			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Italian textile group seeks partner GFT, Italy's biggest privately-owned textiles and clothing group, is looking for a partner to help to inject cash into its troubled operations. Although Turin-based GFT, which is owned by the Rivetti family, admitted it was ready to accept the sale of a significant stake to an outside shareholder, reports of advanced negotiations with Miroglio, a leading privately-owned textiles and clothing group, were without foundation, it said. A takeover of GFT, which had sales of about L1,500bn (Dollars 949m) last year, by the slightly smaller Miroglio would create Italy's third-biggest textiles and clothing concern behind Benetton and Marzotto, with turnover of about L2,700bn. GFT has grown rapidly through acquisitions and supply agreements with some of Italy's best-known designers. However, earnings have come under pressure owing to high domestic costs and heavy interest charges on net debt of about L400bn. In 1991, the group lost L42.6bn, a figure unlikely to have been bettered in 1992. GFT denied reports that it had failed to find a financial institution to take a minority holding, forcing it to give up control to Miroglio, one of Italy's most successful private textile groups. 'The search for a partner is under way, and many alternatives are being considered,' it said.</p>

During his  meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Rawlings  stated that his government still has much to do for Cuba because  somehow they must express their appreciation for all that Cuba  has done for Africa.    Robaina, on the other hand, delivered a message to Rawlings  from Cuban President Fidel Castro, and described the statements  by the Ghanaian leader as a reflection of the historic relations  between the two states. Robaina expressed appreciation for  Ghana's position on such issues as the U.S. blockade of Cuba and  human rights. After stating that 1993 had been the most  difficult year in the history of the Cuban Revolution, Robaina  predicted that 1994 would be the beginning of an ascending  spiral for the Cuban people.    Robaina concluded his official two-day visit to Ghana as  part  of a tour of five African countries. Today, Robaina is in  Luanda, Angola.</p>

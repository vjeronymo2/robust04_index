			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: BHP says it has no plans for acquisition BROKEN HILL Proprietary (BHP), Australia's largest listed company, has said that although it is not planning a large acquisition, it is financially in a position to make investments of any size, Reuter reports from Melbourne. A BHP spokesman said chief executive Mr John Prescott's statement in a newspaper interview that the oil, minerals and steel giant could make an acquisition of any size was made in a response to a question about its strong balance sheet and its expansion plans. 'He wasn't indicating we were about to do anything mammoth,' the spokesman said. 'We have a lot of options open.' Mr Prescott said in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper: 'I think we are very clearly in the situation that we could make any quality investment that we wanted to make - of any scale.' He was also quoted as saying that BHP would issue figures in a few weeks showing it had reduced its gearing in the year to May 31 from the 48.2 per cent level at May 31 1992. Mr Prescott indicated it would 'be a little less than that', the spokesman said.</p>

In overseas areas, statute of limitations relevant to locally procured tenders and contracts will be observed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Servicing transportation offices provide supporting documentation and perform necessary inspections in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Claims files include complete, legible documentation needed to support recovery action, including a copy of the itemized breakdown prepared by the claimant's insurer when appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Third party liability is correctly calculated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3, and is reflected on all copies of the DD Form 1844.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Written demands for reimbursement are prepared against appropriate third parties, and demands are dispatched locally or forwarded for centralized recovery within 30 days of settlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see &sect;536.196). If this 30-day standard is not met or no demand is prepared because liability will not be pursued, claims personnel will explain the basis for this on the claims chronology sheet. Note, however, that files will not be forwarded for centralized recovery prior to the 21st day after settlement in order to afford the claimant an opportunity to request reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Unearned freight letters are prepared when required by DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;27, and are either included in files forwarded for centralized recovery or are dispatched locally after settlement with the carrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Settlement offers from third parties are accepted or rejected within 30 days of receipt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Checks received are kept in a locked container in accordance with AR 37&hyph;103, and are hand-carried to the servicing finance and accounting office within 24 hours of acceptance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Claims files for which a third party fails to satisfy its liability are forwarded to USARCS or to contracting officers for offset as appropriate (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Include demand packets for all claim files forwarded to USARCS due to incidents of bankruptcies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Commander, USARCS, is responsible for the general administration of the Army Carrier Recovery Program and for the Army Centralized Recovery Program. The Commander, USARCS, will ensure that field claims offices comply with paragraph (a) of this section, and will also ensure that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Demands for reimbursement received for centralized recovery are reviewed for correctness and dispatched within 7 days of receipt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Within 30 days of receipt, checks matched to files are accepted and hand-carried to the servicing finance and accounting office (within 24 hours of acceptance) or are rejected and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned to the third party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Checks which cannot be matched to files are recorded and kept in a locked cabinet in accordance with AR 37&hyph;103.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Unearned freight letters are dispatched after settlement with the carrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Offset action, or other collection action as appropriate, is initiated against any carrier or other third party that fails to satisfy its liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Field claims offices are promptly directed to forward files of bankrupt third parties to USARCS to protect the Government's interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Records are maintained of non-temporary storage contractors who default on their contractual obligations, and of incidents that occur in non-temporary storage warehouses, in order to pursue liability as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Chief, U.S. Army Claims Service, Europe, and the Chief, U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service, Korea, will_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Assume the responsibilities outlined in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section on claims forwarded for European or Korean centralized recovery (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;22), except that offset actions requiring action by DFAS will be forwarded to USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Review each POV shipment file forwarded for recovery action against the European inland carrier for potential liability within 45 days of receipt. If negotiations with a POV contractor result in an impasse, USACSEUR will arrange for dispatch of a contracting officer's final decision within 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.185  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Determination of liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A prima facie case against a third party is established when evidence shows delivery of an item in good condition to the third party, return of the items in a damaged condition or non-return, and the amount of damage or loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.186  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Exclusions of liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third party is not always held responsible even though a prima facie case is established. The burden of proof will be on the third party to show that loss or damage was caused by one of the excepted conditions that relieves it of liability. The following exceptions emphasize or add to conditions stated in the various third party rate tenders:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

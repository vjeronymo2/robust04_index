			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Vauxhall car workers offered 5.5% MANUAL WORKERS at Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, have been offered inflation-plus pay rises averaging 5.5 per cent after industrial action including an overtime ban. The offer, which is being recommended by union negotiators, provides for rises of nearly 2 percentage points above the 3.7 per cent inflation rate for the year to last October, the settlement month. It would also guarantee the more than 8,000 workers inflation plus 0.5 per cent in the second year of the two-year deal. The proposed settlement is higher than that recently won by 30,000 manual workers at Ford. They settled for 5 per cent in the first year and inflation plus 0.5 per cent in the second. Like Ford, Vauxhall has resisted pressure for a cut in the working week. Rover and Jaguar last year agreed deals for 37-hour weeks, compared with the 39-hour industry norm. Managers would also secure union approval through the offer for a slower growth in productivity payments. Nonetheless the proposed settlement is considerably above the average in manufacturing industry, put by most pay research organisations at between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. The offer was reached after more than nine months of negotiations, a long period even by the standards of the motor industry, which is renowned for protracted talks. It was delayed in part because of the wrangle over the size of the offer and because workers at Luton, where the company has one of its two car plants and a parts centre, were concerned at proposed changes. These are similar to those agreed two years ago at Ellesmere Port, the company's Cheshire plant. They included single-table bargaining, team working and cashless pay. The changes would trigger pay increases of about 5 per cent on top of the national deal. The average 5.5 per cent rise under the national offer comprises 5 per cent for all manual workers plus Pounds 1.13 a week. Skilled day workers at present earn about Pounds 242 a week including bonuses.</p>

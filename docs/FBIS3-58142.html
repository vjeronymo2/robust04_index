Sources in Dublin expressed fears that recent statements  from  the Prime Minister and Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary,  warning of limited British patience over the Downing Street  declaration, could be counterproductive. "The British could be  more positive," one said.    Sinn Fein and the IRA are seeking clarification only on the  political implications of the Downing Street declaration, and  are not seeking textual changes in the document itself, Dublin  has been advised.    The Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, is concerned that John Major  is not making enough effort to sell the document to Nationalists  and Republicans, relying too much on threats.    This partly underlay Mr Reynolds' remarks this week about  the  importance of "demilitarising" the Northern Ireland situation.    This was a calculated attempt to ease concerns about  Britain's future role voiced by the senior Sinn Fein figure  Martin McGuinness last weekend.    While deploring the violence of the Provisionals, Dublin  believes that if the peace effort is to bear fruit, a degree of  respect must be shown by both governments to Sinn Fein's process  of deliberation, given its entrenched political perspective.    The lack of direct information since the lines of  communication between the Republican movement and London became  public last November has exacerbated the Provisionals' unease  about British intentions.    Dublin has opened the door to a political role for Sinn Fein  in a forum for peace and reconciliation with other Irish parties  after an IRA cease-fire. But Republicans want to know more  about what political process is envisaged by Britain.    The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, is this week writing  to  Mr Major mapping out areas where his party wants clarification.</p>

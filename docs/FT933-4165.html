			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Olympique Marseille ban delayed by court OLYMPIQUE MARSEILLE, the troubled French football club, yesterday won the first round in its legal battle against exclusion from the European Champions' Cup when a Swiss court temporarily suspended the ban, pending a final ruling. Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French businessman and Socialist former minister who chairs the club, vowed to stay on as chairman. The Marseille club, which last season became the first French team to win the European Champions' Cup, is fighting to overturn the decision on Monday by Uefa, the European football authority, to ban it from this season's competition because of a bribery scandal. Club officials have been accused of trying to bribe players of a rival French team to rig a league match last season. The ban threatened to drive Olympique Marseille into bankruptcy because of the loss of the estimated FFr150m (Pounds 17m) the club had expected from its European games. A final court ruling on the Uefa ban is expected within days. The club's position is further complicated by an edict earlier yesterday from Fifa, the world football authority, that it be suspended from the French league unless it abandons its legal battle against the Uefa ban. Fifa threatened to force the French football authority to exclude Olympique Marseille by invoking article 42 of its statutes. Mr Sepp Blatter, general secretary of Fifa, said the ultimate penalty would be to ban all French teams from international games.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Australian unit halts output at two plants Fears of a further big contraction in Australia's car industry surfaced yesterday, when Ford Australia said it would halt all production at the Homebush assembly plant in New South Wales, and cease producing the Capri sports car at its Broadmeadows plant in Melbourne. In Sydney, Mr John Ogden, president of Ford Australia, emphasised that the restructuring did not herald an immediate pull-out by Ford from manufacturing in Australia. Declining tariff protection for the Australian car industry caused Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, to halt local assembly in 1992, with the loss of almost 2,000 jobs. Tariffs, which stood at 57.5 per cent in the mid-1980s, are being reduced and should reach 15 per cent by the year 2000. Ford said that the decision to shut down the Homebush plant, which has been assembling the Laser model since 1981 and employs around 400 people, was due to 'increasing costs of complete knock-down assembly, reducing tariff levels and declining volumes'. One-off costs associated with the restructuring plan marred an otherwise improved profit performance from Ford Australia in 1993. The company said that it made a net loss of ADollars 45.3m (USDollars 32m) on sales of ADollars 2.77bn, compared with a loss of ADollars 38.3m in 1992, when sales reached ADollars 2.46bn. But the 1993 deficit was entirely due to a ADollars 89.3m abnormal item, largely reflecting the restructuring costs. After-tax operating profit was ADollars 44m, up from a loss of ADollars 25.7m last time. Ford also said its market share edged up from 22.9 to 24.4 per cent.</p>

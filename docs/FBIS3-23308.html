Two other people were hurt and more could be buried under  the  ruins of the headquarters of the Mkhedrioni (knights), a former  militia now part of the regular armed forces, where the  strongest blast occurred, the ministry said.    Three smaller explosions occurred at the main tax department  in the city.    Georgia, which in two years has seen a coup and two civil  wars, is currently the theatre of a power struggle between the  Security and Defence Ministries as well as uncontrolled banditry.    The Mkhedrioni, loyal to the president of the Georgian  emergency committee, Djaba Iosseliani, had one of their regional  officers killed at the end of January.    On February 3, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in  Tbilisi, Deputy Defence Minister Nikolai Kekelidze was killed by  a bomb at his home, and Defence Minister Georgi Karkarashvili  was wounded by a second blast while visiting the scene.</p>

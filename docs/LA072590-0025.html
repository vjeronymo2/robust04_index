			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER ADDING EXTRA OFFICER  </P> <P> The Moorpark City Council is gearing for a debate tonight over whether to beef  up surveillance of youth gangs by hiring an extra sheriff's deputy.  </P> <P> About $82,500 has been reserved in Moorpark's nearly $2-million law enforcement  budget. However, council members are divided over how to spend it.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department has maintained that Moorpark has a low crime rate and  no gang problem. However, concerns about an increase in vandalism and burglary  earlier this year prompted a suggestion from two council members that the city  add an officer to the Sheriff's Department special enforcement detail.  </P> <P> The officer's main task would be gang and drug enforcement.  </P> <P> Councilman Paul Lawrason said Tuesday that he is in favor of adding an officer  because citizens are aggravated by the vandals who paint graffiti in the city.  </P> <P> Until vandals began spraying graffiti on their property, residents in newer  housing tracts in the southern hillsides of Moorpark did not believe that crime  was on the increase, he said.  </P> <P> However, Mayor Bernardo Perez said he believes that adding an officer to  concentrate on gangs when there are no known gangs in the city is a poor use of  the money.  </P> <P> Perez has asked for additional funds for youth activities, rather than  stepped-up police enforcement.  </P> <P> "I have no support for the special enforcement detail at this time," Perez  said. "Things would have to change drastically for me to consider supporting  it."  </P> <P> Moorpark Sheriff's Lt. Rich Rodriguez in a report to the council said officials  have three options.  </P> <P> The first option would be to hire a full-time officer for the special  enforcement team based in Thousand Oaks. The officer would bolster Moorpark's  15-officer patrol. The special enforcement team covers most of eastern Ventura  County, and adding an officer to the team would ensure that Moorpark is  assigned a full-time deputy, Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> The two other options would be to hire a community services officer to oversee  crime prevention and neighborhood watch programs, or to hire a youth resources  officer to handle anti-drug programs in the schools.  </P> <P> All three options would cost the same, Rodriguez said.  </P></p>

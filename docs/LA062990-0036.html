			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: SPIRO AGNEW WOULD LOVE SANTA MONICA'S CAFE ATHENS  </P> <P> Cafe Athens is a '90s version of a Greek family restaurant. Instead of cramming  its walls with black-and-white glossies of the owner's favorite Greek  celebrities, Cafe Athens art-directed its Greek pride: Along the top of one  wall you see the names CASSAVETES . . . DUKAKIS . . . STAMOS in bold teal  letters; larger-than life, teal-tinted photos of other famous Greeks and  Greek-Americans (of course, Maria Callas) appear around the room.  </P> <P> (On the menu, there's a picture of Spiro Agnew at a White House press  conference.)  </P> <P> The food -- stuffed grape leaves, spanakopita and lobster linguine! -- is more  professionally done (and less homey) than your average Greek family restaurant.  The prices are higher than what a Greek mama would charge, too.  </P> <P> But some things never change in a Greek restaurant:  </P> <P> Can't find your waiter? That might be him with his fellow waiters in the middle  of the dining room -- singing, dancing, dragging you away from your flaming  cheese appetizer to line dance. And if you're concerned about getting your next  course, don't worry, he can spin, dip and clear your plate in one graceful  motion.  </P> <P>  Cafe Athens, 1000 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica, (213) 395-1000.  </P> <P> LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

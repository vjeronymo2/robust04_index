			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / S Korea to probe chaebol power THE South Korean government said yesterday it will investigate unfair trading practices by the country's large conglomerates, or chaebol. The announcement by Mr Han Lee-hun, the chairman of the Fair Trade Commission, indicated that the new government of President Kim Young-sam will use anti-trust laws as its main weapon to curb the economic power of the chaebol. In a meeting with senior officials from the country's 30 largest chaebol, Mr Han explained that the chaebol had grown too large and diversified to compete effectively abroad and that their dominance of the domestic economy prevented the growth of small and medium businesses. He also criticised the ownership structure of the chaebol, which are usually controlled by one family. The government is likely to impose new inheritance and gift taxes to dilute family ownership. The goal of the government's chaebol policy will be to force the conglomerates to rationalise their operations and concentrate on a few core industries. Some chaebol, such Hyundai and Samsung, now have 40 or 50 different businesses. The government has already imposed restrictions on cross-shareholdings and debt payment guarantees among chaebol subsidiaries to weaken the links between them. Mr Han, a former economic adviser to President Kim, said the government will now investigate internal trade practices among chaebol subsidiaries that he alleges inhibit fair competition. Internal trading within chaebol groups reduces the ability of small businesses to sell products and services to the conglomerates. The FTC estimates that internal trading accounts for 21 per cent of purchases and 16.9 per cent of sales among the chaebol.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Coal dust flies as door shuts: The recent dismissal of Malcolm Edwards Several days ago, Mr Malcolm Edwards, British Coal's top marketing man, arrived in Hobart House, the company's headquarters behind Buckingham Palace, to find his office door locked. He was then told not to come to work any more, or to make any contact with the state coal company's customers. It was a sad end to 36 years in the coal industry for the man who was once a longshot tip for the chairmanship of British Coal. After a series of bitter rows with Mr Neil Clarke, the current chairman, and a lengthy legal wrangle, Mr Edwards had been sacked. The matter, however, did not stop there. This week Mr Edwards's departure was at the centre of a political storm concerning the whole future of Britain's coal industry. An influential cross-party group of MPs, led by Dr Michael Clark, the Conservative chairman of the energy committee, signed a motion expressing horror at his ousting and calling for his reinstatement. As British Coal proceeded on Tuesday to announce the loss of 1,105 jobs at four pits in West Yorkshire, the conspiracy theorists had a field day. The government, they said, had wanted Mr Edwards, an outspoken critic of its plans for the company, out of the way to smooth the path for privatisation, expected soon after the general election. The statement by Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, that Mr Edwards's dismissal was a matter for Mr Clarke, whom he fully supported, did little to quell the speculation. It is not surprising that Mr Edwards's departure arouses strong feelings. As marketing chief for the old Coal Board since 1973, he had been an articulate advocate of coal, in the energy market and in the political marketplace. Had he stayed, Mr Edwards would have been in charge of negotiations with the newly privatised electricity industry on the price and volume of the coal supplies it will take when the generators' current contracts with British Coal expire in March 1993 - and it is on the outcome of these talks that the future shape of the industry depends. Although no official explanation has been given for the falling out, it may well have come to a head in disagreements about how to handle the negotiations with the generators, National Power and PowerGen. Mr Edwards has always taken a robust approach - lashing out at rival fuels, and lately (to the apparent dismay of Mr Clarke and Mr Wakeham) lambasting the electricity generators for their decision to invest in new gas-fired stations in preference to coal. 'I fight because I believe markets are made,' he says. 'You have to persuade the buyer not to get into a jam that doesn't suit you.' The government has insisted that it will not intervene in the electricity contract negotiations, although many doubt this given the highly political nature of decisions about the future of the coal industry and the regulation of energy prices; only this month Mr Wakeham was dragged into a row between British Gas and its regulator. Nor, the government claims, will it seek to influence the generators' decision on what kind of power plant they build, for example to ensure that coal or nuclear retains a share. Mr Edwards has frequently pointed out that in spite of this free market philosophy, the government subsidises the nuclear industry through a levy on electricity consumers  - and that leaving the untested new market to decide which fuel should be used in power stations could put the coal industry out of business long term. 'If these decisions prove to be wrong, some will be quite irreversible and others only reversible at great cost to electricity consumers,' he says. His views find an echo in Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary: 'We think there's no point in formulating a coal industry based on sympathy for mines. But we believe the coal industry is in the interest of the country, we believe in husbanding the resources of the country.' Against that background, it is easy to see how Mr Edwards's outspoken approach could have embarrassed the government in the run-up to the election. He would also have objected loudly to current moves by Mr Clarke - with approval from Mr Wakeham - to negotiate a one-year contract with the electricity generators; he has always argued that British Coal needs long-term contracts for planning. Mr Edwards was not against privatisation per se. 'I think he sincerely wanted the company to be privatised,' says an old electricity industry colleague. 'But he still believed the government could force the generators to buy all their coal from British Coal - he couldn't accept the idea of the company shrinking.' Not so, Mr Edwards says. As a marketing man he realised that market share meant strength. And he has always been a vigorous advocate of cost cutting and commercial rigour. The latest round of cost-cutting was signalled on Tuesday. And with privatisation looming, it seems to be going to the heart of British Coal's empire. As the company is forced to shrink and possibly to join the private sector, there are certain to be fierce political and industrial arguments. Mr Clarke, inexperienced in the cut-throat world of nationalised industry politics, appears to have decided that quiet diplomacy is better than the Edwards megaphone.</p>

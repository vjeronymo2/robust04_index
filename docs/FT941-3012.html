			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Mahathir at last gets Sabah to bow to Kuala Lumpur: Kieran Cooke on the struggle for control of a Borneo state Sabah prides itself on being exotic. The East Malaysia state on the island of Borneo called 'The land beneath the wind' by the early explorers, is home to the Rafflesia, one of the world's largest flowers. Sabah's Mount Kinabalu is south-east Asia's highest mountain - an outcrop said to be home to spirits who have to be appeased by the yearly slaughter of a dozen white chickens. Orang-utans, once adopted as domestic pets, are taught the ways of the jungle at the state's special animal rehabilitation centre. Then, for the really exotic, there is Sabah politics. For years Sabah, the former British north Borneo, was run like a private fiefdom by local politicians who plundered the state's vast timber reserves to accumulate fortunes. One chief minister kept luxury cars in several European capitals and thought nothing of having his favourite violin flown to his holiday home in London in a specially chartered aircraft. Yesterday Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, finally won control of the local assembly in Sabah. Now only one state in the Malaysian federation - the Moslem fundamentalist ruled state of Kelantan - is not part of the National Front. Dr Mahathir has had a tough fight taming Sabah. The locally constituted Sabah Unity Party (PBS) had ruled the state for nine years. Sabah's 1.8m people are a mixture of races and religions: the PBS, while dominated by local Kadazan tribal Christian groups, prided itself on being a multi-racial and multi-religious party, with a following among Moslem, Chinese and other communities. On the eve of Malaysia's last general elections in 1990, Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the leader of the PBS, took his party out of the National Front. Dr Mahathir was enraged, saying Mr Pairin had 'stabbed the National Front in the back'. The prime minister vowed to bring Sabah back under National Front control and rid the state of Mr Pairin. Local elections last month were a bitterly fought affair. The PBS accused Dr Mahathir's government of withholding much needed development funds from the state. Mr Pairin said the National Front was buying votes to the extent that it was 'dropping money out of helicopters'. Dr Mahathir said that Mr Pairin and the PBS had held up Sabah's economic development. Only when the National Front gained control would the state be able to progress like the rest of Malaysia. The PBS achieved a narrow victory, winning 25 seats in Sabah's 48-seat national assembly. Sabah's politicians hop from one party to another like frogs at a fireworks display. In the days after the election Mr Pairin said millions of dollars were being offered to PBS assembly members to defect to the National Front. With PBS's majority in danger Mr Pairin applied to the state's governor to dissolve the assembly and hold new elections. In what was rapidly descending into political farce, Mr Pairin said the governor first agreed, then disagreed, with his request. Meanwhile PBS members were hopping away - some to the National Front, others to form their own political parties. Among them was Mr Jeffrey Kitingan, a younger brother of Mr Pairin. Mr Jeffrey Kitingan, elected to a PBS seat in the recent election, was released from detention late last year after being held for three years on suspicion of wanting to take Sabah out of the Malaysian federation. But now the younger Kitingan is on good terms with Dr Mahathir and says his new party, so far a one-man show, will join the National Front. As a result of the PBS defections and the formation of various splinter parties, the National Front was yesterday able to declare itself the party of power in Sabah. 'It is a sad decision for me but I truly feel this is the most honourable thing to do under the present circumstances,' said Mr Pairin, resigning as chief minister. Politics in peninsular Malaysia is divided on religious and racial lines, with the majority Malay Moslems, the Chinese and the Indians all having their own political parties. Sabah has had a different tradition: critics of Dr Mahathir say that the peninsula's racially divisive politics will now be imported into Sabah and could create tensions. But the National Front is likely to bring plenty of money to the state. Businessmen once fearful of investing in Sabah for fear of upsetting Dr Mahathir are now likely to flood in. There is already talk that a ban on the export of logs imposed by the PBS to preserve the state's dwindling timber reserves will be lifted. Having finally tamed Sabah, the National Front is unlikely to loosen its grip. Perhaps 'The land beneath the wind' will not be quite so exotic any more.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TENNIS MATCH PRIZE TOO RICH, W. GERMANS SAY  </P> <P> West German tennis authorities have refused to sanction a proposed $6-million  season-ending men's tournament, saying the massive prize money being offered is  bad for the game.  </P> <P> In a statement issued today, the West German Tennis Federation's board of  directors and regional committees said they had decided "neither to approve nor  sanction" the so-called Grand Slam Cup, which the International Tennis  Federation wants to stage in that country in December, 1990.  </P> <P> International federation spokesman Ian Barnes said that without approval from  the local German authorities, "it would be very difficult" to stage the event  there.  </P> <P> In a statement, directors of six West German tournaments on the 1990 ATP Tour  calendar said they are joining the national governing body in denouncing the  eight-man Grand Slam Cup.  </P> <P> "The winner's first prize of $2 million endangers the long-term stability and  above all the general image of tennis as a sport," the statement said.  </P></p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Sales of summer holidays rise by 8% TRAVEL AGENTS sold 7.9m summer holidays this year, the highest level since 1988, Lunn Poly, the largest retail travel chain, said yesterday. Last summer's figure was 8 per cent up on the 7.3m holidays sold the previous year. In 1991 travel agents sold 6.4m. Lunn Poly said this year's increase was the result of the poor UK summer and competitive pricing. The average price of a summer 1993 holiday before travel agents' discounts was Pounds 375, the same as last year. It said the increase also appeared to reflect confidence that the recession was ending. The seven airports owned by BAA handled 7.4m passengers last month - 7.9 per cent more than in October last year. The total number of passengers handled for the 12 months to the end of October exceeded 80m for the first time.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo offer likely to raise Dollars 30m more than expected SHARES IN Lasmo, the UK oil exploration and production company, gained 8p to 207p on news that it expects to receive Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.9m) more than expected from the offering of its Canadian and US refining and marketing business. Including other factors, Lasmo could earn about Dollars 175m more from the disposal than previously estimated. Lasmo announced at the beginning of the month that it planned to float the US downstream assets of Ultramar, the oil company it acquired in a Dollars 1.2bn takeover last year. But a revised prospectus lodged with the US Securities and Exchange Commission raises the price of the equity offering to between Dollars 590m and Dollars 680m, an increase of some Dollars 30m over the previous price range. Proceeds from debt offerings remain unchanged at Dollars 400m, and together with inter-company debt of Dollars 80m to be repaid, Lasmo will receive an estimated Dollars 1.07bn to Dollars 1.16bn from the public offering. This would put the estimated total net proceeds to Lasmo from the disposal of the downstream businesses - including the refining and marketing businesses, ships, and financial and property assets - at between Dollars 1.35bn and Dollars 1.44bn, compared with a previous net estimate of Dollars 1.17bn and Dollars 1.27bn. The proposed offering will go before an extraordinary meeting of shareholders for approval on June 10. Lasmo disappointed the stock market in March with a sharp drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 48.8m to Pounds 28.8m, with gearing up to 83 per cent. The company hoped to reduce its Dollars 1.2bn debt burden by selling off Ultramar's downstream assets, but has so far been unsuccessful, and opted instead for a flotation. However, initial pricing details showing a potential book loss again disappointed the City, sending the share price tumbling 21p. Lasmo made a small contribution to reducing its debts last week by selling half its 57 per cent shareholding in Lasmo Canada for a profit of about CDollars 38m (Pounds 17.5m). The 10.1m shares were owned by its wholly-owned Lasmo International and Lasmo Oil Development (Canada) subsidiaries. The deal, arranged by Gordon Capital Corporation, priced the shares at CDollars 8.25, producing an aggregate consideration of CDollars 83.2m before expenses. A share purchase warrant attached to the shares entitles holders to buy Lasmo's remaining shares in Lasmo Canada for CDollars 8.75 at any time up to December 15 1993. If the warrants were exercised in full, that would entail a further profit to Lasmo of about CDollars 42m, and result in the disposal of its entire interest in Lasmo Canada.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Interbank rates ease Interbank rates eased to discount further base rate cuts after the government's partial U-turn on the decision to close 31 coal pits failed to quash market expectations of further monetary easing. Gloomy weekend press reports about the British economy and unease after Friday's one point cut in base rates meant the market moved to discount further rate cuts in the morning, before Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said only ten pits would be closed. Dealers said the vacuum in government economic policy was making it difficult to take decisions. 'All the market knows is that if things do get worse, the government will simply cut rates,' said one senior analyst. 'The market isn't going to trust the government on anything it says, let alone on inflation. 'The government is going for the easy money option,' said Mr John Holmes at Bankers Trust. 'I think the general gloom of the weekend press has made the market more bullish about further interest rate cuts.' The sterling futures market continued to discount base rate cuts by the end of the year. The December contract closed at 92.77 compared with Friday's close of 92.63. 'Short sterling is discounting lower rates again to be ahead of the game. We are looking at 7.5 per cent in January and 7 per cent by March,' said Mr Stephen Scott of Kleinwort Benson. On the cash market the three month interbank rate hovered just above 8 per cent for most of the morning easing slightly after the Bank provided Pounds 1.5bn of liquidity in the early round. It closed at 8 per cent on the offered side. The one year rate for cash eased to 7 15/16 on the offered side from Friday's close of 8 1/8 per cent. The day's shortage was Pounds 2.15bn. The Bank of England removed more than half in the morning, with a Pounds 1.32m repurchase agreement at 7 15/16 per cent. It also operated in bands 1 and 2 at the new rate of 7 7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 200m. German call money held steady at just below 9 per cent as the market awaited signs from the Bundesbank at this week's tender for securities repo funds. Most dealers expected the Bundesbank to continue to offer liquidity at a fixed rate of 8.9 per cent.</p>

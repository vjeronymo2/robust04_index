			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Personal View: Why Russia is not a special case One of the most curious assumptions about developments in Russia is that we from the outside can somehow steer them in the right direction by an appropriate choice of actions. It expresses itself in the belief that the west has more power and influence than do Russians in moulding the Russian destiny. The search for those outside Russia who might be accountable for the debacle has been intense, particularly in the wake of the setbacks to reform caused by the resignations of Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov. Some observers blame the undoubtedly careless comment by the US ambassador at large to the former Soviet Union, Mr Strobe Talbott, last year that there has been too much shock and too little therapy. This was obviously untrue. A striking feature about the past two years of Russian policy is how little shock there has been. The response of one of the foreign advisers responsible for advising the Russian Federation to follow the shock course was even more curious. Harvard economics professor Jeffrey Sachs has repeatedly denounced the international community - the G7, the World Bank, and, in particular, the International Monetary Fund - for failing to cushion the shock of the transition to the market with sufficient support measures. He says international institutions should have taken a bold gamble and supported with very large transfers of resources those few people (Mr Sachs's friends) who promised that they could see how Russia might be changed. According to him, almost every successful stabilisation effort in the past has relied on generous foreign support. Mr Sachs's favourite example of a successful foreign-supported stabilisation is the aftermath of the German hyper-inflation of the early 1920s. It was at the time often called the 'miracle of the Mark'. A reforming new central bank president, Mr Hjalmar Schacht, broke with the old conservatives, and introduced a new and stable currency. A few months after his currency stabilisation, Germany was supported through a major international loan, the Dawes Loan ( of 1924); and foreign central banks gave considerable help with short-term measures to ensure the stability of the new Mark on the foreign exchanges. Meanwhile, the government followed an austerity course that was bitterly unpopular. The only way that it could be sold politically to a sceptical and disenchanted German electorate was as the inevitable price to be paid for foreign assistance, and for the prospect of the inflow of foreign credits. As long as these credits flowed, Germany managed a precarious stability. Once something went wrong, though, ever larger numbers of people believed the foreign contribution to the stabilisation to be the source of their misfortunes. They began to vote in large numbers for the National Socialist party, and the democratic order collapsed. Too much effort had been expended on devising complicated schemes to help Germany and imposing them from the outside, and not enough with building domestic consensus about reform. One of the perpetual dilemmas of an operation mounted as an obvious aid mission is that it leads to suspicions of political manipulation. The realistic way to avoid such suspicions is to de-politicise assistance as far as possible. One of the most important conceptual contributions of the Bretton Woods conference (which created the World Bank and IMF) was the idea of equal and uniform treatment of all members of a new financial order. It was intended to avoid the excessive politicisation of 1920s international rescue operations - all of which failed in the long run. There would be no 'favourites' or 'darlings', but a community of states supporting each other in times of difficulty through a regulated institutional mechanism. Such an approach created a series of incentives for compliance, and for opening to the world economy and for the creation of prosperity, growth and stability, that were not merely political bribes or hand-outs. It also emphasised the need for adequate domestic support, and for avoiding the impression of a course imposed from the outside. If we put our trust too blindly in a few specific individuals, rather than in an institutionally anchored and broadly supported reform exercise, we are almost bound to be disappointed. Perhaps we should remember that Mr Sachs's favourite architect of the German economic stabilisation of the 1920s, Mr Schacht, soon became Hitler's minister of economics and the 'wizard' of National Socialist rearmament.

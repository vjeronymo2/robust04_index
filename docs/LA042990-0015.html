			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:;  </P> <P> *** SALT-N-PEPA. "BLACK'S MAGIC." NEXT PLATEAU.: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF  ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC.)  </P> <P> Few other women in rap have a firmer grip on the in-your-face concept of  machisma than this spicy three-female unit.  </P> <P> They seldom deal in heavyweight social matters but when it comes to voicing a  swaggering sense of selfhood, Salt-N-Pepa delivers. "Negro Wit' An Ego" has  strong comedic energy. "Expression," written/produced by Cheryl (Salt) James  with a power-to-the-individual emphasis, is one of the wittiest rap tracks to  emerge this year.

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> TRUSTEES PRESSED TO REOPEN SCHOOL  </P> <P> Concerned about the growing student population, parents and teachers urged the  Westminster School District's Board of Trustees to reopen one of five schools  closed when enrollment declined.  </P> <P> About 100 people attended the Thursday night hearing.  </P> <P> Most of the speakers objected to an alternative plan to change an existing  junior high to a middle school. They also opposed adding portable classrooms to  existing school sites.  </P> <P> "If the sixth-graders are forced to go to a middle school, I'll work a second  job and my husband will work a second job to pay to send our child to a private  school," said Cynthia Torres, mother of a first-grader.  </P> <P> Teachers Assn. director Richard Snyder also urged the board to reopen a school.  </P> <P> "Those schools were paid for by citizens and that's what they're there for," he  said."It would be foolish for the district to overlook that option."  </P> <P> Snyder said portable classrooms would create crowding in the cafeteria, media  center and computer room.  </P> <P> The district's elementary schools are filled to capacity with an additional 400  students expected next year.

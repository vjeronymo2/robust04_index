			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: Sibling rivalry full of tension - Alastair Macaulay reviews the alternating cast of 'True West' There is surely no acting in London today more interesting to watch than Mark Rylance and Michael Rudko swapping roles in Sam Shepard's True West at the Donmar Warehouse - alternating at each performance. I reviewed Rylance as Austin, Rudko as Lee, at the West Yorkshire Playhouse last month; but afterwards I said to a friend: 'I can't imagine them the other way round.' On opening night at the Donmar Warehouse, when they were playing the opposite roles, my friend said: 'Well, I can't imagine it the other way round.' So authoritative are their performances that at no point was I reminded of how the reverse casting had felt. Each character has changed, and so has the play. Austin and Lee are brothers in southern California. Austin, the younger of the two, is the writer, domestic, civilised. Lee, the elder, is the loner, anarchic, desert-loving. The action takes place in their mother's apartment, where Austin is living (and has been tending her house plants); Lee's fondness for the desert comes from their father. The play covers a brief period when they are in each other's orbits, during which they travel, psychologically, in opposing arcs, each trying to become the other. But the play is also an alarming, even terrifying, struggle for power. Rylance usually appears to be one of our most marvellously Stanislavskian, naturalistic actors; but True West shows Rudko (an American actor) as actually the more utterly natural of the two. In neither role could I spot a moment's artifice or contrivance from him; you are not aware of his acting at all. Rylance's acting is superbly organic, but it is also - relatively speaking - a triumph of technique. It is Rylance who can maximise the emotional highs and lows of a character, who can draw out attention (by the subtlest of means) to the vulnerability or cruelty of either role, and whose pacing is full of danger and surprise. When Rudko plays Austin, he emphasises his weakness; Rylance as Lee is a more pronounced bully; and it is clear that the two are brothers who are engaging once more in an old rivalry. When Rylance was Austin he revealed his Apollonian restraint and quiet forbearance and anguish; and Rudko, as Lee, was the vulpine, Dionysiac, prowler from the wild; and it seemed astonishing, and exciting, that these two polar opposites could be brothers at all. Congratulations to Matthew Warchus, the director, for helping to elicit performances of this calibre. True West is a lean play, acute in the way it touches on the larger politics of sibling rivalry, but not endlessly growing in the mind as one watches it. To my surprise, however, it had just as much tension the second time around, and seemed less, not more schematic. For two actors to alternate like this is daring, and marvellous. At the Donmar Warehouse, WC2.</p>

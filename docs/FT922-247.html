			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / A state of limbo in Lisbon: Real progress on EC integration awaits ratification of the Maastricht treaty Sometimes an event, or the recollection of it, is entirely dominated by its post-script. So, President Mitterrand's personal bid to 'do something' to relieve the siege of Sarajevo threatened to eclipse entirely the EC summit in Lisbon that seemed to 'do nothing' except wring its hands about the rising toll in the Yugoslav civil war. Indeed, it could hardly be more dramatic than for an ageing French president to wend his unarmed way into war-torn Bosnia, after a summit at which British officials were estimating that it would take no fewer than 100,000 troops to open, and keep open, Sarajevo airport to relief supplies. It could also hardly be more erratic than to have the leader of France leave a summit, dedicated above all to saving the EC's Maastricht treaty and its commitment to a common European foreign and security policy, without breathing a word of his mercy mission to his fellow summiteers. It was not the first, nor is it likely to be the last, freelance act of French diplomacy. But the gall of Gaul seemed particularly ironic to other EC diplomats when Mr Mitterrand had just joined other leaders in signing a document calling for 'a strict discipline among member states' in joint implementation of Maastricht's intended common foreign policy. Yet, Lisbon was not a 'do nothing' summit, despite the best efforts of many leaders to make it so. True, perhaps the summit's main achievement was for the leaders of the 12 EC states, including Denmark, to record that Denmark's popular rejection of Maastricht did not sway their 'determination to press ahead with European construction'. That does not sound earth-shaking. But that had not been said, at the highest level of government, since Denmark's referendum on June 2 went against the Maastricht treaty. There is still a sense of illegality, or at least doubtful legality, about Denmark's 11 partners going ahead with ratifying the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union, when the Treaty of Rome clearly says that constitutional revisions must carry the unanimous assent of all EC states. But, in the final resort, EC government leaders can make the rules up as they go along. In going along, 'we should keep all 12 passengers on the train', said Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Mitterrand was not so sure on this count. In the end, 'those countries which do not ratify the treaty will simply have to count themselves out', he said. But, then, the French president was busy during the rest of the weekend showing his rather idiosyncratic view of collective action. Lisbon's second achievement was to signpost how the Community might, as the final communique put it, 'bring the process of European Unity closer to the citizens' through subsidiarity. Making EC decision-making more open and decentralised promises to pay dividends in aiding Maastricht ratification in several countries this autumn and in prompting Danish second thoughts, perhaps next year, about Maastricht. In one of the rare moments on Friday, when he was not either anticipating or celebrating his country's 2-0 victory over Germany in the European soccer final, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark's foreign minister, said he hoped for 'a new political landscape in which new decisions can be taken'. This was as near as he or any Danish government leader came to hinting at a possible second referendum on Maastricht. But the summiteers said they were also convinced that subsidiarity - confining legislation at the Community level to a carefully justified minimum - could contribute to the 'harmonious development of the (European) Union over the coming years'. In a general debate on the issue, several leaders aired pet candidates for the legislative scrap-heap. Mr Kohl said he saw no reason why the EC should have legislated on toy standards, bathing water purity, or safety roll bars for tractors. It was a little ironic that the Chancellor should have so complained. Although he has good reason to placate his Lander - the 16 federal states - which fret about rule from Bonn, let alone Brussels, the fact is that Germans are among the most pernickety Europeans when it comes to technical and environmental norms. But there are plenty of other ironies in the subsidiarity debate. One is that the push for interventionism often comes from member states, not Brussels. Mr Jacques Delors, for whom subsidiarity is clearly going to be the theme of his newly-extended term as Commission president, pointed out that, in passing a recent measure on free circulation of poultry, the Council of Ministers had asked the Commission to set the point in time at which slaughtered chickens should have their feet cut off. The Commission, said Mr Delors, refused to make such a determination. EC leaders eagerly took up two ideas from Mr Delors. One was that the Commission would report to them in 18 months' time on what existing EC laws and rules it reckoned could be scrapped or modified in the light of subsidiarity. Mr Delors also promised to justify future legislative proposals on grounds of subsidiarity, a test that the Council of Ministers would also have to apply in modifying such plans. But making the EC less intrusive in the lives of citizens and companies should not, in Mr Delors' view, lead to any scaling down of the Community's core policy ambitions - or their cost. Indeed, at Lisbon he reverted to his original plan to raise EC spending by a third, from Ecus 66.6bn (Pounds 47.5bn) this year to Ecus 87.5bn in 1997. This was the upshot of a few genuinely acrimonious hours on Saturday, when the richer northern countries pocketed a compromise proposal, hatched by Mr Delors at the Portuguese presidency's request. The compromise would have stretched the rise in the EC's revenue ceiling two years longer (until 1999) but the northern countries flatly refused to commit themselves to double structural aid to southern countries. The north would only agree, in the final communique, to give the south an 'appropriate' amount. So, Mr Delors pulled what he considered a lop-sided bargain off the table. Prime Minister John Major termed this 'progress', even though his UK presidency, which starts in two days' time, will now have to begin the financing negotiations all over again. It does not mean that Britain will not broker a budget deal at December's summit in Edinburgh. Indeed, the supposedly neutral presidential role now imposed on it removes from the budgetary fray one of the toughest protagonists for EC austerity. And, if and when they ratify Maastricht, other richer countries may change their tune. But the key country here is Germany. Mr Kohl complained at Lisbon that southern EC leaders did not seem to realise that there were wider calls these days on Germany's diminished largesse. He cited demands by the third world at Rio's recent Earth summit for environmental help and the needs for Germany to help its eastern neighbours improve the safety of their nuclear power plants. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was unimpressed. Asked if he minded being considered 'the stone in the richer countries' shoe', the Spanish leader replied: 'Not only am I not bothered by that, I consider it a positive compliment.' It seemed a far cry from 1988, when a Kohl-Gonzalez deal settled the EC's budget guidelines for the subsequent five years. Nor is it likely that Mr Kohl will feel much mollified, if as now expected, he wins agreement within the next six months that the European Central Bank should be based in Germany. He feels he almost got that in Lisbon. An elaborate Portuguese plan to share out EC institutions chiefly foundered on Mr Major's refusal to see the ECB go to Germany. According to Portuguese ministers, all other leaders accepted Bonn as the sole seat of the ECB, and its planned precursor, the European Monetary Institute. Again, the constraints of his impending presidency will hamper Mr Major in continuing to seek at least the ECB's foreign exchange arm for London, a quest made all the harder by the UK's Maastricht treaty reservation about joining the final stage of economic and monetary union. Mr Major came to Lisbon, keen that the hallmark of his presidency should be an openness to the outside world, as symbolised by an uncomplicated and early start to enlargement negotiations with European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries. But the first part of this battle was won before he arrived in the Portuguese capital. When the Danes voted Maastricht down, they also killed the Commission idea that the early stages of enlargement would have to go in step with further institutional changes inside the EC, like more majority voting, which would be highly unwelcome to the UK. What remained to fight over in Lisbon was the timing of the start of negotiations. Mr Major pushed hard. He got agreement that he could start preparing the EC's negotiating position before Edinburgh, but that 'official negotiations' could only take place after the Maastricht treaty is ratified and the EC's future financing is settled. The UK had long agreed with its partners that a budget deal must precede enlargement, but had hoped to avoid Maastricht ratification, with its unknowable timetable, also becoming a pre-condition. Thus, the UK leader used up some valuable political capital with his colleagues to get informal preparation of enlargement this autumn. This was a gain, the usefulness of which was questioned even by diplomats from Efta countries hovering around the Lisbon summit. For, in the end, Mr Major, like everyone else at Lisbon, found himself bumping up against the one hard reality facing the Community today. That is that, unless and until the Maastricht pact is put solidly in place, the EC cannot emerge from its current state of limbo. For the UK presidency, this means hard pounding on the budget issue all autumn, whether it likes it or not.</p>

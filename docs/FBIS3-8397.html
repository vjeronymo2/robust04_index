The party was formed last  November through the merger of some breakaway factions of the  Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP).    The FKGP was originally a member of the governing coalition  but later on party Chairman Jozsef Torgyan and some other  deputies went into opposition. Thirty-six Smallholders,  however, turned against Torgyan and remained in the coalition.  Some of them are now leaders of the EKGP.    The EKGP manifesto lays emphasis on economic development,  mainly in the provinces, and covers home policy, foreign policy,  nature protection, education, and health, too.    The United Smallholders seek to develop an efficient  agriculture based on private ownership. To attain this aim,  they wish to join the next cabinet in any case. The EKGP says  Hungary's agriculture should be duly prepared for European  integration, which is an indispensable condition of economic  growth.    The EKGP criticizes the current banking system for its  failure to finance private farms appropriately. The party is of  the view that the whole food industry should be transferred to  the scope of the Ministry of Agriculture.    The United Smallholders say the new Parliament should draft  a  new Constitution to be confirmed by a referendum.    According to the manifesto, the president of the republic  should be elected in a referendum, and the government controlled  more efficiently by a bicameral parliament.</p>

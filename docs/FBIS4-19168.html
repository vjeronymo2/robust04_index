			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive interview" with Iranian Ambassador </F> to Turkey Mohammad Reza Baqeri with Adnan Caglayan at the  Iranian Embassy in Ankara; date not given]    [Text] Ankara--Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Reza Baqeri  stressed that the recent local elections in Turkey expressed the  free will of the Turkish people and could not be criticized by  anybody, referring to the emerging debate over the pro-Islamic  Welfare Party's (RP) electoral victory in the March 27 polls.  "Turks are a brave, civilized and independent people. Who can  say that Turks do not know how to elect the right leaders?"  Baqeri told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS.    "These results should be of concern only to Turks. They,  themselves, can talk about it. Iran is respecting the  expression of the Turkish people's free will. Some comments  concerning the election results can be attributed to the enemies  of Turkey. They are trying to distract the Turkish public. The  Turkish press has to prevent this plot," Baqeri said.    Regarding his visit to the newly elected RP mayor of  Erzurum,  Baqeri said that he traveled to Erzurum on a regular basis in  order to visit the Iranian Consulate in that city. "I went to  Erzurum two years ago and I visited the mayor, the governor,  local press representatives and the university, just as I did  during my last visit. But the Turkish press preferred to focus  on my visit to the mayor. I have no particular interest in  visiting mayors from the RP. For example, I have no plans to  visit the (newly elected RP) mayors in either Istanbul or  Ankara," said Baqeri.    "Turkish authorities and the press are aware of my  activities  here so there should be no question as to the purpose of my  visit to Erzurum," Baqeri noted, stressing that with his  four-year presence in Turkey, he is no newcomer to the country.  "Are there any suspicions raised when other diplomats travel to  Southeast Anatolia? Iran and its ambassador bring nothing but  good intentions to Turkey," Baqeri stated.    Meanwhile, the Iranian ambassador also said that with 60  million Muslims living in Turkey, the RP could not claim to be  the sole representative of Islam in the country. His statement  was made in reference to claims that Iran has taken a special  interest in the success of the pro-Islamic RP. "Can you say  that people from the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) are  not Muslims? I know so many people from True Path Party (DYP)  who pray regularly. There are ministers among them.  Consequently, those who place these issues on the agenda do not  have good intentions," he said.    However, he also mentioned that it would not make sense for  Iran to distance itself from the newly elected RP mayors either.  When the mayor of the Iranian city of Tabriz visited Turkey two  years ago, Baqeri pointed out, he held a meeting with SHP  Chairman Murat Karayalcin. At the time Karayalcin was a mayor  from the SHP. "We established a good dialogue with him. But  now, the new mayor comes from the RP. Should we not establish a  dialogue with him simply because he is from the RP?"  <H5>  Press Reports False </H5>   On another subject, Baqeri disputed press reports claiming  that he had proposed a solution to the Kurdish question,  branding them as false. "The question proposed to me concerned  the situation of minorities in Iran, especially the Kurdish  minority. My response was that they do not present a problem  for us. I also explained Iran's policies concerning its  minority populations. My intention was not to advise Turkey.  Either there was a misunderstanding or the false interpretation  of my statements was done intentionally. My response was in no  way related to Turkey's problems. I have no interest in them,"  Baqeri said.  <H5>  PKK Question </H5>   Meanwhile, Baqeri stressed that his country had cooperated  with Turkey since the very beginning of its problems with the  outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).    "This cooperation is not new. We have been handing over to  Turkey people in Iran who have been acting against them. We  will continue to implement this policy. With the signing of a  security agreement between the two countries, we have just  stressed this cooperation one more time. But our stance has  remained the same since the very beginning of the problem,"  Baqeri pointed out.    He also criticized anti-Iranian reports related to the PKK  issue that have appeared in the Turkish press in the past. "We  confronted the Turkish authorities about these reports and they  told us that these articles are created by the press and that  their own positions do not reflect the views expressed in the  news reports."    Baqeri said that relations between Turkey and Iran were  very good. He also voiced Iran's pleasure on the cooperation  between the two countries on issues concerning security. "I  hope that our relations on security issues will serve as an  example for other neighboring countries," he said. He also  mentioned that the general manager of Turkey's security forces,  Mehmet Agar, would visit Iran soon as an official guest of  Iran's security and disciplinary forces commander, Gen. Reza  Seyfullahi.  <H5>  Common Enemies </H5>   Baqeri also claimed that Turkey and Iran shared many common  enemies, forming even closer bonds between the two countries.  To demonstrate this point, he displayed a map illustrating the  borders of a Kurdish state which extended into Turkish, Iranian,  Iraqi and Syrian territories.    He explained that the map had been published in Europe last  week, and said: "Who are our enemies? Who is supporting the  establishment a Kurdish state? This is a plot of those who are  falsely claiming to be close to us. Is the exaggeration of news  about Iran an attempt to cover up these dangerous intentions?"  Baqeri also noted that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel,  while he served as prime minister, had shown a similar map to  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and had reportedly  said during the meeting, "Look what they want to do." Baqeri  stressed that "it is obvious that some people intend to tear  away parts of Iran and Turkey. We must be awakened," Baqeri  stressed.  <H5>  Israel, Enemy of Muslims </H5>   In a reference to the development of closer relations  between  Turkey and Israel, the Iranian ambassador stressed that Iran  considers Israel to be untrustworthy.    "Turkey makes its own foreign policy. We cannot comment on  this. But, we do not see them (Israel) as an honest society.  There is a verse in the holy Koran: It says that they had  tried to cheat even Allah. They definitely hate Muslims. They  are the enemies of all Muslims. You can see it in their  policies," Baqeri said.  <H5>  Cooperation on Central Asia </H5>   Meanwhile, Baqeri stressed that the two countries were also  cooperating on the issue of Central Asia.    Despite the propaganda emanating from the Western press  which  claims that Turkey and Iran are competing over the newly  independent countries of Central Asia, the results of the  cooperation are beginning to bear fruit, Baqeri said. "Turkmen  natural gas will be transported over Iran to Turkey and to  Europe by pipeline. The Western and Turkish press have written  much propaganda, but the realities (of the cooperation) are  obvious," Baqeri stated.    Turkey and Iran also share common views concerning the  Caucasus, he said. "The two countries are opposed to the  Armenian invasion. Furthermore, we both have requested that  Armenia withdraw its forces from the Azeri territory it has  occupied. Both Iran and Turkey have been providing humanitarian  aid to Azerbaijan. And, both are helping the Caucasian and  Central Asian republics within the framework of the Economic  Cooperation Organization (ECO). There are many examples like  these."    Moreover, he indicated that Iran was prepared to cooperate  with Russia and Turkey in an attempt to resolve the problem of  Nagorno-Karabakh. "We informed Moscow and Ankara about our  readiness to cooperate. We are ready to cooperate with any side  that is willing to take steps to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh  question. Turkey, Russia and Iran are influential countries in  the Caucasus. Therefore, there is a need for intensive dialogue.  We are ready for this."    Baqeri also mentioned that Iran and Turkey have already  conducted consultations at the levels of foreign ministry  general directors, department chiefs and experts. "These kinds  of consultations are necessary. Ministerial level meetings,  alone, are not enough. For example, the Turkish Foreign  Ministry's general director of Caucasia and the Balkans, Omer  Ersun, visited Iran and their Iranian counterparts have visited  Ankara--all over the past few months. After discussing the  issues, we realized that our views were similar."    The Iranian ambassador also expressed his government's  pleasure over Turkey's participation in the Bosnian peacekeeping  force, known as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. "We are happy  about the decision that foresees the presence of Turkish  peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. The placement of the Muslim  Turkish soldiers in Bosnia is a situation that is very pleasing  to Iran."    Meanwhile, Baqeri disclosed that there were 48,723 displaced  Azeris living temporarily in Iran who were receiving aid from  the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS).    According to information provided by the IRCS, seven tent  camps have been established for Azeri refugees in the border  areas of Pars Abad in Imishlinskiy, Bileh Savar, Saberabad and  Saatlinskiy regions since September 1993 and there is an urgent  need for increased international participation and support for  them.  <H5>  Iran Overcomes Economic Troubles </H5>   Baqeri said that Iran, currently involved in a period of  reconstruction, was experiencing no economic problem that could  not be overcome.    We are reconstructing the areas that had been damaged during  the time of the Shah and in the Iran-Iraq war, Baqeri said. He  disputed the reports that claimed Iran was immersed in great  economic difficulties, saying that they were untrue and were  only made to disseminate political propaganda against Iran.    "It is normal to experience economic problems. Just look at  other countries. Although they did not conduct a revolution  against a regime connected to the United States, or fight an  eight-year-long war or resist U.S. attempts at political  domination for 15 years, all of them still are experiencing  economic problems, including Europe and the United States,"  Baqeri noted.    The Iranian ambassador stressed that the current regime in  Iran represents the first implementation of an Islamic  government and is now in a period of experimentation in the  economic field. "We want a state that depends on its own  resources. Our goal is not to depend on foreign resources.  However, foreign pressure does have an impact on the Iranian  economy.    ``The United States does not want the Iranian system to be  successful. To place pressure on the Iranian economy is among  their leading priorities. By reducing the prices for crude oil,  they want to negatively affect the Iranian economy so that they  can say that the Iranian system is unsuccessful,'' Baqeri  claimed.    He said that the United States was "trying to place pressure  on the countries that were having economic relations with Iran.  Yet, they are always calling on Iran to establish economic  relations with them while trying to prevent other countries from  having economic relations with Iran," he said. [quotation mark  as published]    Baqeri also said that Iran was beginning to implement second  five-year developing plans in which the main goal was to develop  the country's very rich natural resources. ``Iran has very rich  resources along with its reserves of crude oil. Iran's natural  gas stocks are the second largest in the world.    ``We also have other resources. We have prepared an economic  plan that is not as dependent on crude oil export revenues. We  are now preparing to pass the plan, but obstacles still remain.  The Iranian nation is prepared to make sacrifices. In the  period of economic trouble, we eat and drink less,'' Baqeri  stated. Meanwhile, Baqeri said that Iran had offered a proposal  to Turkey related to increased cooperation in the area of the  automotive and spare parts manufacturing industry.    "In one or two months, we are expecting a delegation from  the  Turkish Ministry of Industry and Trade to investigate the  opportunities for cooperation. We are hopeful about this issue  because there are many opportunities," Baqeri said.</p>

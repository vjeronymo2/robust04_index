			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: An open door alone is not enough to attract cash - Unctad's World Investment Report AS multinationals integrate their global operations, and account for an increasing share of world trade and investment, they present new challenges for policy makers. Liberalisation may no longer be enough to capture a share of international investment capital, the World Investment Report says. More pro-active measures are needed. While it challenges the value of tax holidays and other fiscal incentives, it calls on governments to 'play an active role in improving their economies as locations for foreign investment'. Noting that 90 per cent of foreign direct investment goes to industrial countries, and that a further 8 per cent goes to just 10 countries in Asia and Latin America, it says the potential 'is considerable' for developing countries to capture increasing investment flows over the decade ahead - as long as appropriate policies are adopted. 'Modern financial services, telecommunications, transport and utilities are essential for developing countries, not only to bolster the efficiency of the wider economy and improve the competitiveness of the export sector, but to insert themselves into the system of integrated international production,' it says. Noting that an efficient private sector 'is unlikely without an efficient public sector', it calls for public institutions to be 'restructured according to modern organisational and management practices'. The complex integrated relationships between parents and affiliates across the world are challenging nationally-based legal control. This raises the question of whether such multinationals should be treated differently from domestic companies as well as making it steadily harder to pinpoint where legal responsibilities lay and where tax should be paid. The reason liberalisation alone is no longer enough is that an increasingly large number of developing countries have opened their economies in similar ways. Governments keen to attract foreign investment 'should go beyond general, broad based efforts and focus on particular functions (eg regional headquarters, research and development, accounting) for which they believe they have certain advantages'. Also countries must: Care less about ownership structure of a multinational based inside their borders, and more about attracting investment in the first place: 'It is more important to host technology than to own it.' Market themselves attractively. Focus on service industries, as these will account for an increasing share of foreign investment flows in the decade ahead. Develop policies to encourage small and medium-sized domestic industries, as such policies can attract investment from the increasingly numerous small and medium-sized transnational corporations. Cut transaction and 'hassle' costs while minimising the risk and uncertainty many foreign investors feel when entering a new market. Ensure assistance is available to foreign investors after approval has been given for an investment. Protect intellectual property, seek help from nationals living overseas, and consider export processing zones, 'some of which have been quite successful'. 'International production is increasingly determined by factors that go beyond cheap labour, and depend on overall national competitiveness.' It challenges strongly the use of fiscal incentives such as tax holidays: 'An incentive competition between governments is very costly, particularly for developing countries, and can generate inefficient investments with disappointing results. If it goes too far, not even the 'winning' country obtains a net benefit.' It nevertheless concedes that incentives have been effective in influencing the direction of investment. It refers to a recent World Bank study in which two-thirds of 74 cases showed the final decision on where to invest was influenced by incentives. The report calls for international co-operation - through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or the UN - to negotiate incentives down: 'International harmonisation of incentives is a difficult thing. But given their limited effectiveness, their tendency to distort investment, trade flows and the danger of an incentives war, a concerted effort in this area would be desirable.' Examining the increasing problems linked with pin-pointing the 'legal personality' of a multinational, it recommends international co-operation in areas such as competition policy, disclosure of corporate information, common accounting principles, and regulations for environmental protection. Co-operation is also urgently required on the issue of taxing multinationals, and answering questions such as where taxable income is earned, how it is distributed across different countries in the production chain, and how taxes should be allocated. The issue has been highlighted in the US, where California is challenging conventional 'arm's length' international tax practices by insisting it can tax multinationals operating there by calculating a sum based on the staff employed in the state, the investment made, and the value of output, as a proportion of the TNC's global activities. The UN report is sympathetic to such a 'unitary tax', but warns of complications because such a tax assumes profit is spread uniformly across all stages of an integrated production system and does not take into account that production costs vary from country to country. It calls again for international co-operation as the only solution to these problems.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE LARGEST 20 NON-FINANCIAL TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS, RANKED BY FOREIGN ASSETS, 1990 (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank  Corporation           Country           Industry  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1    Royal Dutch Shell     UK/Netherlands    Petroleum refining  2    Ford                  United States     Motor vehicles and parts  3    GM                    United States     Motor vehicles and parts  4    Exxon                 United States     Petroleum refining  5    IBM                   United States     Computers  6    British Petroleum     United Kingdom    Petroleum refining  7    Asea Brown Boveri     Switzerland       Industrial and farm                                                 equipment  8    Nestle                Switzerland       Food  9    Philips Electronics   Netherlands       Electronics 10    Mobil                 United States     Petroleum refining 11    Unilever              UK/Netherlands    Food 12    Matsushita Electric   Japan             Electronics 13    Fiat                  Italy             Motor vehicles and parts 14    Siemens               Germany           Electronics 15    Sony                  Japan             Electronics 16    Volkswagen            Germany           Motor vehicles and parts 17    Elf Aquitaine         France            Petroleum refining 18    Mitsubishi            Japan             Trading 19    GE                    United States     Electronics 20    Du Pont               United States     Chemicals  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Foreign    Total   Foreign    Total Rank  Corporation                assets   assets     sales    sales  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1    Royal Dutch Shell            69.2    106.4      47.1    106.5  2    Ford                         55.2    173.7      47.3     97.7  3    GM                           52.6    180.2      37.3    122.0  4    Exxon                        51.6     87.7      90.5    115.8  5    IBM                          45.7     87.6      41.9     69.0  6    British Petroleum            31.6     59.3      43.3     59.3  7    Asea Brown Boveri            26.9     30.2      25.6     26.7  8    Nestle                          -     28.0      35.8     36.5  9    Philips                      23.3     30.6      28.8     30.8 10    Mobil                        22.3     41.7      44.3     57.8 11    Unilever                        -     24.7      16.7     39.6 12    Matsushita Electric             -     62.0      21.0     46.8 13    Fiat                         19.5     66.3      20.7     47.5 14    Siemens                         -     43.1      14.7     39.2 15    Sony                            -     32.6      12.7     20.9 16    Volkswagen                      -     42.0      25.5     42.1 17    Elf Aquitaine                17.0     42.6      11.4     32.4 18    Mitsubishi                   16.7     73.8      45.5    129.3 19    GE                           16.5    153.9       8.3     57.7 20    Du Pont                      16.0     38.9      17.5     37.8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Data unavailable; Unctad estimates Source: UNCTAD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

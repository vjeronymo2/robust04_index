			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / No relish in City for Ratner's humble pie EATING humble pie does not seem to come easily to Mr Gerald Ratner, chairman of Ratners, Britain's biggest retail jewellery group, who yesterday issued a formal apology for describing his products as 'crap' at last week's Institute of Directors' conference. But even as Mr Ratner's uncharacteristically cowed statement was being dispatched across London, the windows of some Ratners' shops were being plastered with posters plying the merits of its 'Cheap Reliable and Affordable Prices' - 'CRAP' for short. The 'CRAP' posters are the latest in the apparently unending stream of promotional ploys with which Mr Ratner has transformed his family's floundering jewellery company into one of the most dynamic forces in US and UK retailing. The leitmotif of his style has been to liven up the dusty world of the traditional jewellers - with their Dickensian decor and prim proprietors - by turning his shops into glitzy places crammed with cheap'n'cheerful products and price slashing promotions. Mr Ratner's comments to the IoD conference a week ago on some of the secrets of his success were similar to remarks he has made before, notably in the FT. But this time his comments attracted widespread attention from the tabloid press and prompted a reprimand from the British Jewellers' Association. An apologetic appearance on the Wogan chat show could not save Mr Ratner from being relegated to the ranks of the 'businessmen the great British public loves to hate'. The chastened chairman sent an apology to his staff on Wednesday. A note of 'clarification' for customers was pinned up in Ratners' stores on Friday. Yesterday's formal apology was intended to 'set the record straight'. It remains to be seen what effect the apology, or the 'CRAP' posters, will have on sales. The stock market has already cast its vote. Ratners' shares rose by 6p to 184p last Tuesday, the day of the IoD conference, but fell by 7p to 180p yesterday. The City does not seem to relish the sight of Mr Ratner eating humble pie. Perhaps he should stick to prawn sandwiches.</p>

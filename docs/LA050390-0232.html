			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL  </P> <P> 200th Store While O! Deli trys to get a toehold in Orange County, El Pollo Loco  is about to open its 200th store. The "store of significance," as the company  calls it, is situated on Yorba Linda Boulevard in Yorba Linda and opens  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The new store is in keeping with a corporate plan laid out five years ago that  called for 200 stores by 1990. "With the opening of the Yorba Linda El Pollo  Loco, we will have achieved a benchmark in our development plan," said James  Verney, president of El Pollo Loco.  </P> <P> The chain, which is owned by Denny's Inc. of Irvine, operates exclusively in  sun-belt states where it can capitalize on its Spanish name, Mexican heritage  and California's health-conscious consumers.  </P> <P> One recent study, however, questioned whether El Pollo Loco's grilled,  marinated chicken is much lower in fat and calories than fried chicken. The  Center for Science in the Public Interest, which conducted the study using data  supplied by fast-food firms, found it was 9.5% lower in calories and 2% lower  in fat than the fried chicken sold at the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain.  </P> <P> El Pollo could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Still, El Pollo Loco remains the nation's fastest-growing chain of chicken  restaurants.  </P></p>

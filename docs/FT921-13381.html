			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Advice to turn a director green - Why companies are setting up panels to assess environmental performance Environmental advisory boards, sometimes called panels or councils, are becoming an increasingly popular way for business to tap into environmental expertise and keep up with trends. Advisory boards are designed to be independent and are composed of company outsiders, such as academics and luminaries. Last year US-based multinational Dow Chemical set up what it calls a Corporate Environmental Advisory Council which will eventually consist of up to 14 members from around the world. It will meet three or four times a year. 'We recognise that the public has a right to know what we are doing and a right to contribute to our decisions-making process,' said Frank Popoff, Dow's president and CEO at the council's launch. Waste Management, another US-based company which operates in 14 countries, is establishing a similar but smaller board of up to seven members. 'It's going to make some folks in the company uneasy, but we have to look at ourselves in the mirror. It would be arrogant to say that we have all the answers. We have to listen to the panel,' says David Stringham, director of government affairs for Waste Management Europe. Shanks &amp; McEwan, the UK based waste-management and incinerator operator, has been advised by an environmental board since 1989. The board is an integral component of the group's environmental policy and acts, together with a formal quality assurance scheme, as a check on the company's environmental performance. 'An environmental policy is just a page of nonsense unless you have a management structure that makes it work,' says Roger Hewitt, Shanks's chief executive. Financial institutions which offer environmentally-screened investments use boards - usually called screening committees - to vet their investment decisions and to lend credibility to the scheme. The TSB, for example, has a committee chaired by David Bellamy, the botanist and TV celebrity. Consumer panels are another variation on advisory boards. These are usually groups of people representing a cross-section of a company's customers. BT, the UK's main telephone company, runs three specialist panels, including one on environmental issues. 'The panel enables us to look outwards - to test our policies against outside views,' says Jan Walsh, manager of BT's corporate customer relations. Companies usually use consultants to help choose board members and then to set up and sometimes run the advisory board's affairs. Shanks's board was established with the help of Pamela Shimell, managing director of London-based Industry and Environment Associates. The cost of setting up the board and then servicing it is composed mainly of the time and effort expended by management. To ensure independence board members are usually paid only a small fee and sometimes just get expenses. To guarantee their independence some experts, like Tim O'Riordan, professor of environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia and a member of Dow's council, refuse any form of payment. Hewitt says the total cost of Shanks's board (including administration and company time) is only about Pounds 100,000 a year, which he considers to be good value. 'We pay each member a pretty poor fee compared with non-executive directors.' However, Stringham of Waste Management says top people should be properly paid for their time. 'Top-notch people do not come cheap and we are talking well into six figures to set up our environmental board.' Shimell says paying board members does not necessarily lead to compromise. 'If you choose people of a high enough calibre then they would not be compromised by being paid. They would prefer to resign.' The effectiveness of boards appears to hinge on two factors. First, the quality and independence of the people who serve on them. And second, the willingness of the company to establish a structure which encourages frank and timely discussion. This is because the company is very much in charge of the board. It not only chooses the members and sometimes pays them, but it also often sets the agenda for meetings and controls the information needed by the board. It usually acts as the board's secretariat too. Unless the company is fully committed to its advisory board and is willing to listen to unpalatable advice, the board's work can be obstructed easily. This could be done by, say, being slow to produce information. Because there is a long gap between board meetings - usually held quarterly - delays in getting timely information can seriously reduce the board's effectiveness. There might be some exceptions, but most companies see their advisory boards neither as watchdogs nor as ombudsmen. The businesses want to be kept abreast of environmental issues so that they can plan for shifts in the market. And some companies, such as Shanks, want the board merely to comment on main board decisions. Although some companies say they use their boards to help formulate strategy, they only mean this in the most abstract sense. Hewitt, for example, sees no role for the advisory board in helping to decide company strategy. When Shanks recently bought Rechem, the high-temperature incinerator operator, the board was only told after the event. 'We cannot make an external body party to price-sensitive information. We cannot discuss general or specific strategy with them because it would turn outsiders into insiders,' says Hewitt. Enhancing public image is another benefit of advisory boards - the company is seen to be taking its environmental performance seriously. But this can also work against the company if disgruntled board members choose to talk to the press and analysts. Resignations, for example, can be viewed as a symptom of problems within the company. This underlines the need for the company to make the public understand the role of the board. When Shanks took over Rechem some observers were surprised that the board was not consulted on the move. 'There has been no difficulty in our relationship with the company, although in the public perception there might have been,' says Lord Cranbrook, who chairs the Shanks advisory board. Companies also have to be seen to be taking their advisory boards seriously. This involves giving the board the necessary resources, say to investigate practices in other countries, rotating members to ensure freshness and responding to advice. Taking advice is particularly important. Besides the usual commercial reasons, such as networking and ensuring that their own interests are promoted, many environmentalists are keen to influence business decisions. O'Riordan says there is a convergence of interest between governments, which are trying to formulate policies to protect the environment, and companies wanting to reduce their environmental impact. 'I see this as a significant development. We have to move into an era where relationships between government and big business is complementary. The secrecy has to go,' he says. Lord Cranbrook is pleased with the achievements of the Shanks's board. 'I genuinely believe that some of the things we have suggested have caused a change of view in the company.' He says the board meetings also have to be fun. The Shanks board, for example, meets every quarter, usually for two days. The members have dinner and are then addressed on a 'waste-related topic'. The board also visits a company site, such as a landfill operation. 'We have had an astonishing rate of attendance,' says Lord Cranbrook, who obviously has the midas touch when it comes to making waste fun.</p>

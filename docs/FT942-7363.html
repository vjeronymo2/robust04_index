It was far from clear whether a plea bargain acceptable to both sides could be reached but Mr Rostenkowski's days as committee chairman seemed to be numbered. Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton conceded yesterday that his departure would be a blow to the passage of healthcare reform by Congress this session, which the powerful chairman is committed to achieve. But she remained confident that an acceptable bill to guarantee universal medical insurance in the US would emerge.

In spite of the negotiations being conducted by his lawyers, he has repeatedly protested his innocence.</p>

This committee includes the following  personalities: Raymond Roy, Bernard Craan, Maurice Lafortune,  Reynold Bonnefil, (Dominique Carvonis), Fritz Brandt, and  Michael Madsen.    Before the resolution was proposed and the crisis committee  formed, the participants in the 25 January meeting at the Villa  Creole Hotel spent a great deal of time discussing the content  and form of another proposal in which the following message  would be sent to the international community: Come with your  president [Aristide], install him, and lay down your rules.    Following this decision, the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and  Industry invited the presidents of employers' associations, the  members of the executive councils of those associations,  businessmen and industrialists in general to a meeting to  execute the decisions contained in the 25 January resolution.    We still do not know whether or not the supermarkets are  concerned by this temporary closing. Several supermarket  officials contacted by Signal FM stated that no decisions have  yet been made.</p>

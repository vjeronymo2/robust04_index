			<p>CSO     [Text] Shah Alam, 29 Mar--UMNO [United Malays National  Organization] leaders at the division and branch level in the  Federal Territory and Selangor have been directed to campaign to  ensure that all UMNO members register to vote.    Tan Sri Muhammad Muhd. Taib, chairman of the UMNO Liaison  Committee for the Federal Territory and Selangor, said yesterday  that a review should be made of UMNO membership lists and voter  lists to ensure that all members become voters in general  elections. He said that UMNO members who are found qualified to  vote but have not registered should be helped to register.    "It is regrettable that there are UMNO members who are  qualified to vote but are not registered as voters," he said  today after attending a meeting for the signing of a cooperative  agreement between the Selangor Foundation and Pembinaan Mitra  Jaya Sdn. [Incorporated] Bhd. [Limited] (PMJ).    Last Friday [25 March], UMNO Vice President Datuk Sri Najib  Tun Razak, who is also chairman of the UMNO Membership  Enlargement Committee, said that 388,466 UMNO members who are  qualified to vote have not yet registered.    Muhammad said the UMNO Liaison Committee for the Federal  Territory and Selangor will discuss the issue, primarily to  determine the exact number of UMNO members over 21 years of age  who have not registered as voters. He said those who are 18 are  qualified to be UMNO members but cannot yet register as voters.</p>

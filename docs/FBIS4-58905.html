			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political  adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that  Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will begin talks in Cairo  next week on the points that are still the subject of  disagreement, namely the stationing of a Palestinian policeman  on the Allenby Bridge, the appointment of a Palestinian director  for the Rafah crossing, the al-Mawasi area on the Khan Yunis  beach, and the size of the Jericho area. This came at a news  conference he held today to explain the details of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement which was signed by President 'Arafat and  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on 4 May.    Dr. Sha'th said that parallel to the talks on the points  that are still the subject of disagreement between the  Palestinian and Israeli sides, talks will also start on  extending the Palestinian authority to the West Bank at an early  date so that the Palestinian police will deploy in the West Bank  towns to prepare for the Palestinian elections. He refused to  set a date for these elections, indicating that, in accordance  with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, they  were supposed to take place on 13 July. However, in view of the  delay in signing the agreement from April to 4 May, holding  these elections in Gaza and the West Bank might be delayed .    Dr. Sha'th explained that President 'Arafat will deliver the  list of the names of the members of the Palestinian authority to  Israel on 11 May.    Dr. Sha'th said that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will  also take place in Washington when the Arab-Israeli talks resume  on the other tracks. The talks, which on the Palestinian side  will be chaired by Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, will focus on the  Palestinian legislative elections and the withdrawal from the  West Bank. He added that talks will be held in Gaza and Jericho  on the return of displaced people who left their homes after  1967. He noted that the exact number of these displaced people  is not known because of population growth over the past 27 years.    Dr. Sha'th said the first group from the Palestinian police  force consisting of 360 policemen and officers left for Rafah  today. He added that 1,500 policemen will cross the Jordan  River to Jericho tomorrow. He said more Palestinian policemen  will continue to arrive in the Gaza Strip and Jericho,  indicating that the PLO will adhere to the timetable mentioned  in the agreement, namely one to three weeks to establish  security control in the autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho.    Dr. Sha'th noted that the Palestinian forces in Yemen today  began moving overland to Najran in Saudi Arabia in view of the  circumstances in Yemen and the closure of airports. He said  Saudi planes will fly them to Cairo. From there they will move  to their assembly point in Rafah. The Palestinian forces in  Libya have also moved overland to Cairo and from there to their  assembly point in Rafah. The Palestinian forces in Algeria will  also move to Egypt and then to the assembly point in Rafah.    Dr. Sha'th said Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf has been appointed  commander in chief of the Palestinian police force. Ziyad  al-Atrash has been appointed representative of the Palestinian  side on the Palestinian-Israeli Coordination Committee.  Al-Atrash arrived in Gaza yesterday. Brig. Gen. Ghazi  al-Jabali has been appointed police commander of the Gaza Strip.    Dr. Sha'th said the interim period will begin on 4 May 1994,  the date of the signing of the agreement. He indicated that a  general amnesty will be issued for all prisoners and detainees  when agreement on the interim period is reached. He added that  no detainee will make a pledge to adhere to the accord. The  pledge will be given to the Palestinian authority and not  Israel; it will be a pledge to adhere to what the authority  adheres to.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th said the agreement signed in Cairo  Wednesday was the best possible agreement under the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in  Washington on 13 September. He noted that the Declaration  postponed discussion of main issues such as Israeli settlements,  Jerusalem, Israeli withdrawal, border protection, and the return  of the refugees.    He said the Palestinian National Authority, as it was agreed  to call it, will be responsible for implementing what has been  agreed upon. This authority, he added, will not have the right  to exercise international powers, and countries cannot, for  example, open embassies in the self-rule areas, but they may  have representation offices in Gaza and Jericho.    Sha'th said the PLO outside will have the right to open  embassies because the Palestine National Council had announced  the establishment of a Palestinian state.    Concerning the structure of the Palestinian National  Authority, Dr. Sha'th explained at the end of his news  conference that a 24-member council will assume legislative and  executive powers. The judicial power, he added, will be  exercised by appointed judges that cannot be dismissed, in  accordance with the familiar norms in this regard.    Sha'th said the Palestinian negotiator managed to regain an  important part of his rights within the framework of the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.    He stressed that the Palestinians will continue the  negotiations until they attain all their rights to  self-determination, the establishment of the Palestinian state,  and repatriation.    He emphasized that the Palestinians will respect all their  obligations and will work for a just and genuine peace.</p>

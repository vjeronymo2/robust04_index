			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: WOODSTOCK PROMOTERS SHOOT THE MOON AND WIN;  </P> <P> BUT 1969'S OTHER GREAT SHOW, MAN'S FIRST LUNAR LANDING, IS LAGGING A BIT ON THE  NOSTALGIA CIRCUIT  </P> <P> Is it just coincidence that more attention has been devoted this summer to the  20th anniversary of Woodstock -- that back-yard-barbecue and rock 'n' roll  party for 400,000 -- than to the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the  moon?  </P> <P> Not at all, and any number of explanations loom.  </P> <P> One is that there were so many eyewitnesses on Max Yasgur's farm back in August  of 1969 that there's no dismissing Woodstock as a hoax, foisted on the world  out of a Hollywood movie set. (The only proof brought back by those guys who  said they went to the moon was a couple of buckets of rocks.)  </P> <P> Another possibility is that Woodstock struck a deeper emotional chord with an  entire generation (especially if you count everyone who saw the movie) than the  sight of a couple of guys on TV hopping around the lunar surface. Jeez, we'd  seen that years before on "Lost in Space."  </P> <P> You might even consider that Woodstock is getting so much better play on TV, in  newspapers and magazines because there's a wider variety of vintage photos  available than for the landing on the moon. What with a half-dozen moon shots  in all, one mission looks pretty much like the next, right?  </P> <P> The real reason, I'd submit, is far more tangible. Woodstock has been doing  stronger box-office on the nostalgia circuit because nobody gave enough thought  to making a buck off Apollo 11.  </P> <P> Think about it. Have you seen Neil Armstrong posters and T-shirts flooding  finer department stores everywhere? Record companies issuing the flight tapes  on triple compact-disc sets (with new liner notes by Carl Sagan)? Movie  companies re-releasing the historic film footage to theaters and pay-per-view  cable networks nationwide (in Lucasfilm THX stereo)? Bumper stickers with a  photo of the moon, the NASA logo and the slogan "We did it OUR way"?  </P> <P> If they had any real smarts, the feds could be selling off most of those stones  Neil and the boys brought back from Tranquility Base as 20-year-old  commemoratives. They could net enough to finance a manned shot to Mars.  </P> <P> Let's face it -- NASA blew it. They had a hot property -- one of the monumental  scientific explorations in history, certainly the biggest to be preserved so  exhaustively on film, magnetic tape and computer memory -- and what did they do  with the bulk of it? Handed it over to public television.  </P> <P> Not the folks connected with Woodstock. To them, the sky's the limit. Heck, the  hordes of individuals and corporations holding any ties whatsoever to those  "three days of peace, love and music" not only made headlines for all the ways  they dreamed up to cash in 20 years later, but generated even more news with  fights over all the alleged copyright infringements.  </P> <P> Warner Bros., which had copyrighted the name of "Woodstock," sued a bunch of  '60s rockers -- including some of those who turned the festival into a  marketable commodity in the first place -- to stop them from using the name in  connection with a commemorative concert they wanted to stage.  </P> <P> Of course, lacking rights to the Woodstock name hasn't prevented capitalizing  -- with a capital CAPITAL -- on the Woodstock memory. This weekend, the "20  Years After Music &amp; Art Festival" at Cal State Dominguez Hills is bringing  together such Woodstock hall-of-famers as Canned Heat (minus Bob (Bear) Hite  and Alan (Blind Owl) Wilson -- deceased), Electric Flag (minus Mike Bloomfield  -- deceased), Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company (minus Janis Joplin --  deceased) and the Band of Gypsies (minus Jimi Hendrix -- deceased).  </P> <P> Curious that the 20 Years After fest didn't or couldn't book 10 Years After. Is  it because leader Alvin Lee is still alive, or because by now they'd be 30  Years After and it'd just be too darn confusing?  </P> <P> Fittingly, the whole enterprise is being sponsored by KLSX-FM, the Los Angeles  radio station that owes its existence to dredging up hourly the Ghosts of Rock  'n' Roll Past. Besides the retro music, there will be an "art and crafts bazaar  featuring tie-dye shirts, hand-tooled leather and beaded goods, candles,  pottery, musical instruments, body painting and much more activity reminiscent  of the '60s." All the quaint accouterments.  </P> <P> There's even a "psychedelic car and hippie van competition." Beginning to feel  like Charlie Brown at Christmas, when he comes upon Snoopy decorating his dog  house to "win, win win -- money, money, money"?  </P> <P> If the real Woodstock had been born of this attitude, it wouldn't have featured  Hendrix, Joplin, the Who and others at the forefront of popular music. It would  have been an ode to the great music, cars and clothes of 1949.  </P> <P> It's too bad Jackie Gleason isn't still around to put this all in the proper  perspective. Wouldn't you just love to see Ralph Kramden getting more and more  fed up with all the genuflecting over the anniversary of Woodstock, turning  from his dinner plate and growling:  </P> <P>  One a these days, Alice -- to da moon!  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAHN FILES SUIT, CITES BRADLEY ETHICS APATHY;  </P> <P> EXONERATED BY INVESTIGATION, MAYOR SAYS  </P> <P> A stubbornly defiant Mayor Tom Bradley on Wednesday declared himself exonerated  by the city attorney's decision not to file criminal charges against him and  called for an end to the "almost daily barrage of speculation and innuendo"  that has embroiled his Administration.  </P> <P> Ignoring strongly critical language in a report by City Atty. James K. Hahn,  Bradley said that he was "gratified that the city attorney cut through the  misconceptions and determined that no legal violation of conflict of interest  took place" with regard to his personal finances.  </P> <P> "When all is said and done, the inquiry confirms what I have said all along: I  did not engage in conflicts of interest," the mayor said. "I did not violate  the public's trust. . . . As far as I'm concerned, this matter is now behind  us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financial Holdings  </P> <P> The extraordinary 40-minute speech -- carried on three network-affiliated  television stations -- and a later question-and-answer session occurred only  six hours after the city attorney announced he had filed a six-count civil  lawsuit alleging that the mayor failed to properly disclose some of his  financial holdings.  </P> <P> Hahn's report, the result of more than five months of investigation into  Bradley, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal  charges against the mayor. But, it added tersely, "no vindication of the mayor  is intended, implied or should in any way be inferred."  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times, Hahn said inconsistencies in Bradley's  interviews with investigators "cast doubt" on his truthfulness.  </P> <P> Bradley's remarks contained several inconsistencies compared to his previous  statements on a variety of substantive matters involved in the investigation,  but the mayor made it clear to reporters that he was in no mood to discuss  them.  </P> <P> Bradley at one point lectured reporters who asked about his involvement with a  controversial African task force: "No, you are not going to get me involved in  any further discussion."  </P> <P> Asked about Hahn's statement that Bradley had not been vindicated, the mayor  accused a reporter of misquoting the city attorney. When another reporter then  quoted directly from the city attorney's statement, Bradley only shrugged and  said he did not want to debate "semantics."  </P> <P> The mayor said of Hahn: "He said he found no evidence that I violated conflict  laws. That is the bottom line to the inquiry. That is good enough for me. I'm  going to put the matter behind me."  </P> <P> Speaking from his mahogany-walled City Hall conference room jammed with  reporters, Bradley sought to reach out to the voters who elected him the city's  first black mayor in 1973 and who have sent him back to office every four years  since, most recently earlier in April for an unprecedented fifth term.  </P> <P> Frequently referring to his 47 years in public service -- as a police officer,  city councilman and mayor -- Bradley grew personal but with understated  emotion.  </P> <P> "My friends, I love this city," he said. "I would never do anything to harm Los  Angeles. . . . I hope after all these years, you know the kind of man I am."  </P> <P> Bradley called the civil action filed by Hahn "far less significant" than the  city attorney's decision not to file criminal charges, even though the lawsuit  could result in fines approaching $200,000.  </P> <P> The mayor characterized the civil suit as a move made necessary by mistakes he  made in an effort to act as his own accountant: "The errors I made were not  deliberate. They show only that I am not an accountant, and that I shouldn't  have tried to be one."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Admission  </P> <P> He also reiterated his public admission of last May, when he told the City  Council -- and by extension the residents of Los Angeles and his political  allies -- that he had erred in creating an appearance of conflict of interest  in accepting outside income.  </P> <P> "Engaging in outside employment fell short of my own high standard and led to  the misperceptions we have all seen," the mayor, 71, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The speech was the latest chapter in a political drama that has enveloped the  city's chief executive since the spring, overshadowing his inauguration in July  and the opening months of what many perceive as his last term.  </P> <P> Every effort was made to give Bradley the advantage Wednesday evening as he  went before reporters and a local television audience. During his speech, the  mayor appeared at a wooden desk backed by a telegenic blue drape and three  flags -- decorations not normally in evidence at a Bradley press conference.  Bradley took care to use a TelePrompTer, a machine that displayed to the mayor  his words at camera height, so that he did not have to glance at his text.  </P> <P> At the close of his address, he moved to the front of the desk and sat perched  before the reporters, responding to questions like a stern schoolteacher before  a collection of students. While taking 40 minutes to deliver his speech, he  allowed only 20 minutes for questions.  </P> <P> With the city attorney's decision not to file criminal charges against Bradley,  the mayor appears to have at least initially survived what he has described as  his worst crisis, although several investigations, including a federal probe of  his stock transactions, remain unfinished. Bradley refused to answer questions  Wednesday about his stock portfolio.  </P> <P> Bradley also defended his refusal to turn over his income tax returns, as the  city attorney had requested.  </P> <P> "You know, you don't lose the privilege of confidentiality of your income tax  forms whether you're President, governor or mayor," he said.  </P> <P> In attempting to close the door on the controversy, the mayor acknowledged the  scars of the last several months.  </P> <P> "There is no question about the fact that there has been some damage to my  reputation for honesty and integrity," Bradley told reporters.  </P> <P> He added facetiously, "I want to know how you folks are going to give that back  to me."  </P> <P> Earlier this spring, Bradley had vowed to not discuss the full ramifications of  the case until the close of the Hahn probe. He said that he would not publicly  defend himself because he did not believe his side would receive a fair hearing  in the news media.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Detailed Account  </P> <P> While the address was Bradley's lengthiest and most detailed account of his  activities, he broke little new ground concerning the moves that led to the  city attorney's investigation. At the heart of the inquiry were questions of  whether Bradley had attempted earlier this year to influence the city  treasurer's office to deposit city funds in Far East National Bank, which last  year paid the mayor an $18,000 annual retainer for consulting services.  </P> <P> Bradley declared that he "never directed or pressured" the city treasurer to  deposit public funds "in any bank."  </P> <P> He said he had not considered his contact with City Treasurer Leonard  Rittenberg on the matter to be a conflict because "in my mind at the time, the  two just didn't have anything to do with one another."  </P> <P> Bradley added: "For 15 years, I had never played any role -- directly or  indirectly -- in the deposit of city funds."  </P> <P> In the Far East episode and other matters under investigation, Bradley  attempted to portray himself as simply being responsive to favors requested by  constituents.  </P> <P> "Requests from constituents are part of the normal business of the mayor's  office, and I do my best to see that my constituents get the information they  request from the city bureaucracy," Bradley said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Bradley Coverage Inside  </P> <P> FAR EAST AFFAIR -- Report finds circumstantial evidence that Mayor Tom Bradley  used his influence to direct $2 million in city deposits to the Far East  National Bank, but not enough proof to bring criminal charges.Page 28  </P> <P> AFRICA TASK FORCE -- City Atty.

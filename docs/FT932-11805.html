			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (11): Prices are hardening month by month - The marketplace, discounts and residual values It is a truth universally acknowledged that discounting of new cars leads to lower residual values when the time comes to sell. Therefore - because it is a fact that in the past couple of years discounting has been rife even at the upper end of the market where manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW had previously always managed to persuade their dealers not to resort to price-cutting in order to move the metal  - residual values of these models must inevitably fall. Or must they? If there is a direct correlation between discounted new car prices and used car prices, then why are residual values of executive cars actually rising? A glance at either of the two trade price guides - Glass's Guide and the CAP Black Book - shows prices of good quality used executive and luxury cars hardening month by month. For example, the April issue of CAP has higher values for the Alfa Romeo 164, Audi 52, BMW 850 and Ford Granada 24v. It reports franchised dealers scouring the country looking for late, low-mileage Jaguars and Daimlers, Rolls-Royce and Bentley prices picking up and the shortage of late Vauxhall Carlton cars pushing prices up in Vauxhall dealerships. 'Residual values of executive cars are a lot better than they were a year ago, mainly because of continued very poor new car sales,' says Mr Leslie Allen, director of Glass's Guide Service. 'There has been a marked improvement in one- and two-year-old vehicle values compared with a year ago  -partly because there have been fewer trade-ins, but also because of the rapid expansion of private number plates which disguise the true age of a car. 'This in particular is having a far bigger effect on values than people imagined', he said, explaining that many people - particularly the self-employed or those running their own companies - were quite happy to save money by buying a late-model used car instead of a brand-new one and then fitting a private plate so neighbours and business associates were unaware that the 'new' car was not quite what it seemed. Furthermore, on top of this sort of demand, the very poor level of new car sales since the peak in 1989 means there are inevitably fewer used cars coming onto the market today, and the result of that shortage is to push up values. Mr Geoff Becque, director of Leasecontracts, one of the contract hire firms buying thousands of cars a year and thus more exposed than most to falling residual values, says that although discounting in the past did have an effect on prices, that is no longer the case. 'The market had to respond to falling residual values which were suffered in the early 1990s. The situation was not improved by certain manufacturers - such as Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus - giving discounts where earlier no such deals were available. 'But most of the depreciation suffered by executive and luxury cars was not caused by the discounting but by the state of the economy, because the majority of the buyers of second-hand BMW 7-Series or Jaguar XJ6 models are small businessmen and they simply stopped buying when times got tough. 'When confidence does return, these people will return to the marketplace and values will go up again, but in the meantime the manufacturers are desperately trying to stop the discounting of the recent past'. Mr Becque quotes examples, such as Pounds 8,000 off a Mercedes-Benz 500SEL and massive deals being done on BMW 7-Series transactions in the recent past, but he says there has already been a change in attitude, both at manufacturer and dealer level. 'The majority of manufacturers and importers have now followed Vauxhall's lead and reduced dealer margins to 10 per cent, so there is less money available with which to deal. The discounts are simply no longer there to give away'. Furthermore, he says, any generalisation about residual values of luxury cars is dangerous because the right cars in good condition and with low mileage 'are making good money and prices are improving'. To help residual values continue to increase, manufacturers and importers are ensuring no great oversupply of new vehicles to dealerships, despite the continuing low level of sales overall. BMW, for example, having found itself in a position of oversupply at the beginning of the year, has simply turned the tap off and reduced production of right-hand-drive cars until August this year. With fewer cars available to the dealers, salesmen are beginning to realise that their bottom lines are going to suffer considerably if heavy discounts are offered to their customers. While corporate customers may still find themselves being able to negotiate a modest 7.5 per cent, there are far fewer of the silly deals seen earlier in the year. The result is already apparent. Mr David MacDougall, general manager of BMW dealers Coombs of Guildford, says: 'In fact, residual values are very strong at the moment because there are so few good used vehicles around. It's the first time I can remember when used values are actually going up in Glass's Guide'. But today, as in the past, the first owner of a luxury executive car still has to suffer quite horrendous losses in value over the first two years of ownership. Typically, values of a two-year-old car in this sector of the market will be between 45 and 60 per cent of the cost new.</p>

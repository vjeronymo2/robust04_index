			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippine Navy has just acquired some new  vessels. Earlier today, President Ramos commissioned VRP [Vessel  of the Republic of the Philippines] Dagupan City, another  logistics support vessel donated by the United States, and four  fast patrol crafts bought from South Korea. The commissioning  coincided with the celebration of the 96th anniversary of the  Navy. The president said that the time has come to replace the  old vessels which date to World War II.    [Begin Ramos recording in English] I am happy that the Navy  also has started to decommission ships that are no longer  economical to operate, thus, improving the Navy's over-all  efficiency. But as admirable as our efforts are to extend the  life of even the old ships of the fleet, we can only go so far.  We cannot escape the fact that we really need to upgrade our  ships through new acquisitions and this I assure you we are  trying our best to accomplish. [end of recording]</p>

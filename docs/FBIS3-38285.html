			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Let us now talk about the 28th congress of the  Communist Party, which has ended in Saint-Ouen with the  appointment this evening of Robert Hue, the mayor of  Montigny-les-Cormeilles, as the new national secretary, and thus  as the successor of Georges Marchais, who had been the leader of  the Communist Party for 22 years. During the debates, the  delegates also voted to end democratic centralism and they  ratified the departure of Charles Fiterman. Antoine Lefevre and  Jean-Etienne Mach report:    [Lefevre] [passage omitted] A former nurse, the 47-year old  is the mayor of Montigny-les-Cormeilles, a suburb of Paris. He  has so far dealt with elected members. From now on, he will  have to lead the entire communist house.    [Begin Hue recording] Comrades, you understand that I will  not make a long speech. I am sure that you also understand that  I am deeply moved. [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Lefevre] From now on, Robert Hue will have to compromise  with the various trends, the multiple clans, which will no doubt  rise up on his path, those faithful to Georges Marchais, the  protesters, the hard-line neo-Stalinists, and last but not  least, the group of members of parliament which could become a  bastion under the leadership of Alain Bocquet.    Outside the party, he will have to tie up the threads of  dialogue with the Socialist Party again in view of the second  round of elections -- which is always tricky for the French  Communist Party -- regional, European, and presidential  elections, and especially municipal elections, the most  important for the communists. One might as well say that Robert  Hue's short and medium-term agenda is full.    [Correspondent Claire Chazal] Robert Hue is live with us  from  Saint-Ouen. Good evening.    [Hue] Good evening, Madame.    [Chazal] You are young, you are the national secretary, no  longer the secretary general. Is a new era opening up for the  Communist Party?    [Hue] Well, this congress is the proof of something new  indeed. Those observers who could attend this congress for four  days noticed something new, something dynamic, a major  discussion, a very strong, fraternal confrontation leading to  something new. We have to give ourselves the means today, with a  Communist Party of a new type, as we said in our manifesto, to  go further in the new dimension we want to give our reform.    [Chazal] But Robert Hue, we saw some reformers -- if I may  call them that -- such as Charles Fiterman, leave the party.    [Hue] Well, they did not.... [pauses] Charles Fiterman did  not leave the party, I.... [pauses] No, Charles Fiterman left  the Central Committee. I have to say that I, for one, am sorry  about that. Only last night, I personally asked Charles  Fiterman to stay. Charles Fiterman has decided to leave the  Central Committee. I believe that his decision must be  respected.    However, there remain in the political bureau comrades who  do  not agree with me and those who make up the majority in the  political bureau on the basis of this congress. Comrades have  agreed to belong to the political bureau. I am thinking of my  friend Philippe Herzog, I am also thinking of Guy Hermier.    I was asked a question earlier. I have not answered it yet,  but I will now. I was asked how my appointment as the national  secretary was decided. I can tell you -- and it is the first  time for a long, long time -- that the political bureau of the  Communist Party, including those comrades who do not share my  opinions, have suggested that I become the national secretary of  the party.    [Lazal] Robert Hue, Antoine Lefevre asked the following  question earlier on. With whom will the Communist Party enter  into alliances now? Will it be with the Socialist Party again,  for instance?    [Hue] Well, we shall first and foremost, as usual, enter  into  alliances with wage earners, citizens, people, as close to  reality as possible. You know, I am a mayor and I am a  grass-roots man, and reality for me is at the grass-roots level,  in action, in struggle. Having said that, we want indeed that  the left, progressive forces, find the way to rally again.  Having said that, it should be a rally which will no longer be  the one which has failed.    One of the great lessons of this congress is to say: It is  necessary to build something again, it is necessary to build an  alternative again in this country. France cannot bear those in  power, with Mr. Balladur who strikes terrible blows at the wage  earners, at the young people. It is necessary that the left  find the way to a rally quickly indeed, but never again do what  has failed. It must learn from this failure.    Besides, you know that I was told at a news conference  earlier on about our participation in the conference on social  reform. Well, we shall attend this conference on social reform,  just as we shall attend all those meetings where we can discuss  together how we can change things, change society, but only if  we judge critically and severely what has led our people to  reject, to reject the policy which was carried out over the past  few years.    [Chazal] Thank you very much, Robert Hue, for agreeing to  being our guest this evening, live from Saint-Ouen.</p>

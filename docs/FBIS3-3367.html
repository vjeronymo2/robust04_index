Ten CPPCC members made speeches at the meeting.    Wang Zhaoguo, Qian Zhengying, Sun Fuling and Henry Ying-tung  Fok presided over the meeting. Also present were Vice-Premier  Zou Jiahua and some ministers.    Shi Ningsun, member of the Central Committee of the China  National Democratic Construction Association, called for curbing  inflation.    "To maintain social stability and ensure a healthy growth of  the national economy, the most important thing to do is to curb  inflation," he said.    Luo Yuanzheng, professor of the Beijing Institute of  Economics, called for a vigorous development of an  export-oriented economy.    Chuang Wing-king from Hong Kong called for the government to  adopt preferential policies for the five provinces and  autonomous regions in northwest China and encourage them to  explore CIS, West Asian and Western European markets through  Xinjiang.    Tsui Sze-man, chairman of the Mirror Post Cultural  Enterprises Corp., Ltd. of Hong Kong, said any attempt to  introduce a premature administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong  people under the pretext of accelerating the democratization of  Hong Kong violates China's sovereignty, goes against the  aspirations of the Chinese people and is doomed to fail, he said.    "Whenever British colonialists leave a country or region,  they are sure to create problems and adopt policies aimed at  dividing the local people. This has been experienced by the  people of Hong Kong," he said.    Wang Wenguang, vice-chairman of the Jiu San Society, called  on the government to increase expenditures on the application  and commercialization of scientific and technological findings,  establish a technology market and enact a relevant law.    CPPCC members Wang Xihua, Wu Jing, Zhu Shuhao and Kang Ling  also made speeches at the meeting.</p>

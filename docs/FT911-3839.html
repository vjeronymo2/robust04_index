			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Mrs Fields warns of loss as Gulf war hits sales Shares in Mrs Fields cookie company yesterday slumped 4 1/2 p to 11p after warnings that it had fallen back into the red in the last financial year. In a brief statement, the USM-quoted company said its preliminary results for the year to the end of December 1990 would be published late next month and the company would show a net loss. It is expected to blame television coverage of the Gulf war for keeping people at home and depressing sales of cookies on the high street. The company had previously been scheduled to announce its results today, and the announcement dashed hopes that it would build on its modest return to profit in 1989. Last September, Mrs Fields reported lower net losses of Dollars 2.63m (Dollars 3.53m) for the first half, fuelling hopes that the full-year result could reach about Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.75m) against 1989's Dollars 1.53m. After it floated on the USM in 1986, Mrs Fields acquired a notoriety for disappointing shareholders, most notably in 1988 when it clocked up a net loss of Dollars 18.9m. Founders Mrs Debbi Fields and her husband stepped back from day-to-day management last year.</p>

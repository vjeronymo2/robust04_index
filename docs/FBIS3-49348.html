According to party president Dr. Janez Drnovsek, they  assessed favorably the work of the party and the government  coalition so far. They have only agreed that they will try to  continue the work of the present coalition, and, in connection  with this, resolve the most vital problems. Our reporter, Manca  Ocvirk, has interviewed party president Dr. Janez Drnovsek about  this:    [Begin recording] [Ocvirk] Can we expect any changes in the  government coalition after today's meeting, Mr. Drnovsek?    [Drnovsek] Not on the basis of this meeting. On the  contrary, my assessment is that this meeting will, in a way,  strengthen the relations within the LDS as well as within the  coalition. I do not expect any such changes in the long term.    [Ocvirk] How long will you wait for the reply of the Social  Democrats?    [Drnovsek] I would not like to set any deadlines, however, I  expect their positive reply regarding the annex to the coalition  agreement in the very near future. Namely, this annex is  supposed to facilitate a more efficient work of the coalition.  Of course, if they will not extend such a consent and  signature, a question about the purpose of this party's work in  the present coalition will arise, as, by this, the party will  express its interest, that is to say, its lack of interest for  something like this. However, I expect that they will sign this  in the shortest possible time. [end recording]</p>

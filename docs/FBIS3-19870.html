Following the  appointment of a special coordinator, the State Department  issued a notice enforcing the use of The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia for Skopje. Foivos Karzis has the  following report:    [Begin Foivos Karsis recording] The State Department notice  actually prohibits its officials from mentioning Skopje using  the name of Macedonia under the pretext of brevity or  simplification. The Greek Government is obviously satisfied with  this development, since it sees this as a continuation of a  positive climate that prevails in Washington, such as the  appointment of Mr. Matthew Nimetz as the State Department's  special envoy. [end recording]    Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou also made a  statement on the importance of the State Department notice to  our correspondent Nina Asimakopoulou.    [Begin recording] [Papandreou] The significance is that our  country's sensitivity toward this problem is recognized in the  most official way by the United States. If one combines this  with President Clinton's latest announcement that he would not  establish diplomatic relations with the FYROM until Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou visits the United States, and with  the announcement that Mr. Nimetz has been appointed U.S. special  envoy, then we can see the U.S. political will to contribute  positively toward the efforts for a just solution to this  problem.    [Asimakopoulou] Do you believe that the Greek Government's  measures have brought about results?    [Papandreou] I believe that they have received the message  that Greece considers this issue a very serious one, as we have  been indicating for months during our contacts and discussions.  This has been achieved not only by the Greek Government, but  citizens of the United States have also played a significant  role. [end recording]    The government spokesman also described the U.S. State  Department decision as positive and noted that similar  developments also took place in Australia, where the government  decided that, until the dispute over the Skopje name is  resolved, the Skopjeans will be officially called  Slavomacedonians.    These moves by Washington also show a clear [word  indistinct]  of the climate that the U.S. Government desires to formulate in  view of the prime minister's upcoming visit to the White House.  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou will leave for the  United States tomorrow to prepare for the prime minister's  visit. [passage omitted]</p>

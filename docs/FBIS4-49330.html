			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] The Beijing-appointed panel overseeing Hong Kong's  transitional matters has ruled out the single-seat, single-vote  system for the 1997 Legislative Council [Legco] direct  elections. The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) political  sub-group prefers either a multi-seat, single-vote system, or  proportional representation.    The Legislative Council has already enacted legislation to  introduce a single-seat, single-vote system for the 1994/95  district board municipal council and Legco polls. A revised  report by the political sub-group will be tabled to the third  plenary meeting of the PWC in July.    PWC member Professor Lau Siu-kai said scrapping the  single-seat, single-vote system would not create great shock in  the community. "The impact on society will be limited," he said.  "Even if we adopt a different voting method, it will only have  a limited effect on the result of the elections."    Professor Lau said China had always voiced opposition to the  single-seat, single-vote method, but the PWC would try to gauge  public opinion on the issue.    Another departure from the 1995 model will be the line-up  for  the nine new functional constituency seats. Hong Kong  co-convenor of the political subgroup, Leung Chun-ying, said  members agreed that the nine new seats should be created with a  franchise similar to the existing functional seats.    Members also agreed to lowering the voting age from 21 to  18,  Mr. Leung said.    Another contentious issue was how to cope with the  legislative vacuum following the disbanding and re-organisation  of the legislature upon the change of sovereignty, according to  Professor Lau. Members felt that it could be resolved either by  forming a provisional lawmaking assembly or delegating the power  to the chief executive, he said.    Ending a two-day session in Hong Kong, mainland members of  the political sub-group will meet political parties in the local  Xinhua (New China News Agency) Wan Chai headquarters today and  tomorrow.    Meanwhile, Senior Executive Councillor Lady Dunn yesterday  stressed that Hong Kong would remain under British rule until  mid- 1997 despite the presence of the PWC in the territory.  Speaking after yesterday's Executive Council meeting, Lady Dunn  said: "It is clearly stated in the Sino-British Joint  Declaration that Britain will rule Hong Kong until June 30 1997.  I firmly believe that both the British and Chinese governments  will uphold the Joint Declaration."    She said the PWC, which China claimed was only an advisory  body, posed no threat to the Government. "The PWC is only an  advisory body but not a power organ. Where they hold their  meetings is no big deal. Given the fact that there are Hong  Kong and mainland members, it is easy to understand why they  want to meet in Hong Kong," she said.</p>

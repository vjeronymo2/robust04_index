			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez] </F>   [Text] A new Shining Path [SL] slogan is starting to appear  on poor neighborhoods' walls: "An imprisoned Maoist is a dead  Maoist."    This is the war cry of subversives who are against the "new  and great definition" imparted from prison by Abimael Guzman  Reinoso: "To struggle for the achievement of a Peace Accord."    This is a clash between the "Leftist Annihilation Line  (LLI)"  headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand, who is supported by the "cadres"  (highly trained militants) who are not in prison, and the  "Right-Wing Opportunist Line" (LOD), headed by Guzman, who is  supported by the majority of SL members in prison.    LOD members were the first to propose an end to the armed  struggle in view of the severe blows sustained by the party  leadership and of the need to end the bloodbath.    Guzman has decided to hold a second SL congress so the "new  and great decision" will be adopted by all combatants to thus  recover party authority and avoid internal party divisions.    Ramirez Durand, however, has not remained idle.    In February, LLI members were able to get the SL Central  Committee to hold a meeting in Ayacucho. They were not only able  to restructure the main party leadership organization with  acting members elected during the first congress in 1988 but  also ousted Guzman and all of his close advisers from the  organization by adopting the following agreements:    A) Neither the war nor the party can be led from prison  because combatants behind bars are inoperative and disconnected  from reality. This is the reason for adopting the slogan: "An  imprisoned Maoist is a dead Maoist."    B) Those who favor a peace agreement are violating basic  Marxist-Leninist-Maoist principles, particularly the "Gonzalo  Thought" principles, and, therefore, isolating themselves and,  by their own initiative, deserting the party.    They also reasserted an agreement already approved during  two  other previous high-ranking meetings (Central Committee "working  sessions" of a "resolutory nature" in December 1992 and August  1993) that obviously were not attended by Guzman: to continue  "the people's war."    Public attention is again centered on those SL members out  of  prison headed by Ramirez Durand, "Comrade Feliciano," because of  recent terrorist actions (car bombs, an "armed stoppage," an  attack on a section of the oil pipeline, and armed propaganda).    Since the disclosure of Guzman's letters to President  Alberto  Fujimori and details on the peace agreement negotiations, the  government has only disclosed details on the movements of  Guzman's faction and its leaders but has concealed the reactions  of Maoists out of prison regarding the conduct of their  "leadership and authority."    It is now known that LLI members, also known by their LOD  enemies as "traitors" and "military goons," did not resign  themselves to accepting Guzman's capitulation. They allege that  the videos are a sham, the letters false, and the agreement a  hoax with the ultimate objective of assassinating "President  Gonzalo" and destroying the armed struggle. With this excuse,  they proceeded to restructure the entire party apparatus. They  have filled vacant posts left by their leaders and dead or  imprisoned "cadres" and resumed the implementation of plans  approved by Guzman at the Third Central Committee Plenum meeting  in August 1992, just a few weeks before his arrest.    That is why the government strategy of strengthening the  leadership of Guzman and the arrested Central Committee members  and presenting them as the real SL representatives (recent  intelligence reports recommend breaking the isolation of Guzman  and his aides, allowing them to visit other inmates or vice  versa to allow them to intensify their propaganda campaign to  promote a split in the SL organization) will have to be  reconsidered given that the organization has begun to be  represented by the LLI.    To begin with, the government must resume the talks, which  have been paralyzed for the past seven months according to LOD  leaflets. Guzman needs new arguments to attract a new  public--the "glorious combat trenches" and the inoperative  militants currently have very little or no influence on the  course of the war--because the same speech for imprisoned SL  members and those who are operational outside has not yielded  results.    Statements like "a golden page was turned with the people's  war; we are now beginning a stage of bloodless war that means  politics without bloodshed; a bloody war is politics with  bloodshed," can affect an SL member burdened by the humiliating  prospect of being able to enjoy sunlight for only 30 minutes a  day for the rest of his life. Such statements do not have the  same effect on a "military commander" who, for example, conducts  a column and has seen his subordinates fall precisely in the  name of the "people's war" that, according to Guzman's new  position, does not mean "giving up or abandoning the revolution  but to continue fighting our new conditions." They also will  have no effect on an Upper Huallaga column that lives from the  "protection money" it charges drug traffickers.    The deadlock of the talks between the government  representatives and the imprisoned SL spokesmen can be explained  by the conditions demanded by the SL, which have annoyed  President Fujimori, who said the only result he expects from the  agreement is "unconditional surrender."    LA REPUBLICA had access to the documents the SL members  circulate inside the prisons, which contain 15 points divided  into four sections as an "introduction" and 11 other points  listed as "basic proposals."    These "guidelines for basic documents," that is, the  Maoists'  expectations of the benefits they expect to obtain after laying  down their weapons, do not correspond at all to an  "unconditional surrender."    By granting the following concessions: "To cease the  people's  war that began on 17 May 1980 in its four wartime expressions of  guerrilla actions (selective annihilation, sabotage, political  agitation, and armed propaganda and guerrilla warfare), to  self-dissolve the People's Guerrilla Army, to destroy their  weapons and combat means, and also to dissolve the Popular and  Grass-Roots Committees that support the RPND [Republica Popular  de Nueva Democracia--New Democracy People's Republic]," Guzman  intends to obtain:    A) the end of antisubversive operations by security forces;    B) the release of all the men and women accused or sentenced  for terrorist actions and the improvement of the prison  conditions as long as the release process lasts;    C) ending all trials for terrorist crimes; the opening of  new  court proceedings; and the nullification of all subpoenas and  arrest warrants submitted against combatants, collaborators, and  sympathizers both in Peru and abroad;    D) ending the government campaign "conducted in the country  and abroad against the people's war, the party, and its members  and sympathizers";    E) reinstating the legal status of SL members, including  those living abroad;    F) returning the SL "museum" seized from Abimael Guzman in  1990, including the video in which he is seen dancing a Greek  dance and the books from his personal library;    G) allowing an "honorable" burial for Augusta La Torre  Carrasco, "Comrade Norah," whose body currently is buried in a  secret tomb;    H) promulgating a general amnesty law "that will reconcile  the nation, without victors or vanquished, without reprisals or  shame";    Pardoning all SL members, releasing them from jail, and  letting them go free is not exactly what the government had in  mind with Guzman's surrender, particularly because he does not  believe this agreement is tantamount to a defeat or a surrender  but "a period between an end of a stage in the International  Proletariat Revolution and the future Great Wave itself. This  justifies the general political withdrawal. We have started to  manage the general military withdrawal as a result of the  general political withdrawal, which is complex and difficult but  necessary to develop other forms of struggle under new  conditions."    Guzman and his followers simply believe that the people's  war  will continue but under different forms of struggle. These new  forms of struggle will establish the conditions for the advent  of that "future Great Wave."    At the other extreme there are Ramirez Durand and his  people,  who reasserted their leadership at the February Central  Committee meeting, during which they achieved several agreements  to guarantee the armed struggle's continuation. Some of them  are: "To struggle to impose Maoism as the new, third, and  superior stage of Marxism; to tenaciously combat imperialism,  revisionism, and international reactionary movements; to  reassert the principle of revolutionary violence as the  universal law achieved during the people's war; to work among  the masses in and for the people's war; to struggle to vindicate  power; to incorporate the masses in the people's war; (and to  organize) the arming of the masses."    The 14 years of armed struggle, therefore, are taking by  surprise an organization whose combatants out of prison have  started the reorganization of their party leadership and  continues to implement a guerrilla campaign interrupted in view  of the arrests that were made and that has isolated their  "prisoners of war" (including Guzman and its Central Committee).  They are considered nonoperational cadres unable to lead the  party and the war. In view of this, the SL radical group has  been able to describe the peace agreement as a desperate  proposal made by combatants who find themselves pressured by the  prospects of life imprisonment or, in the best of cases, who  will be in jail for at least many decades.    Everything indicates that the government will continue to  strengthen Guzman's authority and undermine Ramirez Durand's and  his real power over the combatants out of prison. Under these  circumstances, "Feliciano" will increase the levels of violence  to obtain more attention and recover the war initiative. From  now on, should antiterrorist forces ask whether or not they  support the peace agreement when they arrest SL members? If  they say they support it, should they let them go free? This is  one of the several contradictions of the new course of the war.  Before, a jailed Maoist was a key figure in the armed struggle,  a fortunate member of a "luminous combat trench." Nowadays, to  be jailed is tantamount to being buried alive. A jailed Maoist  is the same as a dead Maoist. The dead have little or no  influence on the war's course.</p>

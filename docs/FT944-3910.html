			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: GEC steams ahead GEC exudes quiet confidence. At the half year, operating profits are up 13 per cent and turnover up 10 per cent - a creditable performance for a company so often accused of losing momentum. The trio of core businesses is in rude health. Telecommunications is positively buoyant, with profits up 22 per cent in the first half. Profits at electronic systems may be flat at present, but future earnings will benefit from a crop of contracts poised to come out of the development phase. Likewise, a head of steam is building up behind GEC Alsthom. All this is encouraging for shareholders, who have suffered underperformance of more than 50 per cent, taking a 10-year view. But it will not be enough to inspire a re-rating. GEC's Pounds 3bn of cash earns a low return and medium-term earnings growth will be pedestrian, if solid. For so rich a company, GEC's dividend payouts are not generous, even if there has been a gentle decline in cover over the years. Dividend growth, for this year and next, is not likely to match that of the market. For that reason it is appropriate that the shares stand on a 20 per cent prospective yield premium to the market. The lacklustre outlook for the shares could change if the company chose to give some some of its cash to investors. Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, sees the Pounds 3bn as a cash hillock - but it looks mountainous in the eyes of covetous shareholders. But Lord Weinstock probably has the cash earmarked in part to promote a merger of GEC's defence operations with those of British Aerospace, a longstanding ambition which he would like to see fulfilled before he retires. Compared with this, the temporarily frustrated VSEL bid looks small beer.</p>

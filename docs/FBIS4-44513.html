			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Liangduo (2621 5328 1122): "Dialectical Unity </F> of Opening Up Policy With Independence and Self Reliance"]    [Text] Independence and self-reliance are basic tenets of  Mao Zedong's thoughts, and they relate to and reinforce China's  policy of opening up to the outside. But in everyday life, this  is not understood in dialectical terms, and incorrect attitudes  toward the issue still prevail. Some people think that a strong  emphasis on independence and self-reliance would amount to  weakening or even rejecting the opening up policy, so in  implementing the policy they often forget or refrain from  talking about independence and self-reliance; this one-sided  thinking has undoubtedly caused harm to our country's opening up  policy and socialist modernization and development.    Independence and self-reliance are totally different from  isolating ourselves and rejecting things foreign. During the  revolutionary period as well as the era of construction, comrade  Mao Zedong made clear that in striving for independence and  self-reliance, we also needed foreign assistance. He always  advocated broadening our horizon and, on the basis of the  principles of independence and self-reliance, proceeding to  develop peaceful and friendly relations and exchanges in  political, economic, cultural and other fields with all  countries, while keeping up a relentless struggle to break up  any attempts by the West to isolate or boycott China. Even  during the "Great Cultural Revolution," he proposed that we  analyze the world from three perspectives, namely to break the  deadlocks in the Sino-U.S. and Sino-Japanese relations and to  regain China's seat in the United Nations. Of course,  constrained by historical conditions, comrade Mao Zedong's  thinking on opening up to the outside did not develop to the  extent as it has today, but he paved the way for the opening up  policy.    The Third Plenum of the 11th CPC National Congress  established the basic line of "one center and two basic points."  Opening up to the outside has become a basic national policy to  be firmly supported over the long term and it represents an  important step toward establishing socialism with special  Chinese characteristics. In over a decade, achievements of this  policy are clearly notable and have contributed greatly toward  China's modernization and development. Implementation has  demonstrated that the policy is entirely correct.    The opening up policy is a prerequisite condition of  independence and self-reliance; they complement and mutually  reinforce each other. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out:  "Independence and self-reliance represent our basic points of  reference, whether in terms of the past, the present or the  future." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume  III, page 3). "In developing a country as large as China, we  cannot help but rely on ourselves, and primarily on ourselves,  and that is the essence of self-reliance" (Ibid., Volume III,  page 78). The opening up policy is necessary and important  because it helps develop socialism, strengthen our country as a  whole and raise the people's standard of living; as a result, it  helps Chinese people maintain their independence and  self-reliance and speed up our socialist modernization and  development. Independence and self-reliance provide  indispensable objective condition and support for the opening up  policy; the policy, in turn, is based on the unshakable  foundation of independence and self-reliance. Any viewpoint or  action which splits these two internally related and unified  concepts is wrong and harmful.    The relationship of these two concepts is unitary and has a  primary and a secondary objectives. The primary objective is to  firmly maintain our independence and self-reliance; the  secondary but complementary objective is to actively seek  foreign assistance. Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC  National Congress, comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed  this [two-fold] objective; he said: "In the end, the objective  of our construction is the same as Mao Zedong had formulated in  the past, namely with its primary focus on self-reliance and its  complementary focus on striving to obtain foreign assistance."  (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping: 1975-1982, page  310) The "primary" and "supporting" elements in the relationship  cannot be equal, and certainly cannot be reversed. For example,  attracting foreign investment is undoubtedly very much needed,  since to a certain degree foreign capital can supplement  inadequate Chinese capital for construction, but we absolutely  cannot depend entirely on foreign investment or put all our hope  on foreign capital; we cannot disregard the consequences of  relying on foreign capital and pay the price which hurts China's  interest, damages our national policy and debases the morality  of our society. Otherwise, it would not be our making use of  foreign capital, but the latter making use of us. In the whole  process of socialist modernization and development, regardless  how far we open up to the outside, the role that foreign  assistance plays will proportionately be relatively limited; it  can only "play a support role in developing production under  socialism" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume  III, page 181); furthermore, any type of foreign assistance must  conform to China's reality and it can only be used effectively  in conjunction with efforts by the Chinese people themselves;  besides, it is certainly not easy to obtain capital and advanced  science and technology from countries of the West. Therefore,  only when we set our objective based on our own strength, then  seek foreign assistance on the basis of self-reliance and mainly  our own conscientious struggle, will we ultimately stand on  victorious ground.    The thrust of opening up to the outside must be to serve the  interests of economic construction. The various aspects of the  opening up policy should be based on the realistic need and  feasibility of China's modernization and development. We need to  attract advanced technology and facilities from abroad, but to  do so only after deliberating carefully and avoiding duplicated  imports wasteful of China's capital; we need to set up  development zones but we must also seek truth from facts and  consider the reality of the zones, China's ability to absorb the  imports, and the various factors involved in calculating the  value of setting up such zones; we must not in a burst of  enthusiasm rush into doing things, nor proceed on the basis of  narrow interests of certain zones without considering how they  relate to or support each other. We need to learn from foreign  countries, but we must do so analytically, critically and  selectively; we must learn the strong points of other countries,  the good things which are truly advanced, and not things which  are backward and passe. Our country is a socialist state, and  our modernization and development is socialist modernization and  development; in our opening up policy, we absolutely cannot  bring in corrupt ideas and lifestyle of the capitalist system.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has clearly pointed out: "In implementing  our policy of opening up, learning foreign technology and  utilizing foreign capital, we must do so in the interest of  socialist construction, and we cannot depart from the socialist  road." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping , Volume III,  page 195) In the entire process of carrying out our opening up  policy, we must firmly protect and maintain China's independence  and sovereignty. For over a hundred years China had endured  aggression and oppression by various Western powers, and  suffered deeply the bitterness of national humiliation and  deprivation of rights. The Chinese people value highly our  national independence and sovereignty gained with the blood and  lives of countless revolutionary martyrs. Today, despite the  great changes in the international scene, big power politics and  hegemonism still remain. Internationally, hostile forces are  still trying hard to overthrow China's system of socialism  through peaceful evolution tactics. We must keep a clear head  and carry out resolute struggle. National independence and  sovereignty are the basic rights of the Chinese people, and on  any issues which interfere with our national independence and  sovereignty, the Chinese people's interests and their honor and  self-respect, we will never compromise on these principles. Just  as the way Comrade Deng Xiaoping put it: "The Chinese people  value the friendship and cooperation with other countries and  peoples, but value even more their own independence and  sovereignty gained through a long period of struggle. No foreign  country should expect China would become their vassal, or to  shallow the bitter fruit harmful to our national interests."  (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume III, page 3)  In looking forward to the opening up policy achieving important  results, we should also be aware that in terms of the  relationship between that policy and our independence and self-  reliance, certain problems still remain. In particular, some  people think that simply by carrying out the opening up policy,  capital, facilities and technology, etc., will flow in from  abroad, and that there will be no need for self-reliance or  struggling to start our own businesses; some people working in  the so-called "opening up" and "introducing foreign things into  China" areas have no qualm about harming the national or  people's interests in the process. Some people, disregarding  reality, conditions or needs, think that starting more and more  "development zones" means greater political accomplishment, or  that attracting more things foreign demonstrates their talent  and ability. Particularly obnoxious are people who, in the  economic exchanges of the opening up process, have developed  various corrupt and evil tendencies. All this goes against the  Party's basic line, and Party discipline and the country's laws  will not stand for it.    At present, China is striving to realize the strategic  objective in the second stage of socialist modernization and  development, and we need to rectify the relationship between the  opening up policy and [our] independence and self-reliance; in  carrying out the opening up policy, we must firmly establish the  spirit of self-reliance and pioneering struggle. And We must  resolutely overcome the negative and corrupt phenomena produced  by opening up to the outside.</p>

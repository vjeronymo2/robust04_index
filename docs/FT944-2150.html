			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BTR - Correction In an article in Thursday's issue, we referred to a leaked announcement and a breach of Stock Exchange regulations on the part of BTR in relation to the disposal of three subsidiaries. It has since been made clear to us that there was no breach of Stock Exchange regulations, nor was the announcement in any way prematurely or incorrectly disclosed. Accordingly there was no issue for the Stock Exchange to consider. We regret the error.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WON'T TOLERATE BIAS NOR ACCEPT QUOTAS -- BUSH  </P> <P> President Bush said Thursday that he will not tolerate bias in hiring but also  will not accept a civil rights bill that imposes quotas on employers.  </P> <P> Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) quickly unveiled  a compromise amendment intended to deal with his objections to the bill.  </P> <P> But the White House and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said it failed to remove  their concerns.  </P> <P> "I want to sign a civil rights bill, but I will not sign a quota bill," Bush  said at a ceremony honoring the recently revived U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights.  </P> <P> The President, who met three times this week with civil rights groups and  lobbyists to search for a compromise on the legislation, said before Kennedy  and Danforth announced their new proposal: "I think we can work it out."  </P> <P> There is no mention of quotas -- the hiring of a certain number or percentage  of minority or other workers -- in the bill. But Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and  other critics have said the earlier version's standard of proof for justifying  exclusionary hiring practices was so tough that employers would use quotas as a  way to avoid lawsuits.  </P> <P> The legislation would undo a series of 1989 Supreme Court decisions that make  it harder for workers to prove they were victims of job discrimination.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the House began action Thursday on a proposal to extend to the  disabled -- including people with AIDS, blindness, cerebral palsy and a number  of other mental and physical impairments -- the civil rights protections given  racial minorities and women.  </P> <P> The Senate passed the bill last September by a 76-8 vote, and the White House  supports it.  </P> <P> But the House approved an amendment Thursday that would allow food service  workers with AIDS to be assigned duties to keep them from handling food. That  may endanger passage since the White House had endorsed the bill's protection  for AIDS patients.  </P></p>

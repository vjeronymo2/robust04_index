			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Christopher's line on Haiti pleases Senate: Military blamed for number of refugees Blaming the upsurge in the number of Haitians fleeing their country on 'the illegitimate military regime's repression', US secretary of state Warren Christopher yesterday insisted that diplomatic and economic pressure would succeed in driving out the military leaders who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide three years ago. 'The longer the tragic situation continues, the harder it will become for those wealthy people who have propped up the dictatorship. In particular, the more protracted the crisis, the more tenuous is the future of the Haitian military,' Mr Christopher told the Senate foreign relations committee yesterday. Over 2,500 Haitians have been picked up by the US Coast Guard in the last four days, fleeing to the US in small and often home-made boats and threatening to swamp the refugee processing system the administration has set up in Jamaica. The Turks and Caicos Islands have agreed to allow the US to set up another processing centre and President Bill Clinton has decided to re-open a refugee camp at the US Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba - a solution adopted by former President George Bush before he decided simply to repatriate all Haitians picked up at sea. Mr Christopher's insistance that the exodus was caused by the military regime's repression was designed to head off criticism that the administration had virtually invited Haitians to flee by conveying the impression that they stood a better chance of winning asylum at the new processing centre in Jamaica than in the three centres already operating in Haiti. The administration has also tried to ratchet up its sanctions on the regime of the military leader, Gen Raoul Cedras. Earlier this week, it revoked almost all visas held by Haitians, to reinforce its existing ban on commercial flights to and from Haiti. Mr Christopher's comments came as part of a wide-ranging discussion of US foreign policy issues before a panel of senators, many of whom were visibly worried at the prospect that the US might tire of waiting for sanctions to work, and turn to military force to restore Mr Aristide. 'All we are hearing is invasion, invasion, invasion,' grumbled Senator Jesse Helms, the extreme right-winger from North Carolina who is the senior Republican on the foreign relations committee. Mr Christopher won applause - rare and welcome in recent months, when the administration's foreign policy team has been under steady attack for inconsistency and indecisiveness - from both Mr Helms and Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the committee. 'I'd like to commend the president and the secretary for the steady hand they have exercised at the tiller of the foreign policy ship of state. . . We have not been goaded into an untimely, unwise use of force, whether in North Korea or Haiti or Bosnia, that would have jeopardised American lives for an uncertain outcome,' Mr Pell said. Mr Christopher said his efforts were focused not just on immediate problems but on 'what I believe to be the most important contribution that I can make to American foreign policy': the creation of long-term relationships and structures to last beyond short-term uncertainties that he likened to those facing President Harry Truman and secretary of state Dean Acheson at the end of the second world war. 'They met the challenge of reconstruction after world war II, and we are meeting the challenge of reconstruction in the post-cold war period now,' Mr Christopher said.</p>

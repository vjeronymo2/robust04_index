			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Singapore presidential race off to a slow start SINGAPORE yesterday formally accepted two nominees for the country's first direct presidential election, but with no rallies or opposition candidates in sight, the race promises little in the way of spectacle, Reuter reports from Singapore. A government commission announced it had accepted the candidacies of Mr Ong Teng Cheong, who resigned as deputy prime minister to run for president, and Mr Chua Kim Yeow, a former senior government official. Mr Tan Soo Phuan and Mr Joshua Jeyaretnam were the only opposition figures seeking to run. Both were declared ineligible under a law which, in effect, rules out all but senior members of Singapore's establishment. 'It is anti-democratic,' shouted Mr Tan after police escorted him from the nomination centre yesterday. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Sunday only about 400 people were eligible as candidates under the law. Political analysts say few Singaporeans doubt that Mr Ong will win the contest with the support of the ruling People's Action party, which has been in power since independence in 1965.</p>

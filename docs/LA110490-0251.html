			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE INSPECTOR: GOOD ADVICE AVAILABLE TO PREPARE FOR 'BIG ONE'  </P> <P> QUESTION: What advice do you have for surviving the "big" earthquake?  </P> <P> ANSWER: There is too much good information available for us to presume to  provide an original answer. Instead, read the following (in about the order of  their complexity):  </P> <P>  -- Telephone book advice on shutting off gas, etc.  </P> <P>  -- "Beat the Quake" brochure prepared by the state, available from regional  Earthquake Preparedness Offices at (619) 238-3321; (818) 795-9055; (415)  893-0818; (916) 427-6659.  </P> <P>  -- Sunset magazine article "Getting Ready for a Big Quake," March, 1982.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inspectors Do Mind Business of Buyer  </P> <P> Q: Why don't home inspectors stick to code enforcement and stay out of such  areas as roof wear and safety enhancements? I think you all overstep your  bounds by making a big deal out of things that are none of a buyer's business.  </P> <P> A: Your concept of a home inspector's job is simply wrong; in any case far from  how most people construe it. Your concept of what is a home buyer's business is  archaic, dating from the days of caveat emptor.  </P> <P> Today because of a combination of high prices and court decisions, buyers  expect the homes they buy to be safe and maintained. "Code" allows for any  number of pre-existing conditions which a prudent buyer will want to be aware  of. Code does not apply to the wear and deterioration that may result in  imminent expenses. Items such as these are the buyer's business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hollow-Core Doors Often Not Maintained  </P> <P> Q: Would you comment on the hollow-core doors that builders have been using for  exterior applications? It seems to me that they are pure junk, and should not  be allowed?  </P> <P> A: The doors you refer to are approved for use outdoors; the problem is mostly  with installation and maintenance. Painters tend to be lax about thoroughly  painting such doors thoroughly (especially the top and bottom edges), and  homeowners tend not to maintain the paint seal.  </P> <P> When there are unsealed edges or other places that allow water penetration, the  door skins delaminate, damaging the doors. This is presumably the basis of your  complaint. I think of such doors as expendables, cheaply replaced if they are  not maintained.  </P> <P> Although I usually find them damaged, the cost of replacement is nominal, and  the risk of other damage if not replaced is virtually nil.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wood Stove Near Wall Could Be a Time Bomb  </P> <P> Q: I'm afraid that my free-standing wood stove may be too close to the frame  wall. Since it looks fine and it has been there for years, I'm of a mind to  conclude that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." Any comments?  </P> <P> A: You could have a time bomb in this stove, and must not dismiss the risk.  Wood that is subject to high temperatures gradually becomes less resistant to  fire.  </P> <P> Consider the analogy of the tires on your car: You wouldn't wait until you have  a blowout to replace them. A potential fire hazard (or any other safety risk  around a house) is comparable. You should make sure it is installed right.  </P> <P> There may be an identification label on the stove that lists the set-back  requirement. If so, make sure the stove meets the label distances. If not, it  would be best to consult a stove specialist or your local building department  for specific requirements.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Tell When Circuit Overloaded?  </P> <P> Q: How do I translate amp or watt ratings on appliances into something more  meaningful?  </P> <P> A: The amp or watt rating allows you to judge whether you may be overloading a  circuit with just simple arithmetic.  </P> <P> Household outlet circuits are rated at 15 or 20 amps. Unless you know  otherwise, use 15 to be on the safe side. Then you can simply add up the amp  ratings of everything you are using on a circuit to see if you're under the  safe limit.  </P> <P> For instance, you could safely use three appliances each rated at 5 amps. But  don't forget to include all the outlets on the circuit -- such as the  refrigerator outlet on a kitchen circuit.  </P> <P> Tracing all the outlets can be laborious, but must be done if you're pushing  the limit. To convert appliances or fixtures that are rated in watts to amps,  simply divide the watt rating by 120 (power (watts) = amps x volts; thus amps =  watts divided by volts).  </P> <P> For instance, a 1,000-watt appliance draws 1,000/120 = 8.33 amps. You could not  safely use two 1,000 watt appliances on one 15 amp circuit. Typically, the  highest amp/watt usage is appliances which heat such as heaters, toasters,  coffee pots.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Ventilation May Cause Roof Harm  </P> <P> Q: My roof has asphalt shingles that are only a few years old. Many of the  shingles are curled. What caused this, and should I be concerned?  </P> <P> A: Curled shingles often indicate poor attic ventilation. The attic air becomes  very hot unless ventilated, and this heat can damage roofing materials. Adding  attic vents is usually fairly simple, such as through the gables or through the  roof.  </P> <P> You can check for attic vents by looking into the attic for visible light.  There should be vents at two different places to allow fresh air to flow  through the attic. If in doubt, consult a roofing contractor to have vents  added.  </P> <P> Ross is the public relations chairman for the California Real Estate Inspection  Assn. (CREIA/ASHI), a statewide trade association of home inspectors.

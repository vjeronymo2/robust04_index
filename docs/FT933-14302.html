			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Bankrupt petitions up 33% last year THE NUMBER of bankruptcy petitions issued in the High Court and county courts in England and Wales increased by 33 per cent to 46,333 last year. The rise followed a jump of 56 per cent between 1990 and 1991. But judicial statistics published by the Lord Chancellor's department yesterday showed that the level of mortgage-repossessions fell by 24 per cent to 142,191 last year after peaking in 1991 at 186,649. Warrants issued to recover land fell by 7 per cent to 124,211. The statistics also showed that in the criminal division of the Court of Appeal there were 669 appeals against conviction, of which 285 were allowed. Of the 1,488 appeals against sentence, 900 were allowed and 49 allowed in part. The attorney general made 24 referrals where it was thought a sentence was unduly lenient. In 20 cases the sentence was increased. The average waiting time for defendants remanded in custody and committed for trial at Crown Court rose from 10 weeks in 1991 to 11.1 weeks. But the statistics show some success in shifting the burden of work from the upper courts. The number of cases committed to the Crown Court for trial fell from 104,754 to 100,994, a fall of 3.6 per cent. The Lord Chancellor's department attributes this fall to the greater use of cautioning by the police and to magistrates dealing with a greater proportion of cases. Reforms made in July 1991 to move work from the High Court to the county courts led to a 27 per cent fall in the number of actions issued by the Queen's Bench Division. The number of cases dealt with by arbitration during the year rose by 30 per cent to 80,332, after the limit for automatic reference to arbitration was increased from Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LEERY TRADERS CASH IN; DOW SLIPS TO 13.35 LOSS  </P> <P> Stock prices posted a moderate loss today, extending Tuesday's pullback from  record highs.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 10.19 on Tuesday, dropped 13.35  points today to 2,911.65.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 626 up, 868 down and 509 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 164.02 million shares, against 199.72 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index fell .78 to 199.15.  </P> <P> Analysts said traders were cashing in some of the gains from the market's  recent run-up.  </P> <P> Market participants also seemed leery of chasing after stocks as a few  misgivings spread about the chances for any further sharp drop in interest  rates.  </P> <P> A Wall Street Journal article published this morning argued that the Federal  Reserve didn't appear in any hurry to tighten credit on the basis of recent  signs that economic growth had slowed.  </P> <P> The story said Fed officials still are inclined to pursue policies aimed at  curbing inflation, rather than easing credit.  </P> <P> Bond prices drifted in a narrow range today as traders awaited more evidence on  the direction of the economy.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged at midday as its yield held  at 8.45%, the same as late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said trading was very light in the absence of new government reports  that could indicate trends in the economy.  </P> <P> A report last Friday that showed slower-than-expected growth in May employment  figures triggered a furious rally that pushed yields on 30-year Treasury bonds  to a four-month low.  </P> <P> Bond prices have changed little since Friday, however, and analysts say there  are no potentially market-moving reports scheduled from the government this  week.  </P> <P> Next week, the government plans to report on retail sales, trade and consumer  prices, and analysts say those reports could provide a clearer picture on the  state of the economy and chances that the Fed will encourage lower interest  rates.  </P> <P> "It's really incredibly quiet here," said Nancy Vanden Houten, a money market  economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.  </P> <P> She said an economic report "would have to be something that really changes the  market's view of things before it will move a lot."  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  were off 1/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/16 point and long-term  issues were unchanged to up 1/16 point, according to the Telerate financial  information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer,  lost 0.15 to 1,159.69.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.97% as the discount rose 3 basis  points to 7.72%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.05% as the discount rose 4  basis points to 7.64%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.09%.  </P></p>

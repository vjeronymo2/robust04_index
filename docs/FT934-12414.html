			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / ADB approves loan to Vietnam The Asian Development Bank yesterday approved a Dollars 76.5m (Pounds 50.6m) soft loan for Vietnam, the ADB's first credit to the country since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, writes Victor Mallet from Bangkok. The ADB's announcement from its headquarters in Manila was the latest move by a multilateral institution to resume aid to Vietnam. The US decided in July to stop opposing international assistance for Hanoi, allowing the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the ADB to finance the country's economic reform programme and help repair its run-down infrastructure. The ADB's first loan, which is interest-free and repayable over 40 years with a 10-year grace period, is to finance irrigation projects. The bank has granted a further Dollars 1.8m for technical assistance to help develop water resources.</p>

Han, responding to lawmakers' questions at the National  Assembly's Committee on Foreign Affairs and National  Unification, said the exchange of special envoys is a clear  precondition for the third round of Pyongyang-Washington  high-level talks.    According to an agreement between North Korea and the United  States reached last Saturday, the two nations are scheduled to  hold the third round of high-level talks late this month.    Han said, "Pyongyang and Washington can discuss the  possibility of improving their bilateral relations at the third  round of high-level talks, but now is not the time to discuss  setting up diplomatic relations. It is not an issue that can be  realized in the near future, either."    He also commented on the alleged construction of a North  Korean-Iranian plant to jointly produce North Korea's Nodong-1  missile.    "The government conveyed its concern to the Iranian  Government through direct and indirect channels. Cooperation  between North Korea and Iran has not been realized yet. It has  not been decided on yet."    Han denied remarks made by Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister  of the Economic Planning Board Chong Chae-sok, who said on  Monday that the government will announce an important plan on  inter-Korean economic cooperation soon.    "There is no plan for the government to make any important  announcement related to inter-Korean economic cooperation," he  said.    Meanwhile Paek Nak-hwan, director-general of the Foreign  Ministry's European Affairs Bureau, said revision of government  guidelines on handling asylum seekers is under study to deal  with North Korean loggers who have escaped from logging yards in  Siberia to come to South Korea.    "The government is also studying various international laws  and will revise domestic laws if necessary. The Russian  Government admitted that there are problems including  infringement of human rights in North Korea's logging yards (in  Siberia), and is studying ways to revise the forestry agreement  it concluded with North Korea to insert a provision on  protection of human rights," Paek said.</p>

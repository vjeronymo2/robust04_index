			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Down, but not out for the count: David Owen and Kevin Brown assess Michael Heseltine's ability to recover from defeat Is he all washed up? After two years of well-publicised setbacks the government's vacillation and ultimate retreat over the privatisation of the Post Office appears to have dealt another blow to Mr Michael Heseltine's political prospects. Coming in the wake of the coal fiasco, the doubts about his health and being upstaged at last month's Tory conference by Mr Michael Portillo, the right's young pretender, the latest climbdown has fuelled speculation that the trade and industry secretary's glittering career may be entering its final phase. The fact that Mr Heseltine left nobody in any doubt that he favoured the sale of a majority of the corporation's shares has made the outcome of yesterday's marathon cabinet meeting look like a peculiarly personal setback for him. He has lost out to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who was every bit as vigorous as Mr Heseltine in promoting privatisation but refused to countenance the fall-back option of giving the Post Office greater commercial freedom in the public sector. Mr Clarke argued successfully that real commercial freedom would require a relaxation of Treasury controls over Post Office borrowing, which would fatally damage its ability to determine the size of the public sector borrowing requirement. One of the Tory rebels, whose opposition finally killed the sell-off, said after a 45-minute meeting with Mr Heseltine on Wednesday: 'He was not his normal ebullient self.' Another, more sympathetic, back-bencher said: 'He'd probably like to hang some of these rebels up by their fingernails.' Others sought to portray his last-ditch attempt to rescue the sale, with a complicated plan for partial privatisation, as a tactical error which backfired. According to one back-bencher the compromise plan - to sell 40 per cent of the Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division, retain 40 per cent in the public sector, and transfer another 20 per cent to an independent trust  -convinced some MPs that Mr Heseltine was trying to privatise the organisation by the back door. Some of the rebels saw it as a signal of Mr Heseltine's weak position as a proponent of privatisation in a cabinet that was not prepared to stand firm. But beneath his suave exterior the trade and industry secretary is as tough a political street-fighter as any of his cabinet colleagues. And as a veteran of Baroness Thatcher's cabinet he has more experience than the vast majority of today's ministers. The past two years have brought victories as well as defeats - notably his bravura performance in March at Lord Justice Scott's arms-for-Iraq inquiry. He is also widely credited with instilling a more pro-active and business-like culture in his department. His heart attack in Venice in June 1993 does not appear to have diminished his ambition for the highest office. Nor, it seems, has the second and fatal heart attack suffered by John Smith, the former Labour leader. It was at first widely assumed that one consequence of Mr Smith's death was that Mr Heseltine would no longer be seen as a credible candidate to succeed Mr John Major. It is an assumption that Mr Heseltine has never accepted, and which he has successfully pushed from the minds of many of his potential supporters on the Tory backbenches. If any minister has the sheer political savvy to turn the events of recent weeks to his advantage it is the trade and industry secretary. From his lengthy spell in the wilderness in the late 1980s to his defeat at the hands of Mr John Major in the 1990 Tory leadership contest, Mr Heseltine has been written off so many times that it would be rash to underestimate his capacity to bounce back. The sheer energy with which he tried to win over the Post Office rebels  - even after it was clear that they were in no mood to fold their tents - demonstrates that his taste for battle is as strong as ever. Perhaps fortuitously, he will have an early opportunity to return to the limelight in the next parliamentary session, which will centre on his bill to deregulate the domestic gas market. It is an opportunity he is unlikely to pass up.</p>

At the same time, he alerted his  troops and ordered them to mobilize toward the different  security areas bordering Colombian territory.    The GN's decision is due to the recent increase of border  problems, and according to the GN high command, there is no  quick solution in sight. Apparently, Colombian authorities are  not willing to cooperate in finding solutions to the problem. On  the contrary, they have accused the GN of raiding their  territory, thereby violating, according to their story, their  territorial integrity. What occurred three days ago is the best  example. On Friday, at approximately 1200, a GN commission was  implementing an intensified border patrol program in the  southwest region when their aircraft, a Bell Ranger 212  helicopter with registration No. GN-8008, was downed by a group  of Colombian rebels. Nevertheless, the Colombian authorities  accused the GN of violating their airspace.    According to the Venezuelan aircraft pilots' story, GN  Commander Manuel Bompart Pinango and GN Major Jesus Lozano  Guanipa, accompanied by six soldiers -- one of whom was wounded,  2d Corporal Yasmin Jaimes Canas -- were patrolling the security  strip. Suddenly, Colombian guerrillas moving about in Venezuelan  territory attacked the unit. The missiles hit the tail rotor  forcing the aircraft to crash to the ground, thereby destroying  the equipment. Fortunately, no human lives were lost. The  rebels' attack took place exactly 500 meters from Hato El  Tormento and approximately 10 km from the border checkpoint El  Cututi on the banks of the Arauca River.    Given this case as well as others on other occasions, the GN  high commanders believe the border problem with Colombia is  becoming more and more intolerable. To begin with, the region is  not secure. There is no way to prompt Colombian authorities to  plan and carry out actions with Venezuela to guarantee  territorial integrity on this side of the border. Therefore,  guerrillas, kidnappers, and drug traffickers are having a heyday  in this region, specifically in the Paez District, the Apure  State, and in the autonomous municipalities of Catatumbo and  Colon in Zulia State.    Meanwhile, according to authorities, the GN has been the  target of a campaign to discredit them in recent months. This  campaign has been stepped up recently not only by rebels who  operate in the security areas, but also by Colombian  authorities, who do not hesitate to accuse GN members of  attacking Colombia's territorial integrity.    Given this serious situation in which a satisfactory  solution  has not been reached with the Colombia authorities, the GN high  commanders, with prior authorization from their superiors,  issued a general alert order to all commands in border security  areas. Simultaneously, as a support operation, troops have been  deployed in the region bordering Colombia.    Division General Pedro Jose Romero Farias, GN general  commander, confirmed that all the commanders on the border have,  in effect, been issued a "general alert" order. In addition,  military personnel have been deployed to the region to control  attacks by Colombian rebels.    Romero Farias said: "We will combat these irregular actions  without any hesitation. We will also defend, however, the GN's  honor, considering the GN has been the target of a campaign to  discredit it by bandits who now feel cornered as a result of the  operations carried out by the GN."    Meanwhile, it was learned at Fort Tiuna that Army commands  have stepped up their action in the Joint Task Force mission.  These are contingents that jointly execute military operations  to guarantee Venezuela's territorial integrity. Within this  framework, their task is to combat and wipe out the presence of  Colombian rebels and combat other crimes, among which are drug  trafficking, contraband, and common crimes that constantly  disrupt the peace and prevent normal socioeconomic development  in the region.    The Army's idea with the so-called Joint Task Force is to  create an atmosphere of security for the people in the area and  to combat guerrilla activity -- that is, to minimize the  Colombian guerrillas' presence as well as their activities,  reduce the number of kidnappings, increase the Armed Forces'  prestige in the region, and preserve sovereignty and territorial  integrity.    Given these incidents on the border, Army Div. Gen. Alberto  Emerich Esqueda Torres, permanent secretary of the National  Security and Defense Council, announced yesterday the new border  security arrangements will definitely be made known this week.  It is very possible, he added, that President Ramon J. Velasquez  will disclose the decree's details. It is also possible the  president will speak to the governors and cattle ranchers of  those regions in the province that borders other nations. After  these talks, President Velasquez will make the final decision on  whether or not to issue a decree regarding border security areas.    Precisely because of the course of events on the nation's  borders, a group of experts from the Institute of Higher Studies  on National Defense, directed by Vice Admiral Mario Ivan Carratu  Molina, traveled to the western region -- specifically to the  Falcon, Zulia, Tachira, and Apure States. Pompeyo Marquez and  Leandro Area from the Negotiating Commission on Border Matters  with Colombia; Jose Rodriguez Iturbe, president of Congress'  Foreign Policy Commission; and other personalities are also  participating in this mission.    According to Carratu Molina, the mission's goal in these  areas is to verify important political, economic, social, and  military aspects within the security and defense framework.  Carratu Molina said: "At each of the sites to be visited, we  will meet with the state governors, garrison commanders, and  military unit and development corporation commanders of each  region.    In Zulia State particularly, Army Brigade Gen. Romer Cumare  Roa, commander of the Army's 1st Infantry Division, and his  staff will discuss the military situation on the state's border  area with the mission. This situation is very critical because  of constant attacks by Colombian criminals.    The Army's 2d Infantry Division brigadier general and GN  Brig. Gen. German Valera Araque, chief of the GN's 1st Regional  Command in Tachira State, were the ones who reported what was  happening in the region.    The mission arrived at Guasdualito (Apure) and La Fria  (Tachira) yesterday, where they toured the border posts and  visited the corresponding military units.</p>

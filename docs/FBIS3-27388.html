Some provincial leaders, including Ma Guoliang, Wang  Xianmin,  and Sun Kuiwen, were present at the forum. Leaders of the  cities of Shangzhi, Suihua, Zhaodong, Shuangcheng, Nehe, Fujin,  Acheng, and Hailin; Mulin and Hulan Counties; and  provincial-level departments concerned introduced the  experiences in becoming rich ahead of others and the situation  of supporting the rich counties to seek wealth. Sun Weiben,  secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech at  the forum. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee, also made a speech.    Sun Weiben pointed out in his speech that the nine counties  and cities should lose no opportunities to quicken the pace of  industrialization and regard it as a strategic priority of  development.    The strategy of being the first to become rich was set forth  by the provincial party committee and the provincial government  at the beginning of 1993 with a view to promoting the  development of the county-level economy. Over the past, these  nine cities and counties have firmly implemented the strategic  arrangements of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government, worked in line with their different  actual conditions, fruitfully carried out their work, and  rapidly promoted the economic development. Their overall  economic development level is higher than the national average.  These nine cities' and counties' GNP in 1993 rose by 20.7  percent over 1992 and was 15.8 percent higher than the  provincial growth rate. Hulan County, which had not been put on  the list of nine rich counties, also made sustained and fast  increases in the rural economy and industrial production. So,  this county was listed as one of the rich counties at this forum.    Comrade Sun Weiben pointed out: Viewing the provincial  situation, we know that industry is a weak link in the  development of the county-level economy. When compared with the  national average level, these nine rich cities and counties  still have such problems as industry accounts for a small  proportion, the development speed is slow, and the economic  results are poor. If they do not rapidly make up the deficiency  in industry, it will be difficult for them to take the lead in  becoming rich and the pace of stepping toward the target of  becoming fairly well-off will slow down. Therefore, in line  with the thinking of the socialist market economy, the rich  counties should accelerate the pace of industrializing the  county-level economy and concentrate their energy on vigorously  developing town and township enterprises. In regard to the  selection of projects, we should persistently link the projects  with less investment, fast efficiency, and short construction  periods with key large-scale and export-oriented projects with  high starting points. In regard to the construction of  projects, we should carry out the legal person responsibility  system. Simultaneously, we should attend to the reform and  reconstruction of the existing enterprises. Persistently in  line with the principle of appropriate concentration, we should  pay equal attention to the construction of key projects, small  industrial zones, and small towns.    He said: To ensure the sound development of the county-level  economy, we should take the path of making trade, science,  agriculture, and industry a coordinate process. In regard to  the organizational leadership, we should eliminate the division  of administrative work, break the barriers between different  regions and between different departments, and exercise  organizational leadership according to the principle of systems  engineering. In regard to the distribution of benefits, we  should organize and set up a community of benefits in line with  the principle of equally sharing benefits and risks. Key  enterprises should concentrate efforts on reforming the property  right system, conducting the technological transformation,  improving management, and offering serialized service.    Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, urged that the rich counties should thoroughly  understand the situation, firmly attend to work, unswervingly  implement the strategies of becoming rich ahead of others, take  the readjustment of the economic structure as a priority to map  out a new pattern for county-level economic development, deepen  the reform of the county- level economy, quicken the pace of  entering the market economy, increase the dynamics of  introducing businessmen and capital, support the fast  development of the county-level economy, and accurately handle  the relationship between reform and development and stability,  and concentrate energy to make development.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DUO VOICE MESSAGE WITH HUMOR, CANDOR;  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE: SINGERS ROMANOVSKY &amp; PHILLIPS, WHO PLAYED TO A CHEERING IRVINE  CROWD, SAY THEIR GAY PRIDE THEME GOES FURTHER IN CONSERVATIVE AREAS.  </P> <P> Paul Phillips waltzed on stage at UC Irvine on Sunday night wearing a skintight  miniskirt, garters that gripped thigh-high white hose, one rhinestone earring  and three strands of pearls -- typical garb for a member of Romanovsky &amp;  Phillips, an openly gay duo who sing of closet homosexuals, AIDS and sodomy.  </P> <P> With gusto, the couple chanted: "Give me a guy who's glad to be gay!"  </P> <P> With sober sincerity they harmonized: "Stand by the living and remain unified."  </P> <P> With political zeal, they intoned: "It's not right to legislate how we make  love."  </P> <P> Pretty daring stuff for Orange County -- particularly for Irvine, where voters  last month repealed an ordinance outlawing discrimination against homosexuals.  </P> <P> Romanovsky &amp; Phillips, whose candid, often humorous, sometimes poignant  songs about homosexual life have placed them at the forefront of gay-oriented  music, are acutely aware of the county's fierce anti-gay sentiments. They  appeared at Santa Ana's recent Gay Pride Festival, and afterward "we were  sitting in our car at a stoplight," Ron Romanovsky said after Sunday's show.  "And someone walked by and said: 'There's a car full of disease-carrying  perverts.' We sing about that kind of thing all the time, but to come so  face-to-face with it . . . it was really scary."  </P> <P> "It scares me that that attitude of hatred is so tolerated here," guitarist  Phillips said. "There are places in this world where people think those types  of things, but would never say them."  </P> <P> But the singer/songwriters, at the end of a 40-state tour, say that their  message of gay pride and unity goes further in such conservative pockets as  Orange County or Amarillo, Tex., where they played last week.  </P> <P> "The (gay) people living and staying here to improve things are very  courageous," said Romanovsky, who plays guitar and piano. "We want to give them  a shot in the arm."  </P> <P> They seemed to succeed Sunday: The crowd of about 200 laughed raucously at the  duo's trademark on-stage antics (Phillips described his miniskirt and pearls  outfit as "Barbara Bush meets Cher") and stood and cheered as the concert  closed.  </P> <P> The show was a benefit for the UC Irvine Gay and Lesbian Student Union and the  Orange County Visibility League, another gay activist group. "We're glad to be  here to help OCVL," Romanovsky told the audience. "It's been crazy with Measure  N and all," he said, referring to the recent Irvine vote.  </P> <P> Romanovsky, 30, who writes most of the duo's music and lyrics, and Phillips,  35, began singing together shortly after they met and became romantically  involved in San Francisco in 1981. At UC Irvine, they performed several songs  from three albums recorded on their own label -- Fresh Fruit Records -- as well  as newer material that bespeaks their breakup 17 months ago.  </P> <P> "I'm no good for you, or maybe nobody's good enough for me," went one song  about the pain of lost love. Another caustic tune, written during an earlier  separation, found a scorned lover advising his former boyfriend to take a nice  long trip -- a guilt trip, "all expenses paid."  </P> <P> The duo, who are about to leave for Australia for their first engagement out of  North America, don't just write songs about gay issues; songs about politics,  for instance, also figure into the mix. But in any case, they feel their music  has universal appeal.  </P> <P> Sure enough, Bill Savage of Fullerton, who attended with his wife, Catherine,  said he enjoyed Sunday's show and would see Romanovsky &amp; Phillips again. "I  just thought it was really neat the way they got their message across," he  said. "It showed individuality."  </P></p>

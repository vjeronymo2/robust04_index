			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Feb 03, BNS -- A KGB agent works at the  Lithuanian Ministry of Defense, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper  said Thursday [3 February].    The newspaper said the agent, known as Gnat, currently holds  a high-ranking post in the ministry. He is reportedly a former  activist of the Sajudis popular front and was awarded for  defending the parliament and other state institutions during the  Soviet military aggression in 1991.    LIETUVOS RYTAS implied that the pseudonym Gnat is used for  Ignas Stankovicius, director of the ministry's International and  Internal Relations Division.    There has been no immediate reaction from the leadership of  national defense. The ministry's press service said  Stankovicius is currently on vacation due to health problems.    Stankovicius, formerly an employee of the Physicotechnical  Institute and regional environmental protection inspector, made  a career leap to the rank of colonel in structures of national  defense.    In the summer of 1990, Stankovicius was appointed as the  assistant director of the then Department of Defense, but his  further career was interrupted by then Prime Minister Gediminas  Vagnorius, who dismissed Stankovicius for "neglect of duties,  disregarding property and the basic needs of soldiers and  officers."    But LIETUVOS RYTAS noted that soon before Stankovicius left  the post, the leadership of national defense and the  parliament's National Security Committee were informed by an  anonymous "former KGB colonel" that KGB agent Gnat works in the  system of defense.    Stankovicius returned to the Ministry of Defense in January  1992. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in early 1993.</p>

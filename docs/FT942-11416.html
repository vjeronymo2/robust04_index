			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (5): The three regions go it alone - Flemish hopes for independence worry those who believe regional promotion will result in duplication / Belgium, A devolved trade strategy Five minutes walk from the King of Belgium's palace in the centre of Brussels stands a modern building whose most arresting quality is its name: the Flemish Foreign Trade Board. Entering this state within a state, the visitor is presented with a stack of glossy literature, pens, key-rings, and other paraphernalia whose purpose is to promote Flanders as a separate international business centre within Belgium. The FFTB is a symbol of Flemish political aspirations toward full political independence, but it also claims a practical role as defender and promoter of Flemish exports. These account for nearly 70 per cent of the Flemish gross national product, with a similar percentage going to Belgium's overall foreign trade. The question is whether this regionalisation of trade strategy within Belgium is a model for the rest of Europe, or whether it is merely a special case dictated by Belgium's complex domestic politics where linguistic and cultural tensions are contained in a loose federal framework. Similarly, how is the present system in Belgium working now that the three regions - Brussels, Flanders, and Wallonia - all have their separate trade and export promotion responsibilities? Can it maintain or improve Belgium's position as the ninth largest exporting nation in the world, or does it risk jeopardising that position through duplication? The drive toward greater devolution of political and economic power in Belgium started in 1970, and it has been gathering pace ever since, largely because of pressures from within Flanders. Between 1988-91, all three regions accumulated power steadily over external commercial relations; but the most important shift took place as a result of the Saint Michael accords in mid-1993. These agreements between the national and regional authorities strengthened the responsibilities of the regions at the expense of the Belgian Office of Foreign Trade. The regions gained access to more money, through regionalisation of the external commercial fund with the exception of subsidies for Belgian chambers of commerce overseas; but the crucial step came with the transfer of the Belgian government's overseas network of about 120 commercial attaches to the regions. On January 1, 1994, the FFTB, set up three years before, picked up 61 new attaches, boosting its present number to 69. Wallonia, whose foreign trade relations are run from within a ministry for external relations, received 53 new commercial overseas attaches. The balance went to Brussels region. Alain Crespinet, diplomatic counsel in the Wallonian government, believes that the present system can work well, especially now that commercial attaches have agreed to handle inquiries from all regions. Flemish and Wallonian trade officials also argue that they are closer and therefore better placed to help the small and medium-sized companies who need to be encouraged to export. Language barriers play a role, too. Most Belgians, particularly the younger generation, are bilingual. But tension between the Flemish and Wallonian communities tempts the politicians to argue that the regions need separate trade functions in order to assure fair treatment for all. Here is the rub. The present arrangements in Belgium look more like a creation of politics rather than markets. The establishment of three separate power-centres in foreign trade in addition to the existing national body looks like a recipe for confusion, rivalry and inefficiency, whatever the inclination of all the parties to make the new system work. Regionalisation looks too rigid a formula to apply to overseas diplomatic missions. At a time when the US is pursuing an 'export-or-die' trade strategy and urging all diplomats from the ambassador down to drum up commercial business, the St Michael accords restricting trade promotion to regionally-controlled commercial attaches looks quaint if not ridiculous. Similarly, there are widespread concerns that the regions will be tempted to duplicate trade missions or requests for information when visiting important overseas trade centres. 'The political reforms have created an octopus,' says one Flemish observer. Jean-Francois Levaux, commercial director of Cockerill Mechanical Industry (CMI), a Wallonia-based exporter of heavy equipment such as loco-diesels, argues that big Belgian companies working the European markets bypass the regional trade promotion bodies and plug into their own networks. 'Companies need support when they are trying to break into Asia and Latin America and that is when you need the support of the Belgian government. Belgium does not have as much leverage as, say, Britain. But it surely has more leverage than the regions.' In spite of the devolutionary trend, significant external trade instruments remain in the hands of the national government such as the export credit guarantee system, the provision of soft loans and subsidies for export outside the European Union and the possession of a central data bank containing a register of Belgian exporters and business opportunities in foreign markets. However, Flanders is starting to compete even in these areas. The Flemish Foreign Trade Board already provides interest-free loans and grants to companies exporting outside the European Union. It is also operating a Flemish interest subsidy scheme parallel to existing national mechanisms. Marc Servotte, managing director of the Belgian Office of Foreign Trade, argues that regionalisation was useful as an internal instrument because it brought government closer to the companies; but he is less sure about its impact abroad. 'We have to make sure everybody plays the game,' he says. One upcoming test of co-operation will be a special 'Belgium week' in London, including a food show at the Harvey Nichols store, promotion of Flemish diamonds, health care technology and fashion from the Brussels region. The promotion will run from September 19-23. It would be unwise, however, to write off regionalism as a political force in Europe. There is a new European committee of the regions based in Brussels, alongside the European Parliament and the European Commission. What is unclear is how far this new body is a force which will lead to further fragmentation, or whether it can prove a useful building block in a Europe which has rejected the idea of a European super-state run from Brussels but which instinctively grasps that the nation state is not strong enough to compete on its own. In Belgium, the test of the regionalisation of trade strategy is similarly political. If efforts to co-operate fail, the result will be further strains inside the Belgian state and a weakening of Belgian's performance as an exporting nation.</p>

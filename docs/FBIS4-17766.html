			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- A mechanism of state protectionism  and other problems of the mass information media is the main  topic of the two-day conference of editors of Russia's national  and regional newspapers, which opened at the Russian Committee  for the Press today. Participants are to examine a number of  draft laws related, inter alia, to preferential taxation of the  media.    The press' economic situation is a political issue, said  Boris Mironov, chairman of the committee, opening the  conference. He explained the great importance of the presence  of a large number of regional representatives at this "briefing"  by the fact that it is precisely the Russian province that  becomes the center of economic reforms today. Mironov spoke  about obstacles in the way toward adopting a decision on state  protectionism of the press. Thus, leaders of the Economics  Ministry and the Finance Ministry claim that this document will  create "a dangerous precedent."    Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for  Information Policy and Communications spoke about the  committee's work. He asked to back the committee in adopting a  law that forbids any power structures setting up mass  information media.    This time "the top statesmen" showed unprecedented attention  to "the fourth estate." Today, Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of  the Russian Government, will meet participants in the conference  at the White House. This will be his first meeting with  representatives of the regional press. Also, Vladimir Shumeyko,  Anatoliy Chubays, and Vyacheslav Kostikov are expected to  address the conference.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Greentree replaced at Lasmo MR CHRIS Greentree, who built Lasmo into one of the UK's leading independent oil and gas exploration companies and led its 1991 takeover of rival Ultramar, was yesterday replaced as chief executive. Lasmo's shares fell 8p to 155p on fears the company would take the opportunity of a boardroom change to cut its dividend when it announces results in March. High borrowings, partly because of the Ultramar takeover, and a weak oil price have dented Lasmo's earnings. A maintained final dividend would almost certainly be uncovered. Mr Greentree's sudden departure drew parallels with BP, where a boardroom split led to last June's ousting of Mr Bob Horton, chairman, and to BP cutting its dividend. However, Lord Rees, Lasmo's chairman, insisted that 57-year-old Mr Greentree was leaving to pursue other interests and that the parting was 'extremely friendly'. 'This is not a Horton drama,' he said. Mr Joe Darby, formerly chief operating officer and with the company since 1979, was made Mr Greentree's successor. Lasmo said Mr Darby would continue with the disposals and the reducing of overheads following the Ultramar acquisition. Rumours of other imminent senior management changes were 'totally untrue', Lord Rees said. The change in leadership was greeted with mixed feelings. A large institutional shareholder said he was 'comfortable' with the announcement, although he feared a dividend cut was now more likely. Analysts expect Lasmo to announce net income of about Pounds 29m for the year to 30 September, equal to earnings per share of about 3p. Dividends last year totalled 8.5p, suggesting the final payment would need to be heavily cut to remain covered. Last July the interim dividend was held at 2.3p. Lord Rees said: 'We have not decided on the dividend, and will not do so until the final figures are in.' Lasmo raised Dollars 1.53bn (Pounds 1bn) through disposals last year, which included some of Ultramar's North American and North Sea assets. However, according to some estimates, year-end net borrowings were Pounds 1bn, giving gearing of 92 per cent. Mr Greentree, a Canadian, who was first associated with Lasmo in 1973, became chief executive in 1982. Observer, Page 15</p>

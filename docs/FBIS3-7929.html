			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, March 1 (AFP) -- The four  warplanes shot down Monday [28 February] by NATO fighters over  Bosnia were piloted by Bosnian Serbs flying for the  self-proclaimed "Serb Republic of Krajina" in Croatia, a  Yugoslav Air Force pilot said here Tuesday [1 March].    The pilot, who wished to remain anonymous, said three of the  Serbs were killed and the fourth ejected to safety. He named  the dead men as Lieutenants Sisarica, Zoric and Zvezdan Pesic.    Pesic was based at Podgorica with the Air Force of the rump  Yugoslavia until January when he quit and went as a volunteer to  Krajina, flying from the air base at Udbina, near Knin.    French military officials said in Paris Tuesday that it was  "very probable" that four of the six Galeb ground attack  aircraft intercepted by U.S. F-16s came from Ubdina, while the  others took off from another Serb base at Banja Luka, northwest  Bosnia.    In London and Zagreb, British and UN officials said Tuesday  it was probable that the aircraft had taken off from  Serb-controlled bases in Croatia.    On Monday, French officials said the first reports suggested  that all six aircraft had come from Banja Luka. The two  aircraft which escaped the attack left "due west" and landed  probably at the base at Udbina, the officials said Tuesday.    "The U.S. pilots saw explosions on the ground when they  intercepted the Serb planes," one said. "A munitions depot was  attacked," but "nobody can say exactly what were the Serb  pilots' intentions."    "The Serbian pilots could have dropped their bombs to make  themselves more manoeuvrable and able to escape from the US  planes, or to really bomb a site."    In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told the House of  Commons that the aircraft probably came from Serb-controlled  bases in Croatia. "It's not yet clear where the six Galeb  planes came from though it seems at least probable that they  came from airports under the control of Serbs in Croatia but  that is not yet certain," he said.    In Zagreb, a spokesman for the United Nations Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) was more cautious, saying the aircraft could  have come from a Serb-controlled area of Croatia.    "That couldn't be ruled out," said Michael Williams,  spokesman for Yasushi Akashi, the special representative of the  UN Secretary General in the former Yugoslavia. "We do not have  a confirmation as to which side or on whose behalf these planes  were engaged over Bosnia-Herzegovina," he added.    Also in Zagreb, Jean Marcotte, spokesman for UNPROFOR  commander General Jean Cot said the six Serb planes had just  carried out an airstrike against an ammunition factory at Novi  Travnik and an ammunition compound in Bugojno, both in central  Bosnia, when they were intercepted around dawn Monday.    The UN had no military observers in Udbina and those at  Banja  Luka had been "detained, confined in their quarters for the  whole day" Monday, Marcotte said. "There has been restriction of  movement in different ways by all the factions since we arrived  here," he added.    In Belgrade, Zoran Lilic, the president of the rump  Yugoslavia, said the planes shot down by NATO were not Yugoslav.  He condemned "all actions likely to lead to an escalation of  the conflict and all recourse to force on whatever side."</p>

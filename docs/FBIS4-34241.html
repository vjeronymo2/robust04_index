			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Victorio M. Copa] </F>   [Text] Havana, 14 Jun (DPA) -- Cuba is determined to  continue with its nuclear plans even though the construction of  its most important project, the Juragua Electronuclear Plant,  temporarily suspended in 1992, has yet to resume. In response to  a question asked by a DPA reporter, an Executive Secretariat for  Nuclear Affairs (SEAN) source said the country's plan was  drafted with multifaceted goals.    In 1983, Cuba began building two 440-megawatt nuclear energy  reactors in the area of Cienfuegos, on the south-central coast  of the island approximately 300 km east of Havana. On 5  September 1992, when President Fidel Castro announced the halt  of "the construction of the century," one of the reactors was 90  percent completed and scheduled to begin operating in late 1995  or early 1996, while the other one was only 20 or 30 percent  completed.    The project, which is estimated to have involved an  investment of $1.1 billion, would have been a big relief for  Cuban authorities, who lack hard money to buy the necessary oil  for the operational use of their thermoelectric plants.    For his part, Dr. Daniel Cordoniu, executive deputy  secretary  of the SEAN, said that, together with nuclear energy (production  of electricity stemming from the fusion of the atom) [passage as  received], another method being developed is the use of  radioisotopes and radiation in diverse fields. In addition to  being used in biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, and  health, which are priority areas in the country, these nuclear  techniques are being applied both in the food program and in  open support of diverse industries, the researcher said recently  on Cubavision's "Open Agenda" program. In that sense, he also  mentioned other areas, such as nickel-bearing, sugar, and oil  industries, without ruling out the use of nuclear techniques in  environmental activities related to tourism.    Engineer Gilberto Salazar, who is also executive vice  secretary of the SEAN, praised the production of  radiopharmaceuticals (components that are introduced into the  body for diagnostic and therapeutical purposes), which have  permitted substituting imports in 1993. He explained that this  progress was achieved by the Center of Applied Studies to  Nuclear Development (CEADEN), which is also taking part in  preparing certain components.    That technique is virtually irreplaceable in the studies of  absorption, distribution, metabolism, and the excretion of  medicine (pharmacodynamics), which is essential for registering  new medicines, Salazar stated. After noting that the  preservation of the Juragua plant has been achieved  satisfactorily with the Basic Industries Ministry as investor,  Codorniu confirmed that alternatives are being sought to  complete the project. Cuba and Russia are willing to contribute  foreign capital to put the Juragua plant in operation, which  will net the island a savings of over 800,000 tons of oil  annually.    Diplomatic sources in Havana and Moscow agreed that there is  great interest in this regard and that French authorities  apparently are considering possibly financing the project  jointly with Russia. The weekly GRANMA INTERNACIONAL, which is  edited in Spanish, English, and French, recently revealed that  the Russian Government granted the island a $30 million loan to  maintain the project. The necessary funding to obtain an  automation system for the plant's only reactor, however, is  pending.</p>

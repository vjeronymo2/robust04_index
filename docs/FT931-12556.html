			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Cuba dispute sways Clinton THE senior Latin American policy post at the US State Department seems likely to go to Ms Sally Shelton Colby, following a bitter political dispute between black and Cuban exile lobbies. Ms Shelton Colby, a regional specialist who served in the Carter administration, has emerged as the politically safe and qualified alternative to Mr Mario Baeza, a black Cuban-American lawyer from New York who was the first choice to be nominated as assistant secretary for Latin American affairs. Mr Baeza fell foul of the Florida-based anti-Castro lobby, led by Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, on the grounds that he might seek to negotiate with President Fidel Castro rather than work for his overthrow. Exception was taken to a visit to Havana by Mr Baeza last year, after which he spoke of the desirability of ending the 30-year US trade embargo on Cuba. Congressman Robert Toricelli, a New Jersey Democrat and author of the Cuban Democracy Act which is in part designed to stop foreign subsidiaries of US companies trading with Cuba, has been active in the campaign against Mr Baeza. However, black congressmen are infuriated by the decision to block his nomination. Mr Baeza is a protege of Mr Ron Brown, now commerce secretary, and of Mr Vernon Jordan, director of President Bill Clinton's transition team. They have pointed out that Mr Mas Canosa was close to the Reagan and Bush administrations. Ms Shelton Colby has worked on Capitol Hill for Mr Lloyd Bentsen, now treasury secretary, and in Mr Carter's State Department, eventually serving as ambassador to Barbados and Grenada.</p>

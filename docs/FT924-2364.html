			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Joint assets I AM UNCLEAR as to the income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax position of a husband and wife who own assets jointly but whose tax rates are different (mine 40 per cent, hers 25 per cent). We own jointly building society accounts worth Pounds 80,000 but are considering joint ownership of shares and our home (between them, worth Pounds 200,000-Pounds 250,000, depending on the housing market). The house is in my name only at present. Should I die, my estate would exceed the nil rate band several times (before the house/shares transfer referred to); my wife's would only just exceed it (again, before the proposed further joint ownership of assets). Would the income and capital value of jointly owned assets be divided equally between us, for all the three categories of tax, or would different treatment be levied for different (ie, each) categories. Also, if at any time we wished to transfer absolutely the ownership of certain jointly held assets to one or other partner, is this permissible by the Revenue, even if it meant a lower overall tax payment? Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR80(1992) on the taxation of married couples. The basic rule is that income from joint accounts and joint shareholdings is split 50:50 for income tax purposes, and that the proceeds (and cost) are similarly split 50:50 for capital gains tax purposes. However, there are wider-ranging anti-avoidance provisions to catch transfers into joint names which are motivated by a desire to reduce the family tax bills, rather than to give the other spouse a measure of financial independence. If you want greater details of these anti-avoidance provisions, you should ask also for the free booklet IR83 (1990) on independent taxation. On the death of either of you, jointly owned investments and accounts would vest in the survivor, so there would be no question of an inheritance tax bill at that stage (assuming that both of you are domiciled in England and Wales, or Scotland or Northern Ireland - not necessarily both in the same one of these three countries). The position for your house is a little different: it can be conveyed into the names of your wife and yourself as tenants in common (in which case, each of you can dispose of your respective half share by will, as you please) or as joint tenants (in which case, the freehold will vest in the survivor - unless either party in the meantime gives notice to the other of severance of the joint tenancy). Talk things over with your solicitor. Transfers from joint names to the exclusive beneficial ownership of your wife would be subject to the anti-avoidance legislation mentioned above (primarily, section 674a of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988), but really a transfer into her exclusive ownership is less vulnerable to attack than a transfer into joint names. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Profits at S Korean companies dip slightly PROFITS for South Korea's listed companies fell slightly in the first six months of 1992 compared with the same period in 1991, although sales pushed ahead steadily, Reuter reports from Seoul. According to preliminary studies by Daewoo Securities, covering 423 out of the 528 companies whose fiscal year ends in December, sales for the first half of 1992 amounted to Won77.07trillion (million million), up 14.9 per cent on the Won67.08tr (Dollars 85bn) a year earlier. Daewoo said the 95 companies not listed in the analysis were either concerns declining to take part or finance houses. A total of 688 companies are listed in South Korea, the remainder reporting their fiscal year at end-June. The report showed ordinary profits of the 423 companies in the first half of 1992 totalled Won1.50tr, down 0.4 per cent from Won1.51tr a year earlier; net profits amounted to Won1.08tr, down 0.1 per cent from Won1.09tr. Ordinary profits, usually before-tax, are total revenues minus total costs incurred in normal business activities, while net profits, mostly after-tax, also take into account extraordinary items. The 339 manufacturing companies on the list accounted for Won44tr in sales in the January-June period, a 12.3 per cent increase from Won39.17tr. These manufacturers' ordinary profits fell 5.1 per cent to Won1.11tr in the first half from Won1.17tr the previous year. Their net profits also slid 7.4 per cent to Won786.54bn from Won849.17bn. In contrast to the worsened profitability in manufacturing, the remaining 84 non-manufacturers garnered Won33.07tr in sales in the first half, a hefty rise of 18.5 per cent from Won27.92tr a year before. Non-manufacturers' ordinary profits in the first half increased 15.9 per cent to Won392.67bn from Won338.79bn. Net profits earned by the non-manufacturing sector in the first half totalled Won296.85bn, up 21.3 per cent from Won244.63bn, the Daewoo report showed. A Daewoo official attributed the lacklustre performance of manufacturers in comparison with the others to previous heavy borrowings for capital investment and weakened demand. All of the companies except those in the water transport sector had sales increases, with particularly good performances from the metal mining, telecommunications and construction sectors.</p>

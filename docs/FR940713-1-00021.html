			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Under the second alternative, the current post-mortem inspection procedures would be retained utilizing existing inspection techniques, but with an inspector at the end of the line after the viscera have been removed from the carcasses to examine each carcass for fecal contamination. This could be accomplished either by moving an existing inspector to the end of the line, or by adding a new inspector to every line, or by a combination of both arrangements. However, this would mean that the Government could incur additional personnel costs of approximately $16 million per annum. Further, production rates could be reduced by 30 to 50 percent if the inspectors tasks remained identical, but fewer inspectors were used to perform those functions. The impact of the slowed linespeeds could reach $5.2 billion per year for chickens and turkeys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the judgment of the Agency, either of these alternatives would impose unacceptable costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Executive Order 12778 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions are preempted under the PPIA from imposing any requirements with respect to federally inspected premises and facilities, and operations of such establishments, that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the PPIA. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the PPIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over poultry products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the PPIA or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. States and local jurisdictions may also make requirements or take other actions that are consistent with the PPIA, with respect to any other matters regulated under the PPIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the PPIA, States that maintain poultry product inspection programs must impose requirements on State-inspected products and establishments that are at least equal to those required under the PPIA. These States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State-inspected products and establishments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event of its adoption, no retroactive effect would be given to this proposed rule, no administrative procedures must be exhausted before any judicial challenge can be taken to the application of these provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Effect on Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities affected by this proposal are small poultry slaughtering establishments operating one or two slaughtering lines each staffed by one FSIS food inspector. They include establishments operating under the SIS&hyph;1 and NTIS&hyph;1 inspection systems, and some small entities operating under the traditional inspection procedures; these account for 75 of the approximately 300 poultry slaughtering establishments that would be affected by the proposed rule. Thus, the proposed rule would affect a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It may be assumed that each establishment with only one single-inspector processing line would be required to make a one-time investment of about $10,000 for an inspection platform and installation, enhanced lighting, equipment installation to meet the requirement for antimicrobial treatment of dressed poultry, and training of establishment personnel. Each establishment with two lines could incur expenses of as much as $17,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, every establishment would be required to operate a finished product standards program. Establishments now operating under traditional inspection would thus assume a modest information collection burden. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, there would be no production rate reductions and, in fact, small establishments could benefit from increases in production rates. For example, some processing lines staffed by a single FSIS inspector would now be staffed by two inspectors and plant sorters. That means that, consistent with physical plant limitations, the class of poultry processed, market demand for poultry products (which has been steadily increasing in recent decades), and the establishment's ability to maintain processing controls and quality standards, production rates on these processing lines could be increased with the adoption of the proposed rule. In the most favorable scenario, an establishment currently operating under traditional inspection and processing young chickens at the rate of 25 per minute would be able to increase its production rate up to 70 birds per minute. The increase in annual returns resulting from such a production-rate increase would more than offset any necessary one-time investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for reasons given in this notice in support of changes to the FPS, there would be greater assurances of processing stability and product quality under the proposed rule. Identification of product requiring rework would be more certain. Resulting efficiencies could be expected to yield returns that, combined with productivity gains, would offset outlays for equipment in the near term for most establishments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, therefore, the proposed rule would not have a significant net effect on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Paperwork Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This proposed rule requires paperwork and recordkeeping activities that would provide FSIS with information to ensure that establishments are in compliance with the proposed regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each day, establishments would complete a form that reports that day's poultry condemnations. Also, under the proposed FPS program, establishments would report data on only one form. Under the current FPS system, establishments complete three forms to report data from FPS checks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishments using chlorinated water to meet the proposed antimicrobial treatment requirements would be required to monitor the concentration by testing three times a shift and keeping on file records of the test results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any establishment wishing to operate an approved PQC program would have to send a copy of the program to the Administrator for approval. Additionally, an establishment wishing to use antimicrobial compounds not listed in the table of approved substances may request, in writing, approval for use of such compounds from the Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The paperwork requirements contained in this proposal have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .). Comments on the paperwork burden of this proposed rule should be sent to: Office of Management and Budget, Desk Officer for FSIS, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, and to the Clearance Office, Room 404&hyph;W, Administration Building, Washington, DC 20250. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition  Democratic Party (DP) demanded Tuesday that the prosecution  trace the whereabouts of a slush fund allegedly funnelled into  the political arena by a contractor.    The DP pressed its demand by presenting the financial  records  of Cho Ki-hyon, president of Chungwoo Construction Co., to the  National Assembly.    The DP's action came Tuesday afternoon as the Legislation  and  Judiciary Committee was forming a subcommittee to work out a  schedule for parliamentary investigation of the "Sangmudae  scandal."    The opposition party's maneuver is expected to become a  red-hot political issue pitting the Democratic Liberal Party  (DLP) against the DP as the ruling party maintains that tracing  the money runs counter to the real-name financial system.    A DP special committee probing the Sangmudae affair, chaired  by Rep. Chong Tae-chol, told a press conference that spending  records are listed in a suit against Cho, who has been indicted  on charges of embezzlement.    Calling it "a list of criminal activities," the committee  presented a copy of the document to the National Assembly. It  showed Cho had an alleged slush fund amounting to 22.7 billion  won, with 18.9 billion won having been spent between November  1991 and December 1992.    In addition, the DP said that Cho used 3.8 billion won for  "business expenses" which, it claimed, could very well have been  lobbying outlays for his company.    Cho's Chungwoo Construction Co., along with Hyundai  Construction Co., received a multi-billion-won order to relocate  military facilities called "Sangmudae" from Kwangju city to its  outskirts.    The DP alleges that Cho created a slush fund out of money he  received from the defense ministry and diverted a large part of  it to the ruling camp during the 1992 presidential campaign.    At Tuesday's press conference, the opposition party charged  the prosecution with trying to cover up or minimize the scandal  by not tracing the whereabouts of money spent by Cho.    "If the prosecution has any intention to find out where  checks issued from the slush fund have gone, there is no need  for the National Assembly to undertake a parliamentary  investigation," one committee member said.    The DP has been under pressure from the ruling party to  produce material evidence to substantiate its charges.    Tuesday's presentation of a copy of Cho's financial  transactions, therefore, was seen as the DP's answer to the DLP  demand.    If the prosecution refused to trace the checks, the  opposition party could claim that the probe into Cho's slush  fund had failed because of the uncooperative attitude of the DLP  and the government.</p>

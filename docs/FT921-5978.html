			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: When politics and art don't mix - The work of Alfredo Jaar at the Whitechapel Gallery GOOD INTENTIONS do not necessarily lead to good works of art, especially if the intentions are political as well as artistic. Alfredo Jaar, the Chilean artist whose exhibition Two or Three Things I Imagine about Them is at the Whitechapel Gallery until March 29, means well. He has set himself the task of bringing into our western art space images of people who live and work in some of the most miserable conditions in the so-called third world. His subjects include the toilers in the hellish gold pit of Serra Pelada in Brazil, the residents of Koko, in Nigeria, where toxic wastes from Europe and the US have been dumped, and refugees from Vietnam interned in Hong Kong. He presents them in photographs, some taken by himself, some selected from other sources, displayed on light boxes. The light boxes are then arranged in installations of varying degrees of complexity, the purpose of which is to make us experience both the physical and the political distance which separates the viewer from the subject. So far so admirable. The problem is the works just don't work - or rather they do, but in such a simplistic fashion that instead of being moved and in some way involved with the people whose lot he or she has been invited to contemplate, the spectator is more likely to be appalled at the assumption that such poorly conceived gallery tricks could begin to embody the complexities of perception and experience they dare to hint at. An example: the images of individual Brazilian gold miners in 'Out of Balance', 1988, are set at the edges of their light boxes, the catalogue explains, because the miners are 'marginal' to the developed world. Yes, really . . . that's all. The piece 'Untitled (Water)', 1990, at first sight works better. Here, five light boxes show images of the sea. Behind them, 25 small mirrors reflect fragments of the images on the other side of the light boxes, of boat people either at sea or grouped in internment camps. As a metaphor, this works, but only until curiosity prevails and we walk up to the floor-set boxes and peer behind them to see the images of the people on the other side 'properly'. This lack of control in the placing of the boxes makes it possible to undermine the whole point of the installation, which is surely to allow us to realise that what we think we 'see' of such people is inevitably both The gold miners and refugees are passive subjects, brought to us from far away. Trapped in their boxes, they do not answer back. Not so the pupils of the Mulberry School for Girls, some of whose pupils Jaar had had photographed (with their and their parents' consent), to form part of the installation Two or Three Things I Imagine about Them which fills the lower gallery. This is a new piece specially commissioned for the exhibition: its subject is the Bangladeshi community of Whitechapel. When the young women saw that the large colour photos of their faces - individual, identifiable, local faces - had been overlayed with quotes from remarks made by a Bangladeshi some time in the fifties, referring to the compatriots he employed as home workers and saying, amongst other things 'They are all illiterate', they objected. The uncredited text imposed over their faces made it look as if either they had said the words themselves or that their images had been defaced with the anonymous racist slurs so familiar in our streets. After a meeting with the girls at the school, and a discussion about what he had been trying to achieve in the work, Alfredo Jaar agreed to take the pictures down. Seven of the 18 lightboxes which hang from the gallery ceiling are now empty, their unlit neon tubes exposed. The others retain images of young women's faces or close ups of their eyes. Other elements of the exhibition include film, sound, neon and mirrored walls. Just inside the entrance, a screen blocks the way. On it is projected upside down the head of a woman asking questions such as 'How to learn to see differently? Who sees? Who is seen?' in English and Bengali. The screen is reflected in a pool of water and the spectators gazing at the ensemble are themselves reflected in two large mirrored panels which flank the video screen. This hotch potch of high tech and high ideals, put together by a sophisticated artist, a distinguished cultural critic (Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, who is the questioning head and Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York), numerous assistants and a battery of technology fails to achieve a unity of content and form able to withstand the critique of the young women whose lives it claimed to make visible and whose artistic judgment is to be commended.</p>

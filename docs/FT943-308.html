			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Nato pledges tougher Bosnia line Nato defence ministers pledged yesterday to make the use of alliance airpower in the skies over Bosnia more effective. But they also agreed, at the insistence of Nato's European members, that the UN must retain its veto over any hardening of tactics by the Atlantic alliance. An informal meeting of Nato defence ministers, attended for the first time since 1966 by France, heard calls from Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, for much tougher action against the Bosnian Serbs. He told his colleagues that Nato's political credibility had been damaged by the fact that in an air raid near Sarajevo last week five aircraft were apparently needed to destroy one tank. In a spirited exchange, the European allies agreed that there was room for some stiffening of Nato's stance but they insisted that British and French generals on the ground should retain the last word. Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said the use of airpower so far had been more symbolic than substantial and said Nato could 'go a bit further'. Mr Leotard called for a more vigorous response to 'unacceptable behaviour' such as firing on UN aid convoys or relief flights. Apart from intensified use of airpower, he said, there was room for the UN to adopt tougher procedures on the ground such as, opening fire when humanitarian convoys are attacked. Yesterday's meeting took place in the shadow of widespread complaints from supporters of the Bosnian government that Nato's air raids so far have been little more than pinpricks. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence minister, insisted strongly on the need for the UN to be involved in the process of defining what a 'robust response' to provocations in Sarajevo would mean in practice. But he acknowledged the force of US complaints about damage to Nato's credibility. 'If you use airpower at all, it has to be effective,' he said. Senior officials in Russia's arms exporting enterprise have criticised the US for 'discrediting' Russian weapons in international arms markets and forecast a continuing rise in arms sales. At the same time, a foreign office official told the news agency Interfax that there was 'no reason to break military relations with Iran', writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The comments came while Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton disagreed on arms sales to Iran. Mr Clinton attempted to persuade the Russian leader to stop arms deliveries to a country the US sees as a supporter of terrorism, but Mr Yeltsin made no commitment.</p>

There is so much  behind these words! The fleet has rich traditions, and a heroic  past. The whole world knows of the heroism of Black Sea Fleet  seamen in the difficult war years.    But today the fleet is going through difficult times. The  ships are growing old, and there are no new ones to replace  them. The seamen take fewer long cruises. The hopes and dreams  of those who decided long ago, in childhood, to tie their life  to the sea are vanishing. Many officers who see no future in the  service are retiring into the reserves. Often with heavy hearts,  in anger. The delays in dividing up the fleet and the political  squabbles around it have had a negative effect on the skills of  Black Sea Fleet seamen.    What are Black Sea Fleet seamen doing in this complex  situation? It's not an idle question--many are asking it.  Getting ahead of ourselves a little, we should note that in the  last training year the Black Sea Fleet seamen successfully  endured some difficult trials. They have something to be proud  about. They have created a good foundation in their training.  When compared with the Northern, Pacific and Baltic fleets, the  Black Sea Fleet is among the best in terms of the results of its  combat training. Black Sea Fleet seamen have won six prizes in  contests of naval championship.    [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, does this mean that there are  grounds for optimism? Judging from last year's training results  and from the way the new stage in the combat training system has  begun, it might be said that personnel of the fleet's ships and  units are ready to carry out the most complex missions. I would  like to know your opinion in this regard.    [Svyatashov] I'm pleased that winter training basically  began  in organized fashion in the fleet. Commanders, staffs, staff and  division specialists, and instructors gave some thought to their  work ahead of time, and creatively planned the training. They  took account of the situation and the general training level of  their students. Instructors thoughtfully utilized experience  accumulated last year in their practical training. Trainers and  mockups are being used to teach the seamen. Lessons are also  conducted at duty stations. Rather than playing the role of  testers, officers who attend the lessons provide practical  assistance to the young instructors. Training in classrooms and  offices has become more active. This is an indication that many  students are striving to become rated specialists. There has  been a noticeable improvement in the training of young seamen as  well. They are striving to make it to sea aboard warships  faster. This fast start in winter training will doubtlessly have  an effect on the skills of all specialists. Our hope is that  this year ships will go to sea more often, and carry out planned  missions.    But for now let's return to the training results for the  past  training year. The fleet took second place in the navy. The  tasks imposed on the ship crews and unit personnel were  completed in full. Practice missile, artillery and torpedo  firings at sea were successful. Commanders sought the initiative  and avoided stereotypy in fluid, dynamic combat. The main goal  was to make the people proficient, to prepare for them for  action in novel situations.    In this regard I would like to make special mention of the  crews of the BPK [large ASW ship] "Kerch", the SKR [guided  missile cruiser] "Razitelnyy" and the SKR "Ladnyy", which  participated in an exercise in the Mediterranean Sea in a KPUG  [ship hunter-killer group]. ASW seamen displayed a high class of  work in their hunt.    Black Sea Fleet seamen worked quite competently in their  hunting efforts during a joint exercise with an American ship as  well. They obtained good combat experience in the Mediterranean  Sea, and gained confidence.    Mention should be made of the crews of other warships, as  well as of vessels of the auxiliary fleet, which carried out  their tasks.    [Chumak] In addition to planned training measures, the fleet  also carried out special missions. For example, evacuation of  refugees from the Caucasus. On some occasions the Black Sea  Fleet seamen risked their own lives to rescue children,  casualties and the families of servicemen. Setting off aboard  their ships to the Georgian coast, to Poti, the seamen knew that  anything could happen. Were there any who displayed cowardice,  who refused to go to sea?    [Svyatashov] No. The seamen knew that many people in the  Caucasus were in difficulty, and they went to the region of  misfortune to help them. The crews of BDK-69, the BDK [large  amphibious warfare ship] "Konstantin Olshanskiy", and of other  warships and auxiliary vessels in the fleet displayed real  heroism and courage in rescuing the peaceful inhabitants.    During these operations the forces were competently led by  Rear-Admiral N. Mikhalchenko, Captain 1st Rank V. Maksimov and  other experienced commanders. The fleet's assault forces  accumulated rich experience in "hot spots." This experience is  being analyzed and generalized. It would be nice if this kind of  thing didn't happen again. But if difficulties once again arise  in some region, Black Sea Fleet seamen will always be ready to  render peaceful assistance.    [Chumak] Comrade Vice-Admiral, which military collectives  especially pleased the fleet command with high indicators in  combat training despite the complexities of last year?    [Svyatashov] There are many such combined units, units and  ships. Our submariners distinguished themselves: Participating  in the naval championships, a KPUG consisting of the BPK  "Kerch", the SKR "Ladnyy" and the SKR "Skoryy" won a prize in  missile launching.    We were also pleased with submariners under combined unit  commander Rear-Admiral F. Pogorelov. They had it rough in their  training and their cruises. Captain 2d Rank K. Vasiltsev's crew  distinguished itself. The submariners won the navy's perpetual  prize for the second time in succession.    As always, the offshore defense unit performed at its best.  Crews of minesweepers, particularly of the MTShch "Signalshik",  the MTShch "Zenitchik" and the MTShch "Dizelist", confirmed  their high class rating in their qualifying exercises. And an  honorary prize was deservedly presented to the best ships in the  beginning of the new training year. Captain 2d Rank M. Spalek  and captains 3d rank O. Vatin and S. Pyatnichuk competently  organized the training process, and displayed creativity and  initiative in exercises. They earned their training results.    The collectives in which rear-admirals A. Tsubin, A. Aladkin  and A. Grinko, captains 1st rank N. Martynov, Yu. Kostyrko, N.  Mikheyev, S. Umnov and V. Krikunov, Captain 2d Rank V. Belenko  and Lieutenant Colonel A. Smolyak serve faced very important  missions. Despite everything, these leaders competently  organized the people in complex conditions to carry out their  assigned missions. Good organization of service, exactingness,  and control over execution promoted this success. By the way,  submariners, ASW specialists, boatmen, signalmen and other fleet  specialists have also begun the winter training period  aggressively.    [Chumak] How did the fleet's Rear Services do last year?    [Svyatashov] Rear-Admiral Bogdanov and his aides approached  their work competently and creatively. Potatoes and vegetables  were procured and delivered to fleet storage depots in time.  Suppliers had to work a great deal in fall in order to procure  everything planned for the seamen. The storage depots contain  more than enough, and that's gratifying. This is the result of  the fact that the fleet's rear services oriented themselves  promptly in the complex situation, and correctly organized their  work. Seamen have high quality food, and warrant officers and  officers will receive their food rations, which is important  these days.    [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, many difficulties arose in the  course of training and during work on planned missions,  constraining the people's initiative and sometimes slowing  progress down. What troubled Black Sea Fleet seamen the most?    [Svyatashov] First of all, the uncertainty. People were  perpetually keyed up, in anticipation of changes. But  politicians are in no hurry. As for what awaits Black Sea Fleet  seamen tomorrow, no one can clearly say. However, we firmly  believe that the fleet problem will be resolved reasonably.    Last year there were cases in which training measures had to  be postponed at the fault of certain executives. And there was  stereotypy in some practice firings as well. Another troubling  thing is that certain subunit commanders, especially junior  officers, have lost interest in service, and consequently  they've left seaman training to its own devices. As a result the  number of highly qualified specialists decreased aboard a number  of ships. Poor training of seamen and petty officers led in turn  to breakdown of equipment and weapons. The shortcomings were  especially great in this regard in the combined unit under Read  Admiral O. Sviridov.    Nor can we condone cases of poor organization of alert duty  and watches, or the absence of proper order. Things like this  led to disciplinary violations, and to improper mutual  relations, with serious consequences.    This training year, like the last, will not be easy for  Black  Sea Fleet seamen. Many unsolved problems are getting worse. But  we always need to remember that we are military people. And our  most important objective is to become masters of our work, to be  prepared, if necessary, to carry out any mission. Therefore we  need to improve the quality of special training. And this  quality will depend in many ways on the training provided to  instructors. However, as the first inspections showed, there are  many passive officers among them, who have stopped improving  themselves. What could they teach subordinates? Nothing.    Staff workers need to keep questions of this kind under  special scrutiny. Their demandingness and their interested  assistance will help to upgrade the quality of training in the  Black Sea Fleet. We can't allow seamen to be taken away from  their training, or to waste their time.    Much in the course of planned measures depends on  commanders.  Where they continually raise the level of technical training,  display aggressiveness and strive for novelty and initiative,  order will necessarily be better and organization and  performance will be higher. But these are precisely the  qualities that some executives lack. They promise many things,  but their results are meager. This is why, as an example, repair  training of specialists has declined.    Commanders and staff officers need to keep a constant eye on  issues like accident-free ship navigation, damage control,  injuries, fire and explosion safety, the physical fitness of  seamen and other problems in the course of winter training.    I would like to make special mention of deputy commanders  for  personnel. They unite the collectives, and do much to help young  seamen mature and to maintain glorious fleet traditions. Many  fabulous educators who enjoy respect among the people serve  aboard ships. They are the ones who are sought out for help and  advice. Discipline has risen and order has become firmer aboard  ships owing to many of them. The crews are living in friendship.  The seamen are happy to serve.    However, it would be wrong to assert that things are like  this everywhere. Some educators were put in their important  positions by accident. They don't know how to work with people,  and they don't understand their needs. Such educators can only  do harm to the collectives. Educational work is especially  poorly organized in the combined unit in which Captain 1st Rank  G. Chernokhlebov serves, and aboard the PSK "Apsheron".    [Chumak] There have been complaints that some officers,  warrant officers and civilian employees of the fleet have not  received their pay and wages for November, December and January.  How are these people to live? And why did this happen?    [Svyatashov] I know that the Russian Ministry of Defense has  transferred funds to the fleet. But the fact is that not all  Ukrainian banks are working efficiently. That's were the holdup  in pay is. But I think that his matter will soon be resolved.    [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, what would you wish Black Sea  Fleet seamen in conclusion?    [Svyatashov] That they gather up their endurance, and do  their work honorably. It is the hope of all of us that this year  the fate of the Black Sea Fleet will finally be resolved. And  then all of us would see that we have a future. Officers,  warrant officers and seamen will be able to serve in peace.    And one other thing--we all need to live in peace and  friendship. There are some people who are trying to start fights  between our Slavic peoples. But this cannot be. Black Sea Fleet  seamen have stood, and will continue to stand guard over the  southern borders of CIS countries.    [Chumak] Thank you for the interview.</p>

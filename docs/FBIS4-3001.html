			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.J. Tzou and Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 13 (CNA) -- Sri Lanka  hopes to strengthen trade ties with Taiwan, Economic Affairs  Minister P.K. Chiang [words indistinct] Taiwan minister made the  statement after meeting with Sri Lanka's Trade and Commerce  Minister A. R. Mansoor, who is leading a delegation to the  ongoing ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT).    Chiang is heading a 15-member Taiwan delegation to the  four-day GATT meeting, which opened Tuesday [12 April].    Both sides exchanged views on how to boost bilateral trade  cooperation, he noted.    Chiang said he also expressed Taiwan's willingness to  promote  trade ties with Sri Lanka.    "I told my Sri Lanka counterpart that any bilateral  relationship would be substantially strengthened if official  trade offices could be established in each other's territories,"  he said.    The offices will certainly help protect the interests of  traders and investors, thereby paving the way for increased  trade exchanges, he elaborated.    The Sri Lanka minister pledged he will convey the proposal  to  the Colombo government and work on ways to promote trade with  Taiwan, he added.</p>

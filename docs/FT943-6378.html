			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Riyadh boycotts population talks Saudi Arabia, one of the world's most strictly Islamic states, has decided not to send a delegation to next week's United Nations Conference on Population and Development in a move sure to stoke intensifying conservative Moslem opposition to the Cairo meeting. A UN spokesman in Cairo confirmed that Saudi Arabia had said it would not attend, but said Riyadh had not explained why. Around 20,000 delegates from up to 180 countries are due to attend the event, which opens next Monday and is billed as an attempt to formulate a sweeping but consensual world approach to the related issues of population growth and development. Conference organisers say only Monaco, Liechtenstein, Eritrea and the small Pacific Island of Nauru had previously stated they would not participate. Saudi officials were not available to comment on the decision. However, the kingdom - whose ruler King Fahd titles himself the 'custodian of the two holy mosques' of Mecca and Medina - is deeply sensitive both to its role in the Moslem world and also to powerful conservative Islamic opinion within the Gulf state. As a measure of the latter, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baz, the kingdom's senior religious figure, yesterday called on Saudi Arabia to boycott the meeting. He said a meeting today of the kingdom's most authoritative religious committee would 'denounce' the Cairo conference as 'incompatible with the Moslem religion'. Sheikh bin Baz's comments and Saudi Arabia's decision will further encourage conservative Islamic critics of the conference, who have grown increasingly vocal in recent weeks, notably in the host country itself. Iranian officials have also cast the forthcoming conference in a religious light, condemning the draft UN text for promoting 'sexual liberty' and committing Iranian delegates to making the final document compatible with Islamic law. Extremist Islamic groups in Egypt joined the fray at the weekend, warning that all foreign visitors to the conference were 'putting themselves in dangers' way' by attending what they described as the 'licentiousness conference'. Security at hotels, tourist and other sensitive sites has been increased noticeably in the past few days to safeguard against this threat. The government is forced to take it with the utmost seriousness despite its recent successes in quelling militant attacks.</p>

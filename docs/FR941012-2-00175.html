			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;Improving the enforcement and legal response to family abduction cases. The enforcement and legal systems lack the knowledge and skill to deal with these cases effectively. Legal reform is needed to further define when a child is considered missing in a family abduction case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  *&blank;Creating stronger linkages between human service agencies, the criminal justice system, and the juvenile justice system. Currently there is a chasm between the justice system and human service agencies in providing services to missing and exploited children and their families. Too many cases are passed back and forth among these two systems rather than being handled through a comprehensive case management system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  *&blank;Developing a plan for marketing services available to communities through Title IV. A coherent plan of action needs to be developed and implemented to expand the understanding of the services that are available to missing children and their families from Missing Children grantees. Teleconferencing and other new technologies should be used to promote more awareness of the dimensions of problems addressed by Title IV. State Clearinghouses could play a more active role in disseminating information regarding missing and exploited children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  *&blank;Disseminating useful information from research and evaluation work funded by Title IV. Findings from research and evaluation projects need to be translated into useful information that can be used in communities by practitioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  *&blank;Applying new information technologies in addressing the goals of Title IV. With discussion of an ``information highway'' being built in the United States, Title IV activities should be more directly tuned to take advantage of the potential benefits of information system technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  *&blank;Further defining the role of non-profit organizations. The wide range of services provided by non-profit organizations continues to evolve. As a result, there is a need to continue to define the role of these organizations in relationship to other community agencies. A set of standards is needed for services provided by non-profit organizations participating in Title IV related activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  *&blank;Continuing the evolution of the role of State Clearinghouses. The number of state clearinghouses has grown slowly but steadily. The roles of these organizations vary from state to state. Title IV has funded technical assistance and training for state clearinghouses. The nature and scope of services to be provided to state clearinghouses should be re-evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Long Range Plan for Future Title IV Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OJJDP funds need to be allocated to reach each of the three goals. Strategies can be implemented through multiple program initiatives to include the National Resource Center and Clearinghouse mandated in Title IV. Overall, these goals and strategies are designed to help communities to use  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> existing community resources <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to improve the quality of services provided to missing and exploited children and their families through multi-disciplinary approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Goal 1: Increase Awareness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title IV programs should focus on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> increasing awareness <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of problems related to missing and exploited children on the part of professionals and the general public. Linkages between child victimization and future costs to society are not generally understood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Strategies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign demand sustains Nikkei at two-year high Growing optimism pushed share prices up strongly for a third straight day in active trading, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average added 140.84 at 21,402.78, its highest close in more than two years. Although there was heavy profit-taking, foreign investors joined some domestic institutions in a wave of buying. Volume was estimated at 850m shares, sharply above Wednesday's 599.3m and the heaviest since the 950.8m that changed hands on February 1. Rises led falls by 721 to 303, with 162 issues unchanged. The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 finished at 311.60, up 1.75, and the Topix index of all first section stocks gained 11.42 at 1,709.16. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 4.21 to 1,414.69. The market scraped bottom at 21,263.95 on the Nikkei 225 in the first half-hour, but it had made the bulk of its gain by mid-morning; the afternoon session saw heavy trading across all sectors, with individual investors appearing on the buy side, and the day's peak of 21,455.49 was reached shortly before the close. Brokerage houses benefited from the return of activity that spells high commission income. The 'Big Four' houses all gained ground, Nomura Securities advancing Y90 to Y1,440, Yamaichi Y31 to Y990, Nikko Y40 to Y1,440 and Daiwa Y20 to Y1,840. Smaller firms also posted strong gains. Wako Securities added nearly 10 per cent, moving up Y120 to Y1290, and Marusan Securities climbed Y80 to Y1,250. Shipbuilders rose in active trading. The volume leader, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, moved up Y32 to Y819 in heavy foreign buying that pushed turnover to 40.5m shares. Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding advanced Y13 to Y394. The second most active stock, Oki Electric, added to its previous strong gains, rising Y49 to Y789, a new high for the year, in volume of 29.6m shares. Other electricals were mixed. Toshiba put on Y27 at Y869 but Fujitsu fell Y20 to Y1,130. NTT climbed Y4,000 to Y886,000. Analysts were generally encouraged by the renewed healthy activity in the market, but caution prevailed because of the unstable political situation and tomorrow's release of the tankan, a quarterly index of business sentiment. In Osaka the OSE average rose 178.01 to 23,530.64 in volume of 62m shares. Roundup A mixed performance was seen in the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG declined 1.1 per cent, under pressure from a late fall in futures prices and weakness in the property sector as investors assessed the impact of government measures to cool the overheated housing market. The Hang Seng index closed 100.54 lower at 9,190.64 as arbitrage trading was seen between the physical and the futures market. Among property issues, Cheung Kong dipped 75 cents to HKDollars 37.50, Henderson Land HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.25 and Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars Dollars 50.50. HSBC Holdings dropped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 85.50, a day after Merrill Lynch and SBC issued covered warrants on its shares and amid speculation that warrants were about to be issued on shares in Hang Seng Bank and Hong Kong Electric. TAIPEI tumbled 2.6 per cent on profit-taking, mainly by domestic investors. The weighted index shed 156.20 to 5,942.38 in TDollars 72.5bn turnover. The electronics sector was the worst affected, with Acer falling by the maximum permitted 7 per cent limit to TDollars 70. SEOUL was mixed in moderate trading as selective gains were mostly offset by marginal losses in blue chips. The composite index ended 2.77 higher at 935.79 as the impact on the market of the North Korean nuclear issue appeared to be weakening. KUALA LUMPUR was spurred higher by an unexpected flurry of late demand for blue chips, and the composite index reversed early weakness to finish 12.41, or 1.3 per cent, ahead at 981.72. Tenaga moved forward 40 cents to MDollars 13.80 and Telekom 50 cents to MDollars 19. Genting rose MDollars 1 to MDollars 31 as the market revised the company's earnings forecasts upwards due to projections for better earnings from its power unit, Genting Sanyen. BOMBAY finished at a four-month high, the BSE 30-share index adding 104.04, or 2.5 per cent, at 4,137.70. It was the first time that the index had topped 4,100 since February 28, when India announced its national budget. The index had since fallen, marking disappointment with the budget and in response to the ban on badla or carry forward trading. The current revival has been triggered by strong corporate results and the prospects of a normal monsoon. SINGAPORE was helped higher in thin trading by some late foreign demand for blue chips which reversed earlier losses. The Straits Times Industrial index advanced 16.69 to 2,282.34. MANILA fell as investors took profits ahead of forthcoming new issues. The composite index shed 26.3 to 2,990.85 in turnover of 900.1m pesos. SYDNEY was discouraged by weaker bonds which dragged equities down later in the session. After a day's high of 2,090.5, the All Ordinaries index ended a net 3.0 off at 2,076.7. Turnover amounted to ADollars 519.9m. Strength in commodity prices helped Western Mining rise 17 cents to ADollars 8.12, while MIM was up 5 cents at ADollars 3.22. WELLINGTON shrugged off early weakness to finish a thinly traded session higher on rises in a number of major issues. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 9.52 at 2,125.87 in turnover of NZDollars 33.7m.</p>

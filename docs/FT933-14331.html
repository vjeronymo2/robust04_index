			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Tension rises in south Lebanon security zone ISRAEL sent 1,000 soldiers and a fleet of tanks and armoured vehicles to its self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon yesterday, sparking renewed speculation of an imminent attack against Arab guerrillas, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem. Israeli aircraft flew mock raids over both south and eastern Lebanon and the inner cabinet discussed a list of possible military actions against Arab guerrillas operating in Lebanon as retaliation for the killing of five Israeli soldiers last week. In Beirut Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, said the escalation in tension was aimed at putting pressure on his government to make concessions in the Arab-Israeli peace talks to the detriment of Lebanese sovereignty and dignity. 'We will not submit to any blackmail from Israel,' he said. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, has vowed to strike back against the Palestinian and pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas, responsible for last weeks' deaths. Senior Israeli officials, however, played down the possibility of a serious strike especially while Mr Dennis Ross, the US peace talks coordinator, was in the region. Mr Ross left for Washington yesterday. Syria, which Israel blamed for the surge in violence, also called yesterday for the US to discourage an Israeli retaliation. It said such action could jeopardise the next round of peace talks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 5 Jun (PL) -- Jorge Pinto Mazal, under  secretary for foreign relations for Latin America and the  Caribbean, said in Mexico City that relations between Mexico and  Cuba are consistent, solid, and steady.    In statements to the press, the official said that the  Mexican Government has always maintained a very close  relationship with Cuba, not only because of their close border,  but because of the obvious ties of friendship and affection  between both peoples. Regarding the upcoming visit to Havana by  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Pinto Mazal said that the  idea is to maintain a "very open and fluid" bilateral relation.    According to Foreign Affairs Secretariat sources, during  Salinas de Gortari's visit to Cuba, planned for 13 June, there  will be contacts at the highest level with Cuban officials,  which reaffirms Mexico's policies and principles toward Cuba.  Likewise, the official emphasized that Mexico demands an end to  the U.S. economic blockade against Cuba, as reflected in  Friday's resolution adopted by the Latin American Economic  System (SELA). Pinto Mazal ruled out highs and lows in Mexico's  ties with Cuba and added that Salinas' presence in Cuba will  endorse the traditional ties between both peoples.</p>

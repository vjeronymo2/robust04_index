			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IWC reduces crop estimates THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has reduced its estimates of the 1992 world wheat and coarse grains crops. In its latest market report, published yesterday, the London-based agency has cut the wheat harvest forecast to 546m tonnes from 548m tonnes in its June report and that for coarse grains to 820m tonnes from 824m tonnes. Both figures are up on actual 1991 output, however; wheat by 3m tonnes and coarse grains by 25m tonnes. The reduction in the coarse grains estimate mainly reflects deterioration in European Community harvest prospects, particularly in Denmark and Germany, where drought is expected to hit barley production severely. The report attributes the cut in the 1992 wheat estimate to lower figures for the EC and Canada, 'which were only partly offset by better prospects in China and India.' The projection for the US is up 200,000 tonnes from the June assessment at 60.7m tonnes, and is now 13 per cent higher than in 1991. The IWC figures include a 400,000-tonne cut in the coarse grains estimate for the Commonwealth of Independent States, but that would still be 11.6m tonnes above last year's. The estimate for CIS wheat remains at June's 83.5m tonnes, up 11.1m tonnes from 1991. Mr Bill de Maria, the IWC's chief economist, warned, however, that while June-July weather had been generally good in the CIS, dryness might be causing problems and the effects had yet to be evaluated. The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which did not join the CIS after the collapse of the Soviet Union, are now expected to produce 5.7m tonnes of grain between them in 1992, about 200,000 tonnes down from last month's IWC estimate but up 500,000 tonnes from last year's actual outturn.</p>

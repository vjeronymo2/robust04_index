			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (7): Denim maker shows way ahead - The government's aim is to establish integrated industrial sectors On a gentle rise overlooking the plain at Settat, south of Casablanca, stands an impeccable new factory producing half the denim needed by Morocco's clothing industry. The Spanish company Tavex, a leading European producer of denim cloth, built the Dollars 50m facility two years ago. The Moroccan branch now accounts for a third of the group's production. By 1996, under current plans, this proportion will have built up to almost half. With 260 employees, the venture does some direct export business - it has a contract with Wrangler of the US - but is essentially geared to the needs of the local clothing industry, which accounts for one in every four manufacturing jobs in Morocco and depends overwhelmingly on exports of finished products to the European market. For Mr Driss Jettou, the industry minister, who himself is a businessmen with textile interests, the venture illustrates one way in which Morocco can reduce its vulnerability in a highly cost-competitive industry. 'Before, we made jeans, importing the cloth. Now we make the material.' The factory, carrying out the whole process of spinning, dyeing, weaving and finishing, is an example of the government's aim of establishing increasingly integrated industrial sectors. Textiles and clothing, Morocco's biggest industrial sector in value after food and chemicals, is already suffering from competition from south-east Asia and other areas. Morocco currently has a significant advantage in wage costs compared to EU countries - a ratio of as much as one to five - but Mr Jettou says the government is conscious of the risk of counting too much on this differential. 'We want to avoid surprises,' he says. 'Basing our industrial development on a low price of labour cannot last long. Someone will always come up who can do it more cheaply.' His department is placing emphasis on training at all levels, quality and productivity, on integrating industrial activities, attracting higher-technology industries (with companies such as Alcatel and Thomson already installed) and exploiting Morocco's proximity to the European market to ensure quick reaction and delivery times which Asian producers would find difficult to match. Morocco's manufacturing sector accounts for about 18.5 per cent of gross domestic product, a proportion that has increased only gradually in recent years. The government has promised more support for the private industrial sector and a reduction in administrative red tape. It is counting on a boost from foreign investment and privatisation of state activities, ranging from machine tools to canneries. Mr Abdellatif Filali, the liberal-minded prime minister, said soon after his appointment this summer that the government must 'let the private sector play its role,' recognising that the state 'does not have the vision of a modern entrepreneur'. Many employers are nervous, however. Mr Abderrahmane Ouali, secretary-general of the CGEM business federation based in Casablanca, is worried that many Moroccan companies are too small to take on world competition under the conditions of April's Gatt agreement. Three out of four Moroccan manufacturers have fewer than 50 employees. Mr Ouali says he is counting on the establishment of a sectorial restructuring fund backed by the World Bank, and the availability of more funds for expansion as savings move from property into shares. Family groups are likely to open up increasingly to new shareholders, he says. The predominance of small companies has its advantages, according to Mr Jettou, insofar as they can adapt rapidly to changing conditions. 'But that does not mean we are not seeking the development of companies of European or international dimensions.' This implies encouraging companies to regroup. Industrial investment from abroad has risen sharply this year, Mr Jettou says, reaching some Dollars 200m by the end of August, led by France, Spain and Italy. Overall foreign investment in Morocco totalled Dollars 600m last year, compared with less than Dollars 100m five years ago, and senior government planners say a target of Dollars 1bn a year by the year 2000 is 'not dreaming'. France, which has kept its place as main investor as well as the main provider of bilateral aid, has tripled its level of investments since 1988. Investments from Spain have multiplied 20-fold in the same period, and are now not far behind those of France. Among the latest ventures, Indo, a Spanish spectacle and lens maker, is setting up two new plants in the Tangier industrial zone, employing about 100 people. The government has meanwhile reached agreement with Fiat of Italy on production of a 'people's car' in Morocco. In a depressed new car market - distorted by the popularity of second-hand imports - the idea is to produce a car within the reach of the middle-ranking office worker, and at the same time boost the components and spares sector. According to Mr Jettou, it should cost about Dollars 6,500 compared with a minimum of about Dollars 10,000 for cars currently assembled in Morocco. The Italian group, already present through the Somaca assembly facility in Casablanca, won the deal against Renault, Peugeot and Citroen, which all currently have cars assembled in Morocco. The project will start next year with the existing Uno model but a new model is planned from 1996. Under the agreement, half the components will be locally made. But Mr Jettou has no chauvinistic illusions. 'It will be an Italian car,' he says.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO JULY (IN MILLIONS OF DIRHAMS)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Direct investment Jan-July 93                             1,283 Direct investment Jan-July 94                             1,496 Change                                                    +16.6% Portfolio investment Jan-July 93                            136 Portfolio investment Jan-July 94                            549 Change                                                   +303.9% Total Jan-July 93                                         1,937 Total Jan-July 94                                         2,288 Change                                                    +18.1%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finance Ministry  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

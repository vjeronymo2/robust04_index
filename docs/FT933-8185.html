			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Toys 'R' Us ahead SALES at Toys 'R' Us, the US toy retailer, grew by 5.4 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars 1.3bn, despite a fall in sales inside the US due to a lack of big-selling new products. Net earnings rose by 8.5 per cent to Dollars 35.5m, or 12 cents a share, from Dollars 32.7m, or 11 cents, a year earlier, reflecting a switch in sales towards higher-margin products and better control of inventory, said Mr Charles Lazarus, chairman and chief executive. The improvement in margins should be sustained in the second half as sales of computer game software pick up, said Ms Dorothy Lakner, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York. First-half net earnings of Dollars 70.9m, or 24 cents a share, were up from Dollars 61m, or 21 cents, in 1992. Sales rose by 7.5 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn.</p>

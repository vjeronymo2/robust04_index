			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Miyuki Sasaki] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  1. Foreword </H5>   In recent years, the dissemination of CAD systems in design  sites is remarkable. However, many hand-drawn sketches still  remain in design sites. Therefore there is a need for input and  editing of hand-drawn sketches.    The image vector integrated image editing system  VECTIMATM is a system developed to satisfy this type  of need and it is characterized by performing image editing and  CAD data editing at the same time without changing the screen.    Here, the operating method is introduced with an emphasis on  the user and machine interface of the VECTIMATM.  <H5>  2. Outline of the VECTIMATM System </H5>   VECTIMATM operates on the engineering workstation  AS4000 series of this company and is a system which can edit and  display image data and vector data at the same time. This system  is composed of drawing input, drawing editing, drawing output,  and external interface sections, as broadly classified. Each of  those functions is executed from a window.    Figure 1 shows the functional structure of the  VECTIMATM.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-09A>      Figure 1. Functional configuration of VECTIMATM. </FIG>   It is composed of drawing input, drawing  editing, drawing output, and external interface.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Scanner, 2.

RVC operation </H5>   The RVC function in the VECTIMATM uses the  dialogue type from past experience. This function automatically  vectorizes the designated zones and can perform vectorization  without waste by performing restorative processing of incorrect  spots due to paper quality at human discretion. Figure 2 shows  the flow of the RVC processing function.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-10A>      Figure 2. Flow of RVC function. </FIG>   This is in the order of parameter setting, zone designation, batch  processing-confirmatory registration, or dialogue processing,  zone designation completion, and vector restoration successively.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Parameter setting, 2. Zone designation, 3. Batch  processing, 4. Dialogue processing, 5. Confirmatory  registration, 6. Zone designation completion, 7. Vector  restoration.&lt;/graphic&gt;     RVC processing consists of parameter setting, initial  processing, batch conversion processing, dialogue designation  processing, registration processing, RVC zone release  processing, and vector restorative processing. An outline of  each of those functions is shown below.  <H5>  3.1 Parameter setting </H5>   This is the function to determine parameter values in zone  designation-conversion processing inside the designated zone  before performing zone designation and conversion processing.    The two types of parameters are preprocessing and detection  processing and both influence each process. Also, by filing the  parameters, it is possible to retain the parameters of each  drawing. The default values are executed when preprocessing is  executed without setting parameters.    Figure 3 shows the setting of parameters within the system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-10B>          Figure 3. Parameters set by RVC function. </FIG>   The parameter values are set for preprocessing and detection processing and  are useful for preparing the parameter files.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1.

Operation   <H5>  3.2 Zone designation processing </H5>   This function performs preprocessing for the designated  short  form zone. The preprocessing for vectorization executes the run  image conversion function, connected diagram detection function,  line-thinning processing function, contour dashed line  approximation function, and fine line dashed line approximation  function, however, these are batched and executed inside the  computer where the user cannot see.    The user designates the short form zone by locating two  points (designation of arbitrary points in the diagram) and the  red frame indicates the designated area. The processing area can  have several designations, a maximum of four places and layering  is also possible. Also, the entire drawing can be made the  designated zone.    Figure 4 shows the zone designation drawing.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-11A>      Figure 4. Setting range. </FIG>   The processing area can have up to four points designated, layering is also possible.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Drawing, 2. Zone&lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  3.3 Batch conversion processing </H5>   This function performs the detection of circles, line  segments, broken lines, and lines of text in a batch and  prepares the diagram data for the zone designated with  preprocessing.    3.3.1 Detection processing. The user locates which zone  designed with the initial processing is the subject and  designates the detection of any or all circles, line segments  and broken lines, or lines of text inside the located zone.    3.3.2 Registration processing. The data extracted by  detection processing is displayed in order on the screen; the  data detected unnecessarily is eliminated and finally it is  batched and registration is performed. Figure 5 shows the  registration screen.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-11B>      Figure 5. Window for vector data registration. </FIG>   Vector data registration is performed with the ``next site,'' ``delete,''  ``previous site,'' ``batch registration,'' and ``complete''  buttons.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Vector registration, 2. Next site, 3. Delete, 4.  Previous site, 5. Batch registration, 6. Complete, 7. Element:  circle, 8. Current position.&lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  3.4 Dialogue designation processing </H5>   This is the function which performs the detection of  circles,  arcs, line segments, and lines of text by locating the images  and their periphery which the user wants to detect inside the  zone designated in preprocessing.    During the detection of circles, arcs, and line segments,  each of the images is designated. During the detection of lines  of text, the periphery of the text image is designated.  <H5>  3.5 Zone Completion </H5>   The designated zone is released.  <H5>  3.6 Vector restoration </H5>   Since the vector data prepared as the result of RVC  processing is faithfully converted in the image, distortion  appears in many cases. Therefore, various vector restoration  functions are provided in VECTIMATM. Figure 6 shows  an example of restoration.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-11C>      Figure 6. Plastic vector data. </FIG>   This shows the results of the restoration operation for the incorrect vectors detected  with RVC processing.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: (a) Element arrangement, (b) Line segment  conversion, (c) Circle conversion, (d) Line segment  horizontal/vertical&lt;/graphic&gt;     A number of these are introduced here.    (1) Element arrangement: The designated diagram is arranged  in a standard diagram.    (2) Line segment conversion: Several line segments and  broken  lines are made a single line segment.    (3) Circle conversion: Several arcs are made one circle.    (4) Line segment horizontal/vertical: Line segments are  corrected to the horizontal or vertical.  <H5>  4. On-screen tablet operation </H5>   Prior CAD systems usually had the system where a menu sheet  was affixed to the tablet board and commands were selected.  However, this system resulted in wasteful human motions.    Therefore, VECTIMATM has a command menu which the  user can arbitrarily prepare called the on-screen tablet  displayed on the screen and selection by the mouse is possible.    Frequently used commands and macros may be collected on a  single menu and put in an easily used form.    Figure 7 shows an example of the on-screen tablet.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-12A>      Figure 7. Example of on-screen tablet. </FIG>   An easily used MMI is provided with the on-screen tablet which the user can  arbitrarily establish.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. File, 2. Cover, 3. Point-line, 4.

Trace.&lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>   The MMI introduced here was developed using the SunOS window  system (SunOS is a trademark of the US Sun Microsystems  Company). In the future, Open Look and Motif (Open Look is the  GUI advocated by UNIX International and Motif is the GUI  advocated by the Open Software Federation (OSF)) will be  examined for a graphical user interface and then the human  interface with the user will be strengthened.

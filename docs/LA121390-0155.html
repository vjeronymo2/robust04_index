			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BITTER PILL;  </P> <P> FOREIGN-BORN, FOREIGN-TRAINED LATINO DOCTORS FRUSTRATED BY BARRIERS TO  PRACTICING MEDICINE HERE  </P> <P> What if you're Rigoberto Flores Garcia from Puebla, Mexico, and you have dreams  of nice homes and new cars?  </P> <P> You come across the border into Southern California with $500 in your pocket  and start a succession of low-paying jobs. First you scrub pots and pans at a  Carl's Jr. in Los Angeles. Then you try waiting tables at a Mexican restaurant.  You switch to flipping burgers for a living. Finally you lose that job.  </P> <P> Typical immigrant pipe dream gone sour? Well, this 34-year-old newcomer happens  to be Doctor Flores, a licensed Mexican physician who once delivered 12 babies  in one night.  </P> <P> "It was my dream and my mother's dream that I become a physician," Flores said.  "I didn't know it would be this difficult, or this expensive."  </P> <P> Flores and hundreds of other highly educated Latinos living here -- some  without legal immigration status -- are finding themselves in economic limbo  after spending years earning medical degrees. They left Mexico or other Central  American countries fed up with their governments' chaotic economies and low  wages, and now they find themselves among Southern California's unemployed or  underemployed because they lack the language skills and the money to take  courses and exams necessary to obtain licensing here.  </P> <P> "My God, we keep hearing about the lack of Latino doctors in this country for  our Spanish-speaking communities and here Flores was washing dishes for a  living," said Enrique Zuniga, a bilingual counselor at Fullerton College.  </P> <P> Zuniga and counselors from other Southern California colleges are trying to  create inexpensive English courses for Latino doctors that concentrate on  medical terminology.  </P> <P> He also helped organize a group called the Consortium of Physicians from Latin  American, which now includes more than 35 doctors from Los Angeles and Orange  counties. The group hopes to help raise scholarship money for foreign doctors,  and help with post-graduate programs.  </P> <P> "We need any kind of help right now," Zuniga said. "Money or leads for jobs  that some of the doctors can get, such as health assistants, to keep them from  abandoning their plans."  </P> <P> Jorge Lopez Espana, 33, graduated from the medical school at the University de  San Carlos in Guatemala, where he was ranked 86th out of 500 students. At the  Hospital at San Juan de Dios near Guatemala City, he performed appendectomies,  removed bullets, delivered babies, and conducted autopsies.  </P> <P> Today, he is a health educator handing out brochures and conducting AIDS  awareness seminars at a Latino community center in Santa Ana. He's one of the  fortunate -- he has a job in a health-related field.  </P> <P> Alfonso Sandoval, 33, who practiced two years after graduating from the medical  school at the University of Morelia in southern Mexico, is now driving a  vegetable truck for an Anaheim company.  </P> <P> The problem is that foreign-trained doctors must climb through a maze of state  Medical Board restrictions that can take three to five years, and sometimes  longer, to complete and can cost thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> In addition, these doctors, who must support themselves and their families, are  finding the transition from Third World economy to Southern California's  full-throttle materialism very tough.  </P> <P> For example, Sandoval earns $7.50 an hour driving a truck. His wife, Carolina,  who was a third-year medical student in Morelia when they met, later became a  physician and worked for a company specializing in medical examinations. She  now works in an Anaheim assembly plant making aircraft parts for $6 an hour.  </P> <P> "Our biggest problem right now is keeping ourselves motivated and learning  English so that we can fill out the applications for the medical exams and  become licensed physicians here," Alfonso Sandoval said.  </P> <P> The couple said they took university English courses in Mexico to help prepare  for the United States, "but the reality of it is, you don't learn everything  from books. Our English courses were quite different from how English is spoken  here," said Carolina.  </P> <P> "We had no idea it was going to be this tough to live here," she added.  </P> <P> Rolando Castillo, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the medical  school at UC Irvine, said many of the medical newcomers come unprepared.  </P> <P> "They arrive in Southern California with absolutely no orientation about what  to expect or what they should do," he said.  </P> <P> Castillo charged that the medical establishment, by making the licensing  procedure for foreign doctors so long and difficult and expensive (preparatory  courses can cost as much as $5,000) is trying to keep newcomers out because  they fear the competition.  </P> <P> "We have a very closed system for doctors in this country," Castillo said.  </P> <P> However, officials from the Medical Board of California (formerly the state  Board of Medical Quality Assurance) disagreed. They contended the board does  not discriminate, and noted that about one-fourth of the licenses issued last  year went to foreign-trained doctors. About 25% of the state's 69,000 licensed  physicians are foreign-trained, they said.  </P> <P> "We have licensed thousands of foreign medical graduates over the years," said  Linda McReady, a board spokeswoman. "We look not at languages or where they're  from, but the medical training they got, and we have doctors from all over the  world working in California."  </P> <P> In 1987, an unsuccessful lawsuit was filed on behalf of Vietnam-trained doctors  who could not prove they had graduated from the University of Saigon medical  school after the city fell to the communists in April, 1975. The suit was filed  by Julianne D'Angelo, supervising attorney for University of San Diego's Center  for Public Interest Law.  </P> <P> "These people escaped and had no diplomas. They had to take certain courses to  qualify to become a doctor in this state, but the board didn't allow them  (because they had no diploma)," said Marcia Gilchrist, a spokeswoman for state  Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim). Royce sponsored successful legislation that  created a task force of former Vietnamese medical school faculty members that  eventually helped the Vietnamese doctors gain U.S. licenses.  </P> <P> D'Angelo claimed the board's behavior in the Vietnamese issue is indicative of  its attitude toward all foreign medical graduates -- a criticism that was  denied by Terresa Ciau, chief of licensing for the Board's Division of  Licensing.  </P> <P> "Are we fair?" said Ciau, who accepted her Board position after the 1987  lawsuit. "I think so. Our image hasn't been what it should be but we're working  on it.  </P> <P> "Since I've been here, we've been trying to be more service-oriented," Ciau  said. "You do hear discrimination complaints but we're working towards a  consistent procedure. Basically everyone has to meet the same licensing  requirements. That's the bottom line."  </P> <P> The board follows stringent guidelines, Ciau said, because its purpose is to  protect the consumer.  </P> <P> "Would you allow these people to operate on your relatives or your loved ones  without first seeing proof they were adequately trained?" she said.  </P> <P> There is no worldwide accreditation organization that monitors foreign medical  schools, although the state medical board's staff members have conducted some  on-site inspections at schools in Great Britain, the Philippines and in Mexico,  Ciau said.  </P> <P> However, the medical schools inspected in Mexico, at Mexico City and in  Guadalajara are private institutions filled with mostly students from the  United States. Few of Mexico's public medical schools have undergone any  similar inspections, she said.  </P> <P> The board did once rely on a World Health Organization listing of medical  schools until a scandal erupted in 1983 when hundreds of would-be physicians  were caught cheating on basic qualifying exams by purchasing questions or whole  tests in a thriving illegal marketplace. Hundreds more were graduates of  certain for-profit schools, located mostly in the Caribbean, that at best were  providing second-rate educations, and at worst, were little more than diploma  mills.  </P> <P> The legacy, said many Spanish-speaking foreign-born doctors, is that they are  forced to meet the letter of the law that they claim is in contrast to more  relaxed standards for graduates of U.S. medical schools.  </P> <P> Said Robert J. Moser, assistant director for Refugee and Immigrant Services of  Catholic Charities in San Diego: "If you're practicing medicine and saving  lives in one country it doesn't mean your education was inferior."  </P> <P> For Rigoberto Flores, who was already licensed in Mexico, the long trek is just  beginning.  </P> <P> As a general practitioner for Seguro Social, one of Mexico's largest private  health providers, Flores said that three years ago he was earning $254,000  pesos a month, or roughly $90.  </P> <P> "I was working at a health clinic in Queretaro where I was seeing 45 patients a  day. I remember that on one night alone, I delivered 12 babies. I would come  home exhausted," Flores said.  </P> <P> It was then that he heard from friends who had visited the United States who  told him, "that if you work hard here, you can get a good job, a nice car and  buy a home within one year."  </P> <P> His years of schooling worked against him while he was in Los Angeles. "I was  not street-wise. In Puebla, I always had my nose in a book and really didn't  know the ways of the street."  </P> <P> He would lend money to roommates who wouldn't pay him back. Then, with little  mechanical knowledge, he bought his first car, a 1976 Buick, from another  Latino. It cost $1,000. It ran for two months, then broke down.  </P> <P> He has since moved to Fullerton and found another job as a cook, but recently  was terminated. He is living off his partial savings, which help pay for a  nursing course he is taking in Santa Ana. During the days, he attends adult  English classes.  </P> <P> After three years in California, the dream is beginning to dim.  </P> <P> "I like it here. When I work as a cook, I still make more money than I made as  a doctor (in Mexico). But it's very difficult to communicate. If I don't make  it into nursing, I have to leave and go back home," he said.  </P> <P> "It's funny, because in my letters to my mother, I never mention how hard  living here is."  </P></p>

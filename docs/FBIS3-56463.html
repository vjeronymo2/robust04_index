"Some time ago I told both Boris Yeltsin and Viktor  Chernomyrdin: `Remove Gaydar, Chubays, Fedorov and Kozyrev and  you'll have a perfect government,'" Zhirinovskiy emphasized.    In his view, Gaydar "must be replaced by a normal  industrialist." Zhirinovskiy made it plain that his  parliamentary group was "prepared to endorse any government the  president wants but I am saying on behalf of my group: `Boris  Nikolayevich, I implore you to accept Gaydar's resignation.'"</p>

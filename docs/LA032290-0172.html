			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BRENTWOOD;  </P> <P> MOUNTAINGATE PLAN REJECTED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council denied a developer's request to add 165 new homes  to the Mountaingate development near Sepulveda Pass.  </P> <P> The 15-0 vote Tuesday came after Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the  area, said that the threat of methane gas from a nearby landfill has not been  ruled out.  </P> <P> H. R. Stoke, a representative of the developer, Barclay-Hollander-Curci  Inc./Oceanic Calif. Inc., asked for six months to gather more information about  the state of the landfill, which was closed in 1982.  </P> <P> "There is nothing in the file in this matter that indicates the safety of the  canyon is in doubt," he said.  </P> <P> But the City Council went along with the recommendation of Braude, the Planning  Commission and residents' groups, which urged that the developer be required to  come back with a new proposal.  </P> <P> "At this point no one is certain how to close a landfill safely," Braude said.  </P></p>

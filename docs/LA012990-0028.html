			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> GUITARIST STEPAN RAK IN PYROTECHNIC LOCAL DEBUT  </P> <P> Stepan Rak is a nonpareil. The Czech guitarist is an artist and entertainer, a  master of coffee-house schmaltz and acerbic fantasies, and possessor of an  advanced, utterly idiosyncratic technical apparatus that redefines virtuosity  on the instrument.  </P> <P> He made his West Coast recital debut Saturday night at Freeman Chapel of  Pasadena Presbyterian Church, courtesy of the enterprising California Harp,  Lute and Guitar Assn. He brought an almost unimaginably difficult program of  his own compositions and arrangements, and might be playing still, seemingly  fresher than ever, if the management hadn't raised the house lights on him  nearly 2 1/2 hours after he began.  </P> <P> Rak began with the anonymous Romanza dear to all intermediate students, which  he quickly turned on its head, recomposed and sent fluttering on its way in  double tremolo. That set the tone for the evening, which was filled with all  manner of sentimental musical portraits and stories, given the most imaginative  technical expression.  </P> <P> Trills and tremolos on two strings, lightning runs in all registers, explosive  rasqueado and percussion effects, and the widest timbral variety of harmonics  filled Rak's bag of tricks, which he emptied out in almost every piece. All  dazzled, but the strongest musically were the vehement, pseudo-folkloric  "Sonata Mongoliana" and "Twighlight," a nicely shaped and relatively  understated nocturne given its world premiere.  </P> <P> Rak plays to his audience unabashedly. He introduced the numbers, telling  stories in a soft, accented voice. He crooned along on one chorus of his  "Balalaika," and stomped through "The Era of Rock'N Roll," a witty,  free-wheeling, knowledgeable and affectionate parody complete with percussion  solo.  </P> <P> Six other numbers completed the printed agenda, from the long musical soap  opera "The Last Disco" to the Five Early Dances, Renaissance redux at warp  speed. The basic language is thoroughly tonal, spiked with wild tremolo  glissandos and angular chromatic punctuation -- Villa-Lobos squared.  </P> <P> Two encores -- a Rumanian dance that began as a left-hand stunt and ended in  whirling blur, and an exuberantly kitschy improvisation on "My Bonnie Lies Over  the Ocean" -- ended the evening.JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

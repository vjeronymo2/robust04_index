			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Japan's Public Broadcaster Looks Abroad: Following the lead of Japan's giant  electronics companies, publicly funded Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) will buy  and finance more programs made overseas, said Keiji Shima, the network's  chairman.  </P> <P> NHK, which operates a host of television and radio networks, has set up a  company to produce and buy shows overseas to expand its programming, Shima told  reporters. He criticized Japanese-made programs, saying their generally poor  quality, compared to those produced in Hollywood, compelled the move overseas.  Separately, Shima said he wants to create a global news network to counter the  spread of Cable News Network to dozens of countries. Atlanta-based Turner  Broadcasting System Inc., owns and operates CNN.  </P></p>

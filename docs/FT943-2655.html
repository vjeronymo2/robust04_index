			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Books: More than simple stories - Fiction THE CROSSING by Cormac McCarthy Picador Pounds 14.99, 426 pages RUSHING TO PARADISE JG Ballard Flamingo Pounds 14.99, 239 pages EVERYTHING AND MORE Geoff Nicholson Gollancz Pounds 15.99, 251 pages Categorising Cormac McCarthy as a writer of westerns is like calling Herman Melville a writer of fishing stories. A dark poetic evocation of the American West, The Crossing is the second volume of McCarthy's The Border Trilogy. Set in New Mexico and northern Mexico, it moves on from his previous book, All the Pretty Horses, to the years leading up to, and including, the second world war. Juxtaposing an older world of outlaws, vaqueros and Indians with one dominated by cars and aeroplanes, The Crossing investigates the loss of innocence and the relationship between history and narrative. For teenager Billy Parham, crossing the border into Mexico is to journey into unknown territory. Impulsive yet impassive, Billy begins his initial sojourn in the middle of the night, pursuing a wolf that has attacked local cattle. lntending to accompany the animal to the Mexican mountains, it is a year and a lifetime before Billy returns to New Mexico. He arrives to find his family have been murdered and their horses stolen. Only Boyd, his younger brother, survives. Here everyone - Indians, revolutionaries, bandits and gypsies - has a story. Some are true, but most are fiction. As Billy is told, 'things separate from their story have no meaning.' It would be equally misleading to describe JG Ballard as simply a science fiction writer. More concerned with the imagination than science, Ballard's writing can be mesmerising and poetic. He is sometimes almost perversely radical but he can also be oddly primitive. A return to form, though a long way from Ballard's best work, such as High Rise and Crash, Rushing to Paradise focuses on campaigner Dr Barbara Rafferty and her attempt to save an albatross population threatened by the construction of an airstrip on a small French Pacific island. Eventually Rafferty, appalled by the commerciality of the venture, severs links with the outside world, and declares the island a sanctuary for women: 'The biggest problem the world faces is not that there are too few whales or pandas, but too many men . . .' In this fiction, men are victims rather than oppressors. Packaged within a voyeuristic narrative, Ballard's sexual paranoia makes Rushing to Paradise compulsive reading. The work of British writer Geoff Nicholson could be categorised as speculative satire. Locating cultural fault-lines, Everything and More - the slogan of Hadon Brothers department store - examines the relationship between work, consumerism and terrorism and takes place in a gargantuan building with a surreal facade, secret rooms and hidden passages. With its non unionised staff intent on sabotage, loyal employee, Vita Carlisle holds her reclusive and randy employer, Arnold, hostage. Meanwhile, protagonist Charlie Mayhew, reluctantly working as a furniture porter, searches for an art form and finds signification in objects and linguistic tics, such as the term menswear: 'Did it mean 'men's ware', as in hardware, or was it a portmanteau word telling the public that men in those areas were given to bad language?' When an author appears on the wrong day for a booksigning, the staff ask questions worthy of post-modern deconstructionists. Influenced by the literary extravagances of Huysman and George Perec, Everything and More might, in comparison, be lightweight, but it is subversive enough to parody its voyeuristic tendencies. Combining speculation and accusation, Nicholson, no less than McCarthy and Ballard, delights in defying categories.</p>

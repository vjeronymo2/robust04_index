			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa appealed to Sinhalese militants and  Tamil rebels to negotiate an end to six years of ethnic violence and said  Indian troops will be sent home. Premadasa, in a speech broadcast over  state-run radio, promised to scrap the controversial India-Sri Lanka peace  accord in which 40,000 Indian soldiers have been sent to the island nation to  put down the rebellion by Tamil separatists. Premadasa also offered radicals  seats in Parliament and promised to do away with strict anti-terrorism laws.  There was no immediate comment from either the Tamil rebels or the Sinhalese  militants.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Froilan Arencibia] </F>   [Text] Doha, 6 Jun (PL) -- At the end of a 40-hour official  visit to this capital city today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina said in a news conference: "I am not speaking of ideas  only, but specific economic plans as well."    Robaina said that Qatar is a very special country because,  despite the pressure applied on Cuba and countries that have  relations with Cuba, Qatar decided to establish diplomatic  relations with the island, relations that led to the  establishment of a Cuban Embassy there. "It takes courage to do  something like this, and Qatar is brave," Robaina said.    He reported that during his stay here negotiations were held  on cooperation in the fields of health, sports, and biomedicine,  and new methods were discussed to expand bilateral cooperation.    Official talks were held in the evening between the Cuban  delegation and Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim  Bin-Jabir Al Thani, during which the friendly ties between the  two countries and willingness to strengthen these ties were  affirmed.    In addition, on Monday Robaina inaugurated the Cuban Embassy  in Doha, where diplomatic relations with neighboring Oman will  also be handled.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok] </F>   [Excerpts] The prime minister's bureau has recently been  emptying of its senior officials, and the prime minister is not  taking care to fill the ranks. The last person to leave was  Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser.    Several days ago Neriya advised Rabin of his intention to  leave the bureau. He will join the new secretary general of the  Histadrut labor federation, Hayim Ramon, and will head the  Histadrut International Affairs Department. [passage omitted]    Neriya's resignation was the last in a series of  resignations  from Rabin's bureau over the past several weeks. Hayim Asa, who  was slated to head the national security team at the Prime  Minister's Office, was recently forced to resign. Asa charged  that Shim'on Sheves, Prime Minister's Office director general,  and Eytan Haber, head of Rabin's bureau, the two most senior  aides to Rabin, were to blame for his resignation. According to  Asa, the two are preventing other bureau employees, including  very senior ones, from having access to and contacts with Rabin,  thus harming the bureau's proper working procedures. The  officials who left Rabin's bureau over the past six weeks are:  Cabinet Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein; Gad Ben-Ari, the prime  minister's media adviser; Attorney Nira Poran, adviser on  information and public affairs; and Colonel 'Amos Gil'ad, the  prime minister's army affairs adviser.    Despite this mass desertion in a relatively short period of  time, none of the evacuated posts has been permanently manned --  although the posts are most important and some are very  sensitive, and despite the fact that candidates who are  considered to have particularly good backgrounds and potential  offered themselves for all of the posts.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 13 June  reports that "Shim'on Sheves, the director general of the Prime  Minister's Office, denied that Jacques Neriya, the prime  minister's political adviser intends to resign from his post.  Sheves confirmed that Hayim Ramon had offered Neriya a senior  position in the Histadrut labor federation several weeks ago;  however, Neriya had not given Ramon a positive answer. In an  interview with Qol Yisra'el, Sheves denied that advisers were  resigning from the prime minister's bureau en masse, and said  that everyone leaving was had viable and different reasons."]</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KASEM AND HOMELESS  </P> <P> I read in the Oct. 1 Hot Property column that homeless activist Casey Kasem and  his wife, Jean, purchased a home in the Holmby Hills for $6.8 million.  </P> <P> Naturally, a $6.8-million residence is a minimum necessity and quite normal,  especially with all the homelessness and poverty the Kasems and others whine  about.  </P> <P> Kasem could go down as the greatest humanitarian in U.S. history by making the  supreme sacrifice: selling the $6.8-million place and buying one valued at a  mere $1 million. Then Kasem could take the $5.8-savings and make a cash  contribution to each and every homeless person in Southern California.  </P> <P> With this, the homeless could rent apartments or houses, and get off the  streets. Then, with a place of their own, they could go out and look for and  obtain employment. (There are plenty of available jobs.)  </P> <P> I believe, Kasem knows that even if he were to undertake this magnanimous  philanthropy, homelessness would still be with us, as it has been throughout  history.  </P> <P> Many of the homeless are mentally ill and are in need of institutionalization.  Others, enjoy the freedom and irresponsibility of being homeless. They'd all  take the money, and there would still be homelessness.  </P> <P> Then, what would happen to this "cause"? Obviously, Kasem is not cut from the  same cloth as New Orleans millionaire Pat Taylor, who was recently profiled on  "60 Minutes." Taylor is single-handedly offering to pay full college tuition to  any New Orleans school child who stays in school, gets Bs and stays out of  trouble with the law. Pat Taylor puts his money where his mouth is. Casey Kasem  merely fills America with insincere liberal rhetoric.  </P> <P> JERRY HERMES  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

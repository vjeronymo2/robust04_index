			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Gardening: Wild and wet November reveals its glories - Robin Lane Fox has been picking all the flowers he can lay his hands on THE MOON has been scudding wildly above the spires of Oxford; everything is once more remarkable and received wisdom is being turned upside down by its light. In mid-November gardeners are supposed to be losing heart. If you believe what you read, you should be returning to gloom, cutting down the borders and wondering how to aerate the lawn. Nobody has a kind word for the season until it is time to write about catalogues. This year, however, the school of garden gloom has got it all wrong. Naturally, FT readers do not believe all they read: go out there and check it, take the scissors and look carefully. Gloom is not the word for it. The past fortnight has been wonderfully mild and wet, providing us with pleasure which I last remember on such a scale in 1976. Spring-flowering plants, late flowering climbers and shrubs which ought to know better are opening their buds and still showing colour. The primroses are enjoying a postscript; violas are ignoring the calendar; many of the roses have new buds long after the season. According to the books, the only certain flowers for every gardener in November are universal pansies. Pansies may be creeping up on us, but these late encores in a garden are an opportunity. Wherever you see flowers or colour, cut them and bring them indoors. Inhibitions are irrelevant. During the high summer, I pick flowers with restraint, absurdly anxious that I will leave a noticeable gap if I take too much from the main plantings. I hold back, tell myself to economise among profusion and never take an unopened bud. In November, the game is quite different. Flower-picking becomes like shoplifting when the windows hav been smashed and the government has fled. Whatever you leave behind, nature will soon take it instead, sending frost or a storm to ruin it. For some weeks now, the weather has been as changeable as the high seas so nothing can be risked or left to its mercy. Whatever flowers appear end up inside the house: I have even been picking my best successes of this autumn, the pink schizostylis which open wonderfully if the stems are picked in bud. From the window, all may look ravaged, quite unlike the experience which I am reporting. Look closely, and you will be amazed what is lurking among the leaves. In less than an hour, I have picked some crazy mixtures of spring and autumn, pinks, blues, whites against a backing of the pearl-pink berries which are better than ever on the sorbus trees. In November, a ceanothus has no right to be covered in buds, but the last fortnight has brought my Trewithen Blue into yet another covering of flowers. This variety continues to grow furiously up an exposed south wall but these flowers are best taken indoors before November remembers its bad manner. I have been relishing the paradox of these blue flowers from spring among the first scented mahonias of winter, sprigs of the tireless winter Cherry and some faded buds from Rose New Dawn. Rosebuds are wonderfully suited to late picking because they will open fully in a warm room if picked with the faintest flush of colour. Indoors, heating does the work of summer: I find that my favourite apricot-yellow climber, Lady Hillingdon, is second to none for its late scattering of buds which can be brought on under shelter. At this late season, whoever would expect pinks and double primroses, spring-flowering viburnas, perennial wallflowers, clouds of the low-growing gypsophila or yellow potentilla in its herbaceous form called recta? The old-fashioned pinks have gone on strike, but the newer hybrids from the West Country are flowering on and on as if in answer to those who find their too formal or too bright. Pale peach flowers on the Cranmere Pool variety have lasted indoors for more than a week among great bunches of double lilac. The admirable small perahades have never stopped flowering in their charming shades of sky-blue and white. Their small evergreen bushes make a pleasant edging for low borders, although nobody seems to exploit their quality. With me, they have survived all frosts in the last five years Spring-flowering Viburnums in November are a supreme conceit, yet they are showing this year while their autumn relations are flowering madly in pepper-scented shades of pink and white. Heads of Viburnum carlesii smells even better in November among small bunches of musk roses, pink Selicia or the white Prosperity. As the air is so cold, the scents of these flowers are far stronger than in July. As backing, I have been using the clouds of tiny white daisies on the connoisseurs' favourite low-growing Aster, the one called laterifolius Prince the dark little leaves of which are notable throughout the summer. The connoisseurs' oldie among chrysanthemums has also come into its own. Pink flowered Emperor of China won a first class certificate as long ago as 1889, but nowadays critical gardeners may well wonder why. The leaves turn to a strong beetroot red, but the flowers are small and spidery and the bushes are thin and straggly, whatever the conservation plantspeople like to claim in their favour. At the last of this season's flower shows even the nurserymen could not show this old variety in any better shape. The answer is to pick it, not show it. Small vases of its pale pink flowers have the hazy delicacy of a Fantin Latour painting. Buy it for this purpose and put it out of the main sightline where you can ignore it until its mid-November picking. Indoors, these details show up and individuality can be loved. Outdoors, November's 'antis' do have a point. This year, the young wallflowers are almost all of a miserable size for bedding. Because the cold and wet weather hit them at just the wrong point in the summer. Accompanying flowerbulbs have now soared by 15 per cent in price to cope with the pound's collapse in Holland during this planting season. Spring bedding has never been so expensive, but late autumn budding has never been better. Adjust to November's encores, pick them without mercy and if it does not freeze all winter, we will need far fewer of those hyacinths at ever higher prices.</p>

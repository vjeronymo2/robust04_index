			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Make or break for the architects of Russia: Yeltsin wants the right constitution to come out of a meeting starting today RUSSIA BEGINS a constitutional convention today to hammer out a new democratic constitution that will determine not only if the country breaks with the Soviet past but also if it breaks up altogether. On the table is a draft constitution produced by President Boris Yeltsin which gives him sweeping powers, provides a clear executive role for the government and confines the legislature to handling legislation. It is designed to reverse the chaos generated by the old Soviet-era constitution, which made an unwieldy Congress of People's Deputies 'the supreme organ of state power' and enabled it to hinder the government's attempts to push through market reforms. 'The new draft makes clear who does what,' said Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister who took over as chief architect of economic reforms in December after the Congress dismissed Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister. Until now, the smaller, standing parliament has had the power to distribute state funds, the president has been issuing legislation, while the prime minister has not had enough power to run the government. The convention, attended by 700 representatives from around the country and from across the political spectrum, is to be tightly controlled by Mr Yeltsin's allies, who will head five working groups to iron out defects in the draft. With 1,500 amendments already submitted, Mr Yeltsin has ordered the convention to end in just 10 days, avoiding what he called the 'idle chatter' characterising the Congress, or full parliament. The latter, along with the standing parliament elected in the dying days of the Communist era, would be replaced under the new constitution by a western-style bicameral parliament, or Federal Assembly. The new constitution also abolishes the post of vice-president, conveniently removing the president's now most bitter opponent, Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi. While parliament yesterday demanded that its own draft proposal for a parliamentary rather than a presidential republic be merged with the presidential draft, Mr Yeltsin's young reformist allies see the main purpose of the meeting as freeing the presidential draft of its defects. Mr Andrei Makarov, a lawyer who has defended controversial cases including President Yeltsin's ban on the Communist party, says the draft's main failing is its lack of an effective system of checks and balances and of a clear mechanism for solving disputes between the executive, judiciary and legislative branches of power. The document is also heavily weighted in favour of the republics and autonomous territories which were set up by the Bolsheviks to give ethnic minorities a semblance of statehood, now being taken seriously by them. The present set-up would reserve half the seats of the upper house, or Council of Federation, for minorities representing just 18.5 per cent of the population. The draft has the merit of enshrining inalienable private property rights for the first time in Russian history. The short-term question is how the constitution will be enacted once the draft is finalised by the Convention. Strictly speaking, only parliament has the right, under the present constitution, to introduce a new one. But Mr Yeltsin is using his victory in the April 25 referendum as an excuse to bypass a parliament which has until now refused to abandon the old constitution for fear of being dissolved with it. New parliamentary elections are also due to be held to fill the new assembly foreseen by the constitution. Mr Yeltsin might opt for a referendum to adopt his own draft, or for the convening of a special Constituent Assembly whose only task would be to adopt the constitution. The really vital question, as both Mr Yeltsin's supporters and enemies agree, is whether he will endanger plans for Russia to become a genuine federal state in order to get Russia's 88 regions and republics to adopt the constitution. The convention is being boycotted by the 89th 'federation subject' - the autonomous republic of Chechnya, which has declared independence and where eight people were reported killed yesterday in fighting between supporters and opponents of the breakaway leader, General Dzokhar Dudayev. The leaders of the 22 republics are particularly keen to use the constitution as a bargaining chip to insist on more political power as well as control of tax revenues and export earnings, while the regions want to get any economic concessions granted to the republics. The federal treaty signed last year dividing up rights and responsibilities between federal and local authorities is enshrined in the presidential draft constitution. But the bargaining will centre on specific mechanisms on how that federal treaty is to be implemented. Tatarstan has already refused to sign the federation treaty and is getting a special treaty. Others like Bashkortostan and Yakutia want to collect all taxes and then pass on some to the centre, as opposed to a system whereby the federal authorities would levy their own taxes side by side with local authorities. Some even want to have their own central banks. Such centrifugal tendencies, if allowed to get out of hand, will not only harm efforts to build a market economy, but could ultimately lead to a Soviet-style collapse of Russia.</p>

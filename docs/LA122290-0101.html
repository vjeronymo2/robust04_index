			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAIR BOARD TURNS DOWN BID FOR HARNESS MEETING  </P> <P> The board of directors of the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. has turned down a  bid for a harness racing meeting next spring and summer at Fairplex Park in  Pomona.  </P> <P> Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los Alamitos, sought to lease  dates at the Pomona facility from April 26 to Aug. 17 to create a virtual  year-round Southern California standardbred circuit between Los Alamitos  meetings from February to April and August to November.  </P> <P> The California Horse Racing Board approved Arnold's request Nov. 3, reversing  an earlier stand, but limited any agreement to one year.  </P> <P> "The CHRB sent a signal that Pomona would be used as an interim facility  between now and the time a new facility in Riverside would be built," Ralph  Hinds, president of the Los Angeles County Fair Assn., said Friday. "It was not  a long-range plan. Originally, we had talked about a long-range plan with Mr.  Arnold involving a three-year lease and two three-year options.  </P> <P> "We spoke out clearly at the CHRB meeting that we were not interested in a  short-term program, and the decision should not come as a surprise. We are  already involved in a successful long-range thoroughbred training program  (involving about 700 horses)."  </P></p>

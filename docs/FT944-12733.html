			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Argentaria profit edges higher Consolidated earnings at Argentaria, the majority state-controlled Spanish banking group, edged up by 2.1 per cent before tax in the first nine months of the year to Pta84.77bn (Dollars 684m). Net profit, excluding minority interests, showed a stronger rise of 8.8 per cent to Pta57.72bn. The results came after a 19 per cent increase in loan recoveries to Pta31.69bn and a 46 per cent reduction in provisions for loan losses and country risk to Pta35.5bn. This was offset by sharply lower earnings from securities, which fell by 88 per cent to Pta3.33bn from Pta23.54bn. Operating income for the nine months improved by 10.5 per cent to Pta101.67bn. The group, in which the government stake is due to be reduced to a minority through a further share offering next year, said this reflected a 'satisfactory' performance. The next privatisation tranche, originally expected this year, has been put back because of the weak stock market trend, and is now not expected before the spring. Argentaria's total assets at the end of September stood at Pta11,100bn, 7 per cent higher than a year earlier.</p>

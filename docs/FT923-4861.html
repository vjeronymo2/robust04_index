			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Bombings mark split in Kenyan opposition A BOMB exploded in Nairobi yesterday outside the venue for an opposition delegates' congress, raising fears of an eruption in violence between tribally based rival factions of Kenya's main opposition party. Police fired teargas at the venue as clashes between stone-throwing rivals injured several supporters. Police also removed an unexploded bomb from outside the house of Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, leader of one of the feuding factions, hours before the registration of delegates for the congress of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) which will pick a presidential candidate. Observers believe the stage is now set for a possibly violent showdown today between the two factions within the party. This would further erode the credibility of FORD ahead of the country's first multi-party elections in 26 years, expected next month. The debilitating division in FORD has considerably boosted the electoral chances of President Daniel arap Moi, 68, who last year was under intense pressure to move towards political pluralism, clean up his human rights record and resuscitate an economy awash with corruption and mismanagement. Western donors and the International Monetary Fund last November suspended aid worth about Dollars 40m a month until Mr Moi, who has ruled Kenya for 14 years, addressed these concerns. In recent months FORD, which earlier this year was riding a crest of popular euphoria, has almost collapsed in a power struggle fuelled by ethnic conflict and personality differences. Two wings have emerged, one led by Mr Odinga, who is a Luo, and which is supported by many young professionals who fought for an end to the one-party system. The other wing is led by Mr Kenneth Matiba and Mr Martin Shikuku. Mr Matiba is from the dominant Kikuyu tribe and Mr Shikuku claims to speak for the Luhya tribe, Kenya's third largest. Both groups are playing the tribal card, which remains the single most important political factor in Kenya. Party elections last month to choose delegates to the conference were chaotic. Several districts did not hold elections and there were widespread allegations of ballot rigging. The division, expected to be made formal today, has allowed Mr Moi to exploit the disintegration in FORD and to travel the country to press his campaign themes of stability, unity and development for Kenya in a troubled region. Western donors, with the exception of the US, have begun to look more favourably on Mr Moi's political position. The government has also made progress in tackling the three key economic issues raised by donors - curbing the budget deficit which last November, was heading for 6.7 per cent of GDP; restructuring of the large and inefficient public sector; and curbing gross corruption. An IMF mission will visit Kenya this month and is expected to approve government policies. This could pave the way for resumption of aid - which would boost Mr Moi's electoral chances.</p>

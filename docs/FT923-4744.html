			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Citicorp plays down leaked report CITICORP, the leading US bank, played down reports yesterday that federal bank examiners had been critical last month of the management and credit quality of its mortgage subsidiary, one of the biggest in the US with an estimated Dollars 24bn of assets. The criticism, contained in a document dated August 18 and leaked simultaneously to two US newspapers, accused Citicorp's mortgage operation of sloppy practices that caused excessive risk to the bank. According to extracts of the report that were published in the US yesterday, the examiner found serious issues warranting the attention of senior management 'in virtually all functional areas' and demanded plans for corrective action within 30 days. Citicorp's share price was affected by the reports yesterday, at first declining by 50 cents and then stabilising at Dollars 16 5/8 , down by Dollars  3/8 . The bank released a tersely worded statement yesterday morning, the bulk of which was devoted to a discussion of the relative legality of US news organisations receiving and publishing a federal bank examiner's report. The substantive portion of the Citicorp statement noted that 'if regulators were requiring us to take material new reserves or restatements, we would have to disclose that, and we have made no such disclosure'. The bank said that US mortgage problems 'are not new to our management' and added that these had been identified and disclosed, and were already being addressed. Citicorp also noted that in its 1991 annual report it had said its mortgage origination activities in the US were restructured and credit criteria for the US mortgage business 'were reformulated in order to improve the business's credit performance'. Citicorp said that for legal reasons it could not comment on 'the content of what is purported to be a working document of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency'. A measure of Citicorp's apparent anger at the reports was the bank's statement that if the two US newspapers actually held the federal documents 'possession and publication would be illegal.' The bank added that the report would in any case be 'already outdated as simply one of many working documents that typically apply to one of our periodic regulatory audits'. Citicorp said the information contained in such reports 'is designed to elicit responses from management and therefore may or may not be entirely accurate and may not include appropriate context for interpretation by others'.</p>

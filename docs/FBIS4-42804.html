			<p>BFN     [Text] Some 57 percent of Greeks do not believe that the  European Union [EU] operates democratically because of the  stance of some of our partners on the issue of Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. This came to  light because of a public opinion poll, which was released  today, and caused concern for the EU Commission. Correspondent  Nikos Bellos has the following report from Brussels:    [Begin Bellos recording] The stance maintained by some EU  members on the issue of Skopje has cause great dissatisfaction  in Greece. This dissatisfaction in practice translates into a  significant decrease in the number of Greeks who believe that  the EU operates democratically. The latest poll conducted in  the 12 EU member countries last April for the EU Commission was  made public today and caused concern and anxiety for EU  officials in Brussels.    The Greeks, who up until recently were the warmest  supporters  of the EU among European citizens, today appear to be  particularly reserved and suspicious. Specifically, in a  statement issued today the EU Commission admitted that the issue  of Skopje and the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina have negatively  influenced the Greek public's view toward the EU.    According to the poll, 57 percent of Greeks believe that the  EU does not operate in a democratic way. This represents an  increase of 22 percent in relation with the last poll in October  1993. Despite their bitterness, the majority of Greeks still  believe that the accession to the EU was particularly positive  for our country. Specifically, 69 percent believe that Greece  has benefited from its accession to the EU. Furthermore, 64  percent believe that Greece's participation in the EU is a good  thing. In comparison with the poll taken last October, there is  also a decrease in positive answers by 10 and 9 percent  respectively.    Regarding the 12 June elections for the European Parliament,  the country's domestic political and economic situation will  play a decisive role in the choice of parties by the voters.  This was the answer of 85 percent of those asked, whereas only  11 percent will vote European, that is based on the EU's current  picture. Finally, the majority of Greeks, 57 percent, are in  favor of increasing the authority of the European Parliament.  This is the largest percentage among EU members after Italy.  [end recording]</p>

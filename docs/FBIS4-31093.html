			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by unidentified correspondent in Budapest on 4 June; from  the "The Week" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] The Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] held an emergency congress. [passage omitted] We  interviewed Gyula Horn, the party's candidate for prime minister.    [Horn] The important thing for me is that the MSZP is  primarily the party of those living off their labor. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] If we look at the 209 deputies who got into  parliament under MSZP colors, almost 90 percent of them are  former members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP].    [Horn] This is the first time I have heard the figures in  this light. To the best of my knowledge about half of the 209  newly elected deputies were members of the MSZMP, although I  would not swear to it. [passage omitted]    How can you draw a parallel between this party and the old  nomenclature, when the vast majority of our deputies are in the  30- to 40-year-old age group? Even if they wanted to, they could  not have filled any leading positions in the MSZMP. This kind  of issue is not worth bothering about. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] What will happen if there is no coalition?    [Horn] It is not an impossibility. The MSZP received support  from 54 percent of Hungarian society, so it is obvious we will  use it. [passage omitted]    What is not clear is the new government's freedom of action.  We do not know about the obligations made by the previous  government. Prime Minister Peter Boross told me at our latest  consultation that financial obligations pledged by the  government regarding various transactions amount to some 200  billion forints. I suppose he was informed thus by the Finance  Ministry. However, according to my information, very tough  obligations amounting to several hundreds of billions forints  will put pressure on the new government. And what can it do?  It has to take on the obligations previously undertaken by the  government. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] At one of the lastest rallies you said that  the PESTI HIRLAP and UJ MAGYARORSZAG, which at the moment can  still be considered as government papers, will be closed down.  A report said this morning that the PESTI HIRLAP will not  appear next Monday and the editor in chief of the paper was  dismissed during the week. What is your view on this?    [Horn] I find it very strange that while almost all of the  written press has been privatized, a few papers enjoy support to  the tune of several tens of millions forints so that they can  follow a certain political line. No one can accuse PESTI HIRLAP  or UJ MAGYARORSZAG of criticizing the outgoing government and  praising the opposition. They worked along a rather one-sided  political line.    [Correspondent] Will there be an opposition paper?    [Horn] [passage omitted] To my mind, real journalism can  only  take the form of opposition. I do not know of any serious,  quality government-party journalism existing in the world,  excerpt perhaps in dictatorships.</p>

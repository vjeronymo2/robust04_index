			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Outlook for orders 'still weak' UK EMPLOYMENT, home orders, exports and investment are all pointing downwards, according to the latest quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce. The chambers reported yesterday that Britain fell into a 'second leg' of the recession in the third quarter, with business confidence in manufacturing and services dropping to levels last seen in the winter of 1990-91, when the recession's first dip was 'at its worst'. The renewed decline has affected manufacturing worst, although services also suffered a 'significant setback'. While the economy in the second quarter had appeared poised between recession and growth, a renewed decline is set to continue, the chambers said. Manufacturers suffered an 'alarming decline' in orders in the third quarter. The number of companies reporting a drop in domestic orders exceeded those reporting an increase by 22 percentage points. Export markets were also weak and the service sector reported virtually no growth. The chambers said that the rate of job shedding increased nationwide in the third quarter. In London, 29 per cent more manufacturers cut their workforces than increased staff. Investment plans continued to be cut, while less than one company in five is working at capacity. The report, based on a survey of 8,242 companies with 1.3m workers, was completed before the coal crisis, the cut in base rates to 8 per cent and the change of emphasis in economic policy towards growth. The chambers warned that a quick turnround in business conditions was unlikely in spite of later changes because of the weak outlook for orders and employment. London, the west Midlands and Wales fared worst in the latest quarter. The chambers found: The north-east, the 'star region' in previous surveys, experienced a pronounced 'double dip' into recession. Merseyside was back in recession with a 'dramatic' fall in manufacturers' home deliveries. The east Midlands slipped back into economic decline after reporting manufacturing growth in the second quarter. The west Midlands, one of the worst performing regions, suffered a sharp drop in manufacturing confidence. Wales slipped back from the verge of recovery with the worst decline in home orders, the lowest levels of recruitment and investment and the fewest companies working at full capacity. East Anglia's order books shrank at a faster rate than the rest of the UK. The Thames valley was back in recession, although the high-tech industries in the M4 corridor boosted exports. The Southern region, covering Kent, Sussex, south-east Hampshire and Dorset, suffered a sharp drop in confidence. The northern home counties endured a very sharp decline in manufacturing home and export orders, and have the most pessimistic employment expectations. London, worst affected in job losses, faces a further wave of redundancies. Quarterly Economic Survey. British Chambers of Commerce. 9 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3QB.

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (44): The numbers look good - United Kingdom / Philip Coggan on post-ERM progress On few occasions since the second world war can the headline statistics on the British economy have been quite so good. Economic growth in 1994 looks set to be more than 3 per cent and should be higher than inflation, which hovers around the lower half of the government's 1-4 per cent target range. Interest rates, even after this month's unexpected base rate rise, are low by historic standards. Unemployment is falling. And while there is a trade deficit, it appears to be edging downwards. Unfortunately for the Conservative government, economic success has not translated into political popularity and sceptics think the good news will not last. Many believe that at some point in the present recovery, the old British cycle of boom and bust, of inflation and balance of payments crises, will return. Critics also point out that the fall in unemployment has not been matched by a corresponding increase in employment; in other words, discouraged workers have dropped off the register rather than taken jobs. Furthermore, those new jobs which have been created have been largely part-time. Nevertheless, the economic picture looks infinitely better than seemed likely at the time of Britain's humiliating departure from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. For a start, devaluation did not lead to higher inflation, as many expected. And, perhaps more by luck than judgment, the post-ERM policy structure has performed fairly well. A combination of a 1-4 per cent inflation target and a greater role for the Bank of England gave the UK's economic policies some much needed credibility. The markets now perceive that it would be difficult for any Chancellor of the Exchequer to make politically-inspired base rate cuts in the face of the opposition of the governor of the Bank of England, especially as the latter's displeasure would quickly be made public through the medium of the meeting's minutes. The government also took decisive steps to bring the public sector deficit under control. Credibility was boosted further by Kenneth Clarke's decision this month to raise base rates to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent. The government's success in cutting the budget deficit, while incurring political unpopularity because of tax increases, has helped save Britain from the kind of problems which have enveloped debt-prone Belgium, Italy and Sweden. Much economic debate centres on the size of the so-called 'output gap', the difference between actual and potential output resulting from recession. Theory suggests that once the output gap disappears, inflationary pressures start to emerge with capacity constraints. But while an output gap exists, Britain can grow at an above trend rate, without boosting inflation. It all depends,on the size of the gap and the long-term trend rate of growth. The problem for policy makers and analysts is that nobody knows the size of the output gap or has a very clear idea about the trend rate of growth. Economic debate, therefore, often has an 'angels on a pinhead' feel. But one important and connected issue is whether the UK has failed to invest enough to allow for sustainable long-term growth at an annual rate of 2 per cent plus Investment in UK manufacturing fell by a third between 1989 and the second quarter of 1994, leaving it at its lowest level as a proportion of GDP for more than 30 years. Confederation of British Industry surveys show only a modest increase in manufacturers' intentions to invest, despite more than two years of GDP growth. Nevertheless, there has been some sign of a pick-up in investment in 1994. Companies seem to have used the early stages of recovery as a chance to repay their debt and repair their balance sheets. Now that task is largely completed, they can invest some of their healthy profits. Manufacturing investment rose in the second quarter of 1994 for the first time in two years. On the demand side, there are signs that consumer spending, which played a strong part in the early stages of the recovery, might be slowing down. Second quarter GDP figures showed an encouraging shift in the 'mix' of economic growth. Exports contributed more than half the 1 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise. Meanwhile, consumer spending, having risen by 1 per cent plus in each of the past two quarters of 1993, grew by only 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 and 0.2 per cent in the second quarter. An export and investment-led recovery is the ideal outcome, in most economists' eyes. The new low levels of mortgage lending have been an important factor in restraining the growth rate of broad money - M4. Although narrow money, M0, has consistently grown outside its 0-4 per cent target range, monetarists argue that inflation is unlikely to be a threat while M4 growth is so sluggish. Another inflationary demon, escalating wage increases, is still relatively subdued. While there was a jump in the annual rate of growth in average earnings in early 1994, the summer saw the rate stabilise at a modest 3 3/4 per cent. One cloud on the inflation horizon appears to be higher commodity prices. These may be a small part of manufacturers' costs, but could still have a knock-on effect on consumer prices. While inflation indicators are barely flashing amber, what about that other British economic bugbear, the trade deficit? There are some signs of improvement, with exporters benefiting from a weak pound. In the second quarter of 1994, the current account deficit dropped below Pounds 1bn, thanks to a sharply improved exports and a robust invisibles surplus. Meanwhile, the visible trade deficit fell to Pounds 2.4bn in the second quarter, from Pounds 3bn in the first quarter. However, these figures need to be treated with caution. It may be that Britain is at just the stage of the cycle when the numbers look good; when there is enough spare capacity for the economy to grow without causing inflation, or sucking in imports. Or it may be that there has been a genuine shift towards a low inflation era and a more efficient industrial sector. It is too early in the economic cycle to settle the argument. But if the pessimists are right, the government's electoral prospects may be the chief victim.</p>

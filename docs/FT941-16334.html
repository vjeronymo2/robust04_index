			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A soft route to high-tech  -Too few bright ideas are converted into successful UK businesses. Richard Gourlay describes how one consultancy has made the transition to manufacturer When the German group Bosch was looking for a way to differentiate its cordless hand power tools in a market flooded with similar products it chose to introduce a battery charge-monitor. But it lacked the technology to measure the residual power of Nickel-cadmium batteries. Esselte, the Swedish office products group that owns the internationally renowned Dymo labelling system, had a similar challenge. Despite owning an excellent brand, Esselte Dymo saw increasing competition from newer technologies, notably Brother of Japan, but had a limited research and development capability to update its products. Both companies arrived at solutions with the help of The Technology Partnership, a Hertfordshire-based company that started life seven years ago as a engineering and scientific consultancy. Bosch's battery monitor and Esselte Dymo's electronic labeller are now successfully on the market. But for The Technology Partnership, product development contracts like those with Bosch and Esselte Dymo provided a knowledge base that has helped it follow an unusual path of growth. After seven years the group is manufacturing and developing high-tech products in its own right, supported by the knowledge and the cash generated from developing products for third parties. There is nothing new in consultants working beside a company's in-house development team to come up with new products or innovations; the cost of a full blown R&amp;D department can be exorbitant for many groups and many companies also value the independent views of outsiders. But the step from consulting to manufacturing is still relatively unusual. By the standards of recent UK high-tech start-ups, The Technology Partnership has enjoyed a considerable success - it now employs 170 people, six-times more than when it started, and has sales of over Pounds 13m. With some justification The Technology Partnership claims to be joining an all-too-select club of successful high-tech start-up companies in the UK, a list that includes Apricot, Acorn, Domino Printing and Oxford Instruments but precious few others. According to David Connell, head of The Technology Partnership's strategy division, theirs is a model of development that the government should be supporting if it wants to encourage a more dynamic base of high technology start-ups. 'The traditional venture capital model is one where you have your product and your business plan, and you raise finance, do the development and market the product,' says Connell. This approach - what has become known as a 'hard company' start-up - often requires a full management team, considerable capital and substantial risk. Given the risks, it is not surprising that there have been so few successes. By contrast the 'soft start-up company' sells consultancy or does contract manufacturing for a customer, using the cashflow and experience it acquires to 'harden up' and develop its own products. The problem is that even the handful of venture capital funds prepared to finance high-tech start-ups are not interested in backing companies that are still trying to turn their ideas into businesses. This is understandable as these companies' main assets wear shoes and can walk out of the door at anytime. Most will only fund a company when it has already developed a product that is ready to go to market. Even then the transition from consultancy to making and marketing a product is the most difficult phase of development. Companies handle it in different ways. Crombie Anderson, a consultancy in Dunfermline, Scotland and Denver, Colorado, has chosen to spin out the two high-tech businesses it has incubated. But it has always kept its consulting side as a separate business. 'Consulting is jobbing work. If you want to penetrate a market you have to really focus,' says Douglas Anderson, managing director of the consultancy. He is also chairman of Creos, which he spun out of the consultancy when it received backing from venture capitalists Electra Innvotec and which makes high-voltage power supplies for computerised tomography (CT) scanners. 'For this opportunity in medical imaging you have to have a team that is really dedicated to that and nothing else,' he says. The Technology Partnership experience is similar, though on a larger scale. Formed when 25 consultants from PA Consulting Group left en masse in 1987, it started with specialist consulting. As well as developing products for others it started to make manufacturing equipment under contract, notably for Celltech, the drug discovery company. Celltech needed to make large quantities of a growth hormone, and asked The Technology Partnership to make a robot that would replicate exactly the human procedures approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The Technology Partnership has since updated the robot and set up a niche business selling the equipment to biotechnology companies making, for example, vaccines. The next step was to form strategic partnerships to develop ideas generated within the consultancy business. These have included a joint venture with a corporate partner to develop an ink-jet printing technology and a project with Analogue Devices of the US to design telecommunications chips for the new GSM digital telephones spreading across Europe. Lastly, The Technology Partnership has been able to dedicate two people for 18 months to a project that is developing vehicle power systems for electric cars. This has led to the spin-out of a new business funded by a large company. 'It is the service (consultancy) side of the business that allowed two people to explore the possibility of a new approach to drives in electric vehicles with potential partners and the car companies,' says Gerald Avison, managing director of The Technology Partnership. The consultancy started with a distinct advantage - it was quickly large enough to free researchers from the daily grind of covering the business's overheads with fee earning consultancy. But for smaller teams the transition from consultancy to making a product is a difficult manoeuvre. For 11 years after leaving Warwick University, Ron Jones, ran Ceramic Developments as a consultancy. But even after re-mortgaging his house, his company lacked critical mass. 'At the bottom of the recession we were struggling to get product into the market,' says Jones. 'I had been managing director for 11 years but we were short on the technical side and I needed to get back to development.' Like Creos, Jones was fortunate enough to raise venture capital from Electra Innvotec. Jones returned to what he did best, R&amp;D, and the new managing director began to focus the business on its most promising developments. The company now has four products in the market, one of which is lightweight ceramic armour used on the floor and seats of aeroplanes flying into Bosnia. Jones says development plans and the need to provide investors with an exit means the company (current sales roughly Pounds 2.5m) may be sold to a larger company group in the next year. Though Ceramic Developments could become part of a larger group, it has at least joined the thin ranks of companies that have turned ideas into businesses. Some observers believe too many high-tech start-ups do not make this jump, partly because funding for product development is inadequate. Alternatively development is too slow - often also a result of inadequate funding. 'The market window is often finite and not very wide,' says Gerald Avison. 'If a product takes too long to develop it is no longer what the market wants.' David Connell, who was on the UK government's Advisory Council for Science &amp; Technology (ACOST) committee that looked at 'Barriers to Growth' in 1990, believes many more high-tech companies could be successfully incubated in the UK if there were more government support for the soft start-up. He has two concrete recommendations. First, the government could help by using the services of smaller consultancies, which could then begin to develop a knowledge base. Second, the government could try to find ways of supporting the transition to production and marketing, such as regular competitions to promote good ideas. Neither seem likely so long as the government continues to believe intervention is an unwelcome distortion of a market system that works.</p>

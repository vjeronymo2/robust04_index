			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / ITT changes image as it seeks riches: Rand Araskog talks to Martin Dickson and Ian Hargreaves ITT, the US company which more than any other has symbolised the now unfashionable idea of conglomeracy, may be about to pull a dramatic curtain down on this era. But then again, just maybe it won't. What is certain is that ITT's board is yet again considering ways to improve the lacklustre performance of its shares by making the company more appealing to investors. And the options passing through the mind of Mr Rand Araskog, chairman for the past 11 years, include splitting the business into smaller and more clearly identifiable pieces. 'We want our company to be more exciting to the investment community than it is,' Mr Araskog said earlier this month shortly before ITT reported a 15 per cent drop in 1991 income to Dollars 817m (Pounds 466m). He complains that its stock, just under Dollars 60, is undervalued by the market yet could trade at Dollars 80 or more 'if we get a little perception change'. While carefully unspecific about his plans, he makes plain one theoretical option is to split off the group's financial services operations, dominated by the ITT Hartford insurance group, from its manufacturing businesses, which range from automotive and electronic components to pumps, valves and paper manufacturing. ITT's Sheraton hotel group 'could easily be a stand-alone company. Its major competitors - Marriott, Hilton, Trusthouse Forte - are all independent companies'. Certainly, financial services and insurance companies tend to attract lowly market ratings, which has probably helped to hold down ITT's price/earnings ratio. And there are several precedents for such a move. But in the case of ITT any split-up would be the end of an era. In the 1970s the company came to symbolise the fashion for conglomeracy as Mr Harold Geneen, chairman, took it on an acquisition spree far beyond its roots in telecommunications equipment manufacturing. His battle cry was 'synergy', his weapon the agreed takeover, and for a while Wall Street loved it. When Mr Araskog took over as chairman in 1980 he inherited a company which was unwieldy, unfocused, heavily in debt and, as Fortune magazine said, 'a museum of the investment and management ideas of the 1960s'. He spent much of the 1980s sharply reducing its size and improving its financial shape by selling off dozens of industrial companies and cutting fat at the remainder - while fighting off a succession of corporate raiders keen to carve ITT up completely. His most dramatic move was the much-lauded sale in 1986 of a majority stake in ITT's core telecommunications business to CGE of France, which merged it with its own operations to create Alcatel, the world's largest telecommunications equipment company. ITT retains a 30 per cent stake in the company and Mr Araskog, also chairman of Alcatel, says he has resisted pressures to sell the remaining stake because of the 'excellent cash flow from Alcatel'. The net result is a slimmer and financially sounder ITT, whose ambition is to be a market leader in each of its product areas. In spite of this, the group remains out of favour on Wall Street and among institutional investors. This is partly because of the group's lacklustre profits performance over the past few years, when it has repeatedly failed to reach its declared goal of a 15 per cent return on shareholders' equity - in spite of a heavy programme of buying in its own shares. Admittedly, many of its businesses are cyclical, and have been hit hard by the US recession. Last year's Gulf war knocked the hotels business sideways and the Hartford - well regarded for its conservative management and fast-growing life business - has had to grapple with a general downturn in the property/casualty sector. But in spite of these external factors, some analysts question whether all its businesses are being run as hard as they might, and wonder about its strategic focus. Nor was the group's image helped last year by a row with a leading institutional investor over the size (estimated at up to Dollars 11m) and percentage increase (100 per cent) of Mr Araskog's pay package when the group's financial results were so uninspiring. In response to these pressures, ITT is introducing a new pay incentive scheme for 500 senior managers, which emphasises options and ties rewards to ITT's share price performance and the return on equity of its constituent businesses. In the past, earnings per share was the prime yardstick. The change is popular on Wall Street, where analysts argue that ITT's managers now have a powerful incentive to improve their financial performance. 'It may be a reason for management to really shake things up this time,' says Mr Phua Young, of Wall Street's Lehman Brothers. Mr Araskog, curiously, downplays the potential impact of the scheme. 'I basically believe most people want to do well. They want to work hard. They want to be a successful company. I think they expect to get paid, but I don't think handing candy all over the room does any good.' Nor does he yet seem committed to radical change in ITT's conglomerate nature; he is torn, not for the first time, between the big strategic move and a pragmatic, incremental approach to improving financial performance. On the one hand, he says until now the board has believed the differing qualities of the group's component parts add up to a strong whole. On the other, he acknowledges 'there is very little synergy between the service companies and manufacturing'. But with the financial flexibility of ITT's strong balance sheet he does hold out the possibility of a string of new deals, be they acquisitions or joint ventures. Just last week, for example, Sheraton agreed to buy or lease eight hotels from rival Marriott. Certainly, Mr Araskog showed canny timing with his string of deals in the mid-1980s, which the 60-year-old chairman eagerly recalls in some detail when asked to summarise ITT's strategic shifts in the past decade. But the question which has hung over ITT since the Alcatel deal remains as central today as five years ago: can Mr Araskog, together with two lieutenants fighting to succeed him - Mr Travis Engen on the manufacturing side and Mr Dale Comey at financial services - grow profits as well as his company's long record in cutting a deal? The answer should emerge over the next two years as the US recession ends and the new management pay scheme goes into effect. But the immediate challenge Mr Araskog perceives is to boost the share price. The aim, he says, is 'to make the company more identifiable, and if that means doing things that are a little bit surprising . . . then I'm prepared to do that'.</p>

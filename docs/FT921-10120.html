			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Mr Triple Trouble fights his corner: Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, tells Stefan Wagstyl he will resist outside pressure Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, does not believe that his country faces anything like a credit crunch, declining to comment on the 'hypothetical' possibility of even a single Japanese bank needing rescue. Yet in the subtle style of a well-schooled central banker, he indicated a certain level of concern about the health of Japanese financial institutions as they grapple with the collapse of the speculative boom that hit Japan in the 1980s. Central banks had two goals, he said in an interview with the Financial Times this week: maintaining price stability and ensuring a stable financial system. 'In the past, previous governors put a little more weight on the maintenance of price stability (rather than financial stability). But under the current circumstances we should attach equal importance to these two objectives.' Mr Mieno, who has spent his working life at the central bank and has been governor for just over two years, has presided over Japanese monetary policy during one of the most difficult times since the second world war. First he raised interest rates to deflate a speculative bubble in stock and land prices and to dampen inflation. Then as the threats receded, he gently lowered the cost of borrowing. Now he has to consider whether to cut rates further to stimulate growth or to keep the brakes on credit for a while longer. Mr Mieno has been criticised in some corners of the financial community, particularly in the stock market where he was dubbed Mr Triple Trouble in a play on his name, which contains the Japanese word for 'three'. But to the general public he has become something of a hero for the pain he has inflicted on land speculators. While stock market and banking scandals last year tarnished many financial companies and touched even the finance ministry, the Bank of Japan's reputation for rectitude has rarely been higher. Mr Mieno relies on officials for the fine tuning of monetary policy. His biggest personal contribution is his zeal for sound money and his fierce resistance to external pressure on the bank. He said that his motto was never to shirk difficult challenges. 'The current situation at the Bank of Japan requires a strong will to fight back (against pressures from outside),' he said. In preparing for this fight, Mr Mieno, who is 67, has a wider breadth of experience to draw upon than most Japanese. Before the second world war, he lived with his family in Manchuria, moving frequently. Returning to Tokyo, he helped to keep himself and his family by dealing in soap, butter and suiting material. As a student at Tokyo University he boarded at a sumo wrestling stable, an experience that led to a lifelong love of the sport. He has a down-to-earth manner that endears him to his staff. Stories of his drinking prowess circulate the central bank. When he walks with his wife around the shops near his Tokyo home, the shopkeepers call it 'Mr Mieno's price inspection'. But behind the charm a keen mind is at work - his recent reading includes Andre Gide and Dostoevsky. During the interview, Mr Mieno gave a characteristically upbeat assessment of the Japanese economy. It is 'still in quite a robust state', although 'the rate of the slowdown is slightly accelerating'. Mr Mieno argued that, even though companies were adjusting stock and capital investment levels, the underlying tone of the economy was firm. Businesses were pressing ahead with some kinds of investment, such as the purchase of labour-saving equipment; consumption was strong; and the economy was benefiting from the accumulated effect of past interest rate cuts. In contrast to some private-sector economists, Mr Mieno sees little risk of a sharp economic downturn: 'The adjustment process will continue for the time being, but it is unlikely that the economy will decline suddenly. Gradually it will emerge on to a path of sustainable growth.' The central bank would continue to monitor the effects of past interest rate cuts, said Mr Mieno, because it is important that the adjustment 'is not more severe than necessary'. Mr Mieno set the Japanese economy in a global context, pointing out that overseas countries, especially the US, also 'face adjustment from the excesses of the 1980s'. The governor predicted that the US economy would resume growth in the second half of this year, but he expected Asia to grow faster than the rest of the world. Japan should suffer less from the global slowdown than in the past because it relies less on exports and more on domestic demand. In a speech yesterday, Mr Mieno warned against quick fixes to deal with recession or slow growth. He said that long-term and medium-term goals should not be sacrificed for the sake of short-term gains in growth - remarks aimed at policymakers in other industrialised countries. In the interview, Mr Mieno chose his words with care, particularly when it came to the state of health of Japan's financial institutions. He said that some financial companies which had lent money to fund speculative investments were now suffering from non-performing loans on their books and the non-payment of interest. Moreover, the deregulation and internationalisation of the Japanese market had made life 'more severe' for the management of financial companies. But Japanese financial institutions, he said, had large internal reserves so the bursting of the bubble was 'unlikely to shake the stability of financial institutions'. However, it was important for them to strengthen risk control management and their capital bases. For its part, the central bank 'will do its utmost to make the financial system as stable as possible'. Among the more delicate tasks facing a governor of the Bank of Japan is maintaining good relations with the finance ministry. Even though the central bank's independence is enshrined in law, the ministry retains considerable influence, not least because of a tradition that the ministry and the bank take turns in nominating a governor. Mr Mieno, as a career central banker, makes no bones about his determination to assert the bank's independence. He has made headlines defending himself against criticism from finance ministry officials, some of whom felt that his earlier squeeze on credit was too severe. Mr Mieno said that to maintain de facto independence, the central bank had to pursue the right monetary policy with self-confidence. This earns the bank the moral authority to resist pressure from the outside. Mr Mieno said he consulted frequently with business and government circles, but tried to keep 'a certain distance' from politicians. The Bank of Japan's current policy was accepted as correct by the ministry and by government, he said. Turning to the sensitive subject of the recent sharp increase in Japan's current account surplus with the rest of the world, Mr Mieno said that the doubling of the current account surplus last year to Dollars 73bn was 85 per cent owing to 'special factors'. These included changes in gold imports, a decline in the oil price, a rise in the yen's value (which boosted the US dollar-denominated surplus) and the collapse of the financial bubble which hit imports of luxuries. Furthermore, said Mr Mieno, the ratio of the current account surplus to the nominal gross national product - a measure of the surplus's economic significance - had fallen from 4 per cent in 1986 to 2 per cent last year. The figure for 1992 would be little different, he added, a ratio that he described as almost in the range of what was acceptable. Nevertheless further measures were necessary to reduce external imbalances. Japan, he said, needed to promote domestic, demand-led growth. It should deregulate its economy further and increase the transparency of economic transactions to make them more accessible from the outside, said Mr Mieno, in a reference to US criticism of the opaque aspects of the Japanese economy, including keiretsu, or industrial groupings. However, the governor also had some advice for the US and Europe. He said countries with current account deficits also had to do their part to reduce the imbalances through economic policy changes of their own. 'Only through the joint efforts of both surplus and deficit countries does it become possible for the external imbalances to be adjusted.'</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: TR High Income joins the rights issue bandwagon TR HIGH Income Trust yesterday became the latest investment trustto join the rights issue bandwagon with a Pounds 9.1m offer. The issue is thefirst rights offer ever made by a trust managed by Touche Remnant. The High Income Trust, which was launched in November 1989, was specifically targeted at private investors, who currently own about 75 per cent of the equity. The attraction of income-bearing shares, particularly allied to the tax advantages of a Personal Equity Plan, means that the trust has regularly been able to trade ata premium to net assets. There are two classes of shares in the trust, ordinary and subscription. The latter can be converted into ordinary shares at 100p and are also entitled to a dividend of 1.5p. Shareholders are being offered one new ordinary share for every two ordinary and/or subscription shares they currently hold and one new subscription share for every 10 ordinary and/or subscription shares they own. The issue is being underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing. The ordinary shares are offered at 100p and the subscription shares at 27p each, compared with an estimated net asset value per ordinary share of 101p. Directors said they intend to pay further interim dividends of 1.4pfor July 31, October 31 and January 31 1992. The ordinary shares closed 4p lower at 106p and the subscription shares fell 2p to 30p.</p>

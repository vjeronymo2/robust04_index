			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Premier blamed for run on escudo Portugal's prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, was being blamed yesterday for provoking an attack on the escudo by speculators. Analysts said the speculation would either significantly weaken the currency or delay economic recovery by forcing up interest rates. Efforts by the Bank of Portugal to protect the escudo yesterday pushed up overnight interbank money market rates to 100 per cent from about 10 per cent before the currency crisis began 10 days earlier. Dealers warned the turmoil on Portugal's foreign exchange and money markets was likely to continue. The central bank measures lifted the escudo to Es101.2 to the D-Mark yesterday from a low of Es104.3 on March 30 but at the cost of threatening the government's policy of cutting interests rates to help the economy move out of recession. 'The monetary authorities are faced with a choice between allowing the escudo to weaken or sacrificing their declared policy of lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and economic growth,' said Mr Joaquim Gomes, an analyst with Midas Corretora, a Lisbon broker. Mr Cavaco Silva was widely blamed for triggering the attack on the escudo by forecasting that inflation would fall to between 4.5 and 5 per cent in 1994, from 6.3 per last year, and that the central bank's money market absorption rate could be lowered 200 basis points to 7 per cent. 'The markets took the prime minister's forecast as a clear policy statement on interest rates but found his inflation forecast over-optimistic,' said a Lisbon-based foreign exchange dealer. 'Portuguese, Spanish and British banks began to speculate massively over the prospect of a weaker escudo.' The same perceived rift between a government apparently willing to sacrifice the escudo to help kick-start the economy and a central bank firmly committed to exchange-rate stability helped provoke two devaluations of the escudo during the European currency crises of 1993. Dealers said the central bank had also fuelled speculation by allowing the escudo to become the weakest currency in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, when it had previously always maintained it above the peseta. The Bank of Portugal began defending the currency last week by spending massively from its foreign currency reserves to buy escudos, taking the unusual step of officially announcing its intervention. As a result, the escudo began to recover against the D-Mark and the central bank changed its tactics by increasing its money market intervention rates as banks sought to move back into escudos. The central bank has been injecting about Es400bn a day into the money markets this week at rates of 13-14 per cent, compared with 10 per cent previously - but only for banks constituting obligatory reserves. Non-resident banks wanting to move back into escudos are being heavily penalised by having to pay 40-100 per cent interest for funds on the interbank market. Mr Miguel Namaorado Rosa, chief economist with Banco Comercial Portugues, forecast the escudo would shortly move back to its pre-crisis level of about Es102.5 to the D-Mark and that short-term interest rates would also gradually decrease to their previous level. But although the escudo may recover, analysts agreed that by showing such optimism over interest rates, the prime minister had ensured that no reduction could now take place and had consequently damaged prospects for recovery.</p>

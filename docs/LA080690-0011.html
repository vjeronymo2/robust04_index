			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> THE EPITOME OF RACIST THINKING;  </P> <P> REP. STARK TEACHES THAT THE WAY TO MEET DISSENT IS WITH DESTRUCTION OF THE  DISSENTER.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, Rep. Pete Stark (D- Oakland) verbally assaulted Louis W.  Sullivan, President Bush's Secretary for Health and Human Services. Stark's  rebarbative calumniations singularly combined ingredients of racial bigotry,  intolerance, arrogance, cowardice, and emotional immaturity. Democracy, freedom  of speech, and enlightened public policy would be doomed if Stark's style of  discourse became the norm.  </P> <P> Stark insulted Sullivan in labeling him a "disgrace" to his race and  profession, and a craven political apologist for the allegedly racist politices  of White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and budget director Richard Darman.  These defamatory labels were justified, according to Stark, because Sullivan  had voiced dissent from the congressman's health litmus tests: national health  insurance; federal funding of abortions for the poor; and, expanded insurance  for workers and the unemployed.  </P> <P> Stark's invectives epitomize racist thinking. They insist that a black  office-holder disgraces his race if he declines to goose-step to a public  policy viewpoint trumpeted by a majority of his racial cohort. In other words,  a dissident black is traitorous to his race because all persons of color should  be ideologically monolithic to fortify political clout. It is difficult to  improve on Stark's racial stereotyping, which disrespects the right of blacks  to be as individualized in their intellectual convictions as whites.  </P> <P> Stark's temper tantrum also betrayed intolerance. Its message was that  disagreement with Stark over health issues would invite character  assassination, not efforts to persuade by dint of reason. It evokes memories of  Senator Charles Sumner's (R-Mass.) caning by Preston (Bully) Brooks (D-S.C.)  because the former sulfurously criticized slavery. It teaches that the best way  to meet dissent is to destroy or intimidate the dissenter.  </P> <P> What Stark ignores is that certitude is not the test of certainty, that time  has upset many fighting faiths, and that reasoned deliberation is the oxygen of  democracy and enlightened laws. How can the nation forge constructive health  legislation if persons with viewpoints discrepant with Stark's are silenced by  the fear of inviting attacks on their personal characters? That incubus on  robust debate would forever stunt the quest for political truths. Analogously,  imagine the state of physics today if Albert Einstein were ostracized and  reprobated for challenging Newtonian axioms.  </P> <P> Did Stark learn nothing from the Spanish Inquisition and the trial of Galileo?  Did he learn no humility from recent national catastrophic-illness legislation  that was promptly repealed because of its unpopularity? Those who believe that  they monopolize truth endanger the intellectual challenges indispensable to  progress.  </P> <P> Stark's imprecations against Sullivan radiate arrogance. Who elected him to  appraise Sullivan's contribution to the black race? Did Stark poll blacks (with  franked mail) to ascertain their judgments? How does Stark know the consensus  of the medical profession regarding Sullivan? Did the profession appoint Stark  as its mouthpiece?  </P> <P> Stark's self-proclaimed authority to speak for blacks and physicians makes Lady  Macbeth's aspirations unambitious in comparison.  </P> <P> The pummeling of Sullivan was also cowardly. The congressman is no ingenue  regarding the executive branch and Cabinet dynamics. He knows that President  Bush finally decides the health policies voiced by Sullivan. The secretary was  appointed by the President and is subject to removal at Bush's discretion.  </P> <P> But the President is too politically popular to permit attack with impunity.  Thus, Stark targeted a less formidable figure whose denigration would not  undermine his re-election prospects. His eruption at Sullivan echoes the  immaturity of Cleopatra, who attacked the messenger for bringing disagreeable  news.  </P> <P> Stark's tirade would be dismaying to civilized discourse even if he held no  office. But his position as a congressman compounds the harm. For good or for  ill, he teaches a style of public discourse by example.  </P> <P> His teaching, however, is an enemy of measured and open-minded debate. These  characteristics are not endemic in human nature; they must be sleeplessly  cultivated if democracy is to escape the degradations emblematic of Germany's  Third Reich. That is another lesson Stark has yet to learn, although he made  progress in belatedly recanting some of his Sullivan malignities last Friday.  </P></p>

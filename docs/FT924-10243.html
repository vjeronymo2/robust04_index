			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Private armies bring instability to Tajikistan: A Central Asian power struggle ORDER has so deteriorated in the former Soviet Union's south-eastern corner that political power now hinges on the loyalty of competing private armies, and, ironically, the long-hated Russian army. Six months of turmoil in Tajikistan, where the strongest private armies fought for power in a failed coup attempt a week ago, have made it the least stable of the 15 ex-Soviet republics. The capital of Dushanbe, under a 10pm-to-5am curfew, is controlled by these irregular forces and the Russian army. Acting President Akhbarshah Iskandarov travels around in an armoured personnel carrier. Shops have been locked shut for a week and no food is to be bought other than onions, potatoes and cabbages. Tajik officials do not expect things to improve soon, admitting that the government's dependence on untrained, volunteer forces, some of which include criminal gang members, is inherently risky. 'Criminal gangs have no religion, no ideas. They remain with those who pay them well, and with whom they feel influence,' said Col Jurabek Aminov, deputy chief of Tajikistan's KGB. Since the Soviet Union collapsed last December and left the emerging republics without their own armies, irregular forces have risen to importance both in Central Asia and the Caucasus mountains. They helped bring down governments in Azerbaijan and Georgia. They emerged in Russia itself last weekend. The government of the Russian Caucasian republic of North Ossetia announced it would distribute arms to volunteers to help crush an uprising by the minority Ingush. As in Tajikistan, Russian forces have been deployed to prop up North Ossetia's government. Tajikistan's current trouble can be traced to a 51-day rebellion in the capital that ended in May when then-president Rakhmon Nabiyev handed over some power to the opposition. In the rebellion, volunteers loyal to both sides fought in the streets and more than 200 people died. Afterwards, despite the settlement, the competing forces went south to the region of Kurgan-Tyube and began fighting there; officials estimate deaths there at more than 1,000 and say some 250,000 Tajiks have become refugees. In September, opposition fighters forced Mr Nabiyev to resign at gunpoint. About 50 private armies, some of them criminal syndicates, have carved Tajikistan up into areas of influence, say diplomats and Tajik officials. Most of them possess arsenals of Soviet-made weapons bought illegally from Russian soldiers or smuggled from neighbouring Afghanistan. The weapons are bought at a high price, and no one is sure where the money comes from, though government officials speak darkly of 'outside forces' financing the fighting. In the last week, the price of a Kalashnikov automatic rifle rose from Rbs170,000 to Rbs250,000. One of the most important forces is commanded by Mr Juma Khan, who is loyal to the government. His army, which he calls Tajikistan Youth, forced Mr Nabiyev's resignation. It happened at the local airport. With Mr Nabiyev in the airport's VIP lounge, Mr Khan's men moved in tanks and armoured personnel carriers, and reportedly threatened to fire on the building. Mr Khan also helped crush the October 26-27 coup attempt by rebels who wanted to reinstall Mr Nabiyev. The attempt failed when, with Russian troops taking control of roads and key strategic installations in the capital, private armies loyal to Mr Nabiyev failed to reach Dushanbe to counter those of Mr Khan's and other, allied forces. Mr Khan is now among the most powerful men in Dushanbe. His forces man checkpoints around the capital. Recently, he boasted to reporters that he had bought three Soviet tanks and 10 armoured personnel carriers. In the failed coup attempt, three of Mr Nabiyev's most important militia commanders were either killed or wounded. But the most notorious of them - a convicted murderer named Mr Sangak Safarov - remains healthy, and the word last week was that he might be organising a new assault against the capital. In addition, some Tajik officials are predicting that forces now allied with the government will eventually splinter and have their own, bloody struggle for power. As it stands, the Tajik government controls little territory outside the capital and it may not even control that. It is not clear how it can soon stabilise the country.</p>

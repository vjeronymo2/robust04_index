			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Sex bias ruling extends benefits WOMEN claiming severe disablement and invalid care allowances will be entitled to receive benefits until they are 65 following a ruling by the European Court of Justice yesterday. The Luxembourg court ruled that the social security secretary was not justified in denying women access to the benefits - which are linked to state pension ages - because they are over 60. Reliance on the discriminatory state pension ages to deny women access to these benefits was in breach of the European directive on statutory social security which requires that men and women be treated equally, the court said. The case, backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission, was brought by five women who had been forced to give up work either through their own ill-health or the need to care for severely disabled dependants. They were prevented from claiming invalid care allowance and severe disablement allowance because they were over 60 and the upper limit for receiving those benefits is 60 for women and 65 for men, in line with state pension ages. The case meant that other women who would have lost benefits at 60 because of the state pension age for women will receive such benefits for an additional five years, the commission said. It added that 1,500 other cases are waiting for rulings. Mr Alan Lakin, the commission's chief legal adviser, said the case 'shows yet again the extent of the sex discrimination and confusion which comes from different state pension ages'. He said the commission was looking forward to the government's white paper on equalising state pension ages in the hope that some of these anomalies could be sorted out.</p>

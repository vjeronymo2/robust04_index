			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to be considered a ``public road,'' a road must be one <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Which has been designated as a public road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Which is maintained with public funds in a manner similar to other public roads of the same classification within the jurisdiction; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For which there is substantial (more than incidental) public use; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Which meets road construction standards for other public roads of the same classification in the local jurisdiction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (30 CFR 761.5 and proposed Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;200). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its comments, USFS implies that, although FDR's may not meet, in certain instances, the requirements of ``public designation'' and ``substantial public use'' in subsections (a) and (c) above, FDR's should be treated as ``public roads'' for purposes of determining when a surface coal mining operation may be conducted within 100 feet of a road. As explained below, when appropriate, FDR's will constitute ``public roads'' under the existing Federal and proposed State language. Changes to specifically add FDR's to these regulations are thus unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The phrase, ``which has been designated as a public road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located,'' under subsection (a) of the definition of ``public road,'' is interpreted by OSM to include USFS jurisdiction over FDR's. Therefore, FDR's that USFS designates as ``public'' meet the ``designation'' requirement of the definition. There is no need to add specific language concerning FDR's to this requirement of the definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for the ``public use'' requirement of the definition, if an FDR, like any other road, receives substantial public use, the FDR will satisfy this requirement of the definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USFS, from its comments of September 9, 1993, also appears concerned that OSM's and Utah's definitions of ``public road'' will improperly allow OSM's and Utah's regulatory authority to extend to the ``development'' and ``maintenance'' of FDR's. USFS further asserts that ``SMCRA regulations must be limited to restrictions on coal hauling activities rather than orders to reclaim or otherwise modify the transportation facility.'' Again, these concerns are addressed by the existing Federal and proposed State regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect the USFS's first concern, except for a road that is part of a surface coal mining operation, neither OSM nor Utah has the authority to regulate the ``development'' or ``maintenance'' of a road located on USFS lands. Moreover, the Federal and State ``public road'' definition, rather than providing such authority, actually provides FDR's with protection from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations by prohibiting surface coal mining operations from being conducted within 100 feet of any FDR that constitutes of ``public road.'' Finally, it should be noted that surface coal mining operations may be conducted on USFS lands only if the operation in question meets the stringent land conservation requirements of 30 CFR 761.11(b), which include the power of the Secretary of Agriculture, in certain circumstances, to prohibit such mining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to USFS's second concern, even if OSM desired to limit its regulatory power to only coal hauling activities, rather than to the transportation facility itself, it could not do so. OSM is required by section 515(b)(17) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(17)) to regulate the construction, maintenance, and reclamation of roads used in connection with a surface coal mining operation. Such regulation, should it extend to FDR's, is not a usurping of USFS's authority to control roads under its jurisdiction, but it rather OSM fulfilling its mandate, under SMCRA, to ensure that lands disturbed by surface coal mining operations are not permanently damaged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, on the basis of the above discussion, OSM does not required Utah to amend its program in response to USFS's comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letters dated October 29, 1992, and August 16, 1993, the Army Corps of Engineers responded that the proposed changes to the Utah program were satisfactory to that agency (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;796 and UT&hyph;859). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated November 2, 1992, the Bureau of Land Management said that it had no concerns regarding the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;797). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated October 22, 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Mines (BOM) said that it had no comments in response to the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;793). By additional letters dated April 12 and August 10, 1993, BOM responded that because the revised definitions of the terms ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' do not affect the production of mineral resources other than coal, it had no comment (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;831 and UT&hyph;854). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letters dated October 23, 1992, and May 3 and August 12, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) said that it found nothing of significant concern and had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;795, 838, and 856). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

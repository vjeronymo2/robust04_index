			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello, member of the </F> Congressional Commission on Drug Trafficking, by Raul Valladares  in Tegucigalpa; from "The Morning Paper" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Valladares] Good morning. We are talking with  Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello, a member of the Congressional  Commission on Drug Trafficking. What can you tell the Honduran  people when once again the country is mentioned in international  news dispatches? This time, a former Colombian drug trafficker  is saying that drug traffickers are protected in Honduras as  well as in other countries. He also mentioned Mexico, Brazil,  and the Dominican Republic.    [Sosa] [Words indistinct] at some time some drug trafficker  received some type of protection from some authority in  Honduras. These types of people frequently appear at the Senate  subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry. Obviously, the more  charges they make, the better it will go for them in the future.  In 1989, we had a similar experience. We investigated the  statement by a witness of Senator Kerry's subcommittee. He was  a former Panamanian consul named Jose Blandon. On that  occasion, the accusation dealt with the links of some Honduran  military chiefs with former Panamanian dictator Noriega and drug  trafficking. The accusation was investigated [words indistinct]  I was able to testify and confirm to a congressional commission  chaired by Carlos Montoya that the trip of a Honduran military  intelligence chief to Panama, during which he had some kind of  verbal contact with General Noriega, was for the purpose of  meeting with some leaders of the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front, who at that time were in Panama because they  did not have the legal status in their country that they now  fortunately have.    [Valladares] Who was accused?    [Sosa] No [words indistinct] Honduran military intelligence,  whose participation in these types of dealings was not  confirmed. Therefore, I do not see why I should mention his  name. I personally confirmed that the information was false  because by chance I was the one who established contact with the  late Guillermo Ungo so that this military intelligence chief  would meet with him. Therefore, the trip to Panama and the link  with Noriega had nothing to do with drug trafficking. It was a  meeting with a Salvadoran guerrilla leader, which is what  Guillermo Ungo was at that time. The U.S. Senate subcommittee  and Attorney General's Office have the habit of making deals  with drug traffickers, who know that the more statements they  make, the more benefits they will obtain from the Attorney  General's Office and the subcommittee. I am talking about this  subcommittee. We experienced this situation with consul  Blandon, who made these types of accusations.    The current accusation will have to be verified. I think  [words indistinct], will have an opportunity to begin or  continue investigations. The first thing will be to confirm  whether [Colombian drug trafficker] Taboada, under his real name  or alias, legally visited Honduras. Immigration documents will  have to be checked for this. Contacts will also have to be made  with the Senate subcommittee. I will consult with some of our  U.S. friends to see to what extent these accusations involve  Honduran authorities and at what level.    What we now have is the fact that our country was mentioned  among others, such as Mexico, which in the latest State  Department report have been recognized by the U.S. Government  for their great efforts against drug trafficking. Now, in this  testimony, it said that drug cartels are protected in Mexico.  There have always been judges, police chiefs, and officials of  attorney general's offices who at some time have been negligent  or not done their duty and [words indistinct]. But I think the  accusation must be investigated [words indistinct] is not the  policy of the Honduran State, and no state organization protects  drug cartels. This is an assertion by a witness at a U.S.  Senate subcommittee. One does not know whether they are  serious. I repeat that in the past we investigated these types  of statements by witnesses at Senator Kerry's subcommittee, and  we found them groundless. It was much ado about nothing.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (3): Green fields also beckon - Limits to privatisation PRIVATISATION in all its many forms is the most important process at work transforming economies and societies throughout the region. But it is not a panacea. Some potential foreign investors, having looked at the assets on offer, have concluded it is easier to make a greenfield investment than battle with bureaucrats in the various privatisation agencies, fight with the labour unionsover large scale retrenchments or risk unquantifiable obligations to clean up inherited environmental problems. Significantly, most of the estimated Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn foreign equity investment in the region to date has been geographically concentrated on the three central European states - Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. It has been focused on a narrow range of industries, mainly service, including the media and hotels, or consumer goods, including foodstuffs, tobacco, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Other targeted areas have been construction materials, especially glass and cement, or the automobile and components industries. For the multinationals, the purchase of established consumer goods companies gives them a convenient base from which to infiltrate their famous brand names into almost virgin markets. In this way they extend their global competition for market share to areas which are poor now, but will not remain so. This is of particular interest to the car and truck manufacturers operating in otherwise saturated markets. They need low-cost production centres in eastern Europe as much to improve competitivity in the West as to serve demand in eastern Europe where the transition to capitalism has been accompanied everywhere by steep falls in production and real incomes. In effect, foreign investors are homing in on those sectors which were always given the lowest priority for investment under the old regimes which were obsessed with heavy industry. There are very few takers for the vast engineering plants which frequently are the main or sole source of income and support for entire communities. Uncertainty over the future of thousands of plants such as these and armaments and defence-related factories, hangs like a cloud over the privatisation process. Many are surviving by extending loans to each other. The accumulation of such non-performing assets is reducing their net value by the day. Governments hope to include many such enterprises in the mass privatisation programmes, in the hope that the onus of closing them down will then rest on their new private owners. Those that cannot be privatised in this way will either have to be openly subsidised or reduced in size or closed down. What frightens governments throughout the region is the risk that using the new bankruptcy laws to close such factories will set off a domino effect. This can only be avoided by large scale re-capitalisation of the banks, to finance the inevitable write-off of bad debts, and provision of bridging finance for those enterprises judged to be either potentially viable in the long term of politically too sensitive to close. As yet, there is no clear idea as to how such programmes will be financed. Czechoslavakia, which recently set aside Kcs50bn to partially clean up bank balance sheets from non-performing assets has made a start. Poland has invented its own 'sectoral privatisation' scheme, with the aid of foreign advisers, and hopes to tackle the problem by devising industry-wide privatisation and investment programmes. These would be managed by the proposed foreign-managed investment trusts. But the root of the problem is the shortage of management talent needed to turn round the big, ailing state enterprises and the shortage of domestic entrepreneurs able and willing to take on the ownership responsibilities for SOEs. They would much prefer to found and build up their own small businesses. This is happening on a large scale throughout the region. The question is whether they will grow fast enough to allow the withering away of the old state enterprises to take place painlessly.</p>

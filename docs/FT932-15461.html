			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / UK Company News: PNG to take 30% stake in RTZ gold joint venture PAPUA NEW Guinea has confirmed it plans to take a 30 per cent stake in the the Lihir Island gold project being developed by RTZ Corporation of the UK and PNG-based Niugini Mining. The government had earlier planned to take a 20 per cent stake in the project, which is expected to develop into one of the world's biggest and lowest cost gold mines. However, Mr Masket Iangalio, mining minister, said the cabinet had decided to increase its proposed stake to equal its holding in the Porgera project, the biggest gold mine outside South Africa. 'This shows all the mining community here in PNG that we like to maintain a standard policy . . . and get a fair share for our people,' Mr Iangalio said. The announcement was welcomed by Niugini, a 55 per cent-owned subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold, the US resources group, which owns 20 per cent of the Lihir project. 'We have always encouraged the PNG government to take a full part in the project, and we are very happy with the level of equity they plan to take,' said Mr Gavin Thomas, director of exploration. The government is expected to pay Dollars 37.5m (Pounds 24.8m), equivalent to 30 per cent of the project's sunk costs, for its stake. The deal will reduce Niugini's shareholding to 14 per cent, and RTZ's from 80 per cent to 56 per cent. Mr Iangalio said the government hoped to grant a special mining lease in October or November, enabling construction and tunnelling work to start. Niugini estimates that mining would probably begin between 27 and 33 months later. The Lihir mine, which has proven and possible reserves of 42.2m troy ounces of gold, is expected to produce 620,000 ounces a year for the first few years, rising to 1.3m ounces a year later in its 30-year life. Total costs of Dollars 248.75 an ounce, including Dollars 163.20 cash operating costs, will make it one of the world's lowest cost gold mines. Mr Iangalio said the government's decision to take 'positive steps' to secure a significant stake in Lihir was prompted partly by a recent dispute with the overseas owners of the Porgera mine. The dispute ended last month when the government agreed to pay K138.75m (Pounds 91.8m) to increase its stake from 10 per cent to 25 per cent - less than the 30 per cent it had sought. The deal reduced the equity of the three Australian-controlled joint venture partners - Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields and Highlands Gold, a subsidiary of MIM Holdings - from 30 per cent each to 25 per cent each. The Australian groups initially refused to reduce their equity in Porgera when Mr Paias Wingti's newly-elected government announced last year that it wanted to increase its stake to 30 per cent. 'With the experience we went through with equity participation in Porgera we are taking positive steps now to address that participation (in Lihir),' Mr Iangalio said.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DIURETIC, FEWER FRACTURES LINKED  </P> <P> Older people who take one variety of commonly used blood pressure pills called  diuretics may reduce their risk of hip fractures by one-third, according to a  study. The researchers found that people over 65 who used the type of diuretics  known as thiazides appeared to suffer significantly fewer broken hips than  nonusers.  </P> <P> They said that if the medicines work the way they believe, up to 21,600 hip  fractures might be avoided annually. However, they cautioned that more study  will be needed before the drugs could be prescribed solely to prevent  fractures. They said experts will have to be sure that the benefits of this  treatment outweigh the potential hazards.  </P> <P> Experts have long known that thiazides can prevent the body from losing  calcium. However, the medicines can also have unwanted side effects, including  potassium deficiency and high cholesterol.  </P> <P> The study, directed by Dr. Andrea Z. LaCroix of the Group Health Cooperative of  Puget Sound, Wash., was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P></p>

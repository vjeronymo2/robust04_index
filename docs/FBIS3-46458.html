			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter in Beijing: "Lu Ping </F> Accuses British Side of Violating Memorandum of Understanding  and Refutes Hong Kong Government's New Formulation"]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Lu Ping, director of  the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, today  refuted the Hong Kong Government's statement on airport loans.  He pointed out: Neither side raised the question of loans made  by the Airport Authority in building the airport and its rail  link when discussing the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] on  the airport projects, otherwise the sum of money would  definitely be stated in explicit terms in the MOU. Now the  British side is putting forward a new formulation, that is, the  ceiling of 5 billion Hong Kong dollars is only restricted to  government loans, thus showing that the British side once again  violates the MOU.    After attending a meeting of the Political Affairs  Subcommittee of the Preliminary Working Committee, Lu Ping told  this reporter: The Chinese side and its British counterpart  stated when discussing the MOU that future liabilities left for  the special administrative regional government must not exceed 5  billion Hong Kong dollars and that both sides must consult with  each other if the liabilities were going to exceed this sum. He  stressed: "At that time, we did not touch the issue at all.  The British side never talked about how much money the Airport  Authority would borrow in building the airport and its rail  link. If they did, it must be definitely stated in explicit  terms in the MOU that apart from the 5 billion Hong Kong dollars  government loans, how much the Airport Authority was allowed to  borrow. Therefore, the British side is now putting forward a  new formulation which states that the ceiling of 5 billion Hong  Kong dollars is only restricted to government borrowings,  showing that the British side once again violates the MOU."    Lu Ping also raised the following question: If the British  side holds that the ceiling of 5 billion Hong Kong dollars is  only restricted to government loans, whereas loans made by the  Airport Authority in building the airport and its rail link can  be excluded from the ceiling, it is not necessary to consult  with the Chinese side at all since the British side can  absolutely make their own decision. He said, "The British side  will not be able to borrow the money without China's  cooperation."</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Sainsbury to announce change in auditors J Sainsbury, the high street retailer, is expected to announce imminently that it intends to change its firm of auditors from next year. In a statement likely tobe released through the Stock Exchange it will recommend that Clark Whitehill is replaced by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The shift, to the UK's biggest firm froma medium-sized one just a tenth of the size, represents a significant blow for smaller accountancy firms trying to retain large quoted companies as audit clients. The move reflects Sainsbury's growth and its ambitions towards greater international expansion, which it believes demands a more widely-known accountancy firm with an international network of affiliates. The company began considering a change in auditors towards the end of last year, and Coopers won the tender against competition from KPMG Peat Marwick. Clark Whitehill will continue to act as joint auditors for the coming year, and after that will remain as auditor to the pension fund and provide consulting and tax advice. Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, will state that the firm has provided high quality service in the past. The income from Sainsbury represents about 2.5 per cent of Clark Whitehill's total billings. Only a handful of large quoted clients are still audited by accountancy firms below the largest six, such as PannellKerr Forster, auditor to Williams Holdings.</p>

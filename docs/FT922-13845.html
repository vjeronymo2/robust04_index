			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Party tolls - Ballot Box Severn River Crossing has waited until the election is out of the way before calling a press conference next Monday to confirm that tolls on the Severn Bridge into Wales will go up from the present Pounds 1 each way to Pounds 2.80. Severn River is a subsidiary of the Anglo-French consortium that has been awarded the contract to build the second crossing of the estuary, due to open by 1996. Tolls are such a contentious issue in Wales that an announcement of an increase before the election could have had all sorts of consequences. The Welsh Nationalists would like them abolished altogether, Labour would like them to go, but can't afford to promise. Only the Tories are in favour, with Welsh secretary David Hunt saying that higher tolls are a price worth paying for the second bridge.</p>

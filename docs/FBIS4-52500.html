			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Key coalition strategist  Ichiro Ozawa on Tuesday [10 May] criticized a move among  opposition parties to seek an early dissolution of the House of  Representatives, saying the next general election should be held  under a new electoral system combining single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation seats.    Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party  Shinseito, told a news conference it would be ridiculous to hold  an election under the current multiseat constituency system,  noting that a government advisory body has been set up to  delimit single-seat constituencies.    Leaders of the country's two largest political parties, the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), both of which are in the opposition, have argued for the  dissolution of the lower house for a general election to be  contested under the existing multiseat system.    The LDP, which has been urging the minority government of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to hand over power, is poised to  table a no-confidence motion after the enactment of the already  overdue fiscal 1994 budget, expected in a month or two.    The SDP, which quit the coalition immediately after its  members voted for Hata in the Diet's prime ministerial election  on April 25, has stepped up criticism against what it calls the  coalition's high-handed management. SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama on Monday vowed to put the party on alert for a  "battle" that could come at any time, hinting he is looking for  an early general election.    Asked how Hata's minority government will try to survive,  Ozawa said the coalition will continue efforts to acquire a  majority by coming out with its policies in the Diet.    He also said that disagreement over policies caused the  SDP's  withdrawal from the coalition, and that the formation of a  130-member parliamentary group "kaishin" (innovation) excluding  the SDP had merely provided the party with the excuse to leave  the alliance.</p>

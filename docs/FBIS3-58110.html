			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aerospatiale Prepares For </F> Privatization"]    [Text] The French aeronautical manufacturer Aerospatiale  had a terrible year in 1993, according to its president, Louis  Gallois, speaking yesterday. However, despite the crisis  hitting both arms producers and aeronautical manufacturers,  Aerospatiale is continuing with its preparations for  privatization.    Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois yesterday presented an  initial review of the group's activity. In doing so he failed  to avoid the usual speech of the last two years: How the  economic crisis and the slowing of activity have hit the group's  civil business, while the reduction in military budgets has  impacted on arms activity. All told, Aerospatiale had a  terrible 1993. However, although coming at the expense of a  drastic restructuring and reduced investment (down to four  percent of revenues as opposed to nine percent in previous  years), company debt should have been reduced by about one and a  half billion French francs [Fr]. Although it is still not  possible to come up with an exact figure, the result for 1993  should not be as bad as last year.    Nonetheless, it should be noted that the new head of the  aircraft division, Claude Terrazzoni, who has only just taken up  the post, will not have an easy job. It is true that production  has risen to about 138 aircraft and a delivery record was broken  last December, when 20 machines were handed over to client  companies. The outlook for future years, however, looks much  bleaker. The balance of new orders to cancelled orders is zero  for Airbus Industrie and amounts to some 30 aircraft for ATR.  Moreover, 500 aircraft of previous generations, currently  "cocooned," have become profitable again thanks to the drop in  the price of petroleum products. This should encourage  companies to dip into their stocks before they take out new  orders.    From the military and space point of view, Louis Gallois  could congratulate himself on the fact that the French budget  was not as bad as had been feared. It would appear that  Aerospatiale has faired better than some of its competitors,  and, according to its president, it can claim to be the top  European missile producer. In addition, the success of the  European Ariane rocket launcher has had positive effects for the  whole industry, and for satellites in particular. The weighting  of these different elements gives an impression of solidity in  spite of everything, with orders worth Fr130 billion -- the  equivalent of two and a half years' activity. Nevertheless,  revenues for 1993 were once more down by about four and a half  percent over the previous year, at Fr49.3 billion.    It is fair to say that Louis Gallois, without promising  "blood and tears," warned that there was no question of reducing  the efforts made within the company. All the more so since  Aerospatiale is one of the companies that could be privatized  and it would be best to improve its situation still further.  Its president believes that the operation is not likely to go  ahead this year, and probably not in 1995 either. However, an  initial stage, with the arrival of new financial partners, could  well precede the actual privatization. It would then coincide  with the accounts once more balancing out, which Louis Gallois  hopes to achieve in 1996.</p>

In Indianapolis, Lehrer McGovern Bovis will manage the construction of a new maintenance operations centre for United Airlines. Occupying a 300 acre site at Indianapolis International Airport, the USDollars 1bn (Pounds 588m) project includes building and fitting out hangers, airframe repair shops, engine repair shops, a central utilities plant, support facilities and site works. The recently-acquired Schal Associates is to begin work soon in Chicago on the redevelopment of the city's 76 year-old Navy Pier. As general contractor on the 30-month project, Schal Associates will manage all aspects of construction involved in the creation of an 'urban playground', with five parks, a Ferris wheel, ice skating rink, Festival Hall and family Pavilion Building. In Tokyo, Schal Associates is the sole foreign member of a joint venture headed by Kajima to build the east wing of the Tokyo Telecom Center, a 21-storey 792,000 sq ft office building on the city's waterfront. The total project value is over USDollars 450m (Pounds 265m).</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM FIRE  </P> <P> On April 12 we were among those evacuated from the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art when a fire broke out there. We want to commend the work of the firemen who  responded to this emergency. We especially want to commend the two men  stationed at a nearby building who were first at the scene.  </P> <P> They responded immediately, and without protective fire gear used their skills  and courage to put out the immediate threat, which could have become an  all-engulfing fire. They enabled the Fire Department to work diligently to  prevent serious damage to invaluable works of art.  </P> <P> K.J. HIRT  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> CLAUDIA H.

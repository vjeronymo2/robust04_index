			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Fujitsu braced for first-half loss FUJITSU, the Japanese computer and electronics company, yesterday said its first ever interim loss would be 'unavoidable' in the current half year. The company blamed the continued slowing of the domestic economy and the weakness of international electronics markets. The admission by Fujitsu is likely to be the first of many downward profit revisions for the six months to the end of September. Japanese electronics companies had expected domestic sales would recover during the summer but sales have continued to fall. Fujitsu, which owns 80 per cent of ICL, the UK-based computer maker, said consolidated net losses were likely to total Y10bn (Pounds 41m) in the first half, but the company expects demand will improve and it is still aiming for a Y40bn profit for the full year. The company hopes that signs of an upturn in the US computer market will lead to increased sales of its products. As part of its plan to increase profitability, Fujitsu said earlier this week that it would close a memory chip assembly plant in San Diego, one of two US chip facilities. The group has invested heavily in a newly opened UK plant making 4-megabit D-rams but this has been incurring losses, as demand has fallen below expected levels. Fujitsu indicated that in the longer-term, production would be increased at plants in Malaysia and Singapore. Fujitsu's consolidated net profit fell 85 per cent to Y12.2bn in the year to the end of March. This trend is typical of Japanese semiconductor makers, most of whom reported profit falls of 40 per cent and more. Apart from the weak semiconductor market, the company has blamed its poor performance on higher interest charges and declining product prices. Demand within Japan for computers has been hurt by the downturn in capital spending. A survey by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said manufacturing companies would reduce their capital spending by a further 2.8 per cent in the second half this year. Fujitsu planned to cut its spending on plant by 30 per cent this year, and reduce investment in semiconductors by 50 per cent. However, research and development spending was forecast to rise to Y345bn from Y317.8bn.</p>

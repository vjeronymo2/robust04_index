The analyst says:    The Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said on March  4  that "it is important to wrest a more drastic step" from the  DPRK, which has accepted an inspection of the International  Atomic Energy Agency, while Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said  Japan would continue "strongly urging" the DPRK to totally  withdraw its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty, alleging that the DPRK's nuclear  development is a factor of instability in the Asia-Pacific  region."    Their remarks came at a time when an inspection for the  continuity of safeguards is under way according to the agreed  conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. This  is aimed at throwing a snag in the way of the third round of the  DPRK-U.S. talks and hampering the solution to the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula.    In this way, the Japanese reactionary forces are attempting  to find a justification for legally pushing ahead with Japan's  nuclear armament which has reached a danger line, charging the  DPRK with the "nuclear issue."    We can never remain an onlooker to the nuclear armament  sought by the Japanese reactionaries. If Japan were armed with  nuclear weapons, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,  even though it were realised, would be meaningless and the  North-South joint declaration on denuclearization, too, would be  reduced to a sheet of paper.    The Japanese reactionaries must promptly stop their sinister  political plot and ponder over the matter.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong dips 1.4%, Nikkei makes upward move Share prices gained ground for the first time in three trading days on buying by individual investors and dealers, but volume remained low due to lingering caution, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average was up 84.51 at 21,367.47 after a day's low of 21,273.95 and high of 21,389.98. Foreign investors, who had been leading buyers during the past few weeks, were absent, as were domestic institutions. Volume amounted to 382.8m shares, against 468m. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 0.26 at 1,698.53 while the Nikkei 300 rose 0.05 to 308.55. Advances outnumbered falls by 524 to 475, with 184 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.05 firmer at 1,394.88. Traders said that in spite of the day's gains, the correction was likely to continue next week. However, many believe the downside to be limited. 'Most corporate and financial investors who wanted to take profits did so when the Nikkei broke through the 21,500 level,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Meanwhile, rumours that a US hedge fund had bought put options, expecting the index to fall below 20,000, kept many domestic investors nervous. Dealers took their cue from the rises in crude oil and gold prices on overseas markets, buying up resource-related stocks. Non-ferrous metals gained ground, including Sumitomo Metal Mining, which firmed Y2 to Y974, Mitsubishi Materials, advancing Y25 to Y575, and Mitsui Mining and Smelting, gaining Y10 at Y458. Oil shares were also higher, with Teikoku Oil up Y6 to Y798 and Kamei, a petroleum wholesaler, adding Y60 at Y1,490. Individuals dabbled in speculative favourites. Brother Industries, the sewing machine maker, surged ahead Y27 to Y783, Yokohama Rubber advanced Y12 to Y736 and Minebea rose Y11 to Y885. Large-capital blue chips continued to face profit-taking. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, eased Y1 to Y797 and Nippon Steel shed Y2 to Y360. Banks were lower in spite of the absence of arbitrage selling. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank dipped Y10 to Y1,960 and Bank of Tokyo Y20 to Y1,620. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 15.65 to 23,610.55 in volume of 34.5m shares. Roundup A number of regional markets were under pressure. HONG KONG fell 1.4 per cent, under selling pressure aimed at property shares and with overseas investors seen switching their funds into Japan and the US. The Hang Seng index retreated 126.60 to 9,022.92 in thin turnover of HK2.84bn. The property sub-index dropped 2.6 per cent amid worries that the government's recent measures to cool the overheated residential property market could hit the profits of major property developers. Fears were also growing that the government might take action aimed at the commercial property sector. SYDNEY continued to be undermined by sharply weaker bond prices and equities finished at their lowest level for more than a month. The All Ordinaries index lost 18.4 at 2,056.0. The All Industrials index fell 25.2 to 2,995.6, near to its 10-month low. MANILA attempted to put a brake on its near two-week decline before late profit-taking again left shares slightly easier. The composite index slipped 5.31 to 2,916.56. COLOMBO was depressed by declines in shares with a high market capitalisation, and the all-share index fell 19.45 to 928.27 in turnover that jumped to SLRs117m, from SLRs76m on Wednesday. SEOUL rebounded from two days of steep losses caused by a dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme, and the composite index closed 10.16 better at 901.08 in turnover of Won565.3bn. TAIPEI lost some of its gains after late profit-taking in electronics stocks, financials still leading as the weighted index ended 34.58 up at 6,149.64. KARACHI's banks, synthetics and cement stocks attracted investors on the new account day, and the KSE 100 index rose 22.18 to 2,278.80. BOMBAY climbed on local and foreign buying after Indian Hotels announced a one-for-one scrip issue, the BSE 30-share index closing 40.36 higher at 4,164.06. Indian Hotels rose Rs75 to Rs1,350. SINGAPORE recovered on a late buying push which took the Straits Times Industrial index from an 18-point loss to a gain of 0.83 at 2,287.34. KUALA LUMPUR saw reduced activity, volume falling from 338m shares to 236m as the KLSE composite index ended 3.44 higher at 1,032.39. BANGKOK's SET index rose 4.91 to 1,364.4, after dipping by more than 11 points in the morning, on bargain hunting, particularly in financials, in the final hour of trading.</p>

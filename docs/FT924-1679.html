			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Euro assault fended off MEMBERS of the European parliament have been waiting nearly six months to abuse the British prime minister. Yesterday they got their chance. And they were not going to let it drop simply because Mr John Major had done a deal at the Edinburgh summit. As Mr Major quickly learned, changing the opinion of the parliament is like trying to turn round an oil tanker: once MEPs have got up momentum, no amount of deft helmsmanship will stop them. Speaking on behalf of the British presidency of the EC, Mr Major outlined the achievements of last weekend's summit and urged the Community to 'lift its sights' towards an overall Gatt deal, and the 'healing of the division across the heart of our continent'. Not good enough, said MEPs, and gave the chief representative of the most-heckled EC presidency in European history one of the stormiest receptions ever granted to a visiting head of government. Edinburgh deal or no Edinburgh deal, some deputies were not prepared to write off the alleged high-handedness and self-interest of the preceding months of British presidency. In the words of Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, who leads the dominant group of socialist MEPs, Mr Major was trying to play two roles  -the civilised Dr Jekyll and the villainous Mr Hyde, with 'heavy-handed' emphasis on Mr Hyde. But success at Edinburgh has left Mr Major smugly impervious to such attacks. He warned MEPs not to boss around their elders and betters in Britain. Deputies from right and left have backed a resolution calling on the British parliament to ratify the Maastricht treaty before July next year, but the British prime minister was adamant Westminster would ratify in its own time - or at least by October 1993. British MPs now seem to have an unlikely ally in Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. 'Time is on our side,' Mr Delors told the Parliament yesterday. 'What difference will six months make, provided at the end of (next) year we all come together to realise the ideals of the Community's founding fathers?' Nearly two-thirds of Danes would support the Maastricht treaty with the exemptions Denmark was granted at the weekend EC summit, a poll showed yesterday, AP reports from Copenhagen. The survey in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper showed 59 per cent of the 900 people interviewed would approve the treaty. It said 22 per cent would reject it and 19 per cent were undecided.</p>

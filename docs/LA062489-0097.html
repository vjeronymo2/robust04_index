			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REDEVELOPMENT UNIT ASSAILED ON DEAL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County Grand Jury's report, which last week criticized the West  Covina Redevelopment Agency as inefficient and disorganized, has recommended  that the city reconsider the proposed terms of a $117-million mall expansion,  scheduled for approval on Monday.  </P> <P> The grand jury urged the West Covina City Council and Redevelopment Agency to  negotiate a better deal for the proposed Fashion Plaza shopping mall expansion.  The developers, Sylvan S. Shulman and May Centers Inc., are asking for all of  the new property tax revenue and more than 75% of the sales taxes created by  the expansion. The project would add a new department store and additional mall  space.  </P> <P> City officials argued with the report's conclusion, saying the grand jury's  recommendation was misguided, based on incorrect conclusions, and that the deal  was the best the city could expect. Two private economic consultants have  supported the city's contribution to the project, which city officials say is  needed to safeguard the current sales tax base.  </P> <P> The city is preparing a formal response to the grand jury's report.  </P></p>

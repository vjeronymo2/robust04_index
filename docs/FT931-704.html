			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Too many bodies spoil the broth: A look at the duplication of effort in promoting London Is London's government being privatised? This morning a private-sector organisation - with the blessing of the environment secretary, Mr Michael Howard - will publish plans to promote London as a location for business and an international tourist centre. The proposals will be launched by London Forum, a private-sector initiative to provide the UK's capital with a shop window in which the city's wares can be set out to the world. The forum is a sister organisation to another private-sector body, London First, which aspires to provide the strategic thinking needed to maintain and enhance the reputation of London as a world-class city. The organisations share a chairman, Grand Metropolitan's Sir Allen Sheppard, and a chief executive, Mr Stephen O'Brien, vice-president of Business in the Community. Both are attempts to fill the vacuum left by the absence of an elected city-wide or regional body to represent London and to develop the strategic planning essential for a large city. A string of reports, from organisations such as the now-defunct National Economic Development Organisation, have repeatedly identified the absence of such a body as an impediment to improving London's competitive position as a world city. The absence of strategic planning is potently symbolised by the state of the capital's transport infrastructure. Indisputably, transport is one of the most important ingredients in making a city an efficient and agreeable place in which to live and work. Yet in London, public transport is perceived as overcrowded, unreliable, underfunded and overpriced; on the roads, only recession has stopped congestion from bringing traffic to the brink of paralysis. Inevitably, Londoners look to neighbouring capitals for comparisons. When they do, they find London scoring badly. Paris, for example, may suffer even worse traffic jams than London, but Londoners can only stand in awe of Paris's commitment to public transport. Not only is the Metro more frequent and reliable than the Underground, but three cross-city lines have been built since 1987, a fourth is under construction, a fifth is planned, and FFr71bn (Pounds 8.9bn) is due to be spent as part of an expansion plan spanning the next 20 years. By comparison, investment in new transport capacity in central London has virtually halted. Road building has long been ruled out as a solution to the capital's transport problems, but little has happened to take its place. The bus fleet is ageing, the Underground system is decaying faster than it is being renewed, and apart from a short stretch of the Jubilee Line, only one new Underground line (the Victoria line) has been built since the first world war. Central Londoners can only look with envy at examples of what the government can do when it tries. In the Docklands area on the capital's eastern flank, some Pounds 3.5bn is being spent on a co-ordinated effort to stimulate regeneration through big improvements in transport infrastructure. And further east, the government is now talking of developing a linear city down the east Thames corridor stretching from Docklands into north Kent. This means further vast sums will need to be spent on roads and railways outside the central area. To many, this looks perverse: a sort of transport equivalent of adding a luxurious new extension to a house whose roof is caving in. Last year the government sought to counter accusations that it had no policies for transport in the centre of the capital by appointing Mr Steven Norris as minister for transport in London. Mr Norris reels off a list of projects that he says will transform London's public transport: CrossRail, the Jubilee Line extension, Thameslink 2000, the East London Line extension, the Channel tunnel rail link, the Heathrow Express, the Chelsea-Hackney line. And he rejects suggestions that Paris does things better: 'This idea that everything is better across the Channel is simply untrue.' The capital itself, however, seems far from convinced. A report published by the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City of London, earlier this month pointed out how the decision-making process on new transport projects was split between a 'staggering' number of government departments, quangos, borough joint committees, representative organisations and the London boroughs themselves. Once agreed, the report said, these projects then became subject to the vagaries of the national public expenditure control process. 'There is little evidence that new central government arrangements have yet succeeded where earlier planning and governance systems failed,' it concluded. The creation of private sector bodies such as the London Forum and London First is seen as the way forward by the government. To back its efforts, a cabinet subcommittee on London, chaired by the environment secretary, was created last year to co-ordinate policy. However, the creation of more bodies to promote the capital looks set to perpetuate the division of effort between disparate, sometimes overlapping and occasionally competing organisations, none of which can claim leadership. Already there has been some discontent at the City Corporation over the duplication of effort created by the plethora of bodies. One of London First's projects, for example, is a study of London's economic competitiveness, under a group chaired by Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, the retailer. The corporation is almost half-way through a Pounds 1.5m study on the same subject by the London Business School, which is producing a steady stream of papers such as the transport one already published. Similarly, the corporation cannot be a formal member of the London Forum, since Mr Howard excluded local authorities from membership. Yet the corporation is one of the few bodies in London which can provide substantial funds, staff and other resources for the Forum's work. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources committee, says that there is a danger that Londoners will be disappointed if the new body cannot launch its plans with an element of punchiness because it has no resources. They will be bringing 'little new to the party', he says, except for added profile. However, such arguments over turf beg the bigger question as to whether it is appropriate for such important strategic planning to be left to private sector organisations without adequate resources. London First, for example, is backed by some 40 companies, each of which has chipped in Pounds 5,000 apiece to fund its work. These sums are paltry in relation the amounts which would be needed to address London's underlying problems. This privatisation of London's governance will only work if it opens the Treasury's purse strings. It has yet to be proved that it can.</p>

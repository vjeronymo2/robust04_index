			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Health worker in right to smoke case MRS MAY DRYDEN, a nursing auxiliary, today opens a fight for the right to smoke at work. She left her job at Glasgow's Western Infirmary in July, three days after the local health authority imposed a total ban on smoking with no provision of designated smoking areas. Mrs Dryden will claim at an industrial tribunal in Glasgow that she was constructively dismissed.</p>

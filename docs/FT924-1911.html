			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (5): Eggshell policies - Relations with Russia THERE IS, you will be told in the Baltic states of the former Soviet Union, no such thing as 'Russo-Baltic relations'. Rather there are relations between three sovereign states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - and a fourth, Russia. This touchiness reflects two things. First, it demonstrates a desire not to be herded together into one post-Soviet lump of indistinguishably similar little countries - a reasonable desire, because these are countries (for all the forced homogeneity of the Soviet period) which are quite dissimilar in language, culture and society, though more similar in economic structure. Second, it reflects a demand to be treated separately by Russia (although all three will invoke Baltic solidarity if it benefits them). In the past year, the relationships would seem to have sharply declined. President Boris Yeltsin was among the first - even before he became president - to speak for their right to be independent: when Mr Mikhail Gorbachev sent in the special troops in January 1991, Mr Yeltsin went so far as to appeal to the Russians in these detachments to refuse to obey orders. His victory in August 1991 over the would-be putschists was seen as cementing the independence of these three small and vulnerable republics: his desire to democratise his society and lead it to the market was seen as consonant with theirs. Not everything has changed, but much has - although the appearance is worse than the reality, and each case is different. It is certainly the case that none of the leaders now care to pass compliments to and fro on each other's democratic ways: the public pronouncements are now often grudging, even bitter, as the Baltic states accuse Russia of delaying the pull-out of its troops from their countries, and Russia countercharges with accusations that the human rights of ethnic Russians living in the Baltics are being breached. The best relations, ironically, are with Lithuania; ironical, because the leader for the past two years has been Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, by far the most radical of the Baltic heads of state, a former dissident who professed a constant - and overtly expressed - distrust of Russia. But the better relationship sprang not from Mr Landsbergis's character, but from the fact that Lithuania did not fear 'swamping' by its ethnic Russian population. The Russians account for only 7-8 per cent of the 3.7m people in the country: the Poles, who are actually seen as a bigger problem because they are more militant in insisting on their rights and have a political party of their own, make up 6-7 per cent. The Lithuanians, over 80 per cent of the population, have in the past been accustomed to welcoming Russians to their country as refugees from political persecution. Even in the Soviet period, since the war, relatively few Russians were settled in the country. Estonia is different: the Estonian-Russians make up some 35 per cent of the tiny, 1.6m strong population - a majority in Tallinn, the capital, and over 90 per cent in Narva in the north east. In the elections for the parliament earlier this year, most Russians were disenfranchised under a law which awarded citizenship (and hence the voting right) to those who were citizens, or descendants of citizens, of the independent republic which was annexed to the USSR in 1940. This dramatic distancing of hundreds of thousands of people from the state in which they lived raised the ire of the Russians in Russia; and relations became very tense - with a few shooting incidents in which lives were lost. Under the presidency of Mr Lennart Meri and his 'Fatherland' coalition which governs Estonia, there has been some mending of fences, and talks broken off have started again. The Estonian government has said that the registration of Russians as citizens will be made easier by lowering the standards in the language test, and other measures; while the Russians are often unhappy, especially in Narva, so far they are largely staying and do not seem rebellious. It is in Latvia, where the Russian-speaking population is about 45 per cent, that relations are worst. This is a country where all the towns, especially Riga, the capital, are dominated by Russian speakers; where the large numbers of heavy industrial plants owe their continued (now precarious) existence to Russian and Ukrainian orders; and where mutual distrust is highest. There is as yet no citizenship law, but the indications are that it too will exempt Russian speakers from effective citizenship. Russian politicians, goaded by their nationalists, have been constrained to respond. Late in October, President Yeltsin threatened to stop the troop pull-out; in November, he wrote to Dr Boutros-Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to complain of 'mass violations of human rights' and to ask for an investigation. In fact, policy on neither side is that simple. The troop pull-out has never  -so it is said by the Russian foreign ministry - been halted, and is not conditional on the observance of human rights. Estonia certainly, and Latvia probably, will tone down their anti-Russian rhetoric and actions, not least because they face popular discontent arising out of recession, gripping all of their states; they do not want to irritate large sections of their inhabitants even more. Furthermore, most of the Russians appear, at present at least, to be resigned to becoming Latvians or Estonians. Attendance at language classes is growing rapidly and the young, especially, express a preference for staying. There is no question that the relationships will remain tense: the post-Soviet Baltics have painful memories of Russian occupation, and these remain fresh in the minds of the middle aged and elderly. They know well that an authoritarian turn on Moscow could damage them still. So far - on eggshells - they are avoiding confrontation.</p>

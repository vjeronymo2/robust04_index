			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week -(Hamamellis Mollis Pallida) This is a variety of the Chinese witch hazel, one of the best of a small genus of winter flowering deciduous shrubs. It starts to flower in December and continues for many weeks as it is quite hardy, even the apparently fragile flowers being undamaged by frost. It differs from ordinary Hamamellis Mollis in having paler yellow, larger flowers which make a better display. Both have a sweet scent which is carried for a considerable distance on a still mild day. Like other species of witch hazel it dislikes lime in the soil but is happy in neutral or moderately acid soils not liable to dry out severely in summer. It makes a big shrub which looks superficially like a hazel and the foliage colours well before it falls in the autumn. Some thinning of stems can be done in spring but care should be taken to preserve the natural rather widely-branched character of the shrub.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our side sent a telephone message to South Korea on  11 April demanding that the South accept in Panmunjom the letter  to South Korean authorities, political parties, organizations,  individual figures, and overseas compatriots that was adopted at  a joint meeting of DPRK Government, political parties, and  social organizations.    South Korea, however, showed an unreasonable [ondangchi  motan] attitude by saying in a reply telephone message on 12  April that it cannot accept the letter.    As we are not able to hand over to South Korea the letter to  South Korean authorities, political parties, organizations, and  individual figures because of South Korea's unjust manner  [pudanghan chosa], we unavoidably [pudugi] broadcast it  [pangsonguro] today.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Commission to challenge shipping pact The European Commission is about to lodge detailed objections to a powerful agreement among shipping lines operating between Europe and north America. At its meeting tomorrow, the Commission is likely to approve a 'statement of objections' to the Trans-Atlantic Agreement, opening the next phase of an investigation into the accord, which was signed by 15 large shipowners last year in an attempt to fight overcapacity and cut losses. Big European Union exporters claim that the TAA is an illegal cartel through which shipowners have imposed 'exorbitant' rate increases for 1993 on exports to the US. The 15 signatories - including P&amp;O Containers of the UK, Hapag-Lloyd of Germany and Maersk of Denmark - say the agreement is a legal 'conference' of shipping lines, exempt from European competition rules. Shipowners will be asked to respond to the Commission's objections. If Brussels concludes that the TAA is illegally fixing unfair prices, it could impose heavy fines on the participants, as it did last year on two cartels operating between Europe and Africa. Last week, EU exporters claimed to have seen off an attempt by the shipowners to ease the anti-trust rules on shipping cartels. Union transport ministers agreed to withdraw a draft resolution on the competition rules for maritime transport after the Commission promised to report on the scope of its regulations by the middle of next year. Exporters claimed the resolution was the work of the shipowners, trying to bully the Commission into clearing the TAA. The shipowners want Brussels to clarify the legal situation, particularly as it relates to new door-to-door container services. They claim they cannot make ends meet without the help of agreements like the TAA.</p>

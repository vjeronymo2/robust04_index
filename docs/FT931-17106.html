			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC low-cost TV stations Sir, Re Raymond Snoddy's article, 'Broadcasting newcomer promises cost-effective TV' (December 21), on the new approach to television which TSW is adopting in the West Country, we at the BBC have not been slow off the mark to adopt low-cost solutions when building new TV stations. For the BBC World Service TV network, our engineers took the project from concept to reality in less than three months, creating a fully automated three-camera studio, editing and transmission suites, and a newsroom for a fraction of the cost of TSW's bid. Following our fact-finding mission to Europe, a big saving for this 24-hour network was the use of fluorescent studio lights which removed the need for additional air conditioning. This was all completed in 1991 and the network has been operating to an increasing worldwide audience ever since.

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Race for party leadership narrows Mr Ken Livingstone withdrew from Labour's leadership contest yesterday, admitting that he had no hope of gaining the 34 nominations needed to run. Amid a last minute flurry of activity ahead of today's nominations deadline, Mr Livingstone forecast that Mr Denzil Davies would also be 'squeezed out'. That would leave three candidates for the leadership - Mr Tony Blair, the modernist shadow home secretary; Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim leader of the party; and Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment secretary. Mr Blair, who has the support of a majority of Labour MPs, is regarded as almost certain to win. The outcome of the contest for deputy leader, being contested by Mr Prescott and Mrs Beckett, is more uncertain. Mr Livingstone, the leftwing former leader of the Greater London Council, said there was 'no point in advancing one left candidate by damaging others.' He urged his supporters to vote for whichever remaining candidate looked most likely to defeat Mr Blair. 'We want the strongest possible showing for the left in that vote, so that Tony Blair's room for manoeuvre is constrained in what he might want to do if he becomes leader,' he said. Mr Prescott said his campaign for nominations from Labour MPs was 'going very well'. He said many MPs had supported Mr Blair because of media reports that he was certain to win. 'A lot of MPs might have thought that, but that is not what people think in the country,' he said. Mr Prescott's support is believed to lie mainly among traditionalist socialists in the constituencies and trade unions.</p>

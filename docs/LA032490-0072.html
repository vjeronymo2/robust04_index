			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BAD DAY FAR BEHIND FOR ALOMAR;  </P> <P> PADRES: WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? TWO YEARS AGO, THEY SENT HIM DOWN.  </P> <P> It hardly seems possible. Come on, can it really be? Just two years?  </P> <P> "It seems like it happened a long time ago," Padre second baseman Roberto  Alomar said, "but if it really was a long time, then how come I remember it so  clearly.  </P> <P> "I remember every single detail of that day. Everything. Maybe someday I'll  forget. But when bad things happen, you tend to remember everything."  </P> <P> It was two years ago today, in a smoked-filled room at the Ray Kroc Complex,  that the decision was made.  </P> <P> Roberto Velazquez Alomar was going to be sent down to the minors.  </P> <P> The only question: Who would tell him?  </P> <P> This was a kid who was hitting .360 in spring training. He was superb in the  field. He stole the hearts of everyone who watched him.  </P> <P> But after determining that a 20-year-old was too immature to inherit the  Padres' starting second base job, Manager Larry Bowa and President Chub Feeney  told Alomar the following day. The reaction was uncontrollable tears. Alomar  was left alone with his sorrow in the training room, trying to regain his  composure.  </P> <P> "Everybody knew that Robbie got a raw deal," said former Padre infielder Tim  Flannery, "but that's the nature of the business. I remember going into the  trainer's room that day and just saying, 'Keep your head up. The right time  will come for you. You're going to be playing a long, long time in the big  leagues. You're not even going to remember this day.' "  </P> <P> You don't think this is a crazy business?  </P> <P> In the time it has now taken Alomar to reach the ripe old age of 22, Bowa and  Feeney have been fired, Flannery has retired and Alomar has emerged as one of  the better second basemen in the game.  </P> <P> "It's unbelievable, isn't it?" Flannery said. "There's no one like him. There's  not many guys I'd go pay and watch play, but this kid's worth the price of  admission any day."  </P> <P> For a guy who's barely old enough to buy a drink and still can't purchase so  much as a beer without being carded, he's as much a key to the Padres' success  as anyone.  </P> <P> Lest you forget, it was Alomar who batted .326 in July, .321 in August and .365  in September last season. It was Alomar who finished runner-up in the Silver  Bat award among second baseman with his .295 average, 56 RBIs and 42 stolen  bases. And it was Alomar who finished runner-up for the Gold Glove, with his  range helping disguise a league-high 28 errors.  </P> <P> The only flaw in this guy's resume is that it'll be 43 more years before he  starts drawing a full pension.  </P> <P> "People are already telling me I'm going to be in the Hall of Fame, and I'll be  so rich," Alomar said, "but I just smile and nod my head. I'm not going to go  around saying, 'Robbie Alomar is a great second baseman.' If you guys want to  say it, go right on ahead, but leave me out of it.  </P> <P> "I'm the same guy I always was, it's just the thing that I've always dreamed  for is coming true."  </P> <P> Maybe if he hadn't started having this dream 20 years ago, he would realize the  significance of his meteoric rise through baseball. But when you've dedicated  your whole life to the sport well before the senior prom, why should you be  surprised by success.  </P> <P> "All Roberto ever said was how much he wants to play baseball," said Maria  Alomar, Roberto's mother. "I told him, 'Robbie, it's not so easy.' But he says  to me, 'Mama, I want to play baseball in the major leagues. If I don't, I'll  cry.'  </P> <P> "That's all he ever thought about. He didn't even play any other sports. I'm  telling you, it was his life.  </P> <P> "I remember one night I woke up at 3 o'clock in the morning. I got up to go to  the bathroom. The light was on in Roberto's room. I opened the door, and there  he was, exercising. Can you believe it?  </P> <P> "I think the hardest day in his life was when Sandy (Roberto's father) finished  his career in Texas. Robbie cried, he cried so much. He said, 'Dad, I want you  to keep playing. Please play.' "  </P> <P> Said Sandy Alomar, now the Padres' third-base coach: "When I was with the  Angels, Robbie was 2 years old. He knew all of the Angels' players by their  numbers. I could say a number, and he'd tell who it was.  </P> <P> "When I had to punish him, I never had to spank him. All I had to do was take  his bat and glove away.  </P> <P> "There was no doubt in his mind, and eventually mine, he was going to be a  big-league ballplayer."  </P> <P> Little did Sandy Alomar, or anyone else for that matter, realize just how good  he might become.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that Sandy Alomar was a pretty fair second baseman in his day,  playing 15 years in the big leagues and earning an All-Star berth in 1970.  </P> <P> Well, in two full seasons, his kid has driven in more runs than Sandy did in  eight and hit more homers than he did throughout his entire career.  </P> <P> "People ask me to compare us," Sandy Alomar said, "but what's there to compare?  There's no comparison. He's bigger. He's stronger. He's faster. There's nothing  left any more."  </P> <P> Alomar, who will become the first Padre since Juan Bonilla (1981-1983) to be  the opening day second baseman in consecutive seasons, has just one regret.  </P> <P> His brother, Sandy Jr., won't be along to see him.  </P> <P> The master plan was for the Alomars to become the Ripken family of the National  League; father in the third-base coaching box, Sandy behind the plate and  Roberto at second.  </P> <P> Instead, everything was put on hold, if not forever terminated, on Dec. 6 when  Sandy was traded to the Cleveland Indians.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you the truth, it feels strange without him," Roberto said. "You're  together for so long, and you talk about how we'll one day play together, and  then he's gone.  </P> <P> "But I know deep in my heart, this is the best thing for him. He's in the big  leagues, and that's what's important."  </P> <P> Said Sandy Jr.: "It feels weird being in a different camp all these years, and  now being in Tucson, but I know this is best. Maybe it's best for San Diego,  too. I hope they remember me if Joe Carter (acquired in the Alomar trade) has a  good year and they get into the World Series. The least they should do is get  me tickets.  </P> <P> "Maybe the hardest part of this is being in a different league. It would have  been fun to play against Robbie and then throwing him out while he's trying to  steal.  </P> <P> "But you know what would have been the best thing? Watching Robbie play every  day. I know he's my brother, but he's so good you forget he's part of your own  family."  </P> <P> Funny what can happen in two years, isn't it?  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Bruce Hurst has been chosen to start the season opener against the Dodgers on  April 9, according to sources. The Padres are not expected to make the official  announcement for about a week, but the Padres have already plotted a pitching  rotation that has Hurst going in the opener for the second consecutive season.  Hurst will start the Padres' first exhibition game Monday against the Angels  and will be relieved by Mark Grant and Pat Clements. The Angels have scheduled  Mark Langston, Mike Witt, Bryan Harvey, Scott Bailes and Bob McClure to pitch  in the game. On Tuesday, Eric Show, Rafael Valdez, and Craig Lefferts are  scheduled for the Padres. Calvin Schiraldi will start in the 'B" game. Andy  Benes is the scheduled starter Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Padres tentatively are scheduled to make up three of their canceled games  against the Dodgers at the conclusion of the season Oct. 1-Oct. 3 at Dodger  Stadium. They will make up their three-game home series against the Cincinnati  Reds during the season. . . . Bip Roberts, who has been on a hitting tear ever  since camp opened, was merciless in batting practice Friday. He hit a ball that  nailed pitcher Greg Harris in the ribs early during batting practice and a few  minutes later hit a ball up the middle that grazed coach Greg Riddoch. "Son,  you should sit down right now and come back in April," said Amos Otis, the  batting coach. . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon, wanting to make sure his  veterans are physically ready before they play in any exhibitions, has decided  to keep four of his starters on the bench Monday: first baseman Jack Clark,  center fielder Joe Carter, catcher Benito Santiago and shortstop Garry  Templeton. . . . Alex Cole, who will start in center field for the exhibition  opener, has been timed in 6.1 seconds in the 60. Does he think he can beat out  Bo Jackson for the unofficial title as baseball's fastest player? "I don't  know," he said, "but I'd sure like to give it a try." . . . The Padres made  sure that drinking was cut to a minimum Friday night; they scheduled physicals  for Saturday morning, prohibiting consumption of food and liquids after 10 p.m.  </P></p>

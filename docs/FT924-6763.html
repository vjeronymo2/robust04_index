			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal price slump cuts exploration budgets by Dollars 96m MINING COMPANIES are making severe cuts in their exploration budgets to save cash at a time of low metal prices and gold exploration is suffering most of all. The western world's big mining groups will spend about Dollars 96.4m less on exploration this year than they did in 1991 - which itself showed a Dollars 122.8m decrease on the previous year - according to Metal Economics Group, a Canadian research organisation. It says in a new report that gold this year is attracting Dollars 839m or 52 per cent of total spending by the 158 companies that provided this information. This is down from more than Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent of the total in 1991. In 1989, when the gold price was much higher than at present, gold exploration spending at Dollars 1.2bn reached 68 per cent of the total. On the other hand, says MEG, budget shares devoted to base metals exploration have increased steadily during the past few years. Base metals and/or polymetallics programmes are attracting Dollars 525m this year, or 32.6 per cent of the surveyed total, compared with Dollars 576m in 1991, or 31 per cent, and only Dollars 305m or 18 per cent in 1989. Expenditures for other metals and minerals - primarily diamonds, titanium-bearing and other industrial minerals and platinum - are also rising, with Dollars 248m being spent this year (15.4 per cent of the surveyed total) compared with Dollars 242m or 13 per cent last year. The exploration budgets of the 161 companies world-wide that were surveyed total Dollars 1.7bn. The US still attracts most of the spending, taking 21.4 per cent, followed by Australia (19.1 per cent), Canada (17.8 per cent) and Latin America (15.1 per cent). Mining companies' growing interest in Latin America is reflected in the fact that exploration expenditure there is scheduled to rise by 28 per cent this year. Spending in the US is up by 6.5 per cent but it is down in Canada and in Australia by 30 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. Eleven companies in the RTZ Group, the world's biggest mining company, are spending about Dollars 209m, according to MEG's calculations. The seven companies in the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa group, RTZ's biggest rival, are spending a combined Dollars 208.4m.

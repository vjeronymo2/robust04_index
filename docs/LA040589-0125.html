			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN MURDER OF GIRL IS FLOWN TO COUNTY, JAILED  </P> <P> Richard Lucio DeHoyos, arrested in Texas in connection with the slaying of  9-year-old Nadia Puente of Santa Ana, was flown to Orange County and booked  into jail Tuesday.  </P> <P> DeHoyos, 31, who since his arrest has told newspaper and TV reporters in San  Antonio that he killed the school girl in a Santa Ana hotel room, had little to  say upon his arrival at John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> The man who was the focus of an intense police investigation walked off an  American Airlines flight in handcuffs, wearing a dress shirt and dark trousers.  After shrugging off questions from a news reporter, he said only, "I need an  attorney."  </P> <P> DeHoyos was brought to Orange County after he had waived extradition. He was  accompanied on the flight by two Santa Ana police investigators. Security was  tight at the airport Tuesday as DeHoyos and the two investigators were met by a  third plainclothes police officer who quickly guided them to an unmarked police  car.  </P> <P> After being booked in Orange County Jail about 1:40 p.m. on suspicion of  murder, DeHoyos was assigned an Orange County public defender, David Biggs, for  his defense.  </P> <P> DeHoyos is scheduled to be arraigned today in Orange County Municipal Court.  Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon Jr. has been assigned to prosecute the  case.  </P> <P> The murder victim, a fourth-grade student at Diamond Elementary School, was  abducted March 20 on her way home from school. Her body, which was found a day  later, had been stuffed into a trash can in Griffith Park in Los Angeles.  According to the Los Angeles County coroner's office, she had been sexually  molested and killed by asphyxiation caused by pressure against her chest.  </P> <P> DeHoyos was "cooperative" during questioning by police Tuesday, police  spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said.  </P> <P> Police have said there is physical evidence that "positively links" DeHoyos to  the girl's murder, but they have declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> On more than one occasion, DeHoyos told San Antonio reporters that he had  killed Nadia because he was angry while "on drugs," specifically cocaine. He  was quoted as saying that he "drowned her" in a bathtub at a Santa Ana hotel.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County coroner's office has said that DeHoyos' statement that  he drowned the girl is not inconsistent with the autopsy findings.  </P> <P> The suspect has been described as a drifter who has lived in Los Angeles, Santa  Ana, and other parts of Orange County during the last few years.  </P> <P> DeHoyos' grandmother, who lives in Los Angeles, said her grandson left Los  Angeles for San Antonio to visit his mother about 2 weeks ago.  </P> <P> Thomas said security surrounding DeHoyos will be tight because of an earlier  jail escape. DeHoyos was housed in a one-person cell at Orange County Jail.  </P> <P> DeHoyos was first arrested Saturday by Santa Ana and San Antonio police at a  taco stand in San Antonio. But he escaped the next day, police said, after  wadding up a piece of paper and sticking it in the lock to his cell to prevent  the lock from catching.  </P> <P> He was arrested again less than an hour later sitting on a bus bench a few  blocks from the jail.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUSTICES UPHOLD LANDMARK RIGHTS RULING BUT LIMIT IT;  </P> <P> HARASSMENT SUITS MAKE DIFFICULT  </P> <P> The Supreme Court voted unanimously today to leave intact a historic civil  rights ruling used to combat discrimination, but at the same time limited its  scope to make it harder for women and minorities to sue for racial harassment.  </P> <P> The high court, in the most important civil rights case of its term, decided  against overturning the landmark 1976 ruling that upheld a post-Civil War law  outlawing racial discrimination in all private contracts.  </P> <P> But in the same ruling the justices split along conservative and liberal lines,  voting 5 to 4 in holding that the law does not cover racial harassment  lawsuits.  </P> <P> The high court had touched off an uproar last year when it announced it would  consider reversing the 1976 ruling. That ruling largely settled the debate over  whether civil rights guarantees enacted after the Civil War protected blacks  from discrimination by private entities as well as acts by government.  </P> <P> Civil rights groups expressed relief that the landmark ruling survived, but  they charged that a string of recent Supreme Court rulings had severely  restricted the protections under civil rights laws.  </P> <P> While women and minorities can still sue for racial harassment under the civil  rights laws adopted in the 1960s and 1970s, these measures do not provide for  punitive damages and for the broad protections found in the 1866 law.  </P> <P> "This Supreme Court has been a disaster for all those committed to equal  employment opportunity," civil rights leader Benjamin Hooks said after the  ruling.  </P> <P> It marked the fourth decision handed down by the Supreme Court this term that  dealt a setback to civil rights activists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Serious Threat'  </P> <P> "Taken separately, each of these retreats would be a source of genuine concern.  Together they are a serious threat to the 35 years of progress we have achieved  toward a better and fairer society," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said.  </P> <P> The court refused to apply the 1976 ruling to racial harassment suits against  employers for conduct after an employment contract has been entered into.  </P> <P> "Racial harassment relating to the conditions of employment is not actionable  because (the law) does not apply to conduct which occurs after the formation of  a contract, " Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said for the court majority.  </P> <P> Justice William J. Brennan, the court's leading liberal and a strong supporter  of a broad legal interpretation of the civil rights law, issued a blistering  dissent.  </P> <P> "What the court declines to snatch away with one hand, it takes with the  other," Brennan said.  </P> <P> Joining Brennan in partial dissent were Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.  Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.  </P> <P> The five-member conservative majority that voted against applying the  anti-discrimination law to harassment cases consisted of Kennedy, Chief Justice  William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Byron  R. White.  </P> <P> The case involved a black woman, Brenda Patterson, who sought punitive damages  from her employer for alleged on-the-job racial harassment at a credit union in  North Carolina.  </P></p>

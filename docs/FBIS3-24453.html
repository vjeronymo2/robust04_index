Uvarov, senior special </F> investigators under the general procurator of the Russian  Federation, and I. Kuryanov, special investigator of Voronezh  Oblast procuracy: "A Case of Special Importance: Investigators  Appeal to Authorities and the Public"]    [Text] Over the past years we have been hearing constantly  about crime overcoming the country, with corruption accounting  for an increasingly greater share of it. This topic gets  especially exaggerated and played up during the period of  preparation for a referendum and in speeches of candidates for  deputies on the threshold of another election.    Yes, crime has indeed overcome Russia: Gangsters are on the  rampage; businessmen are the prey of choice; people are killed  day and night, on the streets and in their apartments; bombs are  placed in their work place and homes; huge numbers of  bureaucrats reap dividends from simply doing what is supposed to  be part of their job; increasingly often, the criminals' victims  are children.    In 1993 the highest rate of solving all kinds of crime in  Russia was 69.7 percent in Tambov Oblast, the lowest--34.1  percent in the Republic of Karelia. In Moscow and Petersburg,  respectively, the figures were 44.5 percent and 44.4 percent.  All in all, 2,799,644 crimes were registered in  Russia (not counting latent, unregistered crimes), of which only  50.8 percent were solved, that is, one half. A more than  depressing picture.    What, in our opinion, stands in the way of putting a  successful barrier to the bacchanalia of crime? First and  foremost, of course, political instability and the  economic crisis. They create fertile soil for criminal  activities. But there are also organizational shortcomings in  crime-prevention work itself. Among them we should point out  first and foremost the fact that investigative-operational units  are scattered among different agencies and their actions are  poorly coordinated. Tremendous damage to the cause is created by  the lack of a new legislative base. And what is most depressing,  there is no light at the end of the tunnel; moreover, on the  wave of reformist agitation, "preferential" laws are being  adopted in the interests of criminals.    There are also other factors contributing to runaway crime.  Among them are lack of responsibility for failures in  investigative work, which is often conducted poorly from a  professional standpoint; the inequality of citizens before the  law; and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] being overloaded  with other tasks that are unrelated to crime solving.    Especially regretful is the failure to use to the necessary  extent the operational and technical potential of the former  Ministry of Security [MB], which is being endlessly  spontaneously reorganized, a fact the criminal world is  skillfully using to its advantage. It is possible that the  initiators of the final abolishment of the Ministry of Security  were guided by good intentions. But what was the result of not  seeing the absolutely obvious outcome? A highly skilled  investigative apparat, which is so much needed today, has been  destroyed. It is true that its cases under investigation--and  there about 2,000 of them--were transferred to the procuracy,  together with the suspects in detention. But who will  investigate them there, especially within a compressed time  frame? Especially taking into account their specificity? The  investigators from the now former MB have not been transferred  to the procuracy, so in reality the investigative corps has been  reduced in total number. The result is that the only ones to  gain from this presidential edict are the criminals, and not the  small fry at that.    Not least important in this disintegration are political  appointments to jobs in law enforcement. Let us look once again  at the interagency commission for combating crime and  corruption. While its creation could be perceived as the desire  to have a highest-level coordinating body, the appointment of a  politicking lawyer as its head at the very least raised the  eyebrows of everyone more or less knowledgeable in these matters.    The results, as they say, were quick to show. Slandered, as  the Moscow City Procuracy has established, Rutskoy had to be  hastily exonerated in the eyes of the public opinion...    How do we see the body for combating crime (the name is not  important--whether it is a department, ministry, committee,  bureau, and so on)? It must include an investigative committee,  comprising units along the following lines: criminal  investigations, and a combined unit for combating economic and  organized crime. Currently existing units most often duplicate  one another's efforts. It should also include expert evaluation  institutions (except medical), operational units, and  investigative detention facilities. Naturally all of them should  be removed from MVD jurisdiction. It should maintain business  contacts and interaction with the Federal Counterintelligence  Service, and conduct joint actions on matters within the  latter's competence.    Gathered together, in one powerful fist, the aforementioned  units--the head of the entire structure absolutely has to be a  member of the Security Council--will be capable, in our opinion,  of conducting investigations promptly and successfully, and in  the final analysis, suppress crime.    We cannot leave unmentioned the role of investigator in such  a body. In essence he is the main actor, and it is for him that  the operational services should work within the framework of a  specific criminal case, intensifying or reducing their  activities depending on the results. He should receive in  writing all their information without identifying the sources,  which then remains outside the bounds of the case handed over to  the court, which allows who did what and how to be checked.    Right now information relevant to numerous cases under  investigation bypasses him, goes into the file of a militia  operative, and after a period of time is destroyed. On top of  that other militia officers, who are not part of the criminal  case (and responsibility for it) have access to it, as well as  technical personnel at the stage of registration and handling.  That is, there is a myriad of opportunities for information  leaks, and only the procuracy investigator, alas, has no access  because it is classified. A criminal can take advantage of this  information, but the investigator cannot. This situation allows  criminals to avoid prosecution, and operational services--to  hide their inactions and incompetency. There is also great  potential here for abuse of official position.    The time has come to bring up the question of redefining the  rights and duties of the investigator and the procurator, and  their relationship. The current Criminal Process Code of Russia  says that in the course of preliminary investigation the  investigator makes independently all decisions on the direction  and conduct of investigative action, with the exception of  instances envisaged by the law when a procurator's sanction is  needed (and now from the court as well), and also bears complete  responsibility for their legal and timely conduct.    Complete independence? Do not be too hasty. Here are the  rights of the procurator, which do not leave the investigator  any room for independence. He, the procurator, initiates the  case and requests an audit; revokes investigators' decisions;  issues written instructions on investigating a crime, on  selecting, changing, or repealing a measure to secure the  appearance of the accused, on classifying a crime, and on  conducting individual investigative actions, and all his  instructions are mandatory for compliance; participates in  conducting investigations, personally conducts certain  investigative actions or full investigations; removes the  investigator from further handling of the case; affirms the bill  of indictment; and sends the case to the court...    In other words, it is the procurator who makes all  the major decisions on the case, while the investigator is  relegated to the role of executor of his will, which  is far from always based on the law.    A serious miscalculation was made by the procuracy's  previous  leadership in the GKChP [State Committee on the State of  Emergency] case. It was precisely this case that did a lot of  damage to the procuracy's authority, and that of the  investigators with it, although their fault in this is a lesser  one. Considerable resources and high-level specialists were  brought into the investigation of that case; they carried out  their duties in keeping with the requirements of the law.  However, the proof they collected was evaluated not by them but  by Procurator General--now former--V. Stepankov, his deputy Ye.  Lisov, and V. Frolov.    One of the authors of this article was in Foros and worked  with the border troops personnel, who were blamed for everything  under the sun during the first days after the rescue of the  "Foros captive." Who, by the way, has never been found a victim  in this case. The investigator's assessment, based on the  testimony of the people who guarded the president's dacha, not  only was not needed by anyone--the team's leadership did not  even listen to his report on the work done.    As to the circumstances of developing the procurator's  assessment, which then became the basis for the prosecution's  case, there was a testimony of one of the organizers of the  investigation--the same V. Frolov. In IZVESTIYA dated 11 January  1994, in his "advice" to the procuracy he blames himself for at  the time "...not having been able to find a precise  classification for the case. But this was an unprecedented case,  and the opinions of scholars and specialists were split exactly  half-and-half...." That is interesting; somehow, we, during all  our years of investigative work, believed that the  facts that serve as evidence are established through  the testimony of a witness, the victim, a suspect, the accused,  and others, among whom the "opinions of scholars and  specialists" or perhaps someone else are not envisaged by the  law.    By the way, it is not surprising that Mr. Frolov was not  able  to "determine his position." Although he is called a "former  investigator," and after his interrogation of Gorbachev even was  listed for some time as the "prime" investigator, he never  worked as one in his life. Hence Mr. Frolov's "advice" to  produce a political rather than legal assessment of the actions  of those using tanks to shell point-blank the parliament legally  elected by the people, and those who issued this order.    We think that all jurists, including the "resigned" General  Procurator of the Russian Federation, A. Kazannik, who recently  wrote an anniversary article about A.F. Koni, remember how the  latter made precisely a legal assessment of the  criminal case against V. Zasulich, for which he ended up for  many years in disfavor with the authorities but went down in  history as a great jurist. There are people in Russia to emulate!    The State Duma amnestied the participants of the October  events. However, the lessons of the investigative actions in  this case must be learned.    As is known, the Office of the General Procurator of Russia  initiated criminal proceedings on the Moscow events on 3-4  October 1993. Article 20 of the Criminal Process Law, which is  mandatory for the procurator and the investigator, says that  they, along with the court, must take all measures envisaged by  the law in order to conduct a comprehensive, complete, and  objective investigation of the circumstances of the case; the  next article of the same law mandates that the causes and  conditions that contributed to the commission of the crime must  be identified. Based on these requirements, an investigator must  examine the "site" of the incident, facilities, objects, and  documents for the purpose of uncovering criminal evidence and  determining the situation.    Now a trick question. Was it necessary to examine the  Russian  parliament? Without question, any jurist will say, and it had to  be done right away on 4 October, immediately after the  president's opponents left it. The investigators in the central  apparat waited in vain for instructions to go and examine the  site of the incident. The investigators spent the first half of  5 October waiting.    Now let us turn to ex-General Procurator V. Stepankov, who  recently broke his vow of silence and in an interview to the  Perm newspaper ZVEZDA said the following. "On 3 October [as  published] we found no corpses in the White House. Not a single  one. Therefore, the investigation was deprived of the  opportunity to establish to the full extent the cause of death  of each person who had been taken away from this building before  we arrived. What we saw differed a lot from the picture in which  the White House is presented as a source of threat stuffed with  numerous armaments."    Excuse me, Mr. Stepankov, but why did you not fulfill your  duty and did not issue instructions to begin the examination as  early as 4 October, or at least in the morning of 5 October, and  did so only after all the casualties had been removed, thus  immediately nullifying all the efforts of the investigators to  establish the truth?    And generally, the question of "the eyes of the sovereign"  deserves special attention. They are losing their vision  increasingly often. Examples? Certainly... The general procuracy  removes itself from initiating a criminal case based on the fact  of V. Bakatin's handing state secrets over to the United States.  The law is the law, and no matter how you twist it, the actions  of the former chairman of the KGB did contain the attributes of  the crime envisaged by Article 64 of the RSFSR Criminal  Code--betrayal of the motherland. How many facts of pilfering  the national wealth with the participation of highest officials  have come to light, while criminal proceedings have not been  initiated in a single one.    We have had five general procurators over the past few  years.  All of them were appointed for understandable reasons. M.S.  Gorbachev had A.Ya. Sukharev; the situation changed  somewhat--now it was N.S. Trubin; during the period of the  "battle of sovereignties"--"our man" V.G. Stepankov. He did not  meet expectations and was immediately replaced. A. Kazannik did  not carry out the president's "political will"  (again, let us note, not the law but someone's will),  and he had no choice but to resign.    All the aforementioned procurators had something in common,  however: They all attempted to subjugate the investigative  apparat and use it in political battles.    There is no question that in matters of combating crime far  from the last place belongs to the preliminary investigation,  which should be concentrated in only one single organization. In  order for it to function normally, norms of criminal and  criminal process law must be urgently changed to take current  realities into account. The procuracy's oversight over  investigations must be abolished by transferring the right to  issue sanctions to the court.    Perhaps it makes sense to have in the central apparat a few  irremovable investigators for the investigation of cases of  particular importance--for instance, those initiated on the  materials of parliamentary commissions. The legal status of such  an investigator will protect him from bureaucrats' arbitrariness  and enable him to work in keeping with the letter of the law.    As to the procuracy, it should be retained, without the  right  to oversee investigations, and precisely as an eye--an  all-seeing eye at that--that will promote compliance with the  law and facilitate the building of a law-based state. It is a  different matter to correctly organize its work, find qualified  personnel, and place them skillfully, to serve the law and only  the law, and to rid itself of inert, unprincipled staff members  who "go with the flow" and orient themselves on "evenly split"  opinions.    In this article we, professional procuracy officers, have  presented our views on investigation and the shortcomings  existing in combating crime, and it will be enough of a reward  for us if at least some of what we have said will be used to  root out problems.</p>

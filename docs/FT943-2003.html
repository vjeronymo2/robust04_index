			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Suzuki, Mazda to swap products Suzuki and Mazda, two Japanese carmakers, have entered negotiations to exchange products, a growing trend in the Japanese motor industry, where manufacturers are under severe pressure to cut the costs of new product development. Suzuki is considering the purchase of two-litre diesel engines from Mazda for use in its Suzuki Escudo range of four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles. At the same time, Suzuki may supply this vehicle to Mazda for sale under the Mazda badge. In earlier moves the loss-making Isuzu group decided to withdraw from car manufacturing to concentrate on four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles and trucks. It is now marketing a range of Honda cars under its own badge in Japan, while Honda is selling Isuzu sports/utility vehicles under the Honda badge in the US and Japan. Suzuki announced earlier this month that it had agreed with Fuji Heavy Industries to supply a four-wheel drive version of its Hungarian-built Suzuki Swift small car range for sale in Europe under Fuji Heavy Industries' Subaru brand-name. Meanwhile, Nissan Motor, Nissan Diesel and Isuzu said they would begin supplying commercial vehicles to each other from May next year. Nissan, which has suffered heavy losses for two years, also announced that it was to transfer 60 assembly-line workers to Nissan Diesel, its truck manufacturing affiliate, for six months from October. Nissan has already seconded 100 workers to Fuji Heavy Industries and 250 workers to Isuzu Motors. Nissan's domestic vehicle production fell by 19.9 per cent year-on-year in August to 96,517, the 26th successive monthly decline.</p>

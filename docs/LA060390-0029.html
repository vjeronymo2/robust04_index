			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 TRANSPORTATION PROPOSITIONS  </P> <P> Proposition 111 is much more than the doubling of state fuel taxes and an  increase in the trucking weight fees.  </P> <P> These alone would be inflationary and detrimental to the state's economy.  However, the real danger of Prop. 111 is that it will eliminate the 1979  constitutional limits on government spending imposed by the Gann initiative.  </P> <P> Prop. 111 not only authorizes increased spending at all levels of government,  it also creates a huge loophole at the state level by allowing the Legislature  to exclude capital outlays as it sees fit. The truth is that politicians,  government bureaucracies and special interest lobbies have a vested interest in  expanded government power.  </P> <P> Voters should reject Prop. 111 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> MICHAEL ALFORD  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

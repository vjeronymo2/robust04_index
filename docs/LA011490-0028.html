			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: DESIGN;  </P> <P> SCANDINAVIAN SMORGASBORD  </P> <P> TWO SUMMERS AGO, while on a return visit to her home country, Annika Bogart  Elias decided to import Swedish furniture. "I fell in love with a beautiful  hand-painted armoire dated 1718," she says by way of explanation.  </P> <P> She named her Melrose shop after Karl XII, a much-admired king of Sweden, and  began specializing in Swedish Neoclassical and Empire furnishings. Her small  shop houses couches with scrolled arms, cabinets with symmetrical silhouettes  and decorative accessories.  </P> <P> (Prices range from $500 for a circa 1890 wicker chair and fly upwards to  $14,000 for a Swedish Baroque fruitwood armoire. Beautiful pillows made from  old Aubusson tapestries are $1,500 each.) Right next door -- the juxtaposition  was a lucky coincidence -- is another smorgasbord of Scandinavian design, an  emporium mostly specializing in modern Swedish design called Lief (pronounced  life). Its country/traditional hand-painted furnishings "recall meadows and  legacies," lyricizes Lief Aarestrup, the store's owner. He carries a  contemporary Danish kitchen, award-winning indoor and outdoor furniture,  colorful hand-blocked fabrics, flooring and old pine armoires and cupboards  from Swedish farmhouses (1880 to 1940). Table-top accessories include  hand-woven linens, utensils and glassware. The textiles woven of paper twine  from Finland are remarkable.  </P> <P> Karl XII, 8262 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles 90046; (213) 852-0303. Lief, 8264  Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles 90046; (213) 658-1100.  </P> <P> BARBARA THORNBURG  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Professional education  in this north China port city is becoming diversified as more  than 300 such schools with over 500 specialities in basic and  higher learning have been founded over the past few years.    According an education official, in Tianjin there are now  more than 100,000 students who are studying at various  vocational schools. About 40,000 graduate every year.    "Entering university is not the sole choice for high-school  students," the official said.    To meet the increasing demands of the booming labor market,  he said, the city has since 1990 earmarked more than 70 million  yuan to build vocational schools. And township enterprises and  foreign- funded joint ventures are also encouraged to run such  schools.    The city has trained a total of over 110,000 specialists and  skilled workers in technology and management over the past four  years.    According to the official, in the coming years the focus of  professional education is to be shifted to the rural areas, and  about 70 percent of rural middle-school graduates will be  trained in special skills.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HARD 'KNOCKS' FOR DANA CARVEY  </P> <P> Dana Carvey is such a blissfully twerpy presence on "Saturday Night Live" that  his astonishing, Peter Sellers-like gift for mimicry is an added comic bonus.  In his Church Lady and George Bush characterizations, he raises clenched WASP  rectitude to dizzying satiric heights.  </P> <P> In director Donald Petrie's "Opportunity Knocks" (citywide), Carvey has his  first starring role in the movies. It's clearly meant to capitalize on his SNL  personas; he gets a chance to impersonate an East Indian, a Japanese, and  George Bush -- though not Church Lady. The results ought to be, if nothing  else, an orgy of Carvey Characters, but few of his impersonations take hold.  </P> <P> And when he's not dithering with some funny accent he's playing an affable con  man with a heart of gold. He's supposed to be a romantic leading man here, and  if there's one thing Carvey shouldn't be playing right now, it's romantic  leads. Nothing kills comedy quicker than all this blubbery, ardent "sincerity."  </P> <P> The plot has Carvey's Eddie and, later, his con-artist buddy Lou (Todd Graff)  taking up residence in the ritzy suburban Chicago house they've broken into.  The owner's mother (Doris Belack) mistakes Eddie for her son's house sitter --  and best friend from college. The father (Robert Loggia) is so taken with  Eddie, whom he believes to be a hot-shot Harvard MBA type, that he secures him  a vice presidency in his flagging bathroom fixtures company. And their  physician daughter (Julia Campbell), initially skeptical of Eddie's supposed  womanizer rep, also falls for him.  </P> <P> Alas, Eddie falls for her, too. Since this whole scam is supposed to be a "love  con" -- that is, Eddie sets out to wangle Dad's fortune by wooing the daughter  -- his true-love stirrings threaten to ruin everything.  </P> <P> They do more than ruin his scam; they ruin the movie. Carvey doesn't have the  flair or the dramatic heft to portray a heartfelt romancer, and the script, by  Mitchell Katlin and Nat Bernstein, doesn't provide the situations that might  turn Eddie's seductions into something newfangled and funny.  </P> <P> Nothing about "Opportunity Knocks" (rated PG-13) is newfangled; the jokes and  plot mechanisms are moldy, even the characters are retreads. Robert Loggia's  familial tycoon, for example, is a recap of his role in "Big."  </P> <P> If you want to see Carvey do his George Bush impression, why haul yourself  through this movie when you can just tune in to "Saturday Night Live"? Carvey  is a wonderful lightweight joker who needs a tailor-made vehicle to shine.  "Opportunity Knocks" is strictly off the rack.  </P></p>

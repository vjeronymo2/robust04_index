			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: A conductor with a vision - The man behind the the rising fortunes of the San Francisco Orchestra ON WEDNESDAY in the London Festival Hall and the following evening in the Birmingham Symphony Hall, the San Francisco Symphony will be winding up its latest European tour: ten concerts in eight cities in 14 days. Nothing special in that: American orchestras regularly cross the Atlantic these days  -not just the Famous Five (Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia) but several other bands (such as Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and St Louis) risen to international prominence in recent decades, in equal part because of their own improved standards and increased 'visibility' via records. There is now a widely shared perception that, of all those formerly second-rank orchestras, San Francisco's has achieved the most remarkable advances; and since this is most plausibly attributable to the seven-year partnership forged with the conductor who is leading the European tour, the American-born Swede Herbert Blomstedt, a special interest must attach to the latest British encounters with the orchestra. In the summer of 1990, when the Edinburgh Festival formed the sole British stopping-point of another European tour, the San Francisco Symphony's two concerts provided perhaps the purely musical high point of the whole three-week programme. As I wrote at the time, 'Under Blomstedt the orchestra has developed into a first-rate ensemble, (and) should be regarded as a prize catch (for Edinburgh). The first concert was an occasion for broadly authoritative music-making - not splashy or show-off (Blomstedt, a restrained, rather sober figure on the podium, would hardly countenance that) but honestly and powerfully guided by musical concerns'. Since then, the orchestra's star has continued to rise internationally - aided by its output of uniformly fine recordings, mainly but not exclusively on Decca, of 19th-century and late-Romantic symphonies, choral and orchestral showpieces, and new works by such important American figures as Charles Wuorinen. All are made in the Davies Hall, the orchestra's specially built (in 1980) concert hall, whose acoustics, problematical at first, have recently been improved by a Dollars 10m programme of overhaul. Serious programme-building, which the range of San Francisco Symphony recordings reflects, has been a hallmark of concerts during the Blomstedt years. A Nielsen and Sibelius specialist, he has also concentrated on Bruckner, in spite of (as he says himself) a tendency of American audiences to lose concentration during those spacious long movements. In addition, new American music has been assiduously promoted - not just West Coast Minimalists like John Adams but such 'tough nuts' as Carter and Sessions (whom he cracks himself). Yet Blomstedt has maintained not just the San Francisco orchestra but San Francisco concert-goers in step with his vision of what an orchestra should be and do. Down the Pacific Coast, the youth and good looks of Esa-Pekka Salonen are hugely magnified on a Sunset Boulevard billboard advertising the LA Philharmonic. The San Francisco Music Director cuts an altogether different and, on the face of it, less likely West Coast figure - a lean, Nordically sharp-featured 65-year-old whose conversation resonates with dry wit and quiet, cast-iron conviction (he is a devout Seventh Day Adventist). It was, initially, something of a long-shot appointment. Blomstedt came to San Francisco highly respected in the profession for his association with (inter alia) the Danish Radio Symphony and, particularly, for the ten years (1975-85) he spent with the Dresden Staatskapelle. (A mid-'70s Festival Hall concert by the Dresden orchestra under Blomstedt, with Strauss first and a naturally-flowing, magnificently solid Eroica afterwards, has stayed intensely vivid in my memory.) But he exuded no PR-heightened 'glamour', and brandished no recording contracts (those came after the partnership was already launched). Success came in the most rewarding way - in terms of steadily enriched orchestral sound, profile and personality. The healthy artistic situation is economically mirrored: at a time when many American cultural institutions, and certainly the majority of orchestral ones, are struggling to balance their books, the San Francisco Symphony has kept its consistently in the black. I visited the orchestra at its home base at the end of last year, catching at the same time the premiere of the Oboe Concerto (coolly lyrical, catchily percussive, more complex and interesting than first impressions suggest) by John Harbison which - characteristically - Blomstedt is including in one of his European tour programmes. (It will be heard in London, alongside the Bruckner Fourth.) I found that pride in the achievement of the Blomstedt years runs, unshowily but insistently, through every level of the organisation. And yet, prior to the December concerts, the conductor had just shocked everyone by announcing his intention to quit the music director's post in 1995. The loss will be soothed by his occupation thereafter of the Conductor Laureate title. But why the departure? 'It is time. I have had a very good period with the orchestra. The quality of all the sections has improved. The orchestra is now full of fantastic players. It needed building up, and we have worked on that together. In some senses an American orchestra finds the great Classical symphonic repertory harder than the modern music they play: they are very quick in learning the notes, but there is perhaps a shorter interest span than we are used to in Europe.' He has felt cut off from Europe. Artistic connections from the past have had to be loosened or even put aside for San Francisco. As the fine print of his work so plainly testifies, Blomstedt is not a conductor for whistle-stop, minimum-rehearsal guest engagements (he has never appeared with any of the London orchestras, although probably not for want of invitations). He speaks movingly of his years with the Dresden players, of the hardships they endured in GDR times and the uncertainties that now beset them, and above all of the orchestra's character - 'so warm, with its rich string sound, so full and natural'. Where will Blomstedt go after 1995? He is keeping that secret; but wherever it may be, the appointment must surely promise the conditions in which this first-rate musician and orchestral trainer can flourish - as he so obviously has in San Francisco.</p>

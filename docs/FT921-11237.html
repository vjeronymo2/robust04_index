			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Cookery: Luscious lamb for lean times CONSPICUOUS consumption, so they say, is out in the caring 1990s. Cheap is in. Comfort food also is in - in fact, I would say it is essential when winter is at its wintriest, as now. So, you will understand just why bony, gelatinous cuts are centre stage on the culinary scene with tails, ankles and shins seemingly the most desirable meats of the moment. Butchers report a sudden, greedy surge of demand for such things as pigs' trotters, marrow bones, shin of beef and ossobuco (shin of veal). Three butchers in my area sold out of oxtail last week; delicatessens were doing a roaring trade in zampone (pigs' trotters stuffed with sausage meat); and there were mini-scrums in the supermarket around cabinets housing packets of chicken wings and lamb shanks. When you buy a leg of lamb, usually it comes complete with shank - for the shank is, of course, the tip of the knuckle end, the part that is more bone than meat and often is half-cut through so it remains attached to the main part of the leg by a hinge of flesh. When the joint is roasted, even if that is done only until rosy pink through the centre of the leg, the meat of the shank invariably is cooked very thoroughly - rich brown and scrunchy. Many regard it as the prize titbit. In some households it has become the cook's perk, severed quickly from the joint and nibbled greedily while making the gravy before anyone else can lay claim to it. In others, it is demanded as the carver's reward. I had not realised until quite recently that I could buy lamb shanks on their own, without the rest of the leg attached. The ones I get come in frozen pairs from New Zealand. Much larger, more meaty and less fatty than the mini-shank on a home-produced leg of lamb joint, these shanks are, I suppose, the trimmings produced when the thick parts of legs of lamb are cut across the bone to make leg steaks. Weighing 6-8 oz each and costing about 85p a pound, one lamb shank makes a meaty feast for one person. If this is poor man's leg of lamb, then I am happy to be a pauper. LAMB SHANKS ON A BED OF BEANS AND CELERY (serves 4) Lamb shanks can be open-roasted, just as you would cook them when attached to whole legs of lamb. Very good they are, too, when cooked this way, particularly if the skin is rubbed with salt and a fine sliver or two of garlic is slipped between flesh and bone. I reckon, though, that pot-roasting is preferable as it prevents the meat from becoming slightly dried out and chewy - no need for toothpicks. I rate butter beans as bland and boring generally, but this way of cooking them is very good. In fact, I like it so much that I am inclined to make a double quantity and use the leftovers, thinned with stock and freckled with parsley, as soup. Dried broad beans are more flavoursome and mealy than butter beans, and I recommend using them instead if you can find an Italian deli or wholefood shop that stocks them. The coarse, outer parts of celery will do well for this recipe provided they are scraped to remove any strings that might tangle with the tonsils. Save the leafy, tender celery hearts for braising or munching with cheese. Ingredients: 4 lamb shanks weighing 6-8 oz each; 4 thin slices of onion; a dribble of olive oil; 6-8 fl oz stock (or a few tablespoons of wine plus stock or water); 8 oz dried butter beans or broad beans, soaked overnight; 8-10 celery stalks; 1 garlic clove (optional); 1 pt or more of milk (if using semi-skimmed, you might like to consider adding a few tablespoons of cream at the end of cooking); freshly-grated nutmeg; a few spoonfuls of chopped parsley. Method: Choose a heavy, flameproof casserole or pot-roaster and heat it. Film the base with a dribble of oil. Add the lamb shanks and cook for five minutes over medium-high heat to colour them well all over. Lift out the lamb and pour off and reserve any fat yielded in the process of browning the meat. Put the onion slices into the casserole, placing them side by side, and lay a lamb shank on top of each. Pour on the stock or wine and water. Let the liquids bubble up and sizzle for a few seconds. Then, cover the pot and put it into an oven heated to 180 C/350 F (gas mark 4). Cook for about 75 minutes, basting or turning the lamb shanks occasionally, until the meat is tender and succulent. Meanwhile, prepare the bed of vegetables. Swirl the beans in their soaking water and some of the skins will float to the top like the discarded chrysalids of newly-emerged butterflies. The rest will slip off readily if the beans are pinched or rubbed between fingers and thumbs. Drain the naked beans (discarding the spent skins), rinse, and drain again. Put the beans into a heavy-based saucepan. Cut the garlic into slivers and add it. Pour on the milk and bring to simmering point. Season with plenty of nutmeg and black pepper but no salt. Simmer over a very low flame (with the lid just askew lest the milk try to foam overboard) until the beans are very tender - say, 45-60 minutes. Stir the beans occasionally, particularly towards the end, to prevent sticking. Add more milk or a little cream if the mixture looks dry and needs enriching, or remove the lid completely at the end to drive off surplus liquid if it is very sloppy. Season the cooked beans with salt and crush them lightly into their sauce, using a fork. Aim for a rough, knobbled puree - not, repeat not, a smooth baby-food pap. When the lamb is nearly done, skim surface fat from the casserole. Use a tablespoon or so of this (or lamb fat yielded when browning the shanks, or a knob of unsalted butter if preferred) to fry the crescent-moon slices of celery. Cook the celery until it is thoroughly hot and beginning to soften a little, but let it retain some bite to contrast nicely with the creamy tenderness of the beans. Stir the celery and beans together, adding a little finely-chopped parsley. Lay the lamb shanks on the bed of vegetables and sprinkle with a little more parsley for colour. Serve with the lamb 'gravy' in a sauce boat. In my steamed chocolate pudding recipe of January 11 the method should have read: 'Cream the butter in a warmed mixing bowl. Add the sugar and beat again until fluffy and light. Grate the chocolate and beat it in. Add the cocoa mixture etc . . .'</p>

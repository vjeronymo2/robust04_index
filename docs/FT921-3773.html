			<p>920312 FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Treasury forecasts - Correction IN SOME editions of yesterday's FT, the article headlined 'Big boost in government investment will help hesitant upturn', contained some errors. The Treasury is predicting a 10.75 per cent increase in government investment this year, not next year as stated. Business investment last year fell 11.75 per cent, while the Treasury's Autumn Statement in November projected growth in gross domestic product this year of 2.25 per cent.</p>

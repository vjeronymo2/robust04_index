			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Campaigners all at sea: Are environmentalists now in danger of extinction? Bronwen Maddox examines their future Greenpeace, the world's most famous environmental group, defender of nature against man, now faces threats to its own survival. It has been widely applauded by the public as the conscience of the west, and feared by politicians and heads of industry. But now, both friends and enemies are asking whether Greenpeace has had its day. As Pete Wilkinson, a former board member, says: 'Greenpeace now has a fleet of ships running around the oceans looking for something to do.' Many whaling vessels, harried so successfully in the 1970s and 1980s by Greenpeace, have been chased back into port. The cargo ships which once tipped toxic wastes into the seas have been laid up by government orders. On land, the worst effects of industrial effluent have been curbed by new laws. During the last quarter of a century, Greenpeace achieved extraordinary success in changing the relationship between advanced industrial societies and the natural world. To some extent, it has campaigned itself out of a job. Moreover, recession in industrialised countries temporarily restrained pollution, and also reduced the money available to tackle it. These tensions have resulted this summer in bitter infighting among Greenpeace's senior members. The row reflects fears that the organisation is losing its voice: that it can no longer catch the public's imagination as it used to do, or promote visions of a brighter, greener future. The campaigns which won Greenpeace early prominence - against nuclear testing, seal culling, and whaling - established a powerful public image of courageous campaigners in inflatable dinghies risking their lives to challenge steel ships loaded with weaponry. But the power of that image is waning. As Wilkinson puts it, the spectacular protests which became the group's trademark have been becoming 'a bit of a yawn: bigger and bigger banners on bigger and bigger buildings'. To move forwards now, Greenpeace - and the rest of the environmental movement - must grapple with difficult economic and scientific issues which many Greens have so far ignored. However its new quest for solutions to environmental problems is taking the group away from the traditional ground of pressure groups and deep into the realm of politics, economics and science where it has less expertise. As Greenpeace elaborates its theories of how societies should be organised to meet its environmental standards they are revealed as incoherent. Its present conflicts partly reflect the distance Greenpeace has travelled since it was founded. Its roots - and its evocative name - grew out of Canadian opposition to US nuclear weapons testing at Amchitka, a tiny island off the western coast of Alaska, in the late 1960s. Two of its founders were Quakers; according to the authorised history of the group, its tactic of spectacular non-violent protests, or 'direct action', was drawn from that religion's tradition of 'bearing witness', a form of passive resistance. Tom Burke, a former director of pressure group Friends of the Earth and adviser to John Gummer, UK environment secretary, says: 'The secret of Greenpeace's success is that it has always looked like David against Goliath.' But David is now Goliath-sized. Greenpeace operates in 30 countries, connected by electronic mail and fax, and has five ocean-going ships. Its annual income is about Dollars 150m from its 3.8m members worldwide, even though individual subscriptions are low. In the UK, a supporter pays Pounds 14.50 a year. The Greenpeace message has proved particularly resonant in north Europe and north America: those countries have a deep tradition of romanticism about the natural world, which also found expression in the 'flower power' of the 1960s. Greenpeace cleverly turned that sympathy into active support. David McTaggart, an American property developer, who was the group's charismatic leader during its formative years, and is now its honorary chairman, wrote to senior staff two years ago: 'We must have at least one soft issue . . . to take the edge off our 'whack-em' image . . . Anybody who has ever tried to sell Greenpeace to the public knows that dreams are better than nightmares at winning people over.' McTaggart, who now lives on an olive farm near Rome, also explained the way Greenpeace should convert its recruits to what it calls heavy issues: 'Hundreds of thousands of people . . . joined Greenpeace to save the whales. Who knows how many heard the message about nukes?' Greenpeace displays similar worldliness in courting the world's media. Newsdesks are well-used to the arrival late on Friday of a thick Greenpeace report embargoed for Monday papers, which are often short of news. The tactic infuriates government press officers, who are forced to track down civil servants on the golf courses to extract a reply, but it often succeeds. As a result, ministers and industrialists credit the group with great influence. Tim Yeo, the former UK environment minister, says: 'We were very careful to respond to what they were saying about the ozone layer partly because we thought they were on the right track but also because public involvement was important.' After years of confident expansion, however, Greenpeace has found that memberships in some regions are falling, particularly in the US and Sweden. Worldwide revenue fell by 8 per cent between 1992 and 1993. Last month, Greenpeace International, the umbrella organisation with headquarters in Amsterdam, agreed to cut 10 per cent from its Dollars 30m annual budget for international campaigning; and 10 per cent of the international staff are to go. Those cuts have provoked internal opposition, in which seasoned campaigners have turned their skills of attack on each other. Pressure groups are more prone than rock bands to splits and schisms. However, the savagery of the latest argument stems from the feeling among some staff that the leaders have betrayed the founders' purpose, and are replacing direct action with quasi-academic research. 'The bureaucrats have taken over. They've reached 40-something and they want a quiet life,' one former staff member said. Particular venom has been directed at Lord Melchett, the 46-year-old former Labour Cabinet member and executive director of Greenpeace UK. He began two years ago to haul the UK branch through the transformation on which Greenpeace International is now embarking, arguing that 'the world in which we work has changed'. Although Norway resumed commercial whaling in spite of a 1986 international ban, and Japan catches several hundred whales a year for 'research', there are now many fewer such ships to chase. Sea-dumping of radioactive waste was banned almost worldwide under an amendment to the London Convention in February. Industrialised countries have agreed to phase out production of many chemicals which damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere under the 1987 Montreal Protocol. Perhaps most importantly, more than 150 countries acknowledged at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit that the risk of global warming and loss of species were worth attention. This legislative flurry has usurped some territory on which Greenpeace made its most popular stands. In order to keep attracting attention, McTaggart has urged it to consider 'the gray (sic) area between violence and non-violence . . . I am not suggesting we go violent . . . (but) we need to investigate ways of making our campaigns heavier'. Its marine bias may prove a handicap to its appeal, however: it campaigns easily and rapidly against drift net fishing, oil tanker spills and whaling, but does little work on tropical forests, in spite of their popular appeal. Recent campaigns suggest that the group is moving further from public passions. Last year Greenpeace took its campaign against the start-up of the UK's Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant campaigns to the High Court, at considerable financial risk. Yet Melchett acknowledges that it was not, at least initially, of great concern to the group's supporters. As Wilkinson puts it: 'For years they've been looking for 'the new whale' - they need to translate the image of the ship chasing the whale into the 1990s. But problems now are more technical.' The UK branch, in recognition of that task, appointed Chris Rose as campaign director two years ago. A 38-year-old former biologist, he argues that Greenpeace must provide answers as well as attacks. He calls this approach 'solution intervention', a phrase which staff grumble is 'hardly a banner to march under'. But the old guard has cautiously welcomed a campaign, launched last month, which typifies the new strategy. Dubbed 'Greenfreeze', it is a 'green' supermarket freezer, designed in consultation with industry, and containing coolants which do not damage the ozone layer. Recently, a 70ft-truck bearing the slogan 'Tesco's freezers wreck the planet', containing a demonstration of 'planet-friendly freezers', has been touring the UK. The change of direction represented by Greenfreeze is a courageous surrender of some of the romance and adrenalin of the early days. It remains to be seen, however, whether such campaigns will catch the public's interest. Moreover, a move from emotive slogans such as 'Save the whale' to a more analytical style will draw attention to the weaknesses of Greenpeace's ideas. For a start, it has great difficulty in ranking some environmental threats above others, a discrimination which governments must make as resources to combat pollution are limited. At heart, this stems from a quarrel with the nature of scientific proof, according to which accepted theories are repeatedly revised in the light of new evidence. There is, nonetheless, such a thing as scientific knowledge: some theories are persistently better than others at explaining events. But while Greenpeace will accept research that a substance is harmful, they will accept no evidence that a substance is safe. Further studies, they say, might reveal undetected damage. The consequence is that no one can ever show that enough has been done. A second source of incoherence is in Greenpeace's ambivalence about economic growth. Many campaigners appear to regard the notion of an environmentally-friendly industry as a contradiction in terms. Melchett says, for example, that the group's goal in campaigning against toxic discharges is for 'zero discharges of any kind - clean production'. Asked if this is a reasonable target to set industry, he shrugs and says: 'I'm happy for companies to complain that it's not.' Perhaps the biggest equivocation concerns trade. Last year Greenpeace circulated a manifesto calling for 'environmental protection (to be) the over-riding goal of trade rules' such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It urges all countries to be more self-sufficient. But many developing countries argue that such principles prevent them raising living standards, and set 'green' concerns above the health and hopes of some of the poorest people on earth. Such stances imply that many in Greenpeace are uncomfortable with the existence of people, given that most human activities pollute the environment. Those contradictions now confront Greenpeace as it seeks to step beyond its traditional role of simply registering opposition to government and business. The mission which McTaggart bestowed on Greenpeace was 'to get our world into the 21st century in one piece'. Five years from the millennium, the world looks likely to keep going. It is less clear that Greenpeace's sense of mission and its public support will survive.</p>

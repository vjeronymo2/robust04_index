			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Nissan's 16% rise makes it biggest vehicle exporter Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, emerged as the biggest UK vehicle exporter last year ahead of the traditional industry leaders Rover group, Ford and Vauxhall. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed Nissan increased car exports last year by 15.9 per cent to 182,207 from 157,209 a year earlier. Rover group increased its exports marginally last year by 1.5 per cent to 173,292 (including cars and commercial vehicles) as a result of a big jump in foreign demand for its Land Rover products. The foreign car sales of Ford and Vauxhall collapsed in 1993 after a plunge in new car demand in continental Europe. Ford's car exports from the UK rose sharply in 1990 and 1991 but in 1993 the export volume fell by 84.6 per cent to only 11,218. Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, suffered a similar fate, as its car exports dropped by 61.8 per cent to 39,932 last year. The export of Ford cars from the UK was exceeded last year by all three Japanese companies producing cars in the UK - Nissan, Toyota and Honda. Ford stayed ahead of Toyota and Honda in overall vehicle exports because of sales of UK-built light commercial vehicles. Sales of used cars bought on credit are continuing to increase at twice the rate of new cars on credit, says HPI, the vehicle finance information organisation, John Griffiths writes. Its figures show that used car sales grew by 10.4 per cent in November compared with the same month last year, while new cars rose 4.5 per cent. World Automotive Statistics.

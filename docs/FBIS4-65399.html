			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 17 (AFP) -- France will slash its  peacekeeping presence in the former Yugoslavia from 6,000 troops  to 3,500 soldiers by the end of the year, Defense Minister  Francois Leotard said Tuesday [17 May].    "We have begun a process of withdrawal of a certain number  of  battalions we have there, first the one in Glina in Krajina  (Serb-controlled territory in Croatia) and then the one in Bihac  in northwest Bosnia," Leotard said in a radio interview.    "Before the end of the year, there will be about 2,500 fewer  French soldiers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia," he  said.    The move came after Foreign Minister Alain Juppe threatened  to pull out all French troops, who make up the largest  contingent of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former  Yugoslavia, if progress towards a peace settlement was not made.    The French UN troops are deployed in both Croatia and  Bosnia.  There are also French naval forces patrolling the Adriatic Sea  and French aircraft based in Italy.</p>

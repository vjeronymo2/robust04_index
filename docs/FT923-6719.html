			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Lloyds plans brand change for Access card LLOYDS BANK, one of the original members of the Access credit card consortium, plans a shake-up of the branding of its 2m Access credit cards. This will effectively convert them into Lloyds Bank credit cards with the MasterCard branding. The move represents the latest step by Lloyds towards direct competition between banks in the credit card market and away from consortium operations. Lloyds has not finally decided what form the change in brand design will take. One option is for the MasterCard logo to be given equal prominence on the credit cards with that of Access. A more radical solution would be to transfer the Access logo from the front of the card to the back. The move will be announced before the end of the year after which the redesigned cards will be issued in stages. The redesign will not directly affect Lloyds' Access customers, the working of cardholders' monthly accounts, or the retail outlets in which the card can be used. In a separate move aimed at building closer links between credit card customers and the banks, Lloyds redesigned its statements last month. They now emphasise the Lloyds branding and give much less prominence to Access. Lloyds does not, however, plan to withdraw from the Access consortium which handles the marketing operations of the 8.8m cards carrying the Access branding. Apart from the four banks which own the Access brand name - National Westminster, Midland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds - Access cards are issued by five smaller banks and building societies. Two months ago the number of employees at the Southend, Essex operations of Access Brand was trimmed from 17 to nine, but the Access banks say that no changes in its marketing role are under consideration. Another of the Access banks said yesterday: 'We are aware of what Lloyds is planning to do, but as far as we are concerned, it is a decision for them alone. We are still committed to the Access branding.' Mrs Jane Jee, Access Brand general manager, said yesterday that she was not aware that Lloyds had any plans to move away from the Access branding. There was some puzzlement in the credit card industry yesterday over why Lloyds was considering a retreat from the brand it helped launch 20 years ago, since Access is regarded as a very strong name. About 41 per cent of UK credit card holders carry cards branded with Access, compared to 33 per cent for Barclaycard, the second largest brand. Access is the UK affiliate of the MasterCard credit card system which also has a third brand name, Eurocard, in Europe. All three brand names are carried on UK Access cards, but some bankers feel that having three brand names on one card is confusing for the customer and obscures the role of the bank issuing the card. A pilot scheme to print customers' photographs on cash cards as a security measure appears to be successful, the Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday. The bank said 28,000 such cards - which cost each customer Pounds 2 - were in circulation and there had not been a single case of misuse following theft or loss, even when other cards stolen at the same time had been used fraudulently.</p>

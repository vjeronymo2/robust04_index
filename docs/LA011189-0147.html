			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> CAUTIONED ABOUT CONFLICTS;  </P> <P> MRS. QUAYLE TO LOOK FOR JOB AFTER INAUGURATION  </P> <P> Marilyn Quayle may break precedent for a vice president's wife by hitting the  job market while Dan Quayle is in office, an aide said today.  </P> <P> Marilyn Quayle, a lawyer, plans an active search a few months after the  inauguration of President-elect Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle on  Jan. 20, an aide said.  </P> <P> A paying job in law, lobbying or a related field for Mrs. Quayle, 39, could  raise serious appearances of conflicts of interest, according to Senate aides.  </P> <P> "As to both her job-hunting and her interests and causes -- whatever she  decides to do from a public standpoint -- it will probably be this spring  sometime," said Quayle spokesman David Beckwith.  </P> <P> He said Marilyn Quayle is serious about getting a job, "but there are obvious  constraints -- you can't be perceived as having a conflict of interest."  </P> <P> Washington law jobs are lucrative, often paying into the high six figures.  </P> <P> Also today, aides said the Quayles are seeking $150,000 in private donations to  refurbish the vice presidential mansion.  </P> <P> They said the Quayles wanted to give more room to their three children.  President-elect Bush and his wife, Barbara, raised $187,000 in a similar manner  for redoing the mansion in 1981.  </P> <P> Dan Quayle, 41, heir to a publishing fortune, resigned this month from the  Senate, where he earned $89,500 a year. He will make $115,000 as vice  president, have a paid staff of about 90 and will get a pay boost to $175,000  if a proposed pay increase clears Congress.  </P></p>

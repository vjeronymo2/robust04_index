			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Arts: A Midsummer Night's Dream - Opera Below a ceiling painted with moons and stars the nightly ritual of dream and awakening which forms the magical theme of A Midsummer Night's Dream begins. The Freemasons' Hall in Covent Garden must be one of the most unusual venues for opera and the challenge is to find operas that will gain from being seen in its hallowed interior. If one cannot have access to the Royal Opera House, the hall is the largest in the area. The BOC Covent Garden Festival used it to strikingly pertinent effect last year for Mozart's Die Zauberflote, where it had the most apt setting for the Temple of the brotherhood. This year Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream was again performed in the round, risking a more significant penalty if the text could not be heard. In the centre stands a huge four-poster bed. Hordes of infant fairies skip around, wearing green-and-white striped pyjamas and cute little green boots, as if they have stepped straight out of Never-Never-Land with Joseph Beattie's cheeky Puck their Peter Pan of a leader. But Jamie Hayes's production, designed by Ruari Murchison, has a darker side too. Puck describes Oberon as 'King of Shadows' and that is what he is here: bald and bespangled, an 'alternative' leader from a fairy underworld, whose authority is diminished only by the lack of nobility in Christopher Robson's counter-tenor voice. His prowling Tytania in black leather bodice and thigh-boots is at least his match and Judith Howarth sings her music with unblemished certainty. The objective of British Youth Opera (under whose auspices the production has been put together) is to encourage young singers, and in the other roles there is a parade of prize-winners from vocal competitions past and present. The four lovers are not easy parts to sing and this quartet made a handsome job of them, the appealing duo of Ruby Philogene's Hermia and Ian Bostridge's Lysander just outstripping their opposite numbers, Carol Smith and Charles Johnston as Helena and Demetrius. Their main problem was trying to get the words across to an audience seated on all sides, as their scenes together involve rapid-fire exchanges. The rustics did better at that, but were less entertaining. Comedy has previously been Hayes's favoured outlet, but the 'tedious brief scene' at the end - led by Jonathan Veira's prima donna of a Bottom - felt decidedly more tedious than brief. There was ample time to examine the detail of Zandra Rhodes's last-scene costumes. Conducting with one eye over her shoulder, Jane Glover succeeded in keeping singers and orchestra together better than anyone could rightfully have expected. In all, there was a warm feeling of community opera. Perhaps the Masons' watchful eye had cast a benign influence over the evening. Principal sponsors British Gas and South Bank University London.

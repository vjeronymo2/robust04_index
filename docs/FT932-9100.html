			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Prison Service meets Group 4 MR DEREK Lewis, the director-general of the Prison Service, yesterday met directors of Group 4, the security company, to review its handling of the first privately managed prisoner-escort contract, Alan Pike writes. The Prison Service said that considerable progress has been made since initial problems when Group 4 began escorting prisoners last month. During the first fortnight of Group 4 escorting prisoners between prisons and courts in the East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, several escaped or were wrongly released. There have been no escapes during the past three weeks. The meeting discussed the implications of Group 4 being asked by the Prison Service to carry out additional work not covered by the original Pounds 9.5m per year contract.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: Ireland's heritage is on the move - Thanks to a windfall from the Irish government, the National Museum of Ireland has been given a historic building on the banks of the Liffey. Patricia Morison talks to the museum's director, Patrick Wallace The National Museum of Ireland has been given the go-ahead for what its director, Dr Patrick Wallace, describes as 'the most important change for this museum in a hundred years'. The museum is to take over Collins Barracks, a well-known legacy of British rule, opposite the Guinness Brewery on the River Liffey. Founded in 1877, the museum on Kildare Street, across the courtyard from the Irish parliament, is best known for incomparable gold from the Bronze Age and for such superb medieval Celtic treasures as the Tara Brooch, St Patrick's Bell, and the Ardagh Chalice. However, only a tiny fraction of the museum's collections can be shown. The enormous collection of Irish folk life, which Wallace calls 'a remarkable testament to the dignity of poverty', has never been out of storage. For five years, parts of the museum have been closed for repairs and renovations. Designed by Sir Thomas Deane and opened in 1899, it is slowly reemerging as a delightfully pretty and intact example of Victorian museum design. There is a grand central gallery roofed in iron and glass, long mock-Tudor galleries with hammer-beam roofs, and colourful majolica doorways made in Leeds. But the problems remained: acute lack of space and, with only half a million visitors a year, a worryingly inconspicuous place in Ireland's cultural life. A new dawn was signalled in last month's budget. Finance minister Bertie Ahern unexpectedly announced that the museum would be given Collins Barracks and a IPounds 10m renovation grant. The IPounds 10m came from a controversial tax amnesty recently introduced for Irish tax-dodgers. Michael D. Higgins, Ireland's first minister for the arts, then announced an additional IPounds 15m grant from the EC's European Structural Fund. Wallace had hopes of getting his hands on Collins Barracks but had not dared to be optimistic. In the 1980s, the museum was told it would be taking over the beautiful 18th-century Royal Hospital at Kilmainham. There was bitter disappointment when the government instead made it the modern art museum. Now Wallace has IPounds 25m and an historic 17-acre site in a part of west Dublin which, although run-down, is attractive and has considerable tourist potential. Originally called the Royal Barracks, Collins Barracks was built between 1701 and 1706 and is still in use by the Irish army, making it the oldest continually occupied barracks in Europe. A pleasing facade is visible from the busy roads along the banks of Liffey, but few Dubliners have ever been inside. Thomas Burgh, the first architect, also designed Trinity College Library and Dr Stevens' Hospital. His covered riding school survives, also Pierce Square and Clarke Square, dignified great courtyards surrounded by four-storey blocks of soldiers' accommodation, pierced by huge archways. Extra floors were added in the last century, and at its peak, the barracks housed 500 horses and 5,000 soldiers. Conditions were dreadful and cholera was rife. In the next few months, the army will leave and work will start to turn Collins Barracks into a repository for a rich variety of Ireland's heritage. The narrow rooms of the Clarke Square building will house European decorative arts; Georgian silver, Irish lace, ceramics, and fine Irish furniture. Wallace plans to have a temporary exhibition up by the end of the year. Some of next year's major celebration of the Vikings in Ireland may also be exhibited there. Wallace is keenly aware of the potential offered by the gaunt old barracks as a museum for militaria and a shrine to Irish republicanism. Local tradition has it that 'the Curlies', revolutionaries killed in the abortive 1798 rising, were buried on the green esplanade beneath the barracks. Arbour Hill is right behind, and the churchyard with the impressive memorial to the martyrs of the 1916 Easter Rising. Militaria, musical instruments, coins, stamps, carriages, and scientific instruments will have their galleries, as well as the ethnographic collection. The doctor on Captain Cook's second voyage was a Dubliner who brought back Maori treasures, which have not been exhibited for 25 years. Conservation workshops are urgently needed and eventually, there will be crafts' workshops. The heart of the site will be a IPounds 11m purpose-built museum. The architects will be the Office of Public Works, which converted the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham and the new building will be able to take in travelling museum shows. 'Ireland has never got the blockbusters, Tutenkhamun or Benin bronzes, but now that will change,' says Wallace. Wallace plans to keep Kildare Street for Irish antiquities. Ireland's exceptional archaeological heritage (a Viking gold necklace was dug up only last week) will easily fill the old building. The most controversial issue is the fate of the huge collection illustrating Ireland's vanishing folk traditions. Wallace wants it for Collins Barracks, to give an 'upstairs-downstairs' view of Irish social history. 'The Ireland from which the millions went over the world, it's all there, our folk beliefs, superstitions, regional traditions.' The arts minister is said to favour creating a new rural museum at Daingean in County Offaly. Wallace's plans will cost substantially more than IPounds 25m, not least for more staff. Museum charges may well have to be introduced. In the past, fund-raising from Irish business and private individuals has brought small rewards. As Wallace ruefully comments: 'Irish millionaires want a winner at the Curragh and an actress.' Yet he also detects a change in public attitudes in the past few years and a new curiosity to discover something about Ireland's heritage. The proof of that will be what happens now at Collins Barracks.</p>

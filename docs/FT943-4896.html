			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Warrant for Mexico tycoon The Mexican government has ordered the arrest of Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, head of one of the country's largest banking groups and of Del Monte Fresh Produce, the international fruit company once owned by Polly Peck International. The government has charged him with fraud. The finance ministry immediately took over Mr Cabal's Banca Cremi and Banco Union - which have combined assets equivalent to nearly Dollars 11bn and deposits of Dollars 9.8bn - and their subsidiaries, including a foreign exchange house, and leasing and factoring companies. It said that the alleged irregularities suspected so far did not affect the banks' ability to meet their obligations, but all depositors would be protected under the law. The first casualty of the charges may be Mr Cabal's intended purchase of Del Monte Foods, the San-Francisco based canned food company. In June, Mr Cabal and his investor group agreed to buy, for Dollars 277m in cash and about Dollars 700m in debt, the San-Francisco based canned food company. However, according to Mexican government officials, the transaction has not yet been completed. Mr Cabal had planned to re-merge Del Monte Fresh and Del Monte Foods, which were split up and sold by RJR Nabisco of the US in 1989. Mr Cabal subsequently bought Del Monte Fresh out of UK bankruptcy proceedings against Polly Peck. Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, announced on Monday night that the attorney-general's office had issued an arrest warrant against Mr Cabal, accusing him of having illegally loaned himself money from his banks to acquire various business interests. These loans, the ministry alleges, 'represent serious alterations to the accounting of the bank and failure by the administration to observe basic banking practices.' Mr Cabal has risen from relative obscurity to run one of the country's largest business empires, helped by the Mexican government itself. However, Mr Cabal is being sued by Eastbrook, a now defunct US trading house, which alleges that he defrauded it of Dollars 70m of loans. Mr Cabal has vigorously denied these allegations. A government official said yesterday morning that Mr Cabal had not yet been apprehended. There were reports that he may be in Europe. However, the official said four of Mr Cabal's senior executives have been arrested. About 10 people connected to the case were in jail.</p>

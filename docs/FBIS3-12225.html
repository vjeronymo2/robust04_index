During the session, Prime  Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali briefed the Senate on the  government contacts on the massacre perpetrated by the Israeli  settlers in the Ibrahimi Mosque yesterday. The Senate then  issued a statement condemning the ugly crime.    [Begin al-Majali recording] In the name of God, the  merciful,  the compassionate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Brother members of  the honorable Senate: I would like to stress the feelings of the  government, which fully supports all that was said in this  honorable Senate this morning. We want to inform the Senate that  denunciation--and I think this happens for the first time in the  history of this cause--has come from all parties: The European  and American parties and even the Israeli leadership regardless  of whether this Israeli denunciation is a fact or a cover. But  this is the first time such a denunciation occurs in the manner  we all have heard. It is natural that upon the directives of  his majesty the king, contacts were held on the Arab, Islamic,  and international levels and the third world states. The  ambassadors were summoned and informed of the importance and  seriousness of this incident and its impact on the entire peace  process. The crime is unprecedented in history. It was killing  in cold blood, not killing in which there was resistance. They  were in the mosque praying. Therefore, this takes a world  dimension. We should act on the information, press, and  diplomatic levels so that this fact reaches all western minds  continuously and persistently in order to be greatly influential.    We were informed that the Americans are taking this issue  very seriously and they denounce it. Hence, they supported an  old request made by Jordan to hold the negotiations in one place  and to hold them continuously until results are achieved. I  think the U.S. President's call on Israel and the president of  the Palestinian state to send all delegations to Washington is  meant to discuss this matter very seriously. We hope this is so.    On this occasion, we insist that the root cause of these  terrorist acts and killings is the occupation of land and the  construction of settlements. Therefore, we now insist that the  settlements, as we insisted in all our negotiations, are the  obstacle. In all their statements, the United States and the  West also said that. But they might not have felt the  seriousness of this issue except after the perpetration of this  crime yesterday.    Moreover, the UN Security Council met. We supported this  meeting, in which discussions and deliberations are still  continuing.    As for what concerns us here, the government announced an  official three-day mourning. It set up a fund for donations.  As you see, members of the Senate are offering their  contributions. Moreover, the government allocated 100,000  Jordanian dinars, in addition to His Majesty King Husayn's  donation of another 100,000 Jordanian dinars. A full campaign  will be launched in support of our kinsfolk in the occupied  territories. One of the things from which they suffer is the  financial aspect. We should not forget this. Unfortunately,  for a long time our kinsfolk have not had financial support  adequate to enable them to have at least the basic requirements.    Therefore, we hope this support by the Senate will enhance  this and be able to reach those who need it. The committee [as  heard] is comprised of both the private and public sectors. The  government will continue all its measures based on our stands in  Washington. We told the head of the delegation there to convey  our full feelings and to observe the situation in order to adopt  a united stand with the Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese  brothers on the issue of negotiations there. We believe that if  the Americans commit us and force Israel to sit continuously and  act in a serious manner, perhaps the harmful incident might help  in finding a solution or reaching clearly defined measures soon.  We will keep the Senate informed of any further developments.    As for the security situation, about 5,000 people are  currently staging a march at al-Husayni Mosque. However, it is  a peaceful march. Community colleges and universities closed  down. In al- Baq'ah, about 5,000 people staged a march toward  Suwaylih. Some of them returned, while others are still there.  There is a march of about 400 people in al-Zarqa'. A march  staged at 'Azmi al-Mufti camp is over. People at the Jerash  camp are on their way to hold a prayer for the dead. There are  small gatherings in various parts of the country.    We support all forms of expression. However, we are afraid  of marches because various elements get involved. As everyone  knows, those with different views unfortunately take advantage  of marches to carry out acts of violence that we can do without.  Let the marches be peaceful and strong and let the support be  in its right place.    The government called on the Arab world to close ranks  because this will enable us to avoid such an incident and obtain  our rights. We call for and fully support holding an Arab  summit. We support your request to hold a meeting of Arab  parliaments in order to adopt a stand toward this incident.    Thank you, sir. [end recording]</p>

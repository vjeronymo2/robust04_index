			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE THE CHILL, ARMORY REMAINS CLOSED TO HOMELESS  </P> <P> Even though nighttime temperatures in the coldest populated area of Los Angeles  County -- the Antelope Valley -- have routinely fallen below 40 degrees this  month, local officials have been unable to persuade the state to open the  Palmdale National Guard armory as a shelter for the area's homeless until at  least Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> State armories, including five elsewhere in Los Angeles County, were made  available last year starting Nov. 14 on nights expected to be colder than 40  degrees. Even that was two weeks beyond the planned starting date, county  officials said.  </P> <P> The armory in Palmdale was not among those provided to county cold-weather  programs last year by the state Office of Emergency Services. But because of  the area's growing homeless population and cold winter nights when the  temperature drops into the 20s, it is included this year.  </P> <P> The start of the state program has been delayed by an effort to implement new  regulations aimed at solving health and safety issues, including fights and  problems with sanitation at some shelters, that have generated complaints in  the past, state officials said.  </P> <P> Local officials are not unsympathetic to the efforts to prevent a repeat of  those problems. But, meanwhile, the weather is growing colder, especially in  the Antelope Valley, which has one of the harshest and longest winters in  Southern California.  </P> <P> "I don't object to the state setting new safeguards, but if they are going to  have a cold-weather program, they should make the armories available when it  gets cold," said Larry Johnson, assistant director of the county Department of  Community and Senior Citizen Services.  </P> <P> Betty Passerello of the state Office of Emergency Services acknowledged that  "we have stumbled a little bit this year" with the sheltering program. "I think  this program has worked very effectively, but it has not been without its  problems," she said.  </P> <P> Between November and March of last year, 166,000 people took shelter on cold  nights in armories in California, 11,359 of them in Los Angeles County,  according to state statistics.  </P> <P> Fights, attempted murders and rapes occurred at armories in some counties last  year, Passerello said. In others, officials were not equipped to deal with the  illnesses of the homeless people or to clean up the facilities after they were  used. As a result, there were numerous complaints from the National Guard and  others.  </P> <P> "You put 200 people in a facility that is not designed for them and you are  going to have problems," she said. The state is still drawing up new  requirements for counties to hire public health experts, security guards and  professional cleanup crews at armories this year.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County already takes such measures, Johnson said. He said his  department plans to step up lobbying efforts this week to get the shelter  program started as soon as possible.  </P> <P> With the high desert's homeless population growing, the special dangers posed  by cold weather should be recognized earlier next year, said Kathryn Barger, a  deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich who works with programs for the homeless.  </P> <P> Officials are still trying to determine the exact number of homeless people in  the Antelope Valley. When Lancaster opened a homeless shelter last year, social  workers estimated the number to be in the hundreds and possibly higher.  </P> <P> "It's something we are going to have to address, both morally and due to the  strict guidelines" that call for emergency shelters when the temperature falls  below 40 degees, Barger said.  </P> <P> Passerello agreed. "We better revisit it if it really has been that cold down  there," she said. She said her office is exploring the possibility of finding  an interim facility to use as a shelter.  </P> <P> The nighttime temperature in the Antelope Valley hovered near emergency levels  even before the county began the cold-weather program Nov. 1. According to  National Weather Service statistics, the low temperature in Lancaster dipped  below 40 degrees nine days in October, with an average low in the upper 40s.  </P> <P> This month, even though daytime temperatures were in the 60s and 70s, the  average low has been in the high 30s, said meteorologist Steve Burback of  Weather Data, a private meteorological company. On Nov. 5, the low dropped to  24 degrees.  </P> <P> Lynn Davis, director of the Lancaster city shelter, said the sooner the armory  opens, the better.  </P> <P> The county's cold-weather program has been referring homeless people to the  40-bed city shelter operated by Catholic Charities. A maximum of 35 of the  shelter's beds have been occupied in recent weeks, with as many as nine people  being referred from the county's program, officials said.  </P> <P> "Right now it's not a problem," Johnson said, agreeing with state officials  that the current demand for shelter is being met.  </P> <P> But Johnson said the number of people using the Lancaster shelter will grow as  the weather gets worse and the threat of snow and rain increases. The county  may then have to provide hotel and motel vouchers, which cost the county $25 a  person rather than the $10 per person it costs the county for the armory beds.  </P> <P> "That's a drain on the program," which lasts through March and has a $500,000  county budget, Johnson said. "To the extent the state can't meet their  obligation, it's a drain. We don't want to run out of money."  </P> <P> Furthermore, the cold-weather program could disrupt the Lancaster shelter,  which provides social and vocational services for ongoing residents, Johnson  said.  </P> <P> Davis, the director of the Lancaster shelter, said the number of people using  the county's program does not reflect the size of the valley's homeless  population. Some may not know about the shelter program and others may not have  a way to get to the city's shelter.  </P> <P> The growth in the number of homeless people in the Antelope Valley has mirrored  the area's population boom overall and is reflected in the increasing number of  applications for public aid and housing vouchers.  </P> <P> A visible symbol is an abandoned farm building on Sierra Highway near Avenue I  that people on the street call the "Tin Shed." The vast metal building has only  two walls and a concrete floor, but it provides some shelter for as many as 20  homeless people who build bonfires there at night to keep warm and who sleep in  lean-tos and old cars.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies, who have conducted periodic sweeps of the building because  of complaints of thefts from nearby businesses, say many of the shed's  residents are alcoholics and drug addicts.  </P></p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Clinton signs three-way N-missile agreement: Ukraine nuclear arsenal to go as US and Russia end mutual targeting President Bill Clinton wrapped up a successful Moscow visit yesterday by signing agreements to dismantle Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and to end the targeting of US and Russian missiles at each other after May 30. He also heard President Boris Yeltsin promise active Russian participation in Nato's new programme of co-operation with the nations of the former Warsaw Pact. The US president rewarded Mr Yeltsin's renewed commitment to economic reform by announcing that he had earmarked an additional Dollars 900m (Pounds 608.1m) in assistance in next year's US budget, to be presented in February. He said that meant that, with some existing appropriations unspent, Russia was assured of at least Dollars 1bn in US funds in each of the next two years. But the upbeat comments of Mr Clinton, Mr Yeltsin and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine praising the various substantive achievements of the past 48 hours could not entirely dispel a sense that not all the commitments on paper would easily be translated into action. The Ukrainian agreement, which provides for the dismantling and removal of the most potent nuclear warheads and missiles over the next 10 months, still has to be ratified by the parliament in Kiev, a prospect that even US officials privately rated as a 50-50 chance. In Kiev last night Mrs Tatyana Yakheyeva, one of the members of the parliamentary commission on Start 1, said: 'At the very least there will be a veto on the deal - at the most, Kravchuk faces impeachment.' At the same time, a row broke out between Mr Anatoly Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, on whether Ukraine had been promised relief on its Rbs 1,000bn energy debt to Russia. Both Mr Clinton and Mr Kravchuk, the latter visibly elated at his presence on a world stage and looking forward to a Washington visit in March, argued that the more Ukrainians learned about the treaty, the greater the likelihood of approval. Benefits include an estimated Dollars 1bn Ukrainian share of the Dollars 12bn, 20-year agreement also signed yesterday for US purchases from Russia of highly enriched uranium extracted from missiles. On Nato, Mr Yeltsin said its Partnership for Peace, which he called 'a very good formula', should still be seen as only one of the mechanisms for enhancing European security. He also warned against any Nato attempt to 'dismember us' by admitting eastern European nations 'one by one'. US officials insisted, however, that Mr Yeltsin's commitment to the partnership was stronger than they had expected and more than offset his apparent reservations. Once Russia has formally applied to take part, the respective military commands will work out co-operation procedures over the next few months. A big cloud still hangs over economic reform. Deep political divisions were further reflected when the lower house of the Russian parliament elected as Speaker Mr Ivan Rybkin, a former communist who now belongs to the conservative Agrarian party. He was returned with support from the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats, headed by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who, before becoming involved in a fight with a reformist MP, continued in countless interviews to pour scorn on Mr Clinton, Mr Yeltsin and even the existence of US financial assistance. The Russian president's tart rejoinder was that the upper house was 'smarter and more intellectual'. He maintained that the 60 per cent who voted in favour of the new Russian constitution was a more reliable indicator of reform sentiment than the composition of the parliament. Still, Mr Yeltsin, anxious not to appear too much the supplicant, again nudged Mr Clinton towards making the Group of Seven industrialised nations a club of eight by admitting Russia. He said Russia wanted 'full-scale co-operation' in the transition to a market economy.

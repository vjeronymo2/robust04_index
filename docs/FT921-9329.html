			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft posts 32% fall METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German metals, mining and engineering company, continues to suffer from low non-ferrous metal prices but hopes that profits will improve in the current year, ending September 1992. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, said yesterday that earnings in the first four months of the 1991-92 fiscal year had been slightly below those for the same period of the previous year. Two depressants on prices have been smelting over-capacity in western Europe and increased sales from stockpiles in Russia and eastern Europe. In addition to low metal prices, continuing problems with new smelters and in the motor components industry held profits back. Last year, group net income dropped 32 per cent to DM179m (Dollars 112m) on turnover 7 per cent higher at DM21.2bn. Metallgesellschaft is holding its dividend at DM10 a share. Earnings per share slumped from DM29.7 to DM10.3, reflecting minority interests However, the company said cash-flow was expected to increase substantially this year after a drop of 8 per cent to DM657m in 1990-91. Included in the results from January 1 this year are the non-paper activities of Feldmuhle Nobel, which Metallgesellschaft bought from Stora of Sweden for DM1.45bn. Metallgesellschaft holds 80 per cent, and Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank own 10 per cent each. These activities comprise Buderus (building materials and stainless steel goods), Dynamit Nobel (explosives and plastics) and Cerasiv (ceramics and engineering plastics). Last year, these activities made a pre-tax profit of DM200m. One reason that the group feels the bottom has been reached in its downward profits trend is that its new smelters, with advanced operating and anti-pollution technology, are starting to contribute to profits after high start-up costs and some teething troubles. Also, older smelters operated by rival companies are thought likely to close gradually for environmental reasons. Among other group activities, Lurgi, the industrial plant subsidiary, booked a 40 per cent rise in new orders in the first quarter. Kolbenschmidt, the motor parts maker, was trying to recover from a profits slump caused partly by the poor state of the US market.</p>

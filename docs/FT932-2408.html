			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US soya prices leap as rain holds up planting SOYABEAN FUTURES prices at the Chicago Board of Trade exploded yesterday as rain continued to delay plantings in important midwest growing regions and talk of strengthening export sales inspired buyers. The November delivery position hit Dollars 6.03 a bushel, and was up 17 3/4 cents at Dollars 5.99 at the close of trading. November delivery reflects prices for the new crop harvest. Futures for July delivery were up 15 1/4 cents at Dollars 6.01 1/4 . Statistics released earlier this week showed soyabean planting in Iowa, the second largest soyabean producing state after Illinois, was well behind annual averages. Only 60 per cent of the planned area had been planted and continuing rains this week have led traders to conclude the 3.5m unseeded acres will not produce high-quality beans once they are planted. Forecasts for another three to six inches of rain in the key soyabean growing regions by Saturday helped prices to move higher. Mr Dick Lowey, soyabean analyst for Chicago-based AgResouces, said that acreage not planted by the first week in July would suffer low yields. 'Traders are beginning to realise that the old adage 'rain makes grain' does not apply here,' he said. 'We may be looking at severe acreage loss on one hand, and if the ground gets planted, we could see a dramatic loss in yields.' Analysts were busy reducing yield estimates for the new crop, and with them the surplus from next year's crop. The US Department of Agriculture has forecast that 310m bushels of the last US soyabean crop will remain in storage after exports and domestic use at the end of the crop year. Next year, analysts put the carry-over at a meagre 210m bushels. On a 2.2bn bushel crop, 'that doesn't leave much room for serious crop problems in July and August,' one soyabean trader noted. Traders rarely factor a weather premium into soyabean prices this early in the season. However, international trends are at work. Three weeks of flooding in soyabean growing regions of Argentina have caused private forecasters to drop their crop estimates there to 10m tonnes, from the official 11.4m-tonne forecast. The Argentine rains could also result in poor crop quality and a delayed harvest. Traders expected an export sales report to be released after the market closed Thursday to show additional US sales to Europe. 'This is export business we haven't counted on,' said Mr Lowey. 'We didn't expect any European sales for the next eight weeks.' Brazil, which has usually begun new crop soya exports by this time, has been watching the Argentine situation and might play it to advantage, analysts said. 'Brazil doesn't seem compelled to market its crop as quickly this year. Farmers are receiving better subsidies, and will wait until prices rise,' one trader explained.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Why 1,000 Revenue staff may lose jobs UP TO 1,000 staff may lose their jobs at the Inland Revenue in the next few months because public demand for two methods of reclaiming tax has been lower than expected. Advertising of the services available at claims offices has cost the Revenue Pounds 11m in the past two years. The Revenue announced on Thursday that the operations would be reorganised with a reduction in staff and a 'rationalisation' of offices. The plan should save about Pounds 10m a year in salaries. By the end of the financial year in April 1,000 jobs will go, resulting in the closure of four offices and reallocation of space, since a further 15 offices will no longer carry out repayment work. Up to 400 jobs will be created in the five remaining offices - Belfast, Bootle, Glenrothes, Leicester and St Austell. But unions expect that about 600 jobs will go from the Revenue in spite of attempts to avoid compulsory redundancies. The Revenue's claims offices have been facing two types of repayment demand. The first is for tax credits on share dividends from up to 2.5m married women below the tax threshold. Such claims have been possible since the introduction of independent taxation in 1990. The second type of demand is from an estimated 15m non-taxpayers claiming back tax on bank and building society interest, which since last year has been paid net of basic rate tax to all but those who specially register to receive interest gross. More than 7m people have now registered to receive interest gross, although according to a recent Revenue survey about 1m of these were not eligible. The Revenue estimated that there would be about 8m claims - covering all of the remaining 15m non-taxpayers who were eligible for claims. But it now expects no more than 2m claims this year. Officials concede that the level of response has been disappointing. Suggested explanations include ignorance of the programmes, apathy, a belief that repayments amount to charity or a desire not to attract attention.</p>

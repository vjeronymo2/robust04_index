			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kotelnikova report under the "Privatization </F> Prospects" rubric: "State Duma Not Ready To Change  Privatization Course"]    [Text] The hearings on the results of denationalization  and the 1994 privatization program attended by deputies of both  chambers of the Federal Assembly, which ended yesterday at the  State Duma, have split the representative authority into  "Chubays supporters," "Chubays opponents," those favoring the  sale of state property at market prices, and those who oppose  "the expansion of foreign capital." Evidently, the mutually  exclusive nature of the proposals drawn up by the deputies can  block any decision on privatization they might decide to make.  This situation will enable the president to assume the key role  in the drafting and implementation of denationalization policy.    The final day of the expanded hearings at the State Duma  (KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported their beginning 13 April) enabled  various political associations to present their views on  privatization and its further prospects. As expected,  privatization (as was the case with the Supreme Soviet) remains  an apple of discord between the executive and representative  branches. Unlike the government, which now knows for sure that  further privatization should be carried out in favor of  investment and "an effective owner," the deputies lacked a joint  approach. Whereas Sergey Glazyev of the Democratic Party of  Russia faction demanded a change in the policy of check  privatization, which "has led us into a deadlock and a morass,"  Vladimir Martemyanov, representative of the Communist Party,  opposed "the unprecedented sale of Russian enterprises to  foreign capitalists." As an alternative, he proposes that  denationalization be replaced with destatization, as a result of  which the bulk of enterprises will be transferred into  "collective ownership," and privatization will be limited "only  to small enterprises."    Vladimir Lisichkin and Vyacheslav Marychev, representatives  of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], attempted in  their addresses and statements from the audience to expose "the  criminal nature" of privatization "according to Chubays." The  main pathos of their pronouncements and recommendations was  designed to give reasons for the State Property Committee  chairman's removal, particularly because "he has been tripping  up the president." Driven by concern over the president, Mr.  Marychev said that "the LDPR will not let Chubays out of Norilsk  once he has left for it" (the deputy prime minister is going to  Norilsk on a business trip).    Meanwhile, representatives of "Russia's Choice" backed the  post- voucher privatization concept drawn up by the State  Property Committee and proposed that the state intensify control  over the management of state property and the state's share in  denationalized enterprises. Although this stance did not draw  support from representatives of other political organizations,  Chubays (a "Russia's Choice" member) said that he was "content  with the results of the hearings." The deputies' political  ambitions make it impossible for them to control  denationalization. This situation has strengthened Viktor  Chernomyrdin, who, according to Chubays, "will not allow  privatization to halt" (among other things, yesterday the prime  minister signed the decree "On the Practice of Agricultural  Changes in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast," approving the experience of  land denationalization). Since the head of the cabinet has  approved in general the post-voucher privatization concept aimed  at involving "an effective owner" in economic development, the  State Property Committee drafters see their chances to implement  these plans increasing.</p>

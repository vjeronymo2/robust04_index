			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Food and Drink: A culinary philosophy spiced with success - Nicholas Lander meets a French chef who believes fervently in keeping his cooking close to his local roots 'I DO not serve caviar in my restaurant because I do not know any sturgeon fishermen.' It was almost midnight and Olivier Roellinger was confidently expounding his culinary philosophy. We were sitting in a small manoir that had been the Roellinger family house in Cancale, Brittany, but has for 12 years served as his restaurant. The originality of Roellinger's approach is matched by his modesty. When I had asked to meet him I had expected Roellinger to join my table wearing a personalised chef's jacket - after all, he is a two-star Michelin chef. Instead, we were led away from the other diners and upstairs to a small salon where he joined us wearing simple whites, cut Breton style, and a pair of working men's boots. He apologised if he appeared tired. He had been up before dawn to drive to Rennes, 36 miles away, for its Saturday market. 'Walking around this market is an essential and very enjoyable part of my job. Here I meet my suppliers, the fishermen from the west of Brittany, the poultry and vegetable suppliers from the east, who are such vital ingredients in what I cook.' The cooking in French restaurants had, Roellinger believed, lost touch with its local roots and the seasons. But he was confident this was changing. Other French chefs were taking up this challenge and he cited Michel Bras at Laguiole near Conques as a fellow traveller. His menus read, therefore, like the results of an extensive shopping trip. Wonderful shellfish, not just the mussels and oysters which Cancale bountifully provides but locally-caught crab, lobster and clams. These are used in conjunction with herbs and vegetables grown on the salt marshes along the coast which merged into one first course of tiny steamed scallops, served on a shell with miniscule home-grown new potatoes, morel mushrooms and cream. Local fishermen, whom Roellinger has come to know well, bring the main courses: Dover sole, John Dory, skate, turbot and sea bass. Most conveniently, the marshes that stretch from Cancale to Mont St Michel provide the area's best-known speciality, the pre-sale lamb, which has developed a distinctive flavour from its seaside grazing. Yet this was just the obvious aspect of Roellinger's cooking because, as we talked, it transpired that he had never had any intention of becoming a chef. He had graduated as a chemist (his wife, who runs the front of house with a young, enthusiastic team, is a qualified pharmacist) when, in 1980, he had started to cook. Eighteen months later in April 1982 they converted the living room into a restaurant. Roellinger's imagination was fired by the history of St Malo, the nearby port. He says: 'My cooking is neither French nor Breton but that of St Malo.' Two hundred years ago St Malo was the wealthiest port in France, buoyed by the success of the Compagnie des Indes (the equivalent of the British East India Company) in sending ships out to the Indian Ocean, Indonesia and Persia and bringing them back laden with the spices - pepper, ginger, cinammon and cloves - that were all the rage at the court of Louis XIV. Unusually for a Frenchman, Roellinger uses these spices as an integral part of his cuisine, partly in homage to his region's past and partly to forge new tastes and flavours. He buys them directly, closing the restaurant from mid-December to March to be able to travel to expand his knowledge (and also his range of rums of which there are 14 by the glass including a 1929 from Martinique at FFr350, Pounds 42, a measure). His own taste and the fact that he makes up each batch of spices weekly prevents this flavouring from being too heavy or too hot. As a first course, local lobster is transformed by a sauce using small amounts of ginger, galangal, allspice berries, mace, nutmeg, tamarind paste and coriander, while to the local lamb Roellinger adds a teaspoon of green cardamom, cumin, coriander, sesame and nigella. As one of the desserts, possibly the weakest arm of his repertoire, Roellinger produced a pain d'epices with his version of an apple crumble. But the overall effect is stunning, food that is appetising and full of flavour, and a menu that makes choice difficult. Close to the restaurant the Roellingers have a small house, Les Rimains, with six rooms overlooking the sea. Last September they converted an extraordinary seaside mansion, built in 1925 and overlooking the bay of Mont St Michel, into an hotel, La Maison Richeux, where the bedrooms are given the names of spices rather than numbers and there is a simpler, less expensive dining room, Le Coquillage. There is also a free taxi service provided to and from the restaurant - in a 32-year-old London taxi with right hand drive and a wooden fascia. Maison de Bricourt, 35260 Cancale, France. Tel 99 89 64 76, fax 99 89 88 47. Dinner from FFr500, rooms FFr1,100.</p>

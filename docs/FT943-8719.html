			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Spreading the wealth - In the first of an occasional series on employee shareownership in private companies, Richard Gourlay looks at its effect as a motivating agent CMG Computer Management Group is one of those rare companies about which champions of widespread employee share ownership should be shouting from the hilltops. Founded 30 years ago, the European computer services company that helps industry and government make better use of computers has grown to 2,000 employees but is still a private company. Some 200 of these people have been with CMG for more than 10 years, double the average in the software industry, which suggests that it has avoided the bane of many smaller companies' existence - how to motivate employees. Successful businesses generate loyalty. But Douglas Gorman, CMG co-founder and current chairman, believes extending share ownership through the company was a crucial motivating ingredient, particularly in a business where the assets wore shoes and went home each night. As a measure of the now blurring distinction between employee and owner, staff have spent Pounds 14m buying CMG shares since the founders started dispersing shares in 1968. 'Once the company started to take off, we offered people the shares,' Gorman says. 'We have to assume people want the same kind of things as we did - capital growth and involvement.' Gorman has travelled further along this path of employee participation than many founders of successful companies. But organisations which promote wider share ownership, such as Proshare, say many private company owners are unaware of the benefits of spreading ownership. Increasing motivation and a sense of sharing in the fruits of success is one benefit. But for the owner seeking a total or partial sale of shares, employee share option schemes are also tax-efficient vehicles for transferring ownership to employees. So when is the right time for owners of a growing private company to consider selling shares, granting options, starting a Save As You Earn-based scheme or setting up an ESOP? Peter Kindersley is in no doubt. The co-founder and chairman of Dorling Kindersley, the publishing and multimedia company, who last month made Pounds 2.6m of his own shares available to his senior managers in an option scheme, says there is no time like the present. 'It is a no-lose situation,' Kindersley says of the scheme he began nearly 20 years ago. 'I have had nothing but good out of it. It makes people work together much better and makes people happier.' Proshare agrees. As long as the business is on a sound footing, there is a case for introducing some form of employee participation. 'This is a huge under-exploited possibility for the private sector,' says David Senior, Proshare's director of company services. But like Dorling Kindersley, CMG was only able to contemplate a share scheme because it had a sound foundation and was growing successfully. Gorman says some of the credit for CMG's success goes to Charles de Gaulle. After the French president blocked the UK's entry into the Common Market in 1963, Gorman decided continental Europe was where the future lay and that CMG needed to be there. At a time when some of his staff were reluctant even to expand beyond the company's base in Croydon, south London, Gorman decided to open in the Netherlands. The Dutch business took off, through contracts with the government and Philips, the electronics company. But Gorman is convinced his staff turnover levels were lower than the industry norm at a crucial phase in CMG's development because of the share scheme. 'They would have splintered off had we not given shares,' Gorman says of the staff who helped build the business. 'The share scheme has a lot to do with staff retention.' Gorman first started offering shares when the company had only 17 employees in 1967, three years after it was founded. From the early days, CMG's shares traded once a year. The price was decided by two external assessors, the company's auditors and a merchant bank. There was no bid-offer spread. And the founders made available the shares to meet whatever demand there was at the designated price. Over the years this process has reduced Gorman's stake in the company from 40 per cent to 15 per cent. But CMG only became a true employee-owned company when Gorman's co-founders - together owning 60 per cent of the company - sold their shares. 'People put in a huge financial effort, like taking out loans, to buy the shares,' says Gorman. Within a period of 18 months the founders' combined stake fell from 75 per cent to 28 per cent. 'It was dramatic. In the next two or three years the company really took off more than before - there was a release of entrepreneurial atmosphere,' says Gorman. 'The difference was gigantic. People said: 'If we don't like things we can outvote Gorman or get rid of him'.' For some owner managers, such an open invitation to rebellion might be too much to swallow. Accustomed to their word being law, many founders might not stomach such breaches of discipline. Gorman says this democratisation of the decision process was less unpalatable because the three founders had always discussed strategic moves. The only significant insurrection Gorman reports was led by the co-founder with the smallest stake. Isolated in his view that CMG should float sooner rather than later, he started a pressure group to canvass support. When it came to a vote he found little support, Gorman says. The system worked until three years ago when the company grew too big and the share scheme became unwieldy. 'The value of the shares rose faster than salaries so we are going to a flotation to have a market in the shares,' says Gorman. 'There were more sellers than buyers and we decided as a temporary step we would sell to outsiders.' As a result, CMG shareholders sold 4 per cent of the company's equity to Midland Montagu Ventures, now named Montagu Private Equity, for Pounds 3m. By that time the impact of wider ownership was waning. 'I think as a company gets bigger the positive feeling of owning shares, the feeling of belonging to a select club get diminished slowly.' Dorling Kindersley's growing size also lay behind Peter Kindersley's apparent largesse last month. He shares Gorman's belief in the motivational effect of employee share ownership. 'It is a positive thing,' he says. 'We are trying to keep people and not trying to prevent them from going.' The problem was that senior executives arriving at the company were out of step with colleagues who had been collecting shares since Kindersley started the employee share participation scheme. At the same time, Kindersley wanted to push the share option scheme further down the company. Making his own shares available freed up the ordinary option scheme which, with a limited amount of share options, would otherwise have been used up by senior management. The approach is unusual, if not unique. It is certainly enlightened self-interest. But variations on the theme are only slowly catching on. This is in spite of studies carried out by the Involvement and Participation Association, an organisation supported by unions and employees. These show that people in companies with share schemes that reach all employees have more positive attitudes than those without them. To people like Gorman, such findings are obvious. The old demarcation lines in the UK that so often lead to conflict, mistrust and lack of co-operation are fatal for the development of many businesses, he believes. This is particularly true when businesses are smallest and retaining good people is toughest. For many companies, introducing share participation schemes that reward and motivate may provide a more certain way of breaking into the growth corridor and staying there.</p>

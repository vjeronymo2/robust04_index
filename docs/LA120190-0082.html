			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRANFORD MARSALIS IMPROVISES AT CENTER;  </P> <P> THE SAXOPHONIST'S RESPONSIVE QUARTET GAVE FRESH TREATMENTS TO A NUMBER OF  FAMILIAR TUNES.  </P> <P> Branford Marsalis can't leave well enough alone.  </P> <P> The saxophonist's appearance Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center opened with a version of "Cheek to Cheek" that would have made Irving  Berlin's lips pucker. Marsalis twisted the familiar theme in ways that made it  almost unrecognizable, rushing the melody here, falling behind there, and  sometimes ignoring it completely.  </P> <P> Even tunes previously recorded by the quartet -- which includes pianist Kenny  Kirkland, bassist Robert Hurst and drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts -- were given  fresh rhythmic and thematic treatments. Keith Jarrett's "Rose Petals," heard on  Marsalis' recent recording "Crazy People Music," became a lush, sultry ballad  shaded by Watts' gentle mallet work. Marsalis' own "Mr. Steepee," the kind of  up-tempo workout John Coltrane might have penned for himself, had the  saxophonist stringing together rollicking tenor lines with barely a pause.  Kirkland added spunky, block-chord accompaniment before laying out to let the  saxophonist and Watts battle it out as a duo.  </P> <P> Like Sonny Rollins, Marsalis is adept at making meaningful statements without  leaving the middle register of his instrument. He packed tenor solos with  flowing lines while seldom resorting to the high-end wailing that so many  saxophonists use to express emotion. Though apparently plagued by a squeaky  reed in the early going, Marsalis' tone was warm, ripe and rich with breath.  His soprano sound still owes something to Wayne Shorter, but his inventive  excursions showed he's definitely his own man.  </P> <P> Despite their leader's almost athletic ability, Watts and Kirkland proved to be  the evening's most satisfying improvisationists. The drummer coaxed  almost-melodic passages from his modest kit, matching storms of bass and  tom-tom rolls with delicate snare and cymbal play. Kirkland's more considered  approach mixed blistering runs with sweeping block-chord statements and moments  of sweet melodic beauty. It was Kirkland's lyrical approach that put romance in  "Cheek to Cheek."  </P> <P> Hurt by a mix that left his tone a bit muddied, bassist Hurst took the  spotlight on Marsalis' bluesy "Housed From Edward" (renamed here to honor  Watts' and Kirkland's mothers, who were in the audience), setting a deliberate  pace that he spiked with deep-seated plucks and gut-bucket snap. The tune's  minimalist qualities made the quartet's responsiveness especially apparent,  with Kirkland answering Marsalis' one-liners with tidbits of Thelonious Monk  and, at one point, the theme from "The Twilight Zone." Despite the group's  relaxed, practically playful stage presence, their ensemble play was tighter  than Scrooge at Christmas.  </P> <P> One surprise was the inclusion of "Cold Duck," an R&amp;B-influenced number  that Les McCann and Eddie Harris recorded some 20 years ago (and one that  Marsalis' purist brother Wynton would probably never touch). The danceable,  rhythmic romp, anchored by Marsalis' deep, repetitive tenor theme and  Kirkland's soulful chording, brought an enthusiastic ovation from the crowd of  2,564 in paid attendance.  </P> <P> Calls from the audience for Bill Lee's "Mo' Better Blues" were met with laughs  from the band and an explanation that it was done only for the recent Spike Lee  movie. "We don't know it no mo'," Marsalis joked. "We played it, they paid us  and we left."  </P> <P> Marsalis' quartet was also scheduled to appear Friday at UCLA's Royce Hall and  will perform Sunday at the Wadsworth Theatre.  </P></p>

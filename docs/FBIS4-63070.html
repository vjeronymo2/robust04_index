			<p>BFN     [Text] The Brest Oblast Council of people's deputies has  adopted a resolution on the restoration of a border zone along  the boundary with Poland. In Brest, Kamenets, and Pruzhany  Rayons adjacent to the border, special rules of entry into the  zone, as well as of residence and temporary visits, have been  introduced. Permanent residents of these rayons should have a  special notation in their passports, while newcomers -- a permit  to enter a specific populated area. This resolution was  provoked by the need to halt smuggling and illegal border  crossings.</p>

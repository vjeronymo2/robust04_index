			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: TAP chief seeks cash injection TAP-AIR PORTUGAL, the state airline, needs a government capital injection of Es80bn-Es100bn (Dollars 501m-Dollars 626m) by the end of the year if it is to survive, Mr Fernando Santos Martins, the company's president, said yesterday. TAP has an accumulated debt of some Es70bn, with operating losses of Es27.3bn in 1992 and a similar deficit forecast for 1993. The state plans to sell off up to 49 per cent of the airline later this year. A government spokesman said the state was willing to inject Es100bn, provided that a restructuring plan was implemented before the end of the year and that a pact was signed between management and unions to ensure labour peace. TAP has been disrupted by recent strike action, and the unions yesterday threatened a series of 24-hour stoppages in July. Workers are fighting for wage increases and against plans to cut the workforce from 10,500 to 9,000 by the end of 1993. None of TAP's routes is profitable, and it costs the company more than Es15bn annually to lease its 38 aircraft. The company faced angry demonstrations from workers when it was unable to pay all of April's wages on time and was forced to take out a syndicated bank loan of Es30bn to pay them. There have also been difficulties in meeting payments for aircraft leasing, fuel and catering services. The airline, with annual operating costs of Es150bn, cancelled an order for four Airbus A340 aircraft as it was unable to meet the indemnity payments involved. In April, Air Atlantis, a charter company in which TAP was the main shareholder, was closed down by TAP because of insupportable losses amounting to Es2.1bn. Two hundred workers lost their jobs and TAP was left with a monthly bill of Es300m for leasing the defunct company's four Boeing 737-300s.</p>

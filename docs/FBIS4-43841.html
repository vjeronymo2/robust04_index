			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bente Egjar Engesland and Hilde Harbo: "A Solid </F> Yes for the Labor Party Leadership"]    [Excerpt] The Labor Party leadership has been given its  marching orders for European Union [EU] membership. The party's  national congress said yes by 197 votes to 93.    With the national congress decision behind it, the  leadership  can now throw itself into the EU battle in earnest. Party  leader Thorbjorn Jagland will address himself first and foremost  to the doubters and to social democratic voters.    He is also emphasizing strongly that the opponents of the EU  in the party must be given room to fight for their views: "No  one should have to work against their own convictions. The work  in the local party apparatus must be able to reflect the EU view  that exists locally," he said.    Labor Party Youth League leader Trond Giske, who was an  important exponent of the minority's view at the national  congress, praised the party leadership's attitude to the no  side. At the same time he also warned strongly against the link  made by individual speakers between a yes stance and confidence  in the government.    "It is dangerous to hint that the no people have no  confidence in the government. The most important thing in the  debate is what arguments are used, not who is using them.  Loyalty is not allowing others to make up your mind for you,"  he said.    Giske believes that if the internal debate takes such a  turn,  things will be reminiscent of: "A Labor voter is a yes voter."  This slogan from 1972 created much bad blood in the party and  led to many opponents pulling out of party work.    The close of the national congress yesterday was dominated  by  several powerful appeals for cohesion in a party that is split  over the EU question.    "Let it be burned into the heads of each individual: We also  want a strong Labor Party after the referendum," Jagland said.  He warned against disputes focused on people. Party secretary  Dag Terje Andersen followed this by condemning party officials  who voice strong criticism in the media without daring to say  anything in the party's organs.    The Nordic area's role in the EU is a source of conflict on  the no side in the Labor Party. Prominent member of Social  Democrats Against the EU -- with Hallvard Bakke and Trond Giske  at its head -- take the view that a Swedish yes simply makes it  more important to have a Norway outside the Union.  Nevertheless, proposals were put forward for changes to the no  side's resolution that states that "what decision our neighbors  reach in relation to the EU is something that many are concerned  with in their evaluation of EU membership and Nordic  cooperation. Developments among our neighbors should therefore  be followed closely." Both Giske and Bakke think that the  formulation is only justified in respect of the doubters. But  they are aware that several no people in the Labor Party are  prepared to revise their views if Sweden and Finland say yes.    Even if there was a solid yes majority in the Labor Party  another important EU vote remains for the labor movement. On 22  September an extraordinary LO [Norwegian Trade Union  Confederation] congress will discuss the membership issue. LO  leader Yngve Hagensen, who followed the debate at the congress,  admitted that outcome among the trade union movement's elected  representatives is much less certain.    "I believe that the prospect is of a pretty even race at the  congress, but I have a well-founded hope that in the trade union  movement too there will be an objective debate with respect for  the views of opponents," Hagensen told AFTENPOSTEN.    He said that it is first and foremost the high level of  unemployment and the large social gulfs in the EU that frighten  people in the trade union movement.    "But these problems are first and foremost the  responsibility  of the national states. I believe that in the short term we  will not have either higher or lower unemployment as a result of  EU membership. But if we do go in and achieve a breakthrough  for social democratic policies, unemployment throughout Europe  could fall in the longer term," Hagensen said.    The result of the vote at the Labor Party national congress  surprised no one. Veterans Thorvald Stoltenberg and Reiulf  Steen were more in suspense about the outcome of the football  match against Mexico later that evening. But they said they  were satisfied with the yes side's 1-0 at the national congress  and said that they though the debate had been objective,  tolerant, and good. [passage omitted]</p>

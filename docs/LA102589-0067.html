			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'CHEERS' ACTOR TO REQUEST COUNSELING IN DRUG  CASE  </P> <P> Kelsey Grammer, a star of the long-running television show "Cheers" who faces a  cocaine possession charge, is scheduled to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court  on Thursday to request placement in a drug abuse education program instead of a  jail sentence.  </P> <P> Grammer, 34, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane, the comically egotistical  psychiatrist on the popular NBC series, was charged with one felony count of  possession of cocaine after his arrest April 14. Los Angeles police said he  tried to dispose of about a quarter-gram of cocaine following his arrest for  driving without a valid license and with expired license plate tags, and on a  warrant from a previous speeding citation.  </P> <P> The actor is seeking the court's permission to attend the drug abuse education  program, which is offered to people charged with first-time felony drug  offenses, said Rion O'Brien, a Van Nuys Municipal Court clerk. If he  successfully completes the program, which lasts several months, Grammer would  be eligible to have the cocaine possession case dismissed and the arrest  cleared from his record after six months, O'Brien said.  </P> <P> The cocaine charge would otherwise carry a maximum sentence of three years in  jail, but the sentence on a first offense is typically three to six months,  said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew W. Diamond.  </P></p>

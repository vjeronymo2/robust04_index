			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Wage, Price Controls Extended: Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will  extend wage and price controls beyond the July 31 expiration date, newspapers  said. Salinas said the controls must remain in force to ensure improved living  standards for workers. The controls went into effect in February, 1988, after  prices soared 159.2% in 1987. Inflation was reduced to 51.7% last year. Under  an agreement, the government pledged to curb spending, labor to hold down wage  demands and business to freeze prices.  </P></p>

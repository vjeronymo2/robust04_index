			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Founder of Homes Assured is found guilty THE FOUNDER of Homes Assured, the company set up to help council house tenants buy their homes under the government's right to buy legislation, was found guilty yesterday of two charges of deception. A Southwark Crown Court jury, sitting in an annexe of the Old Bailey, returned guilty verdicts on two charges of procuring execution of a security by deception against Mr Anthony Dobson, the company's 60-year-old founder and former board director. Mr Keith Woodward, another board member, was convicted on one charge of furnishing false information. The jury is continuing its deliberations today on joint charges of fraudulent trading against Mr Dobson, Mr Woodward and Mr Michael Robinson, the former managing director of Homes Assured. More than 100 witnesses were called by the Crown in its case against the three directors on charges which arose out of the company's collapse four years ago with debts of Pounds 10.7m.</p>

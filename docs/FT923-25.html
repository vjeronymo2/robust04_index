			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (7): Kvaerner to the rescue - Shipbuilding MANY FINNS regard Mr Martin Saarikangas as the saviour of their country's shipbuilding industry. President and chief executive officer of Kvaerner Masa-Yards, he is a larger than life character with a lifetime in making ships. When Wartsila Marine went bankrupt in October 1989, this huge man came to the rescue. After working at the yards for nearly 30 years, he had a strong disagreement with the old Wartsila management in 1985 over its future strategy. He lost the argument and went into virtual exile in the US, only to return when the company fell into severe financial trouble. At that time the company yards were run with the co-operation of the original shareholders, including the Finnish government, the Union Bank of Finland and a number of shipping companies which had placed orders with Wartsila before it went bankrupt. This could never have been more than a temporary solution. Mr Saarikangas and others searched for a new, more permanent owner who would keep the yards in Helsinki and Turku open. 'We needed a strong shareholder. We could not exist alone,' he argues. A 'Finnish solution' was found to be impossible but in autumn 1990 the Norwegian industrial company Kvaerner came to the rescue with NKr700m, becoming owner on March 22 last year. Some Finns questioned whether the fate of a large part of their country's shipbuilding industry should depend on the attitude of a foreign concern such as Kvaerner but their doubts appear to have been misplaced. In fact, the Norwegian company has an interest in practically every segment of shipping and there are obvious synergies to the benefit of the Masa yards. As Mr Saarikangas explained in last year's annual report: 'Our strength today within passenger shipbuilding and the Arctic segment will also diversify into the field of oil and gas exploration and bring new orders to our yards in Finland thus improving our competitiveness and labour situation.' In the last financial year the yards made a profit (after financial items) of FM270.9m and achieved total net sales of FM1.910bn but this year the performance is not expected to be as good. The change of ownership at the yards has brought with it a clear change in business attitudes. Mr Saarikangas has sought to transform shopfloor attitudes with the introduction of teams into workplace organisation and a considerable cut in overhead costs. The company has pushed through a multi-million markka programme of retraining that was completed this summer. He is very critical of the way in which the yards were managed during the 1980s. 'Many important basic values were forgotten,' he argues. In his opinion there had to be a return to 'basics, such as appreciation of work, high quality, honesty and reliability.' But this has not meant a return to a macho style of management. Mr Saarikangas is keen to stress the need for involvement in ship production at all levels of the workforce. 'We need good human relations and a strong belief in our own skills,' he argues. The transformation in the yards has begun but he accepts it will take time, patience and a constant emphasis on efficiency before the company can reach a position where it can survive. The immediate outlook remains uncertain as long as the recession continues in Europe and the US. This has inevitably brought postponement of new projects and few new orders in shipping. But Mr Saarikangas says that the mid-1990s will be 'a good time' for the industry and for the company. At present the yards have an order book valued at FM6.5bn. There are enough orders to ensure the Helsinki yard is kept fully employed until the second half of 1995 but at Turku, where the yard is one of the largest and most modern in Europe, the outlook is uncertain with the last order due for completion by the third quarter of next year. But a question mark hangs over the prospects of any revival in the traditional export orders from the Finnish yards to Russia which collapsed two years ago with the end of the old clearing house trade system. At that time, it produced devastation at the yards as a quarter of the order book in Helsinki and the whole order book in Turku was linked to the then Soviet market. 'There is still turbulence in the restructuring process. One must not expect any short-term solutions which would lead to opportunities of new shipbuilding orders,' he says. Though the yards are now part of a Norwegian company, 'we are very much one big family,' says Mr Saarikangas. He sees their future in the construction of high quality merchant and passenger vessels as well as specialised boats such as ice-breakers, leaving the volume bulk ships to the low-cost parts of the industry in south-east Asia.</p>

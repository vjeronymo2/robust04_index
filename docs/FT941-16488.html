			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Observer: Stacking up the chairs The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry's regulator which is habitually on the look-out for sharp trading practices among its charges, seems to be experiencing a bit of churning itself - of chairpersons that is. The Commission is now greeting the third acting chairperson selected for it since President Clinton took office a year ago. Latest to step into the breach is Clinton fund raiser and farmer's daughter Barbara Holum, taking over from Sheila Bair, a Bush appointee who had been in place since August. Holum, sworn in as a commissioner only in November, is no time-server either. The game of musical chairs began last January when staunch Bush supporter Wendy Gramm, chairwoman since 1988, handed in her notice. Commissioner William Albrecht was provisionally roped in, but he departed in August, leaving a lonely duo of commissioners, one of whom was Bair. Seeing that the last two chairpersons and two of the three interim heads have been female, there has obviously been no particular problem in achieving gender 'balance' for this would-be politically correct administration. But frustrated regulatory staff suspect that the White House's ambitions extend to redressing ethnic balance, and the names of two female black Chicago lawyers are circulating. Just what kind of political point is there to be made, though, after all the dithering?</p>

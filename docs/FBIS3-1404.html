The African National Congress [ANC] and violence monitor  Mary  de Haas said there were unconfirmed reports of another 10  killings throughout Natal, and in northern Natal particularly,  where political fighting is said to be rife.    The kwaZulu police said four people were killed in separate  incidents in homeland-administered areas at the weekend.    Ms Alice Mhlongo, 43, and Mr Mzokhona Daniel Mhlongo, 17,  were attacked and shot dead at their home in Umbumbulu, south of  Durban.    Ms Regina Mthembu, 38, also of Umbumbulu, was shot and  killed  by unknown assailants and Ms Thembi Khumalo, 36, of Esikhawini  on Natal's north coast, was stabbed to death. A criminal motive  is being investigated in all cases.    Police spokesman Maj Hamilton Ngidi said two people were  killed in kwaMakutha, south of Durban, and two people were  fatally shot in Ndwedwe, north of Durban.    In Bhambayi, also north of Durban, four people were  murdered.    ANC northern Natal spokesman Zipho Mkhize said six people  were believed to have been killed in Ntambanana, near Empangeni,  since last week.    Ms de Haas said there were unconfirmed reports that three  people had been murdered in Ensingweni, near Mtunzini, on  Natal's north coast.    She said the situation in areas around nearby Eshowe were  worsening with reports of a politically motivated murder in  S'qwanjana on Friday. Women in the kwaMfana area were fleeing  their homes at night and sleeping in the bushes after a number  of homes had been attacked and set alight, she said.    On Sunday there were fears of a confrontation between IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters and ANC members after the  network of independent monitors alleged that IFP members had  occupied an ANC rally venue in Vryheid, northern Natal.    The ANC on Natal's south coast said it was worried about  similar conflict linked to its rally, to be addressed by SA  Communist Party stalwart Joe Slovo on Sunday.    Continuing violence in Natal was the subject of urgent talks  between State President F W de Klerk and IFP leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi in Durban on Saturday.    There the leaders agreed to establish a mechanism to search  for solutions to the problem of holding elections in kwaZulu-  administered areas, and both pledged to try and reach agreements  aimed at eliminating violence and the present tension in Natal.    While they met, about 10,000 ANC supporters marched through  Pietermaritzburg to support their stated demand of free  political activity in the province. On Friday, the ANC brought  Durban to a standstill when 80,000 supporters demonstrated for  the same reason.    The ANC has demanded the immediate deployment of South  African troops and the National Peace Keeping Force (NPKF) in  the region to ensure free political activity, and warned of  "unprecedented" mass action if its demands were ignored.    Expressing its concern about the worsening situation in the  province, the Natal church leaders' group on Friday said the SA  Defence Force (SADF) should be deployed in violence flash points.    The Democratic Party (DP) said the situation was bad enough  to warrant a postponement of the April elections. The initial  weekend death toll has brought to over 120 the number killed in  Natal since last Friday.</p>

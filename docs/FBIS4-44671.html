			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bernard Bombeau: "The ATR 82 Seeks Partners"; </F> first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL  introduction]    [Text] The Franco-Italian consortium has settled on the  broad outlines of its future 80-seater turboprop, which it may  launch in late 1994 or early 1995, with or without new partners.    The initial timetable called for a launch decision in  mid-1994. [But] the consortium's general director Henri-Paul  Puel confirmed in late January that there would be a delay of at  least six months for the project unveiled in June, 1991, in  Bourget. Aerospatiale and Alenia will make no decision about the  future of the ATR 82 program until the end of this year or early  1995. The go-ahead, says Henri-Paul Puel, depends on three  things: a technical design for the aircraft, a launch customer,  and a healthy and realistic basis for financing the venture.    Technically, the design and engineering department has  absorbed the lessons of two marketing campaigns. The ATR 82  started out with 76 seats, a number that rose to 78, and  recently to 80. "There is a real demand in that niche," confirms  the program head. "Two thousand stage 2 `jets' with fewer than  130 seats will have to be replaced toward the end of this  decade. The majority of them operate over distances of less than  500 km. The shorter the distance, the poorer the seat occupancy  rate. These aircraft--which are costly to run--usually fly at  only 50 percent capacity."    Hence the selection in Toulouse of an 80-seater "whose  logical engine choice will be a turbo-powerplant." This does not  mean, however, that the jet option (Allison AE3012, CF34-6, or  ALF512) has been scrapped. The consortium has not abandoned the  idea of manufacturing a common trunk that can accomodate either  engine, "on a straight airfoil that we would have to alter and  reinforce with new tail units."    But the first ATR 82, which the consortium says will be  ready  to fly in 1995-96, will be turbopropelled. "About 70 percent of  our customers favor a turboengine," says the consortium's  industrial director Antoine Bouvier.    Two turboprops were originally in competition: the former  GMA  2100 (AE2100) and the PW300/305. Both are derated engines in the  4,500 hp category. "The Allison 2100 looks like a good  candidate," says Henri-Paul Puel for now. But no final choice  has been made. The consortium is paying particular attention to  Lycoming's latest proposals involving the LP512 (derived from  the LF507), and especially to General Electric's for the GLC38.  Whatever the outcome, the engine selected will have to supply  maximum takeoff power of 2,500 to 2,700 kW (3,600 hp), for a  maximum weight calculated at 29,850 kg, a cruise speed of 335 kt  (620 km/hr), and a maximum range.    Henri-Paul Puel currently estimates it will cost $500  million  to launch the ATR 82 program. "That is much too high, and will  have to be pared down to an acceptable $400 million with the  addition of new partners." The consortium CEO sees "the ATR 82  as a chance to clinch new alliances while broadening our  organization." From that standpoint, launching the ATR 82 would  be a decisive step in creating a new, regional aircraft  industrial entity, a development that Aerospatiale CEO Louis  Gallois openly favors.    But with or without partners, the ATR 82 remains a priority  objective whose accomplishment will depend on whether the  consortium can be certain of finding "good launch airlines and  at least 30 to 50 aircraft orders."    The ATR 82 is another ace the Franco-Italian consortium can  play to move toward a rationalization of the commuter market.  <H5>  Specifications </H5>   Span: 27.05 m; Length: 31.80 m; Cabin length: 28.85 m;  Internal diameter: 1.91 m; Max. takeoff weight: 29,850 kg;  Operational empty weight: 17,520 kg; Payload: 9,930 kg; Fuel  capacity: 5,000 kg; Takeoff run (ISA/MTOW):1,400 m; Landing roll  (SL/MLW): 1,240 m; Peak cruise speed: 620 km/hr; Range:1,853 km    The geometry and general outlines of the project are  expected  by late 1994 or early 1995.</p>

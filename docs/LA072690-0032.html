			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BLASTS AT FROZEN FOOD COMPANY INJURE 5  </P> <P> Three electrical workers suffered third-degree burns and two Department of  Water and Power employees suffered minor injuries in two explosions at a  Chatsworth frozen food company Wednesday.  </P> <P> The first explosion at Chef America, 9601 Canoga Ave., occurred as electrical  workers attempted to replace a breaker on the main electrical panel, said  company spokesman Paul Meraj.  </P> <P> "Somebody dropped the main panel on some high-voltage wires," Meraj said.  "There was a flash, and they were burned."  </P> <P> Keith Schaffer, 60, suffered second- and third-degree burns and was listed in  critical condition at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, a hospital spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Jose Medrano, 38, and Evaristo Talavero, 19, were listed in serious condition  at Northridge Hospital Medical Center with second- and third-degree burns.  </P> <P> Meraj said the private contractors were in the electrical room when the  accident occurred at 10:10 a.m. The 480-volt main panel distributes electricity  through the plant from a DWP industrial power station.  </P> <P> The second explosion, a "flashover," occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when DWP  workers attempted to restore power in the plant.  </P> <P> "They were in the process of re-energizing the customer's equipment," said DWP  spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen. "Apparently there was still a problem with the  transformer involved in the first accident."  </P> <P> DWP worker Donald Wells, 50, suffered first- and second-degree burns to his  face and was treated and released from Northridge Hospital Medical Center.  Walter Scoby, 51, suffered first- and second-degree burns to his face and neck.  He was treated and released from that hospital.  </P> <P> A DWP official said the accident did not cut off power to nearby customers. DWP  employees were investigating.  </P></p>

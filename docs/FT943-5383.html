			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / China and Russia sign trade accords Russian and Chinese leaders signed a series of trade and co-operation agreements over the weekend, promising a new era of partnership after 40 years of volatile and often bitter relations. In the first visit to Moscow by a Chinese head of state since 1957, Mr Jiang Zemin signalled his determination to extend the recent rapprochement with Russia. 'Autumn is the season of harvest. In Moscow I have gathered a good harvest,' he said yesterday. The two presidents signed a political declaration promising neither country would target nuclear weapons at the other. Both sides pledged not to allow ideology to obstruct their bilateral relations nor join an international grouping that would endanger each other's security interests. An agreement was reached demarcating the western section of Russia's border with China, which has been in dispute for decades. Russian involvement in five big Chinese industrial projects was also confirmed in a trade protocol, which could bring Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) of orders to Russian companies. 'Both parties reached an understanding of the necessity to build a new type of constructive partnership, which means neither confrontation nor political alliance,' Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, said yesterday. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, said that as a force both in the west and the east, Russia had no alternative but to develop its national interests 'through partnership and normal co-operation with the outside world'. China remains one of Russia's most important trading partners despite a sharp contraction in trade between the two countries this year because of the upheavals in Russia's economy.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: AB Foods gets approval for reorganisation The High Court has given approval for the proposed reorganisation of Associated British Foods, the milling, baking and food products group, in spite of concerns raised by the Charity Commission. ABF said yesterday that courts had ratified the decision of the trustees of the Garfield Weston Foundation to approve the restructuring, which is designed to improve tax planning of the Weston family trusts which control the company. The Charity Commission, which had raised initial concerns about the proposals, was not party to the court hearing, which was held in private. It said yesterday that it noted the decision. A second court hearing to sanction the ABF scheme of arrangement will take place on July 27. The company said its plans would go ahead as proposed, with dealings in shares of Associated British Foods to commence on August 1, ABF preference shares repaid on August 5, and interim dividend of 8.5p on September 1, and a special dividend of 10p per share on October 14.</p>

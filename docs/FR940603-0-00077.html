			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) lands referred to in Section 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Navigable Waters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At this time, Federal subsistence management program regulations apply to all non-navigable waters located on public lands and to navigable waters located on the public lands identified at 50 CFR 100.3(b) and 36 CFR 242.3(b) of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964) published May 29, 1992. Nothing in these regulations is intended to enlarge or diminish the authority of the Departments to manage submerged lands, title to which is held by the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subsistence Taking of Fish and Shellfish Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule contains no subsistence fishing or shellfish taking provisions. The Board intends to propose to the Secretaries that the regulatory year governing subsistence fish and shellfish taking activities be changed from the June 1&hyph;July 30 annual cycle to a January 1&hyph;December 31 cycle. Such a change may provide more consistency during those months when fish and shellfish are most commonly harvested. The current subsistence fish/shellfish regulations will be addressed in a separate interim rule as soon as possible. The interim rule will likely extend the current regulations until litigation appeals are concluded or the agency is directed to issue revised rules, whichever occurs first. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments (Proposals) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 2, 1993, the proposed rule for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska_Subpart D, 1994&hyph;1995 was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 46678&hyph;46706). During the 60-day period to suggest changes for the 1994&hyph;1995 regulatory year, the Regional Councils held their initial meetings in conjunction with public hearings on the 1994&hyph;1995 subpart D regulation proposed rule. Meetings were held in Sitka, Barrow, Bethel, Kotzebue, Fairbanks, Kodiak, Nome, Anchorage, Naknek, and McGrath. The meetings were used to initiate the Regional Council system and to assist in the development of suggested changes to the 1994&hyph;1995 subpart D proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A total of 107 proposals for 1994&hyph;1995 subpart D regulations was received. Of those, 88 were within the scope of the Board's authority under subpart D. Most of the proposals which were not accepted involved requests for changes in customary and traditional use determinations found in subpart C of the Federal subsistence management program regulations. Other proposals which were not considered requested delegation of Board authorities that could not be relinquished to nongovernment entities, or requested application of hunting or fishing regulations to non-Federal lands or waters. One proposal questioned the entire framework of the Federal Subsistence Management Program, one requested regulations for waterfowl, and another proposed inclusion of a non-rural Native group within the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 15, 1993, a booklet describing the 88 proposals was distributed to the public with notice that the Board would accept public comments on these 88 proposals through January 14, 1994. After the public comment period, the Regional Councils held meetings in regional centers to obtain local input on specific proposals affecting each region. Of the 88 proposals, the Board acted on 79 during a public meeting, April 11&hyph;15, 1994. The remaining proposals were withdrawn by their proponent prior to the Board meeting or during the meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposals Rejected by the Board <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

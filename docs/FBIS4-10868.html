			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu will sign a memorandum  of commercial understanding with Egypt and a document formally  closing the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks during a tour of  African Mediterranean countries that he will begin this weekend.    The commercial agreement with Egypt will permit a broadening  of Uruguay's export market, particularly in the area of  agriculture.    Abreu said that a protocol is being finished to permit the  export of Uruguayan meat to Egypt. Abreu added that he will take  advantage of the opportunity to prepare President Luis Alberto  Lacalle's trip to Egypt, which is scheduled for June.    The foreign minister will then travel to Marrakech,  Morocco's  capital, to participate in the formal closing of the Uruguay  Round of GATT talks.    Abreu said that the GATT talks will formally conclude on 15  April, and that he will attend the closing ceremony as the  Uruguay Round president.    The foreign minister also said that he held a meeting with  representatives of the country's entrepreneurial chambers. Abreu  said those meetings are routinely held in order to inform  entrepreneurs of the international situation and the country's  relations with other countries.    "Representatives of entrepreneurial chambers come to the  Foreign Ministry once a month, and here they receive information  about Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and GATT, the  country's bilateral negotiations, and the call to Montevideo of  Uruguayan trade attaches for the exchange of information," Abreu  said.    The minister said his ministry has established this  mechanism  in order to coordinate the operation of the private and public  sectors.    "We want the Foreign Ministry to become an instrument  promoting the country's presence in the world. We want this  ministry to become what we call Uruguay's grand multinational,"  Abreu concluded.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Big drop in days lost from strikes FEWER DAYS were lost through strikes last year than in any year since records began 100 years ago, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of Employment. Provisional estimates put the loss at 800,000 days - the first time the figure has fallen below 1m since 1940 - compared with annual averages of 12.9m days in the 1970s and 7.2m days for the 1980s. The government is likely to use the figures during the election campaign as evidence of the effectiveness of its reform of union law and to support its claim that Labour would be unable to control the unions. In 1991, 177,000 workers were involved in a total of 354 stoppages compared with 298,000 engaged in 630 disputes in 1990. The provisional figure for stoppages in December, the latest monthly figure available, was 25 - the lowest for that month since 1932, when there were 21 stoppages.</p>

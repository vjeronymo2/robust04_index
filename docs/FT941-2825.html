			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: ENI subsidiary sells gas side Agip Petroli, the refining and distribution subsidiary of ENI, the Italian state-owned oil and gas group, has agreed to sell its Liquipibigas business for the equivalent of Dollars 146m as part of its preparations for privatisation. The purchaser is Novogas, a Brescia-based joint venture between Primagaz of France and Brixia Finanziara, a privately-owned Italian company in transport and fuel distribution. The deal includes a 35 per cent interest in the Livorno gas import terminal. Liquipibigas, based in Milan, owns and operates the second-largest liquefied petroleum gas distribution network in Italy with 25 storage and bottling facilities. Its revenues last year were L359bn (Dollars 215m). ENI is reshaping its energy interests into a new company which is due to be privatised next year. Yesterday's sale, first announced last summer, was conducted through an auction and is among the largest of ENI's disposals so far of non-core businesses. Novogas was advised by Merrill Lynch. Great Lakes Chemical Corporation of the US has acquired the plastic materials activities of EniChem Synthesis for L150bn, writes John Simkins in Milan. ENI's revenue from pri-vatisation now totals about L2,700bn, and the businesses sold have a combined turnover of more than L4,000bn with a total workforce of 11,000.</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Macmillan little touched by Maxwell fall, says chairman MR DAVID Shaffer, who is chairman of the Macmillan publishing group and was last week named by a New York bankruptcy court to manage the US assets of Maxwell Communication Corporation, told MCC's bank creditors that Macmillan's business had felt little impact from the scandal surrounding the collapse of the Maxwell empire. Mr Shaffer sought to reassure MCC's bank creditors in New York on Thursday, at a meeting also attended by Mr Mark Homan, the Price Waterhouse partner who is one of the UK court-appointed administrators of MCC. MCC filed last month for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. Under a transatlantic agreement announced on January 3, Mr Shaffer will manage the US assets of MCC and consult with UK administrators. The New York court agreement is subject to review next week. In addition Mr Shaffer said yesterday that he wished to correct a statement he made in an interview earlier this week concerning the holders of shares in Berlitz, the language school subsidiary of Macmillan. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr Shaffer said that Swiss Bank Corporation was among the five groups that received Berlitz stock from the Maxwells as collateral on loans; yesterday he said that it was Credit Suisse and not Swiss Bank Corporation he intended to mention. The Daily News, the loss-making New York paper that was part of the Maxwell empire and which has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11, said that it had retained Salomon Brothers as its financial adviser.</p>

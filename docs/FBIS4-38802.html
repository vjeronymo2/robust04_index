			<p>BFN     [Text] Democratic and centrist forces may support a single  candidate, renowned writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, at the next  presidential elections in Russia, one of the Democratic Russia  movement leaders supposed.    A co-chairman of Democratic Russia, priest Gleb Yakunin told  Interfax Wednesday that "all democratic and centrist forces must  unite to nominate a single candidate for the presidency,  otherwise a nationwide disaster will happen."    In his opinion, such politicians as Yegor Gaydar, Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy or Sergey Shakhray have very little chance of winning  the presidential elections in 1996, as all of them are inferior  to Solzhenitsyn.    At the same time, Yakunin said he was concerned and worried  over some of the statements by Solzhenitsyn who had returned to  Russia last month after a 20-year exile with respect to the  national policy and the "Gaydar-Chubays line in the  implementation of economic reforms."    However, Solzhenitsyn's point of view may change as he gets  to know Russian reality.    According to the Russian Constitution, a citizen residing in  Russia for no fewer than ten years may be elected as president.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Sabbateyeva: "Inequality in Russia: The </F> Genie Coefficient Is Rising"]    [Text] The "consumption boom" Andrey Illarionov  writes about has affected different groups of Russians in  different ways because the rapid stratification of the  population according to income levels continued last year.  According to the data of the State Committee for Statistics, the  income of the wealthiest 10 percent in 1993 was 11 times as high  as the income of the bottom 10 percent. In 1992 the correlation  was 7.5-8 times, and in 1991 it was 4.5 times.    It might be a good idea to add the specialized term "Genie  coefficient" to our common terminology. This coefficient is an  index of income concentration, ranging from 0 to 1. It measures  the distribution of income from the point of total equality (0)  to the point at which everything belongs to a single individual  (1). At the end of 1993, for example, the coefficient in Russia  was 0.346. For the sake of comparison, it was 0.327 at the end  of 1992 and 0.256 at the end of 1991.    According to last year's figures, the per capita income of  one out of every three Russians was below the minimum  subsistence level, and the monetary income of 13 percent of the  population did not exceed the minimum food allowance. The income  of 5 percent of the citizens of Russia was below the minimum  required for physiological survival. The table illustrates the  degree of stratification.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Distribution of Russian Population According to Per Capita Monetary Income i-|  |n November 1993                                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Income (in rubles)       |Millions of people       |Percentages              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total                    |148.7                    |100                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Under 10,000             |0.6                      |0.4                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |10,001-20,000            |9.0                      |6.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |20,001-30,000            |20.2                     |13.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |30,001-40,000            |24.5                     |16.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |40,001-50,000            |23.6                     |15.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |50,001-60,000            |20.4                     |13.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |60,001-70,000            |16.7                     |11.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |70,001-80,000            |13.3                     |9.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |80,001-90,000            |10.5                     |7.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Over 90,000              |9.9                      |6.7                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Average per capita monetary income in November 1993 was  37,908 rubles. This was the average for all segments of the  population. The average was 42,799 rubles for able-bodied  adults, 26,705 rubles for pensioners, and 37,896 rubles for  children. The minimum subsistence level is calculated according  to the methods of the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor and  includes expenditures on food, based on minimum consumption,  expenditures on non-food items and services, and taxes and  obligatory payments--based on the proportional expenditures of  the 10 percent of families with the lowest incomes.    Now our discussions of increasing inequality will require a  slight adjustment. Up to this point we have based these  judgments on the monetary income of the population, but social  divisions based on these income levels are not equivalent to the  actual patterns of stratification. Some of the main social means  (primarily housing and also, to some extent, transportation and  medicine) are being distributed more equally because they are  financed with state budget funds. This means that actual  inequality is not increasing as quickly as we once believed.</p>

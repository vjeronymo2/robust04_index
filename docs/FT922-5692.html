			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons disposes of more pubs ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, has disposed of 300 pubs in the latest stage of its compliance with government orders requiring it to free 2,380 pubs from tied beer supplies, writes Andrew Bolger. The pubs, mainly in the Midlands and south-east of England, were sold for an undisclosed amount to Sycamore Taverns, a company formed to operate tenanted houses only. Allied has only to dispose of a further 200 pubs to comply with the government order, bringing its estate down to 4,400 properties. Last week the group reported that it had reached agreement with the Office of Fair Trading over the leasing of 734 pubs to Brent Walker, the leisure group. The properties in the latest agreement were from Tetley Walker in the north of England, Ansells in the Midlands and Ind Coope Retail and Taylor Walker in the south-east. Sycamore Taverns was formed by five senior executives, previously with Grand Met, Whitbread and Courage.</p>

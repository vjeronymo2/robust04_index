			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: AVOID ESCROW IMPOUND RIP-OFFS CAUSED BY LENDER  MISCALCULATIONS  </P> <P> QUESTION: Our home mortgage has one of those escrow impound accounts for  payment of the property taxes and fire insurance. We have had this loan for two  years and it has been a constant source of trouble. The lender sends us a  statement once a year setting the amount we must pay into the account. The form  is so complicated neither my husband nor I can understand it.  </P> <P> But the amount seemed reasonable, so we went along. Then last month we received  a letter stating there is a $562.34 deficit in our account, which the lender  wants us to pay immediately. But there is no way we can pay that amount all at  once. Since the lender was doing the calculations, how can they be so wrong and  what should we do?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Escrow impound accounts are rip-offs imposed on mortgage borrowers by  lenders who have no valid excuse for demanding lump-sum payments of account  deficits caused by the lender.  </P> <P> If you can't pay the $562.34 deficit, write to the lender explaining you can't  pay and you want to spread the repayment out over the next year. Be sure to  emphasize the deficit was caused by the lender's error in miscalculating the  escrow impound account monthly payment.  </P> <P> Unless you have a VA, FHA or PMI (private mortgage insurance) mortgage, which  require escrow impound accounts, it may be possible to cancel your escrow  impound account. Many lenders will gladly do so even though these very  profitable accounts are major headaches for lenders due to problems like yours.  If you have a conventional mortgage that does not require such an account, you  may be able to cancel the account and pay your property taxes and fire  insurance premiums directly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Borrower Praises Aid of Mortgage Broker  </P> <P> Q: Why are you so rough on mortgage brokers? When we recently bought our home  we applied for a mortgage at the S&amp;L where we have had our checking and  savings accounts for years.  </P> <P> They treated us like dirt. They said we didn't qualify for a loan since we had  recently changed jobs and didn't have six months reserves in our savings  account.  </P> <P> Then the real estate agent took us to a mortgage broker's office. She checked  our excellent credit and within two days had our loan approved by a major bank.  Although the payments will take about 40% of our gross income, we want the home  badly, and I'm sure we can make the payments. Why don't you say more nice  things about mortgage brokers?  </P> <P> A: Some of my best friends are mortgage brokers, and I have no hostility toward  them. You are absolutely correct that mortgage brokers often perform finance  miracles because they can refer a loan to dozens of lenders.  </P> <P> However, a few mortgage brokers give the industry a bad name by promising  borrowers loan terms that they can't deliver. A few days before the scheduled  closing date, the borrower is informed of the best available mortgage terms,  take it or leave it. But most mortgage brokers don't use deceptive tricks like  that and do an excellent job for their clients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Something New in Time-Shares: Quarters  </P> <P> Q: Recently, I visited the summer resort at Ocean City, Md., where I  encountered a developer selling "quarter-shares." He claims this is far better  than time-shares. Each of four owners of a condo gets two-week intervals, which  rotate each year so each owner gets to use the condo during different weeks  each year. The $43,900 price is affordable to us. What do you think of this  idea?  </P> <P> A: Not much, unless you really like to spend your vacations at Ocean City, Md.  I realize you can trade your vacation time through an interval exchange  company, but $43,900 can buy some pretty nice vacations at other places without  your being tied down to one location.  </P> <P> Please be aware vacation property is not a real estate investment. It is the  purchase of a place to spend your vacations. As with any vacation property  purchase, please use only money you can afford to lose because there is no  guarantee of any profit or even being able to get your investment out.  </P> <P> Talk to most time-share owners and you will find there is virtually no  time-share resale market. It remains to be seen if there is any resale market  for a one-fourth interest in a vacation condo. If you would use the  quarter-share regularly every year or trade some of your time for use at other  resorts it might serve your purposes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Combine Tax Break With Deferral  </P> <P> Q: In a recent article you explained how to use the "over-55 rule" $125,000  home sale tax exemption when the profit is more than $125,000 and defer the  remainder of the profit tax by purchasing a replacement home costing at least  as much as the "revised adjusted sales price" of $150,000. But suppose only a  $130,000 replacement home is purchased. Would this trigger tax liability on the  entire remainder of the sale profit?  </P> <P> A: No. Please allow me to use an example explaining how a home seller can  combine the "over-55 rule" tax exemption with a partial tax deferral. Suppose  you are 55 or older on the day you sell your principal residence that you have  owned and lived in at least three of the five years before the sale and you  have never used this tax break before.  </P> <P> Let's pretend your principal residence sells for $275,000 and your cost was  $50,000, so you have a $225,000 net profit. Subtracting the $125,000 "over-55  rule" tax exemption creates a $150,000 revised adjusted (net) sales price and a  $100,000 remaining net profit which is potentially taxable.  </P> <P> If you buy a $130,000 replacement principal residence within 24 months before  or after the sale, Internal Revenue Code 1034 says you must pay tax on $20,000  ($150,000 minus $130,000) of your remaining profit but you can defer tax on the  other $80,000. This home replacement tax break is available to home sellers of  any age. For further details, please consult your tax adviser.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Explaining Capital Gains in Real Estate  </P> <P> Q: Please explain capital gains and the changes Congress is considering. Would  these new tax laws apply to all states and does the owner's age have any  effect?  </P> <P> A: Everyone understands when you sell something, such as your house, for more  than you paid you earn a profit. But to confuse us, Congress and the IRS refer  to profits as capital gains.  </P> <P> There are several tax law revision proposals which would tax profits from the  sale of assets held for a period of time, such as one year, at lower tax rates  than ordinary income tax rates. The idea is to encourage long-term investments  in real estate, stocks and other assets by taxing these sale profits at lower  than ordinary income tax rates.  </P> <P> The most popular proposal would take long-term capital gains (sale profits) at  a 19.6% tax rate instead of the 28% tax rate that currently applies.  </P> <P> But current chances of lowering the long-term capital gains tax rate appear  very slim, even though lowering tax rates raises revenue because then more  investors will sell their real estate and other major assets. Unfortunately, a  few misinformed Congress members are preventing a reduction in long-term  capital gain tax rates. If lower capital gains tax rates should become law,  they would apply to all states without regard to the asset owner's age.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 24-Month Time Limit on Sale of Two Homes  </P> <P> Q: Recently, you answered a question from a newlywed husband and wife who each  own homes bought before marriage, which they want to sell so they can buy one  larger home together. You said they can defer the profit tax on the sale of  their two homes if they buy one replacement principal residence costing at  least as much as the total sales prices of their former residences.  </P> <P> You gave the example of one home selling for $100,000 and the other selling for  $125,000, which would require joint purchase of at least a $225,000 home to  defer the tax. I find myself in a similar situation and wonder if there is a  time limit for selling both old residences. We use my wife's home as our  primary residence and we use mine on weekends, as it is in a resort area.  </P> <P> A: I'll presume your residence was formerly your principal residence before you  moved into your wife's house. If your home was always a second or vacation home  and was never your principal residence, it can't qualify for the "roll-over  residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034.  </P> <P> This tax code section says you can defer your profit tax on the sale of your  principal residence if you buy a replacement principal residence of equal or  greater cost within 24 months before or after the sale of your old principal  residence.  </P> <P> Since you can have only one principal residence and that is now your wife's  house, you better get busy and sell your old principal residence as well as  your wife's house. Please consult your tax adviser to work out your home sale  plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Let's Clarify Rule on Over-55 Tax Break  </P> <P> Q: My girlfriend told me I must have owned and lived in my home for the last  five years if I am to claim that $125,000 old folks tax exemption when I sell.  But I thought you told a reader that only three years of ownership is required.  This is very important to me because my late husband and I bought our home  almost four years ago and I want to sell now because it is far too big for me.  </P> <P> We "rolled over" almost $100,000 profit on the sale of our previous home so I  can't afford to sell too soon and be stuck with a big tax bill from Uncle Sam.  As I need to sell so I can enter a life-care home, is there any special law  affecting my situation?  </P> <P> A: There is so much misinformation about the simple "over-55 rule" $125,000  home sale tax exemption, that your letter will clarify the easy rules. First,  you must be 55 or older on the day you sell your principal residence. Vacation  or second homes don't qualify. Second, you must have owned and lived in your  principal residence any three of the five years before the sale. Since you  bought your home almost four years ago, you qualify if you have lived in it at  least three of those years.  </P> <P> Third, you cannot use this $125,000 home sale tax exemption more than once.  Incidentally, if you were married, only one exemption is allowed per married  couple. It appears you qualify. The $125,000 exemption also applies to the  deferred profits from the sales of previous principal residence when you used  the "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034.  Please consult your tax adviser for further details.  </P> <P> What Can Buyer Do About Defective Home?  </P> <P> Q: I moved into a new home about 2 1/2 years ago. The builder was quick to take  our money, but after we moved in he became a "ghost." The construction is very  poor, cheap materials were used and any repairs are just make-shift jobs.  </P> <P> My worst horror story is a weather-stripping leak under my kitchen window,  causing the Formica back splash to tear apart from the wall, The cabinets under  the sink smell horribly of mildew and I cannot use them. I have complained to  the builder about many other problems but to no avail. I have a Home Owner's  Warranty Corp. warranty, but when I contact them they skate around the problems  and are of no help. Short of hiring an attorney to sue the builder, what can I  do?  </P> <P> A: You are very fortunate to have a 10-year warranty from an independent  third-party company such as HOW. If the builder refuses to take care of your  defects, HOW is supposed to step in and correct the problems. Since you have  given up on your builder, your recourse is now against HOW. Get tough with  them. If they don't come through, please let me know.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J. Bruss, a San Francisco-area lawyer, author  and real estate broker, may be sent him at P.O. Box 280038, San Francisco  94128.  </P> <P> </P></p>

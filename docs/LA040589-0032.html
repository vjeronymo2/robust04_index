			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: BASEBALL HERE FOR REAL WITH THE FIRST PITCH OF JUST ANOTHER GAME  </P> <P> Ah, nothing like Game 2 of the regular season to soothe the soul and introduce  real baseball for another year.  </P> <P> Game 2?  </P> <P> What happened to the season opener?  </P> <P> Nothing. They had one Monday night. They have one every year.  </P> <P> However, it is getting to be that Opening Night -- notice the capital letters  -- is more fantasy than reality. Major league teams go from playing a month of  games that mean nothing to a game that has come to mean too much.  </P> <P> That one game has been promoted for months, almost as though nothing comes  after it. The Opening Day Starter is a most special pitcher. The stadium is  decked in red, white and blue bunting. Radio shows originate in the parking  lot. Ushers wear white dinner jackets.  </P> <P> The season opener is hype and hoopla time.  </P> <P> Give me Game 2.  </P> <P> I know, you're going to say I'm the kind of guy who wears blue on St. Patrick's  Day, eats sauerkraut on Cinco de Mayo and reads a book on New Year's Eve.  You're just waiting for me to say, "Bah, humbug."  </P> <P> OK, I confess. I did wear blue on St. Patrick's Day. But I'm not a Bah Humbug  kind of guy.  </P> <P> The season opener, you see, is almost like a party with a game thrown in as a  sideshow.  </P> <P> Give me The Game . . . all by itself.  </P> <P> Give me Game 2. It has every bit as much of a chance of being a great game as  the season opener, and each counts as exactly 1/162nd of the season.  </P> <P> So I watched Opening Night on television, my friend Duke adroitly tap-dancing  back and forth between baseball and basketball with the remote control.  </P> <P> And then I went to Game 2, partially to see if anyone shared my sentiments . .  . but mostly because it was baseball without the frills.  </P> <P> "Opening Night's special," said Tim Flannery, whose Monday night start was his  first in a season opener, "but it's nice today because we're just going to play  ball."  </P> <P> That's all, and that's nice.  </P> <P> "I was talking to a buddy of mine yesterday who goes to a lot of games but  couldn't get tickets," Flannery said. "I'd already given mine away. I told him  it was like church on Easter, where everybody who hasn't gone goes."  </P> <P> The pace was much more leisurely Tuesday. Unlike circuses, baseball games are  meant to be that way.  </P> <P> It's almost as if Opening Night was a hurdle rather than a milestone.  </P> <P> "Everything is centered on Opening Day," said Jack McKeon, the manager. "It's  like a must situation that you've got to win. It gets blown out of proportion,  and everything's magnified."  </P> <P> Of course, this season opener came at the end of the Padres' best spring  training.  </P> <P> And they lost that season opener.  </P> <P> "We play great during the spring," said Tony Gwynn, "and then we lose our first  game. We all wanted to play well and win the first game and send a full house  home happy. So now they go home and say, 'What a bunch of hype. They're not as  good as we've heard.' "  </P> <P> It wasn't pretty, as the Padres ran themselves out of big innings, and Eric  Show walked San Francisco into a big inning.  </P> <P> "It looked ugly," Gwynn said.  </P> <P> On May 17 or June 6 or July 23 or August 11 or even on April 4, there would not  have been so much attention focused on winning or losing and the little things  that were a part of that result.  </P> <P> McKeon, for one, absorbed some of the heat from that inordinately bright  spotlight. He had left Show on the mound to work himself out of the  seventh-inning jam, and the Giants scored three runs to win, 5-3.  </P> <P> "What am I supposed to do," he asked Tuesday, "alter my style for one  particular game?  </P> <P> Only if it's the seventh game of the World Series, and maybe not then. It is  McKeon's style to be patient with his starting pitchers.  </P> <P> "We're going to get burned, and we're going to lose ballgames," he said.  "You've got to remember that it's a 162-game season."  </P> <P> That's right, but you know what Game 1 is like.  </P> <P> "If you win it," Flannery said, "you're automatically in the playoffs. Right?"  </P> <P> Wrong, of course.  </P> <P> It just seems that way, just as some folks seemed to think losing that season  opener was like getting knocked out of some single-elimination tournament.  </P> <P> After all, how could any team lose the season opener and come back to make the  playoffs?  </P> <P> So that one game, that one-night trip to fantasyland, was behind the Padres as  they arrived at the stadium Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> "Well," said Tony Gwynn, "we have 161 more games. Now we get down to business .  . . just like if we had won last night."  </P> <P> Welcome, then, to Game 2 . . . and the rest of the season.  </P></p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / School opposition to tests 'easing' The NUT teaching union yesterday said opposition to national curriculum tests in England and Wales among its members was easing. This year the NUT was the only union to boycott the tests, following a ban on them by all three main teachers' unions last year. It is canvassing its members after the announcement last month by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, of a Pounds 30m package of concessions to ease teachers' workload.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'HAZARDOUS LOTTERY' AT SUPERIOR COURT  </P> <P> Our readers wrote letters throughout 1989 expressing their viewpoints on a  variety of issues. Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We  appreciate their taking the time to share their viewpoints and look forward to  hearing from more of them in 1990.  </P> <P> Allow me to suggest a powerful deterrent to would-be violators of the law in  Orange County. Let them spend one day -- just one -- in the Jury Assembly Room  and/or the jury box of the Superior Court of the County of Orange. The problem,  as I see it, lies not at the bench, nor with the attorneys, but with the  hazardous lottery know as "a jury of our peers."  </P> <P> I arrived at the Superior Courthouse, naive as a college freshman, eager to  perform my jury service in the most thoughtful, unbiased manner possible. What  I encountered was a room filled with prospective jurors who know that they,  too, will perhaps spend interminable hours waiting to be called. Do they bring  books or magazines? Correspondence or projects to be completed? Crosswords  puzzles even? No. Instead, multiples of the citizenry assembled are content to  sit for hours, staring witlessly into the middle distance. There is clearly  nobody home.  </P> <P> Then, if one is fortunate enough to be selected as a potential juror, it is  still tough to make the final cut. Possession of an operable brain, all (well,  most) of one's faculties, quickly renders a candidate suspect. With keen  insight, I soon discerned that these qualities, along with basic honesty, were  deemed unnecessary in some jury boxes.  </P> <P> Judgment by a jury of my peers? I quail at the thought.  </P> <P> JUDY PERRY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

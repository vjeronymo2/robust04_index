			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bock sells stake in German hotels group Mr Dieter Bock, chief executive of Lonrho, yesterday began to fulfil his promise to dispose of his outside interests when he announced the sale of a controlling stake in Kempinski, the German hotel group, to a leading Thai hotel company. Advanta Management, Mr Bock's German property company, said it was selling its stake of just over 50 per cent in Kempinski to Dusit Sindhorn, a Thai joint venture between Dusit Thani, the hotel company, and Siam Sindhorn, a Thai property investor. The purchase price was not disclosed, but Advanta is believed to have sold its stake at a premium to the price of Kempinski shares on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Kempinski shares rose DM10 yesterday to close at DM850. The deal will be completed on December 5. Mr Bock's pledge to sell his outside interests came this month when he won his battle to persuade Mr Tiny Rowland, his fellow joint chief executive, to quit the Lonrho board. There had been speculation that Kempinski would be merged with Lonrho's Metropole hotel chain. Any such merger would have been complicated, however, by the Libyan government's 33 per cent holding in Metropole. For Kempinski, which is just about to open its seventeenth hotel, in Dresden, the sale comes at the end of a long struggle to find a partner. In 1992, Kempinski, then 42.6 per cent owned by Lufthansa, the German airline, was forced to abandon plans to merge with Meridien, the luxury hotel chain controlled by Air France. Instead, Lufthansa sold part of its stake to Advanta. Today, Lufthansa owns 20.2 per cent of Kempinski, with the remainder held by other investors. Air France sold its 57 per cent stake in Meridien to Forte, the UK hotel group, earlier this year. Kempinski yesterday paid tribute to Advanta's role in developing the chain. Kempinski said: 'Thanks to Advanta, the company achieved a much stronger position in Germany. Advanta assisted in the merger of the company's German and international activities which were previously separated.' Kempinski said Advanta had also assisted it in obtaining hotel management contracts. The German chain said its link with the Thai joint venture would give it a stronger position in the Asian region, the world's fastest-growing travel market. It said the Kempinski name would be maintained. Dusit Thani said earlier this year that it was keen to expand outside Thailand. Khunying Chanut Piyaoui, the group's founder and managing director, said: 'I would like to invest overseas, not to make a lot of money, but because I want to present Thai customs, tradition, art and culture, food and hospitality.' Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank said it sold its 10 per cent stake in Advanta Management to a US investor at the end of October, reports Reuter. A spokesman said the bank had long intended to sell the stake. He said the sale had nothing to do with bourse speculation in mid-October that Advanta had run into financial difficulties.</p>

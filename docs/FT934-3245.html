			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: UK banks intend to increase lending Banks operating in the UK have grown in confidence following the recovery in their earnings and plan to lend more to businesses over the next 12 months, a survey* of 175 UK and foreign banks has found. The survey by the Association of Corporate Treasurers and the Bank Relationship Consultancy found that over half the banks were already planning to increase their loan books, and 70 per cent intended to do so within 12 months. The publication of the survey follows a fall in margins on loans this year to large corporations considered the equivalent of US investment grade. Banks have been trying to increase their low risk lending. About a third of banks surveyed believed margins were increasing in corporate lending as a whole, and half expected them to remain the same. About half the banks expect to see a reduction in margins within 12 months. Mr Gerald Leahy, director general of the association, said the switch in bank attitudes was encouraging, given that one bank executive had predicted at the beginning of the year that banks would be reluctant to lend. Mr Leahy said the remaining question was whether banks would be willing to lend to established medium-sized companies, although there was evidence that they were starting to seek high returns on more risky loans. The survey found that manufacturing, other banks and utilities were the industrial sectors banks favoured most for lending, while real estate, construction and leisure remained out of favour.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Tribunal rejects plea to release Fiat executives A MILAN civil liberties tribunal yesterday rejected requests for the release of two top Fiat executives held in prison since February 22 on charges of corruption. The tribunal accepted prosecution arguments that the two men, Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr Antonio Mosconi, head of Toro, the Turin car group's insurance arm, were liable to influence the course of justice if released. The decision is a blow to Fiat since Mr Mattioli is one of the four top members of the group's management structure following a reorganisation last December. It underlines Milan magistrates' determination to press charges against the two men concerning alleged payments of L1.8bn (Pounds 821,000) by Cogefar-Impresit, Fiat's construction subsidiary, during the building of Milan's metro. Both Mr Mattioli and Mr Mosconi have served on the Cogefar-Impresit board. Mr Vittorio Chiusano, Fiat's lawyer, commented after the decision: 'There was not much hope the request would be received.' Last May Mr Enzo Papi, chief executive of Cogefar-Impresit, was arrested on similar charges and held for 55 days in prison until he confessed. Mr Papi's confession, with that of a Christian Democrat politician, are now being used in allegations against Mr Mattioli and Mr Mosconi. In other developments yesterday, Mr Giuseppe Santoro, a diplomat formerly in charge of overseas aid at the foreign ministry, was arrested on charges of extortion and abuse of office. His arrest is part of an investigation by Rome magistrates into alleged misuse of foreign aid, especially to Bangladesh, Somalia and Sudan that already involves Mr Gianni de Michelis, the former foreign secretary.</p>

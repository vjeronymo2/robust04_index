			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Standard Life sells stake in lossmaking Excalibur STANDARD Life Assurance has sold its 4.99 per cent holding in Excalibur Group, the precision engineering and jewellery company which last week announced annual pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.2m. The disposal was made on the day Excalibur announced the losses and appointed Mr Arthur Church as chief executive. Standard is likely to have suffered a significant loss on the disposal of the 3m shares. Although the shares closed 1 1/2 p up on the day at 13p, Standard has held a substantial stake since 1991 when they traded at about 45p. Mr Richard Griffiths, the chairman's brother who has relinquished the managing director's role in favour of a non-executive board position, announced that he had purchased 200,000 shares at 15 1/2 p on Monday, bringing his total holding to 0.33 per cent. The shares last night closed 2 3/4 p higher at 18p.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Institutions may vote against WPP restructure LENDERS TO WPP, the worldwide marketing services group, have more to lose than to gain by sending the company into liquidation and are unlikely to make good on their threat to do so if shareholders fail to support a proposed restructuring, a leading institutional shareholder said yesterday. Mr Anthony Bolton, senior investment director at Fidelity Investment Services, which has a 9.5 per cent stake in WPP, said: 'Administration cannot be a goal for them.' Among other things, the lenders would be left as owners of a group of companies for which no immediate buyer exists. Furthermore, clients would be unlikely to transmit payments for purchases of advertising space to companies that are already in receivership. Shareholders must decide by August 5 whether to accept the terms of the restructur-ing. WPP's management and its financial advisers, Samuel Montagu, have recommended that they do so while the lenders have said they have no alternative. Mr Bolton said that Fidelity and a group of other shareholders, who between them represent 30 to 40 per cent of WPP's convertible cumulative preference shares, are considering voting against the restructuring proposal which will effectively give the lenders a majority equity stake in the company. So far, the banks have refused to try to reach a negotiated settlement, he said. In particular, the preference shareholders believe the terms are particularly disadvantageous to them. According to one institutional shareholder, the voting and income rights of preference shareholders will be cut to three quarters of that of ordinary shareholders, instead of the 150 per cent as the current securities provide. Mr Bolton said that he personally believed the terms were too generous to the lenders. 'The banks lent imprudently to finance an expansion which was unsustainable and they have to accept some of the pain,' he said. Fidelity has suggested several compromises to the lenders including a plan to issue warrants to preference shareholders exerciseable between 45p and 60p per share. This would dilute the banks' stake down to as low as 33 per cent.</p>

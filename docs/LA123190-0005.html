			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE INSURANCE CLAIMS, REFORM  </P> <P> The supporters of Proposition 103 were foolish to believe that any action short  of recalling insurance commissioner Roxani Gillespie would provide relief from  rising insurance companies. Her lame-duck actions reveal that the system  doesn't have checks and balances, rather it favors the checks that don't bounce  and large insurance companies' account balances.  </P> <P> J. BRIAN AMSTER, Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Bond prices fall again in Europe on inflation fears European government bond markets posted further declines yesterday amid renewed fears of inflation. But the US Treasury market rebounded from a morning sell-off triggered by evidence of growing price pressures in the manufacturing sector. In Europe, dealers reported selling mainly by institutional investors who had been sitting on loss-making positions for months. This combined with technically-driven selling in the futures markets to push prices in many markets to new lows for the year. Shares in London and Paris were dragged lower by the weaker bond prices, while German stocks edged higher but finished well below their best. The FT-SE 100 index closed down 38.6 at 2,931.9, its lowest finish since July. French shares ended with sharp losses, with the CAC-40 closing 50.22 lower at 1,972.18, below 2,000 for the first time since July. US shares lost ground in the morning but recovered in tandem with US bond prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down as much as 25 points during the day, finished up 2.46 at 3,760.83. An unexpected jump in prices paid by US manufacturers in May, revealed in a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, set off the early weakness in US bonds. The rally came amid further declines in commodity prices and talks of unannounced bond purchases by the Federal Reserve. US bond traders were awaiting tomorrow's May employment data. The Commerce Department report is expected to provide further clues on US monetary policy. Higher-than-expected German industrial production data con-tributed to the fall in European bonds. The UK gilts market was one of the worst performers, plagued by fears that the economic recovery will fuel inflationary pressures and lead to monetary tightening. The June contract of the UK government bond future traded on Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, broke through 100 and fell as low as 99 17/32 before closing around 99 25/32 , down 1 1/32 . Despite a small reduction in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase rate, by 5 basis points to 5.15 per cent, sentiment remained negative on German interest rate movements. The repo rate is used as a benchmark for interest rates in German money markets. German government bonds were also sold following remarks by Mr Guntram Palm, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, indicating that interest rate cuts in the near term were unlikely. German bonds did not suffer as much as other European bonds. The June Bund futures contract on Liffe fell to around 92.30, down 0.54. Bond markets in Scandinavia and southern Europe were hit by heavy foreign selling.

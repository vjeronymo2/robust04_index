Most  of the LSI makers in the country will increase DRAM production  by 20&percnt; from now until the end of the year. By companies  ensuring their source of supply and inventory, the supply is  sufficient for two to three months in the future. At the  beginning of next year, the plant of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.  which had an accident will partially recover and increase the  quantity of production. Many LSI makers say that the movement  towards reducing the amount of epoxy resin used which began  after the accident will advance in the future as well. There are  costs from the perspective of environmental problems as well. On  the other hand, the raw material of the sealing material can be  ensured in terms of quantity, but the problems of an oligopoly  remain in that system as usual.    The instability in the supply of epoxy resin which is the  raw  material for package sealer was caused by the accident of  Sumitomo Chemical (previously reported in the August 1993 issue  of this magazine, pp 123-124), but according to the recovery  plan after the accident reported by this company on 5 August, it  was estimated that the previous supply can be ensured in January  of next year. The supply will decrease within the year, but  appears to be supported by the inventory.    Even considering the DRAM production increase plan (see  ``Domestic LSI makers together to increase DRAM production  20&percnt;'' published separately) presented here by the LSI  companies  together, an outstanding shortage does not occur. In the future,  the estimate of whether the demand of industry as a whole will  be satisfied is divided among LSI makers, but companies will  ensure their own portion even when responding ``some shortage''  in the survey conducted by this magazine at the beginning of  October (Table 1).    Makers saying ``no shortage'' were Toshiba, Fujitsu, and Oki  Electric Industry. In particular, Toshiba makes the same  estimate as the optimistic MITI presentation in August  (previously reported in the September 1993 issue of this  magazine, pp 123-125). Therefore, measures toward reducing the  amount of epoxy used have not been planned in particular. Of  course, Fujitsu and Oki Electric Industry also are ``ensuring  the supply for our company'' and say they are not worried about  a shortage.    NEC and Hitachi said ``some shortage.'' NEC especially gave  concrete figures of 5 to 10&percnt; and estimated a shortage. In  the  background, both companies appear to be biased towards a single  supplier of sealing material. Because a supply shortage will  result if the supplier cannot ensure the epoxy in this type of  system, the influence of the demand of the industry as a whole  is easily applied. NEC has already ensured enough for two to  three months and damage to the user appears slight.  <H5>  Long term reduction of quantity of epoxy used </H5>   Many LSI makers say the technical development because of the  reduction in the amount of epoxy used which began when the  supply instability occurred will continue. The following  countermeasures for reducing the amount used have been found:    (1) increasing the coefficient of utilization for the  sealing  material;    (2) increasing the filler charging rate;    (3) changing to a biphenyl system.    Despite the excess or deficiency, they are handled as a part  of the environmental countermeasures.    (1) and (2) were given by all of the makers surveyed as  useful means of reduction. NEC says it can raise the coefficient  of utilization by 20 to 30&percnt; and Oki Electric by  30&percnt;. With (2)  for increasing the filler charging rate and reducing the epoxy,  Oki Electric reduced the percentage of epoxy from 20&percnt; to  10&percnt;.  Hitachi reduced the quantity of epoxy used 20&percnt;. NEC and  Oki  Electric are examining the change in materials in (3).    With the progress of these countermeasures, there is a risk  that there will once again be an epoxy surplus. The supply from  Choshunjinzo Resin of Taiwan, on which Sumitomo Chemical relies  for joint production, began and the first line of Sumitomo  Chemical aiming for a year end recovery is said to be ``recovery  is smooth.'' There is also the stronger production of Nippon  Kayaku Co., Ltd. The time is undecided, but the danger of a  supply surplus is high if another line of Sumitomo Chemical  recovers.    Also, when the quantity of filler is increased, there is a  possibility that an unstable supply of filler will result next.  The general use, spherical silica is becoming mainstream as a  filler material effective for low stress because of the state of  oligopoly of the electro-chemical industry.  <H3>  Domestic LSI makers together to increase DRAM production  20&percnt; </H3>   US and Japan LSI makers have set about increasing DRAM  production together. In the background, the major 4M sales are  satisfactory mainly in the United States.    First on the list is NEC and Hitachi making 10 million per  month by the end of the year; most will increase production of  4M by about 20&percnt;.    The two means of increasing production are to strengthen the  production capacity and to switch production items. Two methods  to switch production items are the method of switching to the  shrink edition and expanding the production quantity and the  method of reducing the 1M production quantity and turning back  the production surplus.    NEC and Toshiba are expanding production capacity. With  continuing satisfactory 4M demand, production facilities will be  added to the current mass production plants by next spring.  Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Oki Electric Industries are handling the  item switch. Hitachi and Oki Electric avoided additional  investment as it is unclear whether the 4M demand will continue.  The shrink edition production percentage is drawn upwards.  Fujitsu is reducing the production of the 1M cut down edition  and turning toward production capacity.    United States manufacturers are also increasing production.  The Texas Instruments company will strengthen 4M production  capacity 35&percnt; by next spring. Along with increasing the  production capacity of existing plants, they operated the  Singapore plant constructed in a joint venture. Also, the United  States Motorola company has said it will somewhat increase  Tohoku Semiconductor in a joint venture with Toshiba by next  spring.    On the other hand, Korean manufacturers will not increase 4M  production. This is because process technicians are divided by  the switch to low voltage production and because the shift to  16M is sudden.       Table 1.

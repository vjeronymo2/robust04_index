			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: RH Macy to enter 'TV shopping' business R. H. MACY, the bankrupt New York-based department store group, plans to enter the growing 'TV shopping' business, initially in a joint venture with Cablevision, one of the larger US cable operators, and two well-known television executives. The partners are setting up a company, called TV Macy's, and hope to start airing Macy's wares on Cablevision systems by the autumn of 1994. The stores group will have an unspecified majority interest in the venture, while Cablevision and the two individuals - Mr Thomas Leahy, a former president of CBS television, and Mr Don Hewitt - will own minority stakes. Macy declined to say how much the venture would cost to set up, although one retail consultant has suggested Dollars 50m. However, Macy did say the investment could be found from currently anticipated capital spending. 'It's nothing that the creditors don't know about,' said the company. Although Macy is talking about selling its merchandise over the Cablevision systems, it hopes to bring other cable TV operators into the venture. 'Other equity holders, including additional cable operators and capital partners, are expected to join the venture in the future,' it said yesterday. The plan is to market Macy's goods via cable TV. Cable subscribers will be able to place orders by phone, and receive deliveries within several days. TV shopping has had a mixed record in the US, and a smattering of large department store groups - such as Dayton Hudson and J. C. Penney - experimented with the concept in the 1980s, but never pursued the business. However, there has been a perceptible increase in interest recently. Mr Barry Diller, credited with building up the Fox network in the US, recently agreed to invest Dollars 25m in QVC, one of the two leading home shopping channels, and to become its chairman.</p>

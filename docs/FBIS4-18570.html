			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Eastern Border Security More </F> Important"]    [Excerpts] The National Bureau of Customs wants to start  x-raying big rigs at the border crossing at Vaalimaa in order to  make smuggling between Finland and Russia more difficult.  Customs suggests that the state appropriate 60 million markkas  in this year's budget.    The X-ray equipment would be used starting in 1998. [passage  omitted]    The Bureau noted that Finnish Customs is prepared to  implement the changes required by EU [European Union]  membership. The geographical location of Finland is such that  customs inspections must be maintained at most international  airports and in most ports, even when Finland joins the EU.    "Guarding the eastern border becomes even more important  than  it previously was," noted Customs Director Juha Niskanen.    This year, Customs has not found any radioactive or other  dangerous substances. In spite of that fact, the Customs Service  is convinced that dangerous substances have been smuggled across  the border from Russia and the Baltic states.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / EC aid to unions is put at Pounds 7m THE European Community is funding British trade unions to the tune of about Pounds 7m a year, senior union officials believe. No precise figures are available for total EC funding of unions, but an estimate by Mr Glyn Ford, MEP for Greater Manchester East and leader of the European parliament's Labour group, puts it at about 50m Ecus (Pounds 35m), of which British unions are winning a growing share. Some EC money is earmarked for projects, such as the UK unions' share of the 14m Ecus set aside for a meeting of unions to discuss the setting up of European-wide works coun-cils in multinational organisations. The EC also supports various trade union organisations such as the European Trade Union Institute and the union-run Health and Safety Centre in Brussels, which directly and indirectly support union work. Unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress spent Pounds 420m in 1990, received Pounds 364m in subscription income and made up most of the shortfall from investment income. Resources from the EC thus form a small part of union income but are becoming increasingly important, especially in trans-European work. British unions led by the GMB general union are set for a new push to establish European works councils in a number of UK multinationals such as Pilkington, the glass group. The European TUC calculates that there are 21 European works councils recognised by employers, such as those at Volkswagen, the carmaker, and Bull, the computer group. As many again are not recognised. None of the 21 is in UK-based multinationals - in spite of the fact that 35 per cent of all companies operating in two or more EC countries are UK companies - and the bigger UK unions are now planning to change that. The unions do not envisage cross-border bargaining on pay - they see works councils, which focus on consultation and information, as the first step towards European bargaining on non-pay issues. Ms Bernadette Tesch, head of FIET, the commercial and clerical workers' union industry committee, said at last week's TUC congress that issues such as training, equality and health and safety, could be the subject of such bargaining. Mr Emilio Gabaglio, general secretary of the European TUC, also told last week's TUC that the social dimension in the EC must operate through a combination of legislation and collective bargaining. Mr Gabaglio said: 'Cross-border bargaining is a major objective for the future.' The Co-operative Bank is to set up a European-style works council in spite of opposition from Bifu, the banking union, according to the latest issue of Personnel Today. The bank said the works council would not be a negotiating body and that Bifu would continue to be recognised for collective bargaining.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Travel: Where the sun god rides the heavens - Nick Haslam visits India's east coast state of Orissa and the town of Puri, a major centre of pilgrimage for Hindus On a raised embankment deeply shaded with cashew nut and jacaranda trees, the road ran through emerald green paddy fields. Sari-clad women stooped among the waist-high rice, and white egrets perched on the backs of wallowing water buffalo. The air was a heady mixture of pepper flower, woodsmoke and dung. Passing a road-side temple, where a smiling goddess sat wreathed in marigold flowers and incense, our driver brought the Ambassador car to a halt. Excusing himself, he stepped out to make a small offering and to receive a dab of red dye in the middle of his forehead from a small boy in attendance. 'The goddess Batamangala,' he said. 'She protects travellers on the road.' Since survival on the crowded narrow road to Puri seemed to owe a great deal to divine intervention, I thought that Batamangala must be one of the more overworked goddesses in the immense Hindu pantheon. On the east coast of India in the state of Orissa, Puri is one of the major centres of pilgrimage for Hindus who come to worship at the temple of Jagannath, Lord of the Universe and one of the most powerful Hindu gods. The wide main street of the town was packed with a mass of cycle rickshaws, sacred cows and white-robed pilgrims, with staves and sleeping rolls slung on their backs. I got out and walked, passing roadside stalls piled high with small wooden replicas of Lord Jagannath, a simple doll-like figure with raised arms and wide staring eyes. One group of pilgrims, small wiry men with aboriginal features who were happily bargaining for a set of cooking pots, told me they had just come from Nepal and had been more than a year on the road visiting holy places. The temple of Lord Jagannath, a massive walled structure of grey stone, was surrounded by a labyrinth of small streets crowded with pilgrims, holy men (sadhus) and beggars. The main tower rose to more than 150 ft, from which long streamers floated languidly in the evening sky. Only Hindus may enter, and I was motioned to a building opposite, the town library, where a gallery overlooked the temple. Below us, a constant stream of the faithful passed through a vaulted arch into the temple; on its ramparts monkeys gambolled and scratched themselves in the gathering dusk. Smoke rose from the many cooking fires inside the compound, where 6,000 temple attendants are permanently employed in building the huge cars which every year sally forth from the temple carrying the images of Lord Jagannath and his brother and sister down the main wide street of Puri. The vast canopied cars, which have given the word juggernaut to the English language, are more than 50 ft high. They weigh 100 tons, need 4,000 men to move them, and are destroyed after the procession each year. Formerly, the faithful - worked up to fever pitch during the processions - would throw themselves under the wheels, to be sure of an instant passage to paradise. Even today, my guide told me, people still mutilate themselves during the procession. Looking down at the heaving throng, it was difficult to imagine what it must be like when Puri fills with more than 500,000 pilgrims for the festival. To escape the noise and confusion, we repaired to the South Eastern Railway Hotel for tea. Only half a mile from the temple, we seemed to step back into an older and more tranquil era as we entered. A long low building with wide verandas overlooking the Bay of Bengal, its walls are lined with hunting trophies shot by officers of the Raj. A row of tall doors opens on to the trim lawn, giving glimpses of large beds swathed in mosquito nets. We sat on the veranda in rattan chairs under a fan and a turbanned waiter brought us tea, with fish paste sandwiches and saffron cake, a combination that brought back dim memories from childhood. Behind us, a door led to the billiard room, and around a small porthole let into it at eye-level, bright red letters proclaimed the truculent command: 'Wait for stroke.' Woe betide, I thought, the careless flunkey who barged through that door at the wrong moment all those years ago. As we talked, bats flew overhead and the high cumulus hanging over the oily limpid waters of the Bay of Bengal changed slowly from lilac to purple as the sun went down. All visitors to Orissa are duty bound to visit the temple of the sun god at Konarak a few miles up the coast from Puri. The temple, which rises from the dunes like a huge jagged molar, depicts the 24-wheeled chariot which draws the sun god across the heavens. It was built in the early 13th century and lay in ruins until 1904, when sand drifts around its base were cleared and the beautiful carvings of the chariot uncovered. Also laid bare for the first time in centuries was an elaborate and highly detailed frieze of erotic carvings. The guide was rather coy about the religious significance of the enthusiastically coupling groups, and would only say that they were symbolic of the act of creation. The temple, which would once have been a place of pilgrimage to rival Lord Jagannath, was crowded with tourists. Venerable grey-haired sadhus under black umbrellas struck poses and then demanded a few rupees. Large Indian families dawdled in the pools of shade cast by the buttressed temple, the women elegant in bright saris, seeming not to look too carefully at the frenetic activities frozen for centuries in rock above their heads, while their husbands and sons peeked and giggled, taking the occasional snapshot. That afternoon was to be my last in Puri, and I decided to go for a swim. Nothing is done by halves in India, and I was escorted to the beach of the hotel by a porter carrying a sunshade, the guide - and a lifeguard. Nearby, fishing canoes were landing the day's catch, and I went over to see what they were bringing in. Fine-featured village women bargained hard with fishermen for the catch, which included shark and stingrays. I asked if it was safe to swim. 'Oh yes, sir,' the lifeguard said. 'Sharks are not available in shallow waters.' We left the fishermen and returned to the private beach. Before entering the sea, I noticed the lifeguard standing and muttering with his hands held together. 'I prayed to Baruna,' he told me as we plunged into the warm surf. 'The sea god.' Never, it seems, is the divine very far away in India. Nick Haslam's visit to Orissa was arranged by the India Tourist Office, 7 Cork Street, London W1X IPB. Tel: 071-437-3677/8.

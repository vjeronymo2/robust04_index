			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> JUDGE RULES ON MONROE ESTATE  </P> <P> A judge has ruled that one-fourth of the earnings of Marilyn Monroe's  multimillion-dollar estate belongs to a British psychiatric center for  children, court papers revealed today.  </P> <P> The money, which was tied up in a court battle launched by the widow of  Monroe's acting coach, will go to the Anna Freud Centre for the Psychoanalytic  Study and Treatment of Children in England, according to the ruling by Judge  Marie Lambert in Manhattan Surrogate's Court.  </P> <P> The estate of Marilyn Monroe, the blonde sex symbol who died in 1962 from an  overdose of drugs and alcohol, grosses more than $1 million a year in royalties  and other proceeds.  </P> <P> In her simple three-page will, Monroe gave 75% of the proceeds to her acting  coach, Lee Strasberg. His widow, Anna Strasberg, was subsequently named  administrator of Monroe's estate after her husband's death.  </P> <P> Monroe willed the remaining 25% to her psychiatrist, Dr. Marilyn Kris, to be  used "for the furtherance of the work of such psychiatric institution or group  as she shall elect."  </P> <P> Kris died in 1980 and in her own will left her share of Monroe estate proceeds  to the Hampstead Child-Therapy Clinic, precursor of the Freud Centre.  </P></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / This Week: Film/Video Slim pickings in the cinema this week. Major League II provides a sedative for stressed-out late-year audiences, while Albert Finney slogs through an American-backed film of Terence Rattigan's The Browning Version. Though directed by Britain's Mike Figgis, this tale of an unloved schoolmaster becomes a wasteland of blitzed credibility with a few small fragments of human pathos. Watch for the howlers in the cricket match, and quail at the just-for-Yank-audiences presence of Matthew Modine as second-lead schoolteacher. Better to settle in with the week's new videos. Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven is the deconstructed cowboy masterpiece that won its star-director a hatful of Oscars. Violent but powerful. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the famous Disney animation feature - fresh as paint after 57 years - about a girl held hostage by extremist mineworkers. And Victor Sjostrom's The Phantom Carriage (1920) and Benjamin Christensen's Haxan (1922) are two marvellous Scandinavian rarities - about ghosts and witches respectively - unearthed by the sex-and-horror video label Redemption, as if to atone for the tripe they usually turn out. At the ICA let me fanfare a season of Korean cinema. This lasts throughout this week and brings another revelation from the enterprise peninsula. The Koreans already make all our TVs, teapots and tennis shoes: now they are turning out high-style comedies and costume dramas. Look out especially for Soponye and Mandala, both by the veteran director Im Kwon-Taek. It is probably time for you to book for the London Film Festival. Following hard on Halloween, this opens on November 3 with Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein (Robert De Niro as the monster) and then becomes the usual heady mixture of trick-and-treat. More about the treats in next Thursday's film column. As for the tricks, keep a pinch of salt handy when you read the brochure's hyperbolised write-ups. Can 200 films all be good? Floreeat festa, but caveat emptor. The LFF, based at London's National Film Theatre, is open to all. Inquiries, tel: 0171-928-3232.</p>

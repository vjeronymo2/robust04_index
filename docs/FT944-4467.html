			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / People: Waldegrave's thinking CAPs William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, plans to turn the government's long-term antipathy towards the Common Agricultural Policy into clear proposals for reform by next year. He has just announced the appointment of a new group - chaired by him - which will discuss ideas on all aspects of UK policy on the CAP. Waldegrave believes the CAP will have to be reformed extensively before it can accommodate enlargement to eastern European countries. He has charged his new group of 11 strong-minded individuals from all sectors of the farming and food industry with suggesting imaginative and practical ways to develop government thinking on the subject. The members of the CAP committee include Bridget Bloom, who was the FT's agriculture correspondent from 1987 to 1992 and now sits on the Meat and Livestock Commission and the Forestry Commission, and Fiona Reynolds, director of the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Many of the members have farming interests: Chris Haskins, chairman of dairy group, Northern Foods, lives on a farm in east Yorkshire and Ewen Cameron farms in Somerset and is vice chairman of the Country Landowners' Association. Poul Christensen farms in Oxfordshire and Dorset and is soon to join the board of Milk Marque, the farmers' dairy co-operative. Helen Browning is an organic farmer and chairman of the British Organic Farmers. Lord Plumb is a member of the European Parliament as well as a farmer and former president of the National Farmers' Union. In addition, Waldegrave has included four academics: Professor Allan Buckwell from Wye College, University of London, Graham McConnell, principal of Harper Adams Agriculture College in Shropshire who worked as an agricultural adviser in New Zealand, David Pearce, professor of environmental economics at University College, London, and Sean Rickard, lecturer in business economics at the Cranfield School of Management, who was until recently chief economist at the NFU.</p>

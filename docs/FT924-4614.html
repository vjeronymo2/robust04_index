			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (17): Virtually all the answers THE VIRTUAL CORPORATION by William H Davidow and Michael S Malone HarperBusiness, Dollars 23, 294 pages LIFE CYCLES, MONEY CYCLES by Patricia Lynch John Wiley &amp; Sons Dollars 19.95, 270 pages SUCCESSFUL TEAM BUILDING by John Davis, Peter Millburn, Terry Murphy, Martin Woodhouse Kogan Page, Pounds 17.95, 184 pages DEALING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE by Roberta Cava Piatkus Books, Pounds 8.95, 182 pages PART of the corporate hangover of the 1980s is the immense quantity of business books now cluttering bookshops and airport bookstalls. Many must have been planned and commissioned in the late 1980s, which is one good reason for regarding them with a healthily jaundiced eye. If these guys are such hot shots, if capitalism and corporate management are so accessible and describable - how come we're in the mess we're in? At a guess, the amount of harm done to companies by stuff printed in business books must be colossal. The trouble is: how can you know which managers or underlings have been indoctrinated by which version of which cock-eyed theory or numbskull extrapolation? Answer comes there none. Not that I would stop anyone reading The Virtual Corporation, which is subtitled Structuring and Revitalising the Corporation for the 21st Century. It has strong entertainment value. It may even be sensible. For a start, it should appeal to all sci-fi fans - a broad church, numbered in millions - while its general approach is excitingly pre-millennial. 'Virtual' corporations, we learn, will sell 'virtual' products and services, defined as those that adapt in real time to customers' changing needs. Typically, customers will participate in the design and creation of what they buy. We are talking 'co-destiny' relationships between corporations of the 21st century and their suppliers, distributors and retailers. We are talking commitment to do almost anything necessary to keep customers for life. We are talking new, flattened corporate organisational profiles that eliminate middle management and greatly empower line-workers. With luck, several thousand chief executives will read this book, shudder, bang themselves between the eyes - and start to raise their games. They can skip Life Cycles, Money Cycles. It is said to be aimed at the 'beginning investor,' and to contain unique and useful insights. True, there are spots of good advice. One of them: beware stockbrokers' recommendations. 'At best, a broker's advice is no better than your own good judgment.' Possibly that is true. But the book contains so much unintended humour that you may have to ask for it at the comedy counter. Not so Successful Team Building, which is abysmally po-faced and likely to interest only the most wretched tiers of middle management: the folk who will be swept from the building about seven years from now if The Virtual Corporation knows what it is talking about. Conversely, I enjoyed Dealing With Difficult People. I have been called a prima donna, though on weasely, scatterbrained evidence. Be that as it may, this book has vaulted me two steps ahead in the corporate rat race. Now I know why I am difficult. And I know how to deal with me.</p>

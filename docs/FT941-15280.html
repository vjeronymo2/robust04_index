			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Ringing in the revolution - A look at the way technology is affecting financial services The British are becoming more comfortable with telephones, and this is causing a revolution in financial services. More than 90 per cent of households in the UK now have a phone and, although it sometimes seems difficult to escape, it also means you are within easy reach of your banker, insurance broker or stockbroker. Telephone-delivered services are a hot item in mass-market financial services, but they have been warming up for years. In the mid 1980s, computers seemed the answer to everything. Every home was expected to contain a computer within a few years, so linking your computer with the bank's computer by means of a phone line seemed logical. Bank of Scotland was the real pioneer in UK telephone banking with its computerised Home Office Banking Service, launched in 1985. Other banks followed with systems using home computers, specially-designed terminals, or voice- or tone-activated systems. But almost 10 years on, there are still many technophobes around, who do not feel comfortable plugging a computer into their phone socket, or holding a tone-pad to the mouthpiece. The financial services industry soon realised that although people were happy using the phone, what they mostly wanted was human contact, not screeching modems. So telephone and computer-based services where the interaction is with a person have taken off - look at the success of Direct Line in the general insurance market. It could not operate without sophisticated information technology, but customers deal with a friendly, human being at the end of a phone. First Direct, the independent Midland offshoot launched in 1989, has shown the way for personal banking with a similar formula. Many of the banks which rushed to offer computer-based services in the late 1980s are giving up on the high-tech approach and going for real people instead. The TSB is phasing out its Speedlink service, to be replaced with a 24-hour fully staffed operation. Lloyds gave up on its computerised phone service in 1990, and is now planning to join the club of telephone bankers with a human touch later this year. Barclays has successful pilots for its new personal service running in several regions, and is planning to go national in due course. NatWest has both the computer-based ActionLine, and PrimeLine, a centralised, personal-contact service for customers earning more than Pounds 18,000. The Bank of Scotland still operates HOBS, and has many loyal customers for it, but it has also succumbed to the human revolution, and launched Phone Line, a real people service, as well. Earlier this month, Bristol &amp; West became the first building society to offer a 24-hour, fully-staffed telephone service for investors. However, First Direct has not been the model in all ways. It is a centralised operation, with no branches, and customers are not allocated to a particular manager. The majority of the rival services are designed as supplements to branches: customers have a choice of voice-to-voice or face-to-face contact, and they can still feel that somewhere there is a manager with personal responsibility for their account. The attraction of telephone banking for most people is speed and convenience. You do not have to visit the bank branch except to pay in cheques (and that can be done by post). There is certainly no need to queue to pay the gas bill, change a standing order or direct debit, check your balance, order a cheque book and so on. Some banks let you order foreign currency over the phone, haggle over your overdraft, or even arrange a mortgage or buy and sell shares. Girobank says its most common service over the phone is giving an up-to-date account balance, followed by chequebook requests and checks on whether a salary or some other payment has been paid in. Additionally, all the telephone banking services are open for longer hours than normal banks, including at weekends. First Direct says that more than half of its calls are outside normal banking hours. It is even open on Christmas day. The Co-op says its busiest time is between 10 am and 11am on Mondays and its daily peak is between 4.30 pm and 5.30 pm - obviously, even though most services use local rate telephone numbers, many customers prefer to call on company time. When banks offer a personal telephone service as an add-on to standard branch-based accounts, the service is usually free (apart from the cost of the call), and account charges are the same as usual. You may have to pay extra for computer-linked services, particularly if you need a special terminal. Telephone-only accounts - such as First Direct or NatWest's PrimeLine - will have different charging structures from the bank's other accounts, so you will need to check whether they are good value for your pattern of use. Security is a concern for many people. All telephone banking systems use passwords or personal identification numbers, and usually other pieces of personal information, such as your mother's maiden name or a memorable date. Although not all the information will be requested each time you make a call, it is better not to make a habit of calling frequently within earshot of the same person. One other worry is what happens in cases when there is a dispute between you and the bank over your instructions - you do not have the comfort of a stamped cheque stub or bill as proof of your transaction. It is sensible to make your own notes on each phone call. If the bank says it has no record of your request, what do you do? Some telephone banks, such as First Direct and Barclays, prevent such problems by tape-recording all calls. Others just tape a proportion or make notes. The Co-op sends written confirmation of all telephone transactions, so that any discrepancies can be caught early.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TELEPHONE BANKING  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                    Contact        Overdraft***            Hours**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays*               Person               Yes              7am-11pm Bank of Scotland        Computer or           No               7am-1am                         Person                No          6am-midnight Co-op                   Person               Yes          6am-midnight First Direct            Person               Yes              24 hours Girobank                Person               Yes         8.30am-8.30pm NatWest                 Tonepad or            No              24 hours                         person               Yes              8am-10pm N &amp; P                   Tonepad               No              24 hours TSB*                    Person               Yes              24 hours  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Pilot schemes ** on weekdays *** can overdraft be arranged over the phone?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

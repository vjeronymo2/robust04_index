			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Vitaliy Chukseyev report: "Nuclear Passions </F> in the Pentagon"]    [Text] Washington -- Discussions have started up in the  Pentagon and other U.S. military "think tanks" about the  possible use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries as  a counterstrike measure or means of deterrence against a  chemical- or biological-weapons attack. The justification for  this discussion is the annual Defense Department report  submitted to the President and the Congress. The weekly DEFENSE  NEWS reports that it contains a proposal to look at the  possibility of taking such a step in the light of the U.S.  renunciation of chemical and biological weapon use.    All this introduces a new element into the formulation of a  new U.S. nuclear strategy in the conditions following the end of  the Cold War. It is very clear that a U.S. repudiation of its  pledge not to use these weapons against nonnuclear countries  will have far-reaching consequences and will also necessitate  major corrections to the priorities by which the Pentagon and  the Department of Energy are guided in their expenditure. As  Jack Mendelssohn, deputy director of the Arms Control  Association, stated, these two departments "are just itching for  an excuse to hang on to and modernize their arsenals." The U.S.  commitment not to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear  countries which was adopted in 1978 and which became an element  in the 1968 Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons is  also under threat.    Opponents of the review note that it will strike a blow  against the efforts being made by Bill Clinton's Administration  in the sphere of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, whereas  its supporters believe that this step will act as a deterrent in  relations with those countries which are striving to develop the  means to wage chemical and biological war.    But who will get the upper hand?</p>

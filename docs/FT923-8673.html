			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Kohl cannot win on abortion MOTHER knows best. Chancellor Helmut Kohl may well have reflected on the old saw as he contemplated last week's interim injunction from the constitutional court in Karlsruhe, which blocked the introduction of Germany's new abortion laws. A long time ago, the story goes, young Helmut came home congratulating himself on a powerful anti-abortion speech in the state parliament of the Rhineland Palatinate. His mother, the story continues, warned him then: 'Son, better hold your tongue. You don't understand anything about it'. While the fire may have faded in his later interventions, Mr Kohl held his ground during sporadic liberalisation debates throughout his career. But the issue emerged again, uncomfortable as ever and this time unavoidable, after unification, when it became essential to end the conflict between laws in east and west Germany. In essence, the decision on whether a woman was allowed an abortion lay with the woman in the GDR, and with her doctor in the west. Mr Kohl was consistent during the following two years of tormented political and moral debate. With one eye on his Christian Democrats' closest allies, the catholic Christian Social Union of Bavaria, and one hand on the constitution, which states 'everyone shall have the right to life and to inviolability of his person', he maintained his opposition to relaxation. But a free parliamentary vote on an amendment in June, granting a woman the right to abortion up to 12 weeks provided she accepted counselling, swept him and his allies aside as eastern CDU members and Liberal Democrats joined the opposition for the day. An appeal for an injunction went immediately to Karlsruhe, supported by 247 centre-right Bundestag members and the entire Bavarian government. As the muted reaction from CDU ranks demonstrated, last week's interim decision was not counted as a victory. It was more a defeat for the chancellor's efforts to restore faith in his ability both to govern and his government's capacity to reflect popular concerns. Mr Kohl's popularity, hit by economic troubles, the failure of the east to develop into his promised 'blooming landscape', the flood of refugees and doubts over the Maastricht treaties on European unity, is already at a level which could cost him power if an election were held now. Opinion polls have consistently shown an increasing desire for easing of Germany's restrictive abortion laws. The Social Democrat opposition can be counted on to continue the debate outside the court and the confines of the Bundestag, until the court delivers its definitive judgment at the end of the year. One aim will be to deepen further the rifts between the CDU core, its disenchanted membership in the east, and its Bavarian colleagues. The Karlsruhe ruling, a masterpiece of technical talk from a panel of seven male judges and one woman, resolved nothing. The constitutional issue, the heart of the plaintiffs' case, was not even addressed. Whatever the final outcome, Mr Kohl cannot win. A verdict for the amendment will be read as a clear defeat for his government while a vote against will mean the defeat of a clear majority of the electorate.</p>

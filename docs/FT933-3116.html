			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Greek bank plans rights to fund Balkan expansion COMMERCIAL Bank, Greece's second-largest banking group, is seeking to raise Dr49.3bn (Dollars 210m) through a rights issue to help it expand into other Balkan markets. The bank, which has a market share in Greece of about 20 per cent, reported pre-tax profits of Dr14bn for the first half of 1993, up from Dr11.8bn the previous year. Commercial Bank started restructuring two years ago, disposing of non-banking assets and writing off some Dr14bn in debt owed by public sector Greek companies. The bank last year sold a loss-making shipyard to a London-based Greek shipping company and a small banking subsidiary, Bank of Piraeus, to a group of Athens businessmen. It is considering a merger with Ionian Bank, another, profitable, subsidiary, which has also undergone restructuring. The move would raise the group's local market share to over 25 per cent and add another 100 branches to its Greek network. Another subsidiary, Investment Bank, is being liquidated. Most of its assets, amounting to around Dr19bn, will be divided between Commercial Bank and Ionian Bank, the two main shareholders. Commercial Bank's two-for-five issue is being made at Dr8,500 per share, close to book value. Once the issue is completed, later this month, one bonus share will be offered for every 10 old shares held. About Dr30bn of the funds raised will be used to set up branches in Romania and Bulgaria by next year. The bank also plans to become the first Greek commercial bank to operate in Turkey.</p>

This confirmation was made yesterday by  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, during an approximately 20-minute  meeting with Gaviria at the Carreras Hotel in Santiago.    It has also been learned that the U.S. assistant secretary  of  state for inter-American affairs, Alexander Watson, asked  Paraguay to vote for Gaviria, whose efforts in the struggle  against drug trafficking and the Colombian mafia have satisfied  Washington.    "We confirmed our support for him," said Wasmosy after the  meeting with Gaviria, even though the previous administration of  General Andres Rodriguez had promised its support to Costa Rican  Foreign Minister Paul Niheaus, who is also here in Santiago  holding meetings seeking support.    NOTICIAS talked with Gaviria on his desire to become OAS  secretary general. Gaviria said he hopes the result of the  final elections in the OAS will serve to strengthen that  inter-American organization.    He said: "I have great confidence in their maturity, in how  the countries value my representation and what I can do as  leader of OAS."    Asked about the pressure the United States is reportedly  exerting in favor of his candidacy, he said: "I believe the  United States is simply expressing the opinion it has always  held on the qualifications I may have for holding that position.  That or any other country of the Americas has the right to  express an opinion publicly."</p>

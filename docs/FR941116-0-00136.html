			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Such yield shall be based on the county yield determined by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for the preceding 5 crop years;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The highest and lowest yield in such 5-year period shall be excluded; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The remaining 3 crop year yields shall be averaged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If a county yield is not available from NASS for the 5 preceding years for a crop of soybeans or minor oilseeds, State committees shall calculate the yields using the following data:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) State or area yields determined by NASS for the 5 preceding crop years, calculated as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If neither State or area yields for the 5 preceding years are available from NASS, yields from FmHA for such years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If such yields are not available from FmHA, data for such yields from other government entities, such as Extension Service (ES).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If no yield information is available from the sources listed in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section, obtain yields from other available sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.17  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Historical weighted yields (HWY).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If separate irrigated and nonirrigated farm crop program payment yields were established for the 1990 crop on a farm, the program payment yield for such crop for the 1994 through 1997 crop years shall be a HWY that is determined by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Multiplying the smaller of the effective irrigated acreage maximum (IAM) determined according to &sect;1413.18 or the CAB times the 1990 irrigated farm program payment yield for the crop;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Subtracting the IAM from the current year CAB and multiplying the result, not less than zero, times the 1990 nonirrigated farm program payment yield for such crop; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Totaling the results of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this section and dividing by the current year effective CAB. If the result is zero, the HWY yield is the 1990 nonirrigated program payment yield for the crop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Irrigated acreage maximum (IAM) for determining HWY's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The farm IAM represents the maximum acreage for which deficiency payments using the irrigated payment yield will be computed.

If 1 or more crops are produced on a farm in a 3-year rotation, the producer has the option of using the 1991 CAB and the 1990, 1988, and 1985 years or 1992 projected CAB and the years 1990, 1989, and 1986 years or 1993 projected CAB and the years 1990, 1987, and 1984 years for the computations explained above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculations for farms enrolled in the CRP.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appropriate adjustments in the IAM calculation shall be made to reflect the amount of irrigated cropland enrolled in the CRP and the amount of reduction in CAB required by the CRP contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculations for FmHA inventory farms.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a farm was in FmHA inventory prior to 1991 and had irrigated program crops prior to 1988, the county committee may approve adjustments to the farm IAM upon request from FmHA, operator, or owner.

Form CCC&hyph;507A, Agreement for Reallocation of Farm Irrigated Acreage Maximum, must be signed by both the operator and owners of the farm before the reallocation can be completed. The deadline for filing form CCC&hyph;507A is the same as for form CCC&hyph;477, Intention to Participate in the 1994 Price Support and Production Adjustment Programs. The reallocation is final for the year and becomes the following year crop IAM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

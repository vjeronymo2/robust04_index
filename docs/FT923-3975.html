			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: When expansion leads to a change of home / A look at a German chemicals company that found success in the east When Asta Medica, the pharmaceuticals subsidiary of the Degussa metals and chemicals group, made an acquisition in the state of Saxony, it went one step further than other companies expanding into east Germany. So taken was it with Arzneimittelwerk Dresden that it decided to shift its headquarters there. In fact, Asta, which plans to float a minority of its shares on the Frankfurt stock market in 1993, had been contemplating moving from its narrow site in Frankfurt. The purchase of AWD, the biggest pharmaceuticals concern in east Germany, from the Treuhand privatisation agency last December gave it the opportunity to do this and also to be close to the extensive scientific, research, and medical facilities in and around the Saxony capital. Since Asta had been looking to expand its research activities, the purchase of AWD, employing 2,200 people (including 450 scientists), enabled it to fulfil another ambition. Asta, which had a turnover of DM900m (Dollars 642.8m) in its financial year to September 30 1991 and raised net income by 14 per cent to DM33m, was also attracted by AWD's facilities for chemical synthesis; the company had supplied most of the East German industry's needs for synthesised materials. Another important reason for the deal was access to eastern Europe. Although the economic travails of the former Comecon area have weakened this argument temporarily, Mr Rolf Kramer, Asta's chief executive, has no doubt of the possibilities. 'In the medium term, there is enormous potential for pharmaceuticals, since eastern Europe's knowhow and infrastructure is not well developed in this field.' He sees future opportunities for co-operation and joint ventures in Russia and the rest of eastern Europe once the region's economies develop sufficiently to allow them to start building up their own pharmaceutical industries. 'State agencies will ask western exporters to come up with investments in Russia and elsewhere and to transfer knowhow,' he says. Companies such as Asta could supply raw materials and semi-finished products, or begin with local packaging operations. 'Russia and other countries would save hard currency and have employment.' In order to keep up the previous links with the east, Asta also bought the former East German state trading company in pharmaceuticals. Like AWD, this had been part of the big Germed pharmaceutical concern, now dissolved. Fortunately for AWD, and unlike many other east German operations, its business was not dominated by eastern Europe. About a third of its sales were made there, a proportion which is falling steadily. None of these various arguments in favour of AWD, which has nearly 10 per cent of the east German market, would have weighed much with Asta if the east German business had not been in solid shape. In contrast to much of east German industry, the pharmaceutical sector did not collapse with the coming of the D-Mark and exposure to western cost levels. Nor was it hit by the preference of east Germans for western goods after reunification. 'There is a very close relationship between the east German medical profession and local products,' Mr Kramer explains. 'Doctors are used to these brands and have strong loyalty to them.' Even before Asta appeared, AWD had had the funds to start modernising its facilities in the hope of being acquired by a western company. Asta has invested about DM100m in AWD's plant and spent a further DM100m on repairs and maintenance. The funds came from the cash flow of AWD, whose turnover is about DM400m a year. It aims to continue investing at the rate of about DM50m a year. Sales revenues are being eroded, however, by the government's requirement that some pharmaceutical prices be cut by 25 per cent to take account of the fragile east German economy. This is apart from the Bonn government's efforts to save on soaring west German health costs by making extensive savings in medical spending. With more than 16m people in east Germany, AWD, whose specialties include circulatory, alimentary, and analgesic drugs, expects market share to shrink as competition hots up. Rising wages will also eat into profits. Because wages are generally rising faster than productivity in east Germany, Mr Kramer warns about escalating cost levels. 'This is the most vulnerable part of the whole economic development there,' he says. Yet he remains confident of AWD's earning power, not least because of the skills and attitudes of the Saxon workforce. 'Motivation is extremely high. I'm always overwhelmed.'</p>

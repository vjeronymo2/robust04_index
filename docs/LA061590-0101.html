Cal Poly SLO also won this year's CCAA track and field title.  </P> <P> Berkeland finished fifth in the state Division I cross-country championships  last fall and timed 9 minutes 7.52 seconds for 3,200 meters in the Southern  Section 4-A Division track meet in May.  </P> <P> Hoover High's Creighton Harris and Gunnar Miller, major contributors to the  Tornadoes' track and field team, have committed to attend Wisconsin and  Harvard.  </P> <P> Harris, a Wisconsin native, qualified for the state meet in the 1,600 meters  and has a personal-best 4:14.33 in the event. He also timed 1:58.60 for 800 and  9:21.4 for 3,200.  </P> <P> The No. 2 runner on Hoover's Pacific League championship cross-country team,  Harris chose the Big Ten Conference school for its recent success in  cross-country. The Badgers have won three NCAA Division I titles in the past  eight years.  </P> <P> Miller accepted a $12,000-a-year academic scholarship to Harvard, Hoover Coach  Greg Switzer said, and will compete in the pole vault. Miller led regional  vaulters with a 14-foot 6-inch mark.  </P> <P> Bob Macias, the latest to pass through the revolving door of the Notre Dame  High cross-country program, will coach the Knights this fall.  </P> <P> Macias, who helped coach cross-country and track at Bell-Jeff the past two  years, becomes Notre Dame's seventh cross-country coach in the past eight  years.  </P> <P> Marcus Reed, a high-scoring guard for Canoga Park High, will attend College of  the Sequoias in Visalia, according to Canoga Park Coach Jeff Davis.  </P> <P> Reed (5-foot-10, 155 pounds) averaged 20 points and 6.3 steals a game last  season. Sequoias, coached by former Cal State Northridge assistant John  Boragno, was ranked fourth in the final state junior college poll last season.  </P> <P> Ron Veres, a volunteer coach at Cal Lutheran last season, has joined the staff  of new Coach Joe Harper as the Kingsmen's offensive coordinator.  </P> <P> Veres, a former head coach at Oak Park High, will coach part time at Cal  Lutheran.  </P> <P> Mike Teich, a sophomore left-handed pitcher at College of the Canyons, has  signed a letter of intent to play baseball for Sacramento State on a partial  athletic scholarship, Canyons Coach Len Mohney said.  </P> <P> Teich, an El Camino Real graduate, finished 6-3 last season.  </P> <P> Lucious Harris from Cleveland High and Cal State Long Beach has been selected  to play on the West squad in the Olympic Festival in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Harris, a 6-5 guard who was the Big West Conference Freshman of the Year, joins  two other area players, Shon Tarver and Dedan Thomas, on the team.  </P> <P> Jabbar Briggs, defensive player of the year at Antelope Valley High this  basketball season, has committed to play at Antelope Valley College next  season.

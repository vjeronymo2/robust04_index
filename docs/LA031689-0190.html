			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLE REMOVAL SPREADS TO FLORIDA  </P> <P> Dade County Public Schools in Florida, the nation's fourth-largest school  district, on Wednesday joined a growing list of school systems across the  nation that have banished apples and related products from lunch menus because  of fear of daminozide, a chemical used to treat some apple crops.  </P> <P> It follows New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and scores of smaller districts  that have removed apples, apple juice and apple sauce from school cafeterias  and vending machines.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, 54 out of 82 districts as of Wednesday had stopped  serving fresh apples and products made from them.  </P> <P> However, at least two local districts -- San Marino and Antelope Valley Union  -- said they have decided to return apples to school menus today after  consulting outside experts and vendors, who told them that daminozide levels  are not harmful or were not found in the products they use.  </P> <P> In other districts, such as Culver City, Newhall Elementary and El Monte Union  High School District, officials said they were still serving apple juice,  because they were convinced that it did not contain daminozide in dangerous  levels.  </P> <P> Most districts said they are refraining from serving fresh apples and apple  products until they receive official word from the U.S. Department of  Agriculture and the state Department of Education that doing so would not pose  a health risk to children. State Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer on  Tuesday said districts were overreacting by not serving the fruit to students.  </P> <P> Jack Hastings, food and nutrition director for Dade County schools, which  provides 163,000 lunches a day, said: "When New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Los  Angeles made the decision (to stop serving apples), we decided maybe we better  do the same thing."  </P> <P> He said Dade -- which includes Miami's schools -- would continue the ban "until  we get some answer from a regulatory agency one way or another" about the  safety of apples treated with daminozide, which has been linked to cancer in  laboratory studies using rats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back in Schools  </P> <P> However, officials in the San Marino Unified School District, after receiving  verification from suppliers that their products do not contain the chemical,  decided Wednesday that it was safe to start serving apples and apple products  again, Food Service Director Susan Delgado said.  </P> <P> Likewise, students in the Newhall Elementary School District, who have not been  offered any apples since Monday, will also start seeing the fruit again today,  according to Food Services Director Terry Custer.  </P> <P> Custer said he consulted the USDA and the Toxic Information Center, a San  Francisco-based group funded by the state Department of Health Services, and is  now convinced that it is "better to eat the apples than not eat them. . . ."  </P> <P> "I'm satisfied now . . . that the whole thing has been blown slightly out of  proportion," he said.  </P> <P> In Newhall, Child Nutrition Director Geri Dee said the district's five schools  have continued to serve apple juice on demand to students who, for health or  other reasons, do not drink milk.  </P> <P> Contributing to this article were researchers Tracy Thomas and Shawn Griggs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> APPLE BAN  </P> <P> Fifty-four out of 82 Los Angeles County school districts have quit serving  apples or apple products to students because of concern over the chemical  daminozide.  </P> <P> ABC Unified School District  </P> <P> Alhambra City and High School District  </P> <P> Arcadia Unified School District  </P> <P> Azusa Unified School District  </P> <P> Bellflower Unified School District  </P> <P> Beverly Hills Unified School District  </P> <P> Bonita Unified School District  </P> <P> Castaic Union School District  </P> <P> Centinela Valley Union High School District  </P> <P> Charter Oak Unified School District  </P> <P> Claremont Unified School District  </P> <P> Compton Unified School District  </P> <P> Covina-Valley Unified School District  </P> <P> Culver City Unified School District  </P> <P> Downey Unified School District  </P> <P> Duarte Unified School District  </P> <P> East Whittier City School District  </P> <P> El Monte Union High School District  </P> <P> El Rancho Unified School District  </P> <P> El Segundo Unified School District  </P> <P> Glendora Unified School District  </P> <P> Hacienda La Puente Unified School District  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach City School District  </P> <P> Hughes-Elizabeth Lakes Union School District  </P> <P> Inglewood Unified School District  </P> <P> Keppel Union School District  </P> <P> La Canada Unified School District  </P> <P> Las Virgenes Unified School District  </P> <P> Lawndale School District  </P> <P> Little Lake City School District  </P> <P> Lowell Joint School District  </P> <P> Lynwood Unified School District  </P> <P> Monrovia Unified School District  </P> <P> Mountain View School District  </P> <P> Newhall School District  </P> <P> Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District  </P> <P> Palmdale School District  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District  </P> <P> Paramount Unified School District  </P> <P> Pomona Unified School District  </P> <P> Redondo Beach City School District  </P> <P> Rowland Unified School District  </P> <P> Saugus Union School District  </P> <P> Soledad-Agua Dulce Union School District  </P> <P> South Bay Union High School District  </P> <P> South Pasadena Unified School District  </P> <P> South Whittier School District  </P> <P> Sulphur Springs Union School District  </P> <P> Temple City Unified School District  </P> <P> Torrance Unified School District  </P> <P> West Covina Unified School District  </P> <P> Whittier City School District  </P> <P> William S.

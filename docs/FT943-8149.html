			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Talk moves on to German interest rates The crystal balls were out in force yesterday, some strategists arguing early in the day for an immediate cut in key German interest rates when the Bundesbank meets today, writes Our Markets Staff. However, Reuter's poll of 20 economists around Europe reported that 85 per cent of them thought that there would be no Buba cut today, although a majority expected a cut some time in September. At Goldman Sachs, Mr Sushil Wadhwani thought that European assets might underperform US assets temporarily, because of domestic interest rate concerns: 'Specifically,' he said, 'given that a majority of analysts still expect the Bundesbank to cut the discount rate one more time, there is clear scope for disappointment here.' FRANKFURT responded to Tuesday's US rate reduction, the Dax index closing the session up 19.15 at 2,162.29, and the post bourse at an Ibis-indicated 2,166.56. Turnover recovered from DM5.1bn to DM7.8bn. Banks and chemicals were mixed, the latter seeing a switch from Hoechst, down DM2.50 to DM356.50, and into BASF, up DM2.50 at DM329.70 with results due today. Schering, weakened by doubts cast on the safety of two of its drugs, hit DM895 in early Ibis trade before closing a net DM5.50 lower at DM909.50. The German health agency which made the accusations, meanwhile, was accused of overreaction to heavy criticism of its predecessor. ZURICH saw its banks move both ways as SBC fell on Tuesday's half-year results, the bearers losing SFr19 at SFr378 in an expected punishment for a drop in trading income. CS Holding moved ahead SFr18 to SFr549, rewarded for results in line with expectations. The SMI index ended just off the 2,600 mark, rising 10.6 to 2,599.3. Brown Boveri shed SFr9 to SFr1,250, but this was seen as selling on the good news after a 30 per cent rise in half-year net profits at the Swiss/Swedish operating group ABB. AMSTERDAM reacted sharply to results from Nedlloyd, the transport and shipping group, which released first-half figures at the lower end of analysts' expectations. The shares were marked down 9 per cent in active trading, losing Fl 6.40 at Fl 64.60. Analysts had been expecting the group to come in with a profit between Fl 34m and Fl 65m, against a loss in the same period last year of Fl 116m. However, the group posted a figure of Fl 35m, viewed as disappointing in light of the recent batch of results from other Dutch companies which have been at the upper end of forecasts. Nedlloyd also reported that it expected second-half results to be at a similar level to the first half, but could be pressured if the dollar remained weak. The AEX index ended 0.73 up at 417.80, after a session's high of 419.74. MILAN closed the last day of the August account slightly softer, with the Comit index dipping 4.93 to 649.22. In banks, BCI fell L184 to L4,174 ahead of today's launch of its capital increase programme which aims to raise some L2,360bn. Shareholders are entitled to buy new shares at L3,000 in a one-for-two rights issue, and analysts said the issue should be fully subscribed. The telecommunications sector also attracted interest, with Sip, the domestic operator, losing L91 at L4,094 on its last day of trading before it was absorbed, together with Italcable, down L166 at L9,782, into Telecom Italia. From today Telecom Italia becomes the country's integrated national telecommunications service operator and will be quoted on the bourse. Stet, the holding company, shed L33 to L4,825. PARIS strengthened, although activity remained unexceptional, as it had been for previous sessions, The CAC-40 index rose 22.93 to 2,034.98 in turnover of slightly above FFr2bn. MADRID closed lower for the fourth consecutive session, as nervousness set in late in the day following weakening trends in the domestic debt market, and on Wall Street. The general index fell 1.51 to 309.67, with Telefonica Pta25, or 1.4 per cent, off at Pta1,775. STOCKHOLM built on Tuesday's rise, helped by a good gain in Ericsson, up SKr9 at SKr402 in the 'B' shares, as investors anticipated today's half-year results. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 5.70 to 1,406.00.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- "Such actions are  welcome for they occasion, through interviews and talks, an  extensive exchange of opinions on current issues confronting our  countries, especially regarding the process of transition to  market economy," is the opinion of Mechyslaw Hryb, president of  the Supreme Soviet of the Belarus Republic.    "I view this meeting as a beneficial one, proving Romania's  wise policy towards openness. It will undoubtedly yield best  results for expanding Romania's cooperation ties with other  countries, especially economic ones. Romania has overcome the  stage of expectations. What we have done here by organizing the  Crans Montana Forum comes to prove Romania's real potential. We  are seeking for an image much closer to the real one that would  open new ways for our country. We are convinced that the Crans  Montana Forum would reflect Romania's real potential which could  attract foreign investors to our country," stated Romanian  Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Western Transvaal was tense today, but no serious  incidents occurred since 14 magisterial districts were declared  unrest areas. There were earlier reports of AWB [Afrikaner  Resistance Movement] gatherings in this area and Robbie  Terblanche went to investigate.    [Begin Terblanche recording] Everything seemed normal, and  no  serious incidents had been reported. Tension could be felt  wherever we spoke to people, and nobody was prepared to appear  on camera. There was a strong army and police presence. Several  road blocks were set up. According to the police liaison  officer for Western Transvaal, Captain Koos Degenaar, the step  to declare 14 magisterial districts unrest areas was taken  mainly to prevent unrest, conflict, and violence. We received a  report that AWB members had gathered in the Koster region but we  could not confirm this during our visit. Our investigation at  Koster led to cameraman Roy Freeman and myself being stopped by  police between Koster and Lichtenburg and escorted to the  Lichtenburg police station. They wanted to confiscate our video  material but they released us after viewing the material.  According to the police people are very tense and they are  receiving several calls from concerned people. [end recording]</p>

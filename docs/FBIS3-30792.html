			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vesna Vujic commentary: "The Democrats After `Muscle </F> Building'"]    [Text] Professor Dragoljub Micunovic, the undisputed  leader of the Democratic Party [DS] for four years and one of  the most prominent figures of the Serbian opposition, has left  the front line of the Serbian political scene. His departure  marks the end of a kind of politics of the center, and an  attempt at a compromise that was not successful, measured by the  number of deputies. It seems that in times of ultra extreme  left and extreme right political programs it could not be.    When he submitted his irrevocable resignation, Micunovic  told  the deputies at the DS convention that he wanted to spare them  the embarrassment of replacing a man of whom they could not  prove the least stigma of guilt. In fact he could not have had  such a scar, as in principle he has consistently implemented his  party's policy -- somewhere in the middle. After the 1992  elections, it became clear for the first time that the fact that  the DS gained only seven seats in parliament was  disproportionate to the great investment in the party. Thus,  even then, some communal party committees called for a change in  the party leadership and even in the policy of the DS.  Micunovic, and even Dr. Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the  Executive Committee of the DS, did not think the time was ripe.  <H5>  Policy of Compromise </H5>   Then last autumn Djindjic judged that the time was ripe and  he set off almost unstoppably on the quest for the top post in  the party and the top of Serbian politics. Although Micunovic  had recently been speaking out as a fierce oppositionist and had  been demonstrating the high standard of his rhetorical talent,  it was already too late. Along with him, all philosophers in  the DS as well as in Serbian politics have lost the battle.  Micunovic is the embodiment of sublime political contemplation,  as well as of political activity that is not in coordination  with that contemplation.    Djindjic has come to the top because, having stepped out of  Micunovic's shadow, he began to give the impression of being an  extremely practical man who knows what he wants and how to get  it. This does not necessarily mean, however, a change in DS  policy. In fact, he openly says that there will be no changes  in the program but there will be changes in action. With the  change at the top, the DS appears to be the same creature, but  after a course of vigorous "muscle building." Djindjic has  confirmed this by saying: "We are a party that has lost fat and  gained muscles."    In leaving, Micunovic certainly took with him the former  policy of compromise, particularly regarding the Socialist Party  of Serbia. The question remains of what Djindjic will do now.  In this respect, other opposition parties do not consider  Djindjic any less suspicious than Micunovic. At the end  Micunovic himself accused Djindjic of colluding with the  Socialists.    As the main evidence of this one usually cites Djindjic's  sudden haste in replacing the former leader of the Democrats,  who did not have even a full year left to go to the end of his  term. Nobody was in any doubt that Djindjic would naturally be  the head of the party after that. Moreover, long before the  denouement in the DS leadership even started, Dr. Vojislav  Seselj, who was still close to the Socialists at the time,  announced Micunovic's replacement. It is also a fact that  during his election campaign, Djindjic said that Milosevic  should not be attacked. What is more, the Democrats have no  interest at all in parliamentary posts, but are definitely  interested in all talks about a government of national unity.  <H5>  Airing of the Opposition </H5>   Djindjic considers the accusations of cooperating with the  Socialist Party of Serbia to be the greatest slander. Regarding  the change in party policy, he says he called for it because  there was a danger of the party losing the entire political  capital it had built up and of being left without a single seat  following some future elections. Secondly, he asks why he would  want any posts in the fourth Socialist government when he has  shown no interest in the previous ones. "I am not that  politically naive and stupid," the new leader of the Democrats  says.    Djindjic's sense of pragmatism -- something that, without  exception, everybody grants him -- will direct his strategy and  thereby the behavior of the DS. Namely, the Democrats proceed  from the fact that a system can be destroyed only from within,  so that the party's possible participation in the government  would not be such a great surprise. Djindjic does not conceal  the fact that his aim is not to get the votes of the opposition,  but the votes of the Socialists, as well as of the undecided.  He says very self- confidently that his next aim is 50 seats in  parliament.    His policy is also to ingratiate himself with the  Socialists,  something that at one time the Radicals were successful at. It  is clear that following the December elections, the electorate  is becoming more stable and there is less inclination toward the  extremists. With a new man the Democrats will try to occupy as  much space as possible in the political center. That is why it  is not surprising that the change at the top took place in the  party that is the embodiment of such a policy of the center.  With the power of the Socialists reduced, the opposition can  breathe a little more easily. Therefore, Micunovic's departure  may herald the airing on a bigger or smaller scale -- the  appearance of new ideas and new people -- in other opposition  parties as well.</p>

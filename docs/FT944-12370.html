			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Troops pack an uncertain punch in Rio: Patrick McCurry in Sao Paulo explains why Brazil's decision to send in the military may not work The decision to send in the military to control Rio de Janeiro's largely discredited police forces follows mounting media pressure for action against violence in the city. But there is little expectation that the move will do much to solve the city's problems of violence, corruption and drug trafficking. Rio state Governor, Mr Nilo Batista, agreed on Monday to allow the military to direct the united operations of the state-controlled military and civil police forces in city. There had been speculation if he refused President Itamar Franco would seek a 'state of defence' decree, allowing federal troops to be sent to the city. The move brings unwelcome reminders of Brazil's two decades of military rule, which ended in the mid-1980s, although most observers believe that military leaders have not sought a role in combating heavily armed drug traffickers in the city's warren-like hillside shanty towns. It is hard to know if violence is on the rise because of the lack of reliable statistics, but media pressure for action has increased following a number of violent incidents in the last two weeks. These include a revenge attack by 120 police that left 13 shanty town residents dead, the death of a 15-year-old girl from stray police bullets and the killing of a multinational executive by car thieves. Another incident that has put pressure on the government is the widespread fraud uncovered during congressional elections in Rio de Janeiro on October 3. Drug traffickers and illegal gambling racketeers - widely believed to have a large portion of the state-controlled police in their pay - are thought to be involved. According to Mr Paulo Calmon, a political scientist, action is being taken now because the presidential election, held on October 3, is out of the way. 'There seems to be a consensus that now is the time for action, so that there is no major crisis awaiting (president elect) Fernando Henrique Cardoso when he takes office next January.' Mr Cardoso has said he supports sending in troops 'if necessary' and that Rio is suffering 'an undeclared civil war.' Some analysts believe Mr Cardoso's candidate for the second-ballot election of the state governorship, to be held on November 15, has been benefiting from the controversy. 'The government could easily wait until after the second ballot. There is no civil war,' says Mr Emir Sader, a Rio-based academic specialising in research into violence. He accepts, nevertheless, that there has been a deterioration in the situation in recent months. It not clear whether troops will be sent into the shanty towns, although they would probably be welcomed by many residents there as protectors. There is always the risk they would be corrupted in the same way as their police colleagues if they stayed for a prolonged period. The problems of crime and violence are widely viewed as the result of Rio de Janeiro's economic decline starting with its replacement in 1960 as capital by the city of Braslia. The decision of former governor Leonel Brizola to restrict police activity in the shanty towns in the 1980s - after complaints from residents about police behaviour - allowed drug dealers to grow into a parallel authority. 'Nothing has been done in the last 15 years to tackle Rio's social and economic problems and now they are trying to correct the situation in a few weeks,' says Mr Sader.</p>

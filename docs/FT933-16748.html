			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Taiwan package approved TAIWAN'S cabinet yesterday approved a draft economic programme and a package of measures to promote private investment in manufacturing and to stem the flow of capital to China, writes Dennis Engbarth in Taipei. The draft, prepared by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), highlighted the sluggish state of manufacturing and emphasised the need to promote private investment. Superficially, Taiwan's economy seems strong. Average real economic growth between 1988 and 1992 of 6.7 per cent compared to the average world rate of 2.4 per cent over the period. Government planners forecast a rise of 6.33 per cent for 1993. However, the growth in fixed capital investment has been declining from between 25 and 30 per cent of GDP in the early 1980s to 21.6 per cent of GDP over the past five years. Private capital investment has been rising by an annual average of only 8.5 per cent from 1988 to 1992. Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of the CEPD, acknowledged that many manufacturers 'have set up factories in foreign countries or the (China) mainland.' Estimates of the accumulated capital outflow from Taiwan to the mainland range from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 20bn since mid-1987, when Taipei began to lift restrictions on contacts with the mainland.</p>

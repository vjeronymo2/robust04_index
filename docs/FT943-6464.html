			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: Oerlikon-Buhrle expects improved annual earnings Oerlikon-Buhrle, the Swiss weapons, engineering and retailing group, has forecast a 'clearly improved' operating result for the current year and has held out the prospect of paying a dividend for the first time in nearly a decade. Buhrle reported a 44 per cent slide in net income in the first half to SFr6m (Dollars 4.3m), but this setback was entirely due to the absence of large extraordinary gains from property sales in the current period. Operating income rose 62 per cent to SFr59.3m on flat sales of SFr1.36bn, and the result before taxes and extraordinary items advanced to a profit of SFr30.4m from a loss of SFr2.9m. The profit improvement came mainly from the Balzers vacuum engineering business and the Contraves weapons subsidiary. Balzers, which supplies surface coating equipment and services, has seen a big growth in demand this year for its machines, especially those for coating compact discs. Orders received in the first half were up 17 per cent to SFr242.7m, and its operating profit more than doubled to SFr14.4m. The long troubled Contraves division also more than doubled its operating profit from SFr7.2m to SFr16m in the first half, but Buhrle warned of lower profits in the full year. It cited budget problems in customer countries and uncertainties over Swiss policy on military equipment exports. Sales of the Bally shoes subsidiary were flat at SFr514.5m, but up 4 per cent excluding currency effects. Operating profit was down 14 per cent to SFr30.2m. Slight increases in sales and operating profits are expected in the full year. Buhrle indicated that it would clear its capital deficit this year. However, the directors have not yet decided whether to recommend a dividend for 1994. The last one paid was in respect of 1985. The group has not yet been able to carry out its DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) acquisition of the Leybold vacuum engineering company. The US Federal Trade Commission had not yet given its approval. The German Cartel Commission has already demanded some disposals from either Leybold or Balzers. Buhrle said it still expected to consolidate Leybold retroactively to the first of the year, and indicated that the German company had returned to profit this year.</p>

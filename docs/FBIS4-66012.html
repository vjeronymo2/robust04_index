			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ter Beek Wants Money From NATO for </F> Peacekeeping Duties"]    [Text] Brussels, 25 May -- The Netherlands wants financial  compensation from the other NATO member states for its  contribution to the peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. The  countries which are providing soldiers are currently shouldering  too much of the financial cost of these expensive operations.  The burden should be divided more fairly.    Netherlands Defense Minister Ter Beek made this demand  yesterday [24 May] in Brussels at the NATO defense ministers'  meeting. Ter Beek specifically referred to the use of  Netherlands aircraft to impose the no-fly ban over Bosnia. This  NATO operation organized under UN auspices, called "Deny  Flight," involves the United States, the United Kingdom, and  France, in addition to the Netherlands. These four countries are  paying the full cost of the operation, between 75 and 80 million  guilders a year for the Netherlands.    The participation of Netherlands soldiers in UN peacekeeping  missions is paid for by the Development Cooperation Ministry.  The Netherlands has previously agreed to pay 1.5 percent of the  cost of all UN operations.    But the cost of providing troops and material for NATO  operations is not divided among all the alliance's member  states. The presence of forces including a liaison battalion  and a transport battalion, and the deployment of the Air Force  (from the northern Italian town of Villafranca to enforce the  no-fly ban) and the Navy (from the Adriatic Sea) are costing the  Defense Ministry nearly 140 million guilders in net extra costs.  Ter Beek has already asked the cabinet for compensation and it  is possible that this will be provided for in the coming budget.    In Brussels, Ter Beek let it be known yesterday that  "financial solidarity" had to apply within NATO. "The  Netherlands can not continue writing out blank cheques for  years. The political signal has been given and now we just have  to wait to see how it works out," it has been said in  Netherlands circles.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Recession-hit textile areas to get Pounds 2m aid AREAS hit by recession in the textile industry are to receive more than Pounds 2m in aid from the European Commission, the government said yesterday, writes Tim Burt. The funds, of which the largest share will go to Yorkshire and Humberside, form part of the Retex initiative, which encourages small businesses and training schemes in regions where traditional textile production has declined. Under the scheme, the government has to commit Ecu5.6m (Pounds 4.4m) by the end of the year to projects selected by officials from Whitehall, Brussels and local authorities. Yorkshire and Humberside receives Pounds 865,560; followed by the north-west with Pounds 615,639; the east Midlands on Pounds 272,573; the north-east with Pounds 202,515; and the west Midlands with Pounds 102,990. Northern Ireland will receive Ecu13m from a different programme under the Retex initiative between now and 1997.</p>

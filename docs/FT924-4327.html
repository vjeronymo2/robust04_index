			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Putting troops into Somalia is the easy bit: Without cash and commitment to a lasting settlement, the experiment is doomed TROOPS from the US preparing to intervene in Somalia will encounter an unusual foe: fiercely individualistic Somali bandits and desert warriors hardened by the rigours of their nomadic lifestyle. President George Bush's decision to offer up to 20,000 US soldiers to the United Nations to revive a defeated international aid effort to save hundreds of thousands of Somalis dying from war-induced starvation will run into special difficulties. Somalia is no Vietnam or Iraq. There is no mass modern army in Somalia and the motivation of the Somali fighters is virtually non-existent. Instead US troops will have to confront undisciplined and poorly armed rag-tag gunmen - often drugged on the narcotic stimulant qat - who kill and maim their own people without remorse or purpose. Groups of teenagers thrive on the anarchy they have created. The greatest fear for the safety of US soldiers will be isolated ambushes and blasts of stray gunfire from speeding customised 'Mad Max' trucks. Furthermore the US force will have to confront a war-shattered country with poor dirt roads and no electricity, water system or social infrastructure where temperatures soar to more than 100 degrees of dry heat. Huge parts of the arid heartland are inaccessible and sparsely populated, yet it is exactly in these southern areas - from Kismayo to Bardere and across to Baidoa - where people are dying most. Few believe the Somali nation will rise up against external intervention. The ruthless warlords who control the divided country have at best a few thousand dissolute gunmen under their command and do not have popular support. But the chances of opposition by Somalis to the US intervention could be lessened if the Americans work closely with the UN and with Somali politicians and businessmen and use the radio to explain their purpose to the Somali people. Many Somalis will be enthusiastic about an intervention with the limited goals of feeding the starving, ridding the country of the ruthless and bloody rule of the warlords and leaving behind a legacy of law and order and a new political arrangement. But months of aggressive propaganda by the warlords against 'western imperialism' have created suspicions among Somalia's illiterate nomads that the west is trying to colonise the country, perhaps to steal fictional oil reserves. These fears will be exploited by the warlords but they can be allayed if the US and UN puts in place a credible Somali consultative assembly or forum of the nation's more respected citizens, many of whom are in exile. However, there is concern among those involved with Somalia that Washington's hasty plans are at best half-baked and at worse could backfire with terrible consequences. Statements by the White House that the 20,000 troops promised for the mission could be in and out of Somalia by January 20 next year, the date of the Bush-Clinton handover, have alarmed aid workers and UN officials in Somalia. Observers concede that with the success of the US aid operation in northern Iraq, the American force could move vast quantities of food and medicine and temporarily end starvation within weeks. But they point out that in Iraq President Saddam Hussein was fearful of antagonising the US into further military involvement and in effect decided to allow the US operation to proceed. He ordered his disciplined troops not to oppose the operation. In Somalia there is no similar fear of provoking the US and no chain of command and control between the warlords and the gunmen. As soon as the US troops pulled out of Somalia, the country could slide back into anarchy, and mass starvation would quickly return. Experienced aid workers say the only possible long-term solution is to launch a massive humanitarian operation in tandem with efforts to broker a political settlement capable of bequeathing the country a climate of peace and law and order. They point out that it is the civil war and insecurity which has caused the deaths from starvation and frustrated relief efforts, and not a natural disaster such as drought. Without resolving the conflict it will be impossible to eliminate starvation. Leaving behind a stable environment will require a working consultative assembly which cannot be blackmailed by the warlords. A well-paid and trained Somali police force will have to be established quickly and put under the authority of an interim administration. Once the police are in place and the cycle of criminality broken, foreign troops can retreat to a minimum role and the UN can sponsor a national conference in a climate of peace to prepare the way for elections. But any Somali administration put in power by the UN will have to be heavily funded to start the long process of reconstruction ensuring that resources are distributed equitably to all Somali clans. As the US and UN prepare to undertake a massive experiment in Somalia, which may set precedents for intervention in other countries such as Yugoslavia and Cambodia, the real question which remains unanswered is whether they are prepared to make the necessary long-term financial commitment needed to make it work. Without that commitment the experiment is doomed to failure.</p>

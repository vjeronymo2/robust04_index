			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LELAND'S FATAL ETHIOPIA CRASH LAID TO WEATHER, PILOT ERROR  </P> <P> Bad weather and improper flight preparation contributed to the plane crash that  killed Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) and 15 others last year in Ethiopia, a  report issued Friday said.  </P> <P> The Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority said the pilots erred by "pushing too  far and flying into an area of bad weather at a very low altitude."  </P> <P> Leland, who was chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was flying  from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa to Fugnido, a refugee camp on the  Sudanese border, to inspect relief efforts. Three congressional staffers also  died in the crash.  </P> <P> The plane ran into a mountainside more than an hour after takeoff on Aug. 7,  1989. A tight flight schedule and the importance of the mission may have  pressured the crew to fly in bad weather, the report said.  </P> <P> The plane, a 1980 Twin Otter, had no defects and crew members reported no  problems during the flight, the report said.  </P> <P> The Ethiopian agency's report was released by the National Transportation  Safety Board.  </P></p>

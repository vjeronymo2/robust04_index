			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 29 May (AFP) -- The social democratic  Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) of presidential candidate  Jose Francisco Pena Gomez today denounced "an attempt to stage  an electoral coup" that would jeopardize "the nation's  democratic order."    In a communique issued in Santo Domingo, the PRD and the  other seven small parties that supported Pena Gomez stated that  "we are facing an electoral coup attempt perpetrated by the  current government (of conservative President Joaquin Balaguer)  through the distortion of the electoral process. The Dominican  Republic held presidential, parliamentary, and municipal  elections on 16 May in the presence of international observers.    "Government officials, in an attempt to keep themselves in  power, realizing that it is impossible for them to win the  elections honestly, decided to corrupt the electoral process,  because they know that it is difficult for them to achieve their  goal through a direct coup d'etat or through military force, the  communique stated.    After insisting that Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist  Party (PRSC) has resorted to "fraudulent attempts in the past,"  the PRD maintained that "on this occasion, the crisis acquired  an unprecedented characteristic because the country's democratic  order is at stake."    The PRD and seven other parties said "the key is to preserve  the representative system," and reaffirmed that [words  indistinct] the PRD leaders announced last Friday, in the voice  of Pena Gomez himself. Analysts think this could reportedly  unleash an institutional crisis that would prevent Balaguer,  should he be proclaimed winner, from ruling beginning on 16  August, the date scheduled for the change in government.    Balaguer, an octogenarian who is virtually blind and has a 1  percent (30,000 vote) lead in the vote count, plans to start his  seventh term in the presidency in the next four days.    No winner in the presidential elections has yet been  proclaimed because of the fraud charges, and the Central  Electoral Board announced that it will start an investigation  into alleged distortions in the voters list. Meanwhile, Pena  Gomez announced he will start an international offensive to  prove that his fraud charges are true.</p>

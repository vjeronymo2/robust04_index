			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Doubt over prospects for peace in Mexico The Mexican government and Zapatista rebels have entered their second week of talks to end the two-month peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, amid conflicting reports on how close they are to a provisional agreement. Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the mediator, said a peace declaration was 'already drawn up and agreed in fundamental terms'. He said a draft accord could be ready by tomorrow, after which rebels would return to their villages and consult their supporters. However, Sub-commandant Marcos, the rebel spokesman, said there was still no agreement on crucial issues, such as self-rule for indigenous peoples, national electoral reforms and changes to the constitution that would permit permanent re-distribution of land. Part of the difference between him and the bishop may be due to the weight given to any preliminary accord. The rebels have insisted that accords are only 'mountains of paper' and that there can no peace until government promises are fulfilled.</p>

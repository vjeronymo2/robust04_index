			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUEBEC INDIANS AGREE TO LIFT BRIDGE BLOCKADE  </P> <P> Armed Mohawk Indians embroiled in a land dispute with authorities agreed  Saturday to lift a bridge blockade near Montreal after a provincial official  promised to reduce the police contingent in this Quebec town.  </P> <P> The agreement was announced after Quebec Native Affairs Minister John Ciaccia  met for more than six hours with Indian representatives in an effort to end the  dispute, which has left one police officer dead.  </P> <P> The meeting came as Indians guarded barricades at a reservation near Oka, 20  miles west of Montreal, and blockaded the Mercier Bridge linking Montreal with  its populous suburbs on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River.  </P> <P> Ciaccia said the bridge blockade could be lifted as early as today. He refused  to elaborate on the terms of the agreement.  </P> <P> But Mohawk representative Ellen Gabriel said the Indians had agreed to reopen  the bridge in return for a "significant reduction" of the police presence in  Oka.  </P> <P> Highways leading to the bridge were blockaded Wednesday by Mohawks of the  Kahnawake reserve following an armed clash between provincial police and  Mohawks guarding barricades on the reservation near Oka.  </P> <P> The clash was sparked by the resort town's plans to extend a golf course onto  Mohawk ancestral territory.  </P> <P> A poll published Saturday showed that 53% of Montreal residents believe the  Mohawks are right to defend their ancestral land. An overwhelming majority --  87% -- said the police should not attempt another confrontation.  </P> <P> Ciaccia said the talks Saturday resulted in the "beginnings of proposals" to  end the Oka confrontation.  </P> <P> "You should all be very happy that we are announcing a solution for one very  serious problem and the beginnings of a solution for the entire problem," he  told reporters.  </P> <P> Ciaccia refused to elaborate on the proposals, saying he must first consult  with the provincial government. He said he would return to Oka today to  continue the talks.  </P> <P> The police officer was killed in Wednesday's shoot-out with Mohawks guarding  barricades. It is unclear if the officer was shot by Mohawks or fellow police.  </P></p>

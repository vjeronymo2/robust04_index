			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: A celebration for the great innovator - 25 years of Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear It is just over 25 years since Yves Saint Laurent opened his first ready-to-wear boutique in London. Today, with hindsight, it seems such an obvious thing to have done. But then it looked different. St Laurent was the star couturier of the day, a day in which haute couture was all. No other had deigned to submit his talents to the challenging disciplines of ready-to-wear. A few had boutique collections, attached to the main house, but they were heavily influenced by haute couture. Yves Saint Laurent was the first to see that ready-to-wear required a different approach, that it deserved a line of its own and that the right place to sell would be a tiny shop in the rue de Tournon, a then unfashionable venue on the left bank (hence the Rive Gauche label). The fashion world looked in amazement as those accustomed to shopping in the chic boulevards of the right bank crossed the river and queued to buy a genuine Saint Laurent label for about FFr200, a fraction of the haute couture price. But, much more importantly, Saint Laurent had discovered that he could reach a completely new market - those who had neither the money nor the inclination to shop in the grand couture houses. As Marguerite Duras put it, in a foreword to a book encapsulating the work of Saint Laurent: 'With pret-a-porter, elitism in high fashion is no longer an issue. Yves Saint Laurent women are made in the harem, the chateau, on the edges of cities . . . they are in the streets, the Metro, Prisunic, the Bourse.' The timing was perfect. Women's lives were changing. As they began to take on jobs, to lead more active as well as busier lives, as servants disappeared from the houses of all but the truly wealthy, they needed clothing for this new way of living. Saint Laurent gave it to them. He was genuinely radical, intuitively deciding that women would need clothes that gave them authority without denigrating their sexuality. He invented the trouser suit for women, proving himself a past master at making women who wore them look more and not less feminine, playing on the ambiguity. Saint Laurent defined the difference between ready-to-wear and haute couture thus: 'Rive Gauche is for the necessities, for the needs of daily life. In haute couture you can allow yourself to dream.' His perception, that the necessities, the needs of daily life, were not yet adequately or stylishly enough catered for, proved correct. It turned out to be the pot of gold and almost every other designer of note followed suit - fast. Today the turnover of the ready-to-wear collections is FFr280m (Pounds 33.29m) at wholesale prices, there are nearly 100 ready-to-wear boutiques, some of which Saint Laurent owns outright, while others are franchised. In 1969 Clare Rendlesham, who had been fashion editor of Vogue and Harpers &amp; Queen, brought Yves Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear to London. Jacqumine Bromage, her daughter, who runs it now, was only nine years old at the time but she remembers clearly that her mother, who had never owned a business before, was 'besotted with Yves Saint Laurent's clothes. 'She was convinced that British women would love them. I can still see her in a long, denim skirt and tight lace-up boots. She wore almost nothing but Yves Saint Laurent and when she used to weed out her wardrobe some of them would come down to me. 'I used to go to school wearing them and I remember everybody laughing at me as I was one of the first to wear Saint Laurent's baggy boots when everybody else was still wearing tight ones.' When that first boutique opened, the famously frail couturier appeared in person - as did his perennial muse Loulou de la Falaise. Princess Margaret, pop stars, all the fashion press and movers and shakers of the day also turned up. It was a poignant moment in the creative life of Saint Laurent. These were times when hemlines were deemed of universal interest. In 1969 when, for starters, he dropped the hemline 12in and, later, all the way to the ankle, he had as definite an affect on the fashion business as Pompidou's devaluation had on the money markets. The fashion press went wild but there were doubts that the look would catch on. Yves Saint Laurent hedged his bets. He was photographed outside the shop with one model in a classic 1960s mini on one side and another with the longer look on the other. The press, it is fascinating to note, were almost universally shocked by the prices. 'Girls buying his ready-to-wear in London will have to be loaded,' wailed the Daily Express. 'Dream clothes, nightmare prices,' moaned the Daily Mail. Other fashion editors pointed out helpfully that at least the fare to Paris could now be saved. 'Rich women used to go to Paris to buy their clothes: now they need not bother - the clothes are here.' 'One of the big problems at the time,' says David Roberts, who joined Clare Rendlesham early on and has been there ever since, 'was persuading people to spend Pounds 30 on a skirt. Clare did a lot of educating. She persuaded her customers that it was more intelligent to buy better and buy less. She herself would buy only about two outfits a season and wear them to death.' Looking back, the clothes seem a steal. A trouser suit cost about Pounds 50, a day suit Pounds 30 but scarves could be bought for around Pounds 10 and a silk shirt for Pounds 15. Anyone who bought a piece then, and still owns it, would almost certainly still be able to wear it. All those classics - the sleek trouser suits, the 'smokings', the shiny trench-coat raincoats, the Scarlet O'Hara corsetry, the pea coats, the safari jackets, would look perfectly, beautifully, at home in the contemporary wardrobe. His clothes more than anyone's capture the spirit of our age. The great innovator, the designer whose clothes were genuinely radical (women, it is worth remembering, were banned from serious restaurants for wearing his trouser suits so provocative were they deemed to be), these days is sickened by innovation for innovation's sake. In his mature years (he is now 58) he seeks a refinement, an updating, a perfection of the style and the craft he has spent his life exploring. Many of his most classic designs, for instance, have been reworked for this season. For winter evenings he has updated 'le smoking' - one rather mannish version, single-breasted, one-buttoned and a slightly softened one with satin lapels and cuffs and satin flap pockets. These days his prices are not so different from many a less distinguished label - a jacket runs at about Pounds 795, trousers at about Pounds 240. It would be hard to better Alexander Lieberman of Conde Nast's summing up of the appeal of Yves Saint Laurent: 'He understood that women needed certain clothing if they were to function in a modern world. He understands, as few other couturiers do, the sex-appeal of women. Other couturiers clothe women to hide their sexuality. He liberates it. Whereas the troubadours of old wrote poems for women, he makes clothes.' Yves Saint Laurent for women is at 137 New Bond Street, London W1 and 33 Sloane Street, London SW1. Yves Saint Laurent for men at 135 New Bond Street, London W1 and 33 Sloane Street, London SW1.</p>

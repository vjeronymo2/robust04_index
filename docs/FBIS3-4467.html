			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" column: "Development Bank to </F> Issue 65 Billion Yuan Financial Bonds"]    [Text] Reportedly, the State Development Bank will issue  65 billion yuan of monetary bonds [jin rong zhai quan 6855 5816  0280 0457].    The bonds will mainly be purchased by banking institutions  rather than individuals and non-banking institutions. The bonds  will include three-year and five-year bonds. The interest rates  will be slightly lower than those of the state treasury bonds of  the same terms. Funds raised from the issuance of the bonds  will all be used to finance key construction projects specified  by state policy.    Reportedly, the State Development Bank now only has  headquarters and will not set up branches. Its credit business  will be handled by the People's Construction Bank of China. Its  funds mainly come from three sources: First, the capital and  key construction funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance.  Second, state-guaranteed bonds issued by the State Development  Bank to the general public, and monetary bonds issued to banking  institutions. Third, part of the deposits taken by the People's  Construction Bank of China (which will be turned into a  state-owned commercial bank).</p>

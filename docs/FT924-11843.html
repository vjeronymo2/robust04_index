			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Japan's emergency package helps the market to recover THE TOKYO stock market went on a roller-coaster ride in the third quarter, as the Japanese government's emergency economic package calmed fears of a meltdown in the financial industry and the market. In mid-August, the Nikkei index of the leading 225 shares plunged to a six-year low of 14,309.41 (down 64 per cent from its peak), but it finally rose to finish the quarter at 17,399.09. Strong buying followed the announcement of the government's support measures for the banking system and the faltering economy. Worries about a deepening recession and a slower-than-expected recovery of corporate profits had depressed share prices in July and early August, and the government's hands-off policy towards the stock market's fall added to the pessimism. However, strong buying followed the announcement of the fiscal package - which included Y10,700bn (Pounds 53.6bn) in public-works spending - and prompted a return to the Tokyo market. The size of the package reflected deep concern among the authorities and their determination to prevent further loss of confidence. Plans to set up a Japanese version of Resolution Trust Corporation (the US federal agency responsible for disposing of assets of failed savings and loan groups), to buy up land held as collateral from the ailing banks, soothed concern over the health of the financial system. The government also included measures to support the stock market, by adding to demand through the increase of public investment allotted to the market, and by limiting supply by warning financial institutions not to sell shares. New offers of former government-owned companies, such as Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone and JR East, the railway concern, were also suspended. Investors expected some Y1,800bn released in public money, including postal savings and public welfare funds, by the end of September, to support the market. A further Y1,100bn is also expected to be invested into the equity market when the supplementary budget has been passed by parliament next month. However, with an increasing number of companies reducing their earnings forecasts, the market may have looked overvalued at the end of the quarter. The yen's strength, a result of worries about the US economic recovery, could also affect the profitability of leading exporting companies in the electronics and automobile industries. For the final quarter of the year, most market participants forecast a price adjustment to suit economic fundamentals, such as corporate earnings and asset values, before share prices can look up again. Meanwhile, worries over Sino-US trade relations and the failure to obtain Chinese approval for airport financing caused the Hong Kong market to fall sharply during the third quarter. The Hang Seng index closed 9.8 per cent off from the end of June, at 5,505.44, and market participants expect the market to remain volatile in response to the spate of political deadlines and meetings to define China's (and consequently the colony's) relationship with countries such as the UK and US. Volatility on the currency markets have hit the Australian stock market, where the All Ordinaries index closed down 9.7 per cent on the quarter at 1,485.10. The weakening of the Australian dollar dented the resources sector, while the industrial sector provided support, as corporate earnings remained close to expectations. In Thailand, the victory of the pro-democracy parties in the mid-September election has given a positive signal to the economy, which is confirming its reputation for resilience in the face of political uncertainty. The SET index rose 12.4 per cent on the quarter, to close at 847.</p>

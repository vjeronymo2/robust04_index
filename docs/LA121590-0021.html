			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOST 'GENERATIONS'  </P> <P> Regarding the articles about the plight of blacks in the entertainment  industry: I am a black woman who was happily employed as a writer on  "Generations" until its recent cancellation. I had the opportunity to work on a  show that not only portrayed blacks in a positive manner, interacting with  whites and dealing with problems that are universal in them, but also provided  jobs, both behind and in front of the camera, for blacks.  </P> <P> You would think organizations such as the NAACP would applaud and support an  endeavor such as ours. You would be wrong.  </P> <P> An appeal was made to the NAACP to help save the show. There was a press  announcement regarding a national letter-writing campaign spearheaded by that  organization. We waited for the letters to inundate NBC executives. We're still  waiting.  </P> <P> "Generations" could have used the support. That might have made the difference.  Instead, we hear of more panels, more symposiums, bemoaning the plight of  blacks in the industry. My question is: Were they so shortsighted and so busy  being angry that they didn't notice that a show already existed that addressed  many of their concerns?  </P> <P> Now, because we work at the mercy of something called the Nielsens,  "Generations" has been canceled. And I seriously doubt whether anything this  progressive will ever be seen again because the powers-that-be can shrug their  shoulders and say, "America isn't interested in seeing black people portrayed  simply as human beings. America doesn't want to see a fully integrated show. We  tried it. It didn't work."  </P> <P> As a black woman, I am appalled.  </P> <P> MICHELE VAL JEAN, Studio City  </P></p>

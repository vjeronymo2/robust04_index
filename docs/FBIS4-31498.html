			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of "exclusive" interview with Slovak Prime </F> Minister Jozef Moravcik by unidentified correspondent following  talks between Moravcik and Imre Szekeres, executive deputy  chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, in Bratislava on 8  June -- recorded; Moravcik speaks in Slovak with superimposed  Hungarian translation]    [Text] [Correspondent] How do you see future cooperation  with the Hungarian Government, or rather with the future  Hungarian Government?    [Moravcik] Well, I have some very good ideas, just as the  other side has, too. As we have already declared on previous  occasions, we should attain something that we call historic  reconciliation. We, these two nations, at one time lived in one  state and we had, we have, our own experiences of this  coexistence, good and less good alike. We should now be able to  find within ourselves sufficient courage and strength to forget  everything that we did not consider really good, and be able to  look to shaping our future relations, because on the basis of  the orientation of policies, and of foreign policy, this future  in fact should, I think, be a common future in both countries.  All this in a wider community, where in fact the intensity of  mutual relations is far greater than the intensity of the  relations of two sovereign states.    This means coexistence within the European Union. We have to  concentrate on this, and we have to settle our relations in  accordance with the interests of both states. [end recording]</p>

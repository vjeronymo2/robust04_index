			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Disposal benefits Sears STORES group Sears advanced 5 to 69p in heavy trading after announcing it was disposing of its loss-making menswear division. Rumours of the sale, the subject of a management buyout, had been doing the rounds in the market and trade press in recent weeks, and pre-empted an announcement with Sears' results next week. The disposal of the menswear division, which lost Pounds 9m last year and includes the Fosters brand, was largely welcomed by the market. However, analysts also pointed to improved sentiment towards the sector as a whole because of the expected cut in interest rates, and part of the Sears rise was due to that. Turnover was a hefty 13m shares. Bryant in demand Bryant Group, the West Midlands based housebuilder, provided a welcome relief from the recent series of dividend cuts, falling profits and hefty provisions now commonplace in the contracting area of the market. A near-doubling of profits, from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 20.3m, and a same again dividend triggered a sharp rise in the shares, which ran up to 93p before easing back to settle a net 8 ahead at 89p. Turnover in the stock was a good 1.8m shares. Building specialists said the results were at the top end of the market range. Mr Mark Hake, building analyst at Nikko Securities, said that while the market accepted that Bryant was undoubtedly one of the best-run contracting groups in the sector, 'much of the good news is already in the price'. Racal/Chubb 'Grey market' activity commenced in 'Racal Special-Ex' and 'Chubb When Issued', the two stocks that will emerge from the split of Chubb from Racal Electronics when it becomes effective on October 5, subject to shareholder approval. After the demerger Racal shares will be consolidated on a five-for-one basis. For every five Racal shares held on October 2, shareholders will recieve one consolidated Racal share and one Chubb share. Racal Special-Ex traded at 141p early in the session but later slipped to close at 134p, with 878,000 shares changing hands. Chubb When Issued finished around 193p after strong turnover of 2.1m, including a single purchase of 1m shares at 195p. Racal 'old' attracted keen support all day, ending a busy session 2 1/4 higher at 65 3/4 p after 9.6m traded. Upgrades in Thorn EMI continued, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew the latest to move its figures. UBS was said to be recommending a switch out of Rank Organisation and into Thorn. Kleinwort Benson was also said to have raised its expectations for Thorn, whose shares jumped 27 to 747p. In addition, there was speculation that the group's talks with Williams Holdings concerning the sale of Thorn's lighting business had made progress. Rank, which benefited from interest rate cut hopes, rose 7 to 546p. Merchant banks ran up strongly, reflecting the remarkable upsurge in institutional activity in the markets last week, but did not hold their best levels. Among the fund management groups, Templeton Galbraith put on 10 to 339p, M &amp; G 23 to 537p and Mercury Asset Management 11 to 304p. Refuge Assurance's preliminary results and new business figures were given a warm reception in the market, with the shares closing 20 higher at 670p. Insurance brokers drew further strength from the latest rally by the dollar. Lloyd Thompson, reporting this morning, moved ahead 14 to 207p and Lowndes Lambert put on 16 to 272p. Lasmo surged ahead again, closing 12 1/2 up at 160p on heavy turnover of 5.4m. US and domestic institutions remained focused on the benefits to Lasmo of the continued steep decline in sterling against the dollar. BP, responding to vague hints that the group may yet attract the attentions of a predator, gained 4 1/2 at 219p on 19m traded. British Gas was barely changed at 235p with 16m shares changing hands. Utilities, widely viewed by the market as defensive stocks and immune to currency shifts, were roughly handled. Strong two-way business was seen in British Steel, with UK investors taking profits after last week's good performance but demand from US buyers once again a feature. Turnover expanded to 20m as the shares added 3 1/4 at 67p. On its first day as a non FT-SE constituent, British Aerospace bounced 7 to 196p on speculation that a deal with Taiwan Aerospace concerning BAe's regional aircraft division would be announced shortly. Talk, however, that the company will reveal big provisions when it reports interim figures tomorrow continued to circulate. Investors were still taking a poor view of Vickers ahead of Thursday's figures and the shares surrendered a further 3 to 85p. Vague bid talk was heard in Avon Rubber, finally 32 stronger at 355p. Lucas Industries moved forward 7 to 101p in brisk trade of 9.8m shares. Among transports, P &amp; O was a good market and volume reached 3.4m with the shares closing at 361p ex-dividend. News that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its Suprane drug helped lift BOC, the shares climbing 14 to 684p. Hickson International was knocked in late trading following a fire at a plant in Yorkshire. The shares dropped 11 to 183p. There were further good gains across the board in the contracting and building materials areas. Tarmac, scheduled to report interims today, finished unchanged at 70p ahead of an expected lapse into losses of up to Pounds 20m, plus a deep cut in the dividend. Barratt Developments, where many analysts are looking for a return to profitability when it publishes preliminary numbers tomorrow, moved up 6 to 50p. A large line of stock, said to be held by Swiss Bank Corporation, unsettled Cadbury Schweppes shares, which retreated 15 to 464p xd. Tesco lost ground following adverse press comment ahead of its results, due today. Analysts expect to downgrade the supermarket group following tough trading conditions. The shares later recovered to close steady at 225p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (101).

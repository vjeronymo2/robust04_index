			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The flow of election results resumed early this  morning after a 32-hour delay caused by sabotage to the computer  system. The latest results show that with more than 15 million  votes counted, the African National Congress is just 1.7 percent  away from wining a two-thirds majority. The ANC has 64.9  percent, while the National Party [NP] is perilously close to  the 20 percent cutoff mark required to capture a deputy  president position with 20.5 percent. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] is still third with 8.1 percent. The IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission] said of the 15,054,768 received from  throughout the country, 14,893,634 have been accepted. [passage  omitted]    This is how the picture looks for the first two parties  according the provisional polling percentages for each  provincial legislature: In the Orange Free State (OFS) the ANC  has 76.9 percent of the votes, and the NP 12.3 percent; in North  West the ANC has 83.8 percent and the NP 8.6 percent; in  KwaZulu/ Natal the IFP has 57.1 percent of the votes against the  ANC's 28.6 percent; in the Eastern Transvaal the ANC has 81.8  and the NP 8.4 percent; in the Northern Transvaal 91.6 percent  for the ANC and the NP 3.3 percent; in the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region the ANC has 57.9 percent  against the NP's 24 percent; in the Eastern Cape the ANC has  81.2 percent, and the NP 12.2 percent; in the Western Cape NP  has 53.3 percent, and the ANC 33.1 percent; and in the Northern  Cape the ANC has 49.9 percent, and the NP 40.4 percent.    The provisional results were received this morning after it  was discovered on Tuesday morning that someone had interfered  with the IEC's computer systems. The results are now being fed  in and analyzed at a slower rate. A team of computer experts is  investigating the problem. It is not yet known who the culprit  was.</p>

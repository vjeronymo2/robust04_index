			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovsky by Hakan Aksay in </F> Moscow; date not given -- recorded; Zhirinovsky speaks in  Turkish]    [Text] During his interview with Zhirinovsky, our colleague  Hakan Aksay immediately came to the point and asked the Russian  politician what he thinks about Turkey. But Zhirinovsky had no  intention of coming to the point, and launched into a long  discourse on territorial issues. Territorial problems have  become a virtual fixation for the Russian politician. Next, our  colleague asked what he thinks about being compared to Hitler.  His reply was a bit odd:    [Begin recording] [Zhirinovsky] One of your writers said: We  are neither rightists nor leftists, we are only footballists.  Similarly, we too are neither rightists nor leftists, but only  centrists. We are to the right of center. It could be that we  are slightly to the right of center by some 20 percent, just  like you. You have the True Path Party once lead by Suleyman  Demirel. On his Ankara party headquarters, it was once written:  The future rests with the father.    It wanted to say that Demirel would become president in the  future. And, in fact he became president.    [Aksay] And are you going to become the father of Russia?    [Zhirinovsky] Yes, Russia's father. Is Demirel a fascist?  Never. I will be just like him in Russia.    [Aksay] You mean to say that you could become Russia's  Demirel, that is, Russia's father?    [Zhirinovsky] Yes, yes, yes. [end recording]    When Turkey is mentioned, Zhirinovsky constantly speaks  about  Pan-Turanism. He often mentions the name of Alparslan Turkes  and goes into a long exposition of Pan-Turkism. He then said:    [Begin recording] [Zhirinovsky] Very good conditions exist  for you to create a Turan in this region, Caucasia -- your next  door neighbor Azerbaijan speaks Turkish; they are of your own  people -- and Turkmenistan. There are Turkish speaking peoples  over a compact region. Culture and religion are all identical.  This is very good for you. Had I been a Turk, I would have  done this [create a Pan-Turkic state]. Had I been in the place  of Alparslan Turkes, I would have established the same party and  now I would have worked to bring all the former Soviet Central  Asian republics closer to Turkey, to tie them to it, and one day  to establish one single state. I would have done this.    [Aksay] Is this why Turkey is a threat? Is it a threat  because it might unite the other Turks?    [Zhirinovsky] Yes, yes, yes, yes....    [Aksay, interrupting] But, as you know, the Pan-Turanists  and  Pan-Turkists are not in power in Turkey.    [Zhirinovsky] Yes, not now, but they could be in the future.  It is better for Russia that there should be a common border  between Russia and Turkey, without the Caucasus, Armenia,  Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Only Turkey and Russia. That will be  sufficient. [end recording]    Yet another gaffe from Zhirinovsky. In reply to Aksay's  question, he gave a reply that is cause for thought.    [Begin recording] [Aksay] You are saying Turkey does not  really have a culture of its own, and that the Turks still pass  off the Byzantine culture in Istanbul as their own. Does your  lack of knowledge of Turkey's culture and your statement that  the world will lose nothing if the Turkish culture vanishes not  reflect a negative attitude toward Turkey?    [Zhirinovsky] The Turkish culture could grow like a flower  in  the Tashkent region, because that is exactly the place for you.  Below that are the Persian-speaking Afghanistan and Tajikistan,  and to the north is Russia. But the Tashkent-Ashgabat region is  your motherland. You have the Motherland Party, and your  motherland lies between Tashkent and Ashgabat. One day in the  past, your Ottoman Turkish armies marched into the Byzantine  lands from this very region between Tashkent and Ashgabat. [end  recording]</p>

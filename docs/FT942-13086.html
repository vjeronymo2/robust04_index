			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: Australia telecoms cable project Telecom Australia, the state-owned telecommunications group, and Optus, its private sector rival, are joining forces to build an optical fibre telecommunications cable between Western Australia and Indonesia. This, in turn, will provide Australia with access to the proposed Asia-Pacific Cable Network. The aim is for this link eventually to replace the existing Australia/Indonesia/Singapore analogue coaxial cable, which was commissioned about eight years ago. The new link will have much greater capacity and will use more recent optical amplifier and synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) technologies. The project is a three-way co-operation by Telecon, Optus and PT Indosat, the Indonesian carrier. However, only the two Australian companies will fund the ADollars 140m (Pounds 68m) cable network, with Telecom providing 69 per cent and Optus the remaining 31 per cent. The new cable is expected to come into service by the end of 1996. Tenders for the supply of the 2,100-km cable are likely to be sought in July.</p>

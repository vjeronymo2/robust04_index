Wismoyo Arismunandar said here Tuesday that  Bali and East Timor because of their "uniqueness" need a special  attention regarding the aspect of security.    "Bali, as a major tourist attraction is an international  gate  to Indonesia, while East Timor as the country's youngest  province still has a lot to catch up with the progress of other  provinces," he said in an address to mark the transfer of post  of the chief of Udayana Military Command.    The post of the commander of the Udayana Military Command  (supervising Bali, East Timor, and Lesser Sunda Islands) was  handed over from Maj. Gen Theo Syafei to Maj. Gen R. Adang  Rukhiatna Puradireja.    Wismoyo further said that the Udayana Military Command has a  heavy task because aside from supervsing Bali and East Timor and  all their uniqueness, it must also look after Lesser Sunda  Islands which are prone to natural disasters.    "This obviously calls for a high spirit of dedication among  the Udayana Military Command members," he said adding that the  command's main task is maintaining security and stability so  that development activities can take place smoothly.    About development programs, Wismoyo, however, also said that  they must be conducted in such a way that not only economic  growth is achieved, but also even distribution of welfare.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Clinton to pass healthcare ration plan THE Clinton administration is expected to announce today its approval of Oregon's plan to ration health care for the poor while simultaneously making basic medical treatment more widely available. Last year President George Bush had rejected the Oregon plan on the grounds that it infringed federal disability regulations. It has subsequently been revised in order to meet these objections. The nub of the Oregon plan advanced by Governor Barbara Roberts is to subject 688 medical procedures to cost benefit and quality of life analyses. The state Medicaid programme, which covers the less well-off and which is partly federally funded, would continue to cover the top 568 medical services, but would not pay for the remaining 120. Excluded would be certain expensive operations, such as some liver transplants and care for the terminally ill, and a variety of other services, including obesity and fertility counselling. According to state officials, Medicaid could be made available to 360,000 recipients, compared with 240,000 at present. However, even administration approval is unlikely to prevent lawsuits against the plan, which may block its implementation . On Wednesday, several interest groups, representing sufferers from cerebral palsy, spina bifida and Aids, urged the president to block the plan. The Oregon scheme is attractive to the administration, itself grappling with healthcare reform, not least because President Clinton has often spoken of the need for the state to act as practical and experimental laboratories for new policies. In meetings with governors last month, he specifically urged them to be innovative in administering their Medicaid programmes, for which costs have soared.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Barclays may reduce capital - Dollars 900m of preference shares could be repaid as tier 1 ratio increases Barclays is thought to be considering reducing excess capital later this year by buying back up to Dollars 900m (Pounds 580m) of preference shares. The bank is concerned that it may otherwise build up too high a ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. Barclays yesterday disclosed a rise in its tier 1 ratio of core capital  - including equity, retained earnings and preference shares - to risk-weighted assets from 6 per cent at the year-end to 7 per cent at June 30. The bank is thought to be considering ways of reducing its tier 1 ratio if it continues to climb at this rate. Although banks in the US have built up ratios of more than 7 per cent, a higher ratio could prompt concern at excess capital. One barrier is that Barclays would have to gain the Bank of England's approval for such a move because its tier 1 ratio is a key measure of financial strength. The Bank might approve such a move if it believed Barclays had recovered fully. The repayment of preference shares might be unnecessary if there was a strong increase in loan demand in the second half of the year. An alternative to buying back the shares would be to increase the full-year dividend by a large amount. Barclays is also thought to be considering repaying Dollars 1.3bn in dated loan capital which has a coupon of between 9.75 and 11.625 per cent. Although this would reduced the overall capital ratio, it would not affect the tier 1 ratio. This is thought to be a more immediate prospect than the buying back of preference shares because it would not involve regulatory approval in the same way. The main advantage would be to reduce a drag on earnings from the high coupon. Barclays yesterday disclosed that it had maintained a net interest margin at 3 per cent, while domestic net interest margin rose from 3.9 per cent to 4 per cent. Some 0.2 per cent of the margin was because of interest rate hedging. The bank's total capital rose to Pounds 10.8bn at June 30 against Pounds 10.6bn a year earlier, while total assets fell from Pounds 169.3bn to Pounds 161bn, and weighted risk assets fell from Pounds 107.5bn to Pounds 94.7bn.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 regains 3,300 in moderate trade - Market report A stronger performance from bond markets across Europe, including British government securities, sent UK equities ahead by nearly 28 points yesterday to close comfortably above the Footsie 3,300 mark. London finished near the best of the day, helped also by a good start to the new Wall Street session. Trading volume remained moderate but gathered pace as gains were extended. The renewed vigour in European bond and stock markets followed the pay settlement in the German engineering industry which encouraged hopes that the Bundesbank will be able to make a further reduction in interest rates soon. The optimists hope for good news either today, when the Bundesbank will disclose the shape of its repo tender, or tomorrow, when the result of the tender is announced. Share prices opened higher but were slow to extend their early gains as some continental European markets slipped back from early peaks. But sentiment turned stronger as the session progressed and the Footsie showed a gain of more than 32 points before closing at 3,305.9 for a gain on the day of 27.9 points. However, London lagged behind the recovery in the German stock market. Several equity strategists told clients that the stock market was staging a recovery, Kleinwort Benson Securities stressing that the financial sectors had been oversold. Natwest Securities pointed to improving dividend prospects. This week brings trading results from a range of leading UK companies, including BAT Industries and RTZ, which will be scanned for the latest indications of the pace of recovery in the domestic economy. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index added 10.4 at 3,937.7. The Mid 250 has outperformed the FT-SE 100 Index by 7 per cent since the turn of the year, and NatWest Securities predicts a further outperformance this year. Seaq volume, said to have been supported in the second half of the session by a trading programme from a UK investment bank, totalled 576.3m shares, compared with 581m on Friday, when retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.44bn. Retail volumes, the soundest test of market activity, have remained at relatively modest levels during the sell-off of the past fortnight but have now begun to show signs of improvement. There was support for the financial stocks which have been so badly hit in the shakeout of the past fortnight. Fears that some of these active players in global securities markets might have suffered severe losses seemed to abate and investors focused on the dividend improvements announced recently by some of the sector leaders. The powerful rally in bond markets, which fuelled a strong rise in UK gilts yesterday, soothed some of the worries over losses in these sectors. The UK equity market, having suffered no more than moderate selling pressure during the global shakeout, now seems ready to benefit from a recovery. 'Investors can now find good value,' commented the strategy team at Nikko Europe. Credit Lyonnais Laing, keeping its year-end Footsie target at 3,750, was another to maintain that the rise in bond yields does not signal any 'reversal' in the economic factors which have been driving equities higher for the past 18 months. Lyonnais Laing believes that hopes for economic recovery will not be disappointed by the current corporate results season.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Arts: Simply horribly funny - Cinema RAINING STONES (15) Ken Loach THE YOUNG AMERICANS (18) Danny Cannon HARD BOILED (18) John Woo Ken Loach's Raining Stones is a comedy about misery: something the English do better than anyone else. Perhaps it is the weather. Perhaps it is Britain's post-imperial national mood: all that lost pride swilling around like poison. Or perhaps it is just the British ability to keep getting turned down for the Olympics. In scene one, somewhere near Manchester, the hero Bob (Bruce Jones) is limbering up for his own unique athletic event, sheep-stealing. Bob is an unemployed fortysomething failing to make ends meet. His friend Tommy is the dumpy, bespectacled ideas-man (Ricky Tomlinson of the famous Riff Raff bath scene) who helps him urge the piece of live mutton into Bob's van. Then, having transformed it into choice cuts off-screen, the two men hawk it around the local pub. Only problem: while they are doing so Bob's uninsured van is stolen from the pub car park. Thus begins the breezy catalogue of disasters. In a Ken Loach film the following truths are self-evident. Few men have any money; few men have a job; and if a Loach hero followed Norman Tebbit's advice to get 'on his bike' he would promptly have his bike stolen. Raining Stones is scripted by former Loach collaborator and Play For Today veteran Jim Allen, who must have been asked to report to the set with three jokes per page. The hero's misfortunes are horribly funny, except in one scene when they are simply, searingly horrible. (A moneylender barges into his home to terrorise his wife: 'Take the rings off]' he says, addressing her knife-threatened fingers). Mostly, Loach and Allen let comedy do the business both cautionary and caustic. Since Bob is a born loser whose empty head fills up with the first predatory propagandisings to come along, he is a semi-devout Catholic. He wants to buy his daughter a communion dress (cost Pounds 115) and this insignium of pride and purity must be acquired by any means, however shamefaced or impure. From rustling sheep our hero advances to stealing turves at the Conservative Bowling Club, cleaning out the drains at the church and coaxing his wife into reluctant seamstress work. (She handles a sewing-machine much as a dog handles a bicycle.) Bruce Jones, his face like a wounded croissant, makes Bob's mixture of dimness, obstinacy and sweet nature irresistible. His communion lessons to daughter are a masterclass in daffy scholarship: ''E takes a piece of bread and 'olds it up to 'is mates' is his summary of Our Lord's activities at the Last Supper. And when the daughter later shows who is the real moral boss by lending Dad a much-needed tenner, he promptly bursts into tears after she has left the room. The movie gets tough when it is time to. Bob is involved in a violent death, and for a few bizarre but persuasive minutes the film is possessed by the dark spirit of urban verismo. But this is world where lunatic optimism always returns to beat back reality. The priest pats our Bob's shaking hand and mouths some doubtful scriptural bromides; and Bob moves off, not much sadder and certainly no wiser, to his daughter's Communion. Bad Loach movies (Fatherland, Hidden Agenda) deal out denouements, showdowns and Messages. Good Loach movies - The Gamekeeper, Riff Raff, Raining Stones  -rejoice in life's confusions and contusions and offer ironic sympathy as the only band-aid. These films are about the mixed blessings of self-knowledge: especially in a hard-up world where energetic befuddlement and instinctive camaraderie often provide the best protective layer between outside world and inside awareness. 'I didn't expect everyone to be so polite,' says New York police detective Harvey Keitel on landing in Scotland Yard. Why not? Has he not seen Brannigan, The Mackintosh Man and a dozen other yankee-in-Queen-Elizabeth's-court crime movies? The Young Americans brings its Stateside law-enforcer to London to assist the natives in their international drug traffic problems, and to be bemused in his turn by people's tendency to say 'How was your flight?' instead of 'Siddown' or 'Whaddyawannaknow?' Not that this politeness lasts long. Soon Keitel is being strobed by East End discos, threatened by cockney crime barons and gnawed by anxiety when he sends in a young apprentice supergrass (Craig Kelly) to grab incriminating evidence on the suspected Mr Big (Viggo Mortensen). The British writer-director is Danny Cannon, a National Film School graduate. He smothers the film in high-concept gloom as if still doing his second-year school exercise, 'How to make a film noir without cutting off all the lighting sources.' There are dark streets strafed by backlighting; dark basement homes illuminated by a single grungy window; dark, flicker-lit dance clubs where a hundred extras trip the light epileptic. What there is not, amid the acres of moody style, is a compelling story. Narrative momentum is constantly sabotaged by Cannon's wish to pile in as many subplots as possible to please the American market he seems to be aiming for. Here an interracial love affair (Kelly's with his black girlfriend), there a crumbling marriage (Keitel's with his end-of-phone wife), somewhere else the wit and wisdom of a veteran 'godfather' (Terence Rigby). No wonder the two best-known UK actors hugging the top of the cast list - Iain Glen, John Wood - have time for about four lines each of true-Brit dialogue before vanishing into the gloom and confusion along with everything else. The Hong Kong action film Hard Boiled has no fears about losing its characters. Its set aim is to dispose of them all as fast and spectacularly as possible. The checklist of weapons includes: knives, handguns, submachine guns, rocket-launchers, electric cables, crashing ceilings, burning hospitals and intercontinental ballistic dialogue. (Exclamatory Chinese interspersed with suddens spasms of B-movie American). If all this does not take care of the arms-running gangsters who have attracted the adverse attention of our hero Inspector Yuen, nicknamed 'Tequila' (Chow Yun-Fat), there is always Yuen's undercover ally Tony (Tony Leung). He has startling powers of survival. Shoot him, beat him up, stab him, electrify him and he still comes back smiling and firing. The man responsible for this insanity is writer-director John Woo. You have to admire his effrontery as one hard-to-top shoot-out is topped by another, and as the violence itself is finally topped by an outbreak of high-kitsch sentimentality in the newborn babies' ward. As mayhem bursts around them, the tots are scrupulously rescued by 'Tequila' and his girlfriend (Teresa Mo). Our hero even takes the trouble to stuff the babies' ears with cotton wool and to avert their eyes ('Hey] X-rated action]') whenever his gun-hand comes into play. Hard Boiled is 100 minutes of movie violence redeemed by its total remoteness from real life: unless we are to take the date in which Woo's story is set - 1997 - as an earnest prediction of life in Hong Kong after that fateful changeover.</p>

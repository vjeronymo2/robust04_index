			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Bonn will defend east's shipbuilders THE German government said yesterday it would fight European Commission proposals to cut capacity in the ailing east German shipbuilding industry. The Commission agreed plans to lift the ceiling on state aid to 36 per cent of contract value for yards opened before October 1990. All aid would have to be paid before the end of 1993. But yards will have to be closed and jobs cut to ensure shipbuilding capacity in the new German Lander falls by 40 per cent before the end of 1995. Other Community shipbuilders, notably the Spanish, have campaigned hard against relaxing the rules for the east German yards. The Bonn Economics Ministry said it could accept the increase in the ceiling, which compares with an EC-wide limit of 9 per cent for production aid. But a spokesman added: 'In the light of cuts already undertaken, reduction of capacity on this scale will give us great difficulties.' The proposals will be discussed by EC ministers next month. Germany alone will be unable to block agreement by a majority of other member states. The Commission said its proposals were in line with policy in other member states and that apart from the increased ceiling, the normal rules on aid to shipyards would be applied. Lightning strikes among printers hit production of yesterday's German newspapers after Tuesday's arbitration talks failed to produce a pay deal. IG Medien, the main union involved, and one of the most militant in Germany, said it would call a strike ballot immediately if there was no result from conciliation talks scheduled for today. Further disruption was expected last night. The threat of strikes also loomed over paper manufacturing yesterday.</p>

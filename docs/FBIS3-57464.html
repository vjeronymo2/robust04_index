"Daniel Tarschys, one of the candidates for the post  of secretary general, stressed in his speech that Russia has  expressed signs of disrespect towards its neighbours," Kelam  said. He added that only the Finnish delegation had supported  Russia's rapid admission to the CE.    Kelam was one of the members to participate in the  discussion. He stressed the Estonian position that Russian will  have to withdraw its troops from Estonia and Latvia, give up its  disrespectful attitude towards its neighbours and launch truly  democratic reforms before being admitted to the CE.</p>

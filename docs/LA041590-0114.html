			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' SCHOOL TO ADMIT GIRLS IN 1991  </P> <P> In a major break from tradition, Junipero Serra High School in Gardena is  planning to add pink tiles to one of its locker rooms, romance novels to its  library and, most important, girls to its all-male student body.  </P> <P> "Serra Men," as the more than 4,000 graduates of the 40-year-old Roman Catholic  school are known, will become "Serra Men and Women" after the school enrolls  its first female students in the fall of 1991.  </P> <P> Principal James Crowell, himself a 1970 Serra graduate, began pursuing  coeducation about two years ago when the school's enrollment began declining  significantly and it became clear that Serra was losing potential students to  coeducational parochial schools in Torrance and Playa del Rey. From 1986 to  this school year, Serra's enrollment has dropped from 520 to an all-time low of  266.  </P> <P> "An all-boy school is really a holdover from the past," said Crowell, who spent  14 years at Serra as a teacher and dean before becoming principal last year.  </P> <P> Serra's boys are enthusiastic about the change.  </P> <P> "The guys are in favor of it," said Kenny Davis, student body president and a  star Serra basketball player. He said it will be strange to return to Serra  after graduating this year and "see young ladies walking around."  </P> <P> Serra already has three all-girl sister schools in Compton, Inglewood and Los  Angeles, which provide cheerleaders for Serra games and whose students are  invited to Serra dances. But the boys said that having girls on campus all day  will be different.  </P> <P> "It will give us a chance to mingle a little bit and not just look at other  guys," said Christopher Rogers, 16, a junior who will graduate before the girls  arrive. "I think the guys may be more mature. You can't act like a fool in  front of a girl."  </P> <P> Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the change.  </P> <P> "There is enough time after they graduate from high school to start mingling  with girls," said Shirley Smith, who heads Serra's parent-teacher organization.  "They'll be doing that for the rest of their lives. I guess I'm a little  old-fashioned about that."  </P> <P> Smith said she supports the move only because Serra's future may be at stake.  </P> <P> The new shower tiles and reading material are just a couple of the ideas  Crowell has to prepare the school for coeducation. Serra will also renovate  four bathrooms for the female students and hold special workshops for teachers  and current students to help them adjust to the new arrivals.  </P> <P> Archdiocesan officials have not yet determined whether Serra will admit girls  gradually over four years, starting with the freshman class next year, or  completely integrate all four grade levels at once. The former option, school  officials said, might lessen the impact on area all-girls schools, which could  lose students to Serra.  </P> <P> "We're a girl's school and we stress that," said an administrator at St. Mary's  Academy in Inglewood who declined to discuss Serra's change to coeducation. "If  this is the kind of education they want, they'll go here."  </P></p>

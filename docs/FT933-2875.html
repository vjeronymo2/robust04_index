			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Job-cut costs batter profit at Simint SIMINT, the Italian clothing group in which designer Mr Giorgio Armani has a 20 per cent stake, reported a collapse in net profits for the year ending April 30, writes Haig Simonian. It blamed extraordinary charges and higher borrowing costs. Net earnings fell to L1.6bn (Dollars 1m) from L17.4bn. The dividend for ordinary and preference shares is being cut to L50 from L150. Sales rose 7 per cent to L377.5bn. Mr Luca Ramella, managing director, said the earnings fall had been expected. He stressed that operating profits had risen by 10 per cent, to L49.7bn from L45.2bn, in spite of a L7bn provision on stock and trade credits. Net operating profits fell slightly, to L33.6bn from L34.1bn, after a L5bn rise in depreciation to L16.1bn. Mr Ramella blamed the profits plunge on one-off restructuring costs linked to the virtual halving of the group's workforce, and an increase in interest charges to L10bn.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Manufacturing sales hopes dashed, says CBI SUMMER OPTIMISM among manufacturers for buoyant orders and output has not lived up to expectations, the latest industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry has found. Its results, consistent with recent fears that the pace of recovery is slowing, showed that orders and output were both flat during the past four months, while export orders declined. The rise in business confidence was the weakest so far this year. But the survey should calm fears that inflation is gaining momentum. For the first time since the survey began in 1958, slightly more companies expect unit costs to fall than to rise over the next four months. The survey, which covered more than 1,300 companies in 50 different industries, found that the number of manufacturers reporting a rise in new orders during the past four months equalled those reporting a drop. The balance was also flat for output. In spite of the disappointing results, companies still hope to see a modest improvement in demand and production during the rest of the year. The drop in exports was not surprising as CBI members are suffering from the recession in continental Europe, to which they export more than half their goods. The number of companies reporting a drop in export orders outweighed those reporting an increase by 8 percentage points. The outlook for exports over the next four months remains positive with a balance of 6 per cent expecting a rise in orders. The CBI said small businesses had fared better during the past four months than big manufacturers. Other highlights of the survey were: Prices - unit costs barely increased in the past four months, suggesting that inflationary pressures remain subdued. The CBI said profit margins were still being squeezed. Employment - the fall in manufacturing employment has eased slightly since summer. Job losses are expected to continue at the same rate over the next four months. Big companies - employing more than 5,000 people  - have shed jobs at a much faster rate than their smaller counterparts. The CBI pointed out that employment has continued to fall while output has remained flat, implying that productivity is still improving. Investment - intentions to invest remain weak. Companies planning to cut spending on buildings and machinery in the next year continue to outweigh those which intend to spend, although the balance is the lowest since the start of the year. Optimism - business optimism rose for the fourth successive quarter, but the increase was the weakest so far this year. A positive balance of 1 per cent of companies said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than they were four months ago, compared with a positive balance of 11 per cent in the last survey.</p>

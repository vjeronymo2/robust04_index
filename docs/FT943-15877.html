			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Call for tobacco events on TV to end The Commons national heritage committee yesterday called for the phasing-out of all broadcasting of events sponsored by tobacco companies on terrestrial television. Mr Gerald Kaufman, the committee chairman, noted that the ITV companies and Channel 4 had decided not to broadcast events sponsored by tobacco companies and that it was 'quite extraordinary' that the BBC continued to do so. The corporation has said it will not enter into any contracts for new events with tobacco sponsors. The committee recommended that no UK sporting events sponsored by tobacco companies be broadcast by any terrestrial channel once existing contracts run out. It called on the government to hold discussions at European and international levels on satellite television coverage 'to seek to end indirect advertising of tobacco products through programme or event sponsorship on satellite television'. The committee sought to give greater protection to the televising of events such as the FA Cup Final, the Grand National horse race and the Olympics to make sure that they continue to be available to all viewers. The 1990 Broadcasting Act decreed that the rights to such events could be bought exclusively by a subscription sports channel such as Sky Sports, but could not be broadcast on a pay-per-view basis. The committee said it wanted the ban extended to subscription services, inferring that listed events - which also include the World Cup finals and the finals weekend at Wimbledon - should be shown on the main channels, be it the BBC, ITV or Channel 4.

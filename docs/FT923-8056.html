			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Observer: Pru's new man Since the Prudential, Britain's biggest institutional investor, is always banging on about the need for strong non-executive directors, it is interesting to see who it thinks fit to serve on its own board. If its latest recruit, English China Clays' chief executive Andrew Teare, is anything to go by, then the Pru seems to be changing from its old ways of packing its board with old establishment figures. Lord Hunt, the former Cabinet secretary, Lord Butterfield, a former vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, and Julius Neave, an old reinsurance hand, were all in their 70s when they retired from the Pru's board after the annual meeting in May. The 49-year-old Teare is the first of a clutch of new non-executives expected to take their place around the Pru's boardroom table. In many ways he is a classic example of what the Pru is looking for when it chivvies companies it invests in to strengthen their own boards. He has rejuvenated English China Clays and is one of a new generation of younger business leaders worth watching. Even so, his judgment can sometimes be suspect. He backed Michael Heseltine in the Tory leadership contest following Lady Thatcher's resignation in 1990. That said, he hasn't yet put a foot wrong in his business affairs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] To further clarify the picture of the contacts on  negotiations, our news program has telephoned Faruq Qaddumi,  head of the PLO Political Department, who spoke about the U.S.  President's announcement of an expected Israeli-Palestinian  meeting in Washington.    [Begin Qaddumi recording] In fact, yesterday's crime makes  it  impossible to think about the negotiations. Our delegations  have been summoned from the committees and from the places where  they hold negotiations. The issue now is not one of  negotiations. It is a crime that has been committed against the  Palestinian people, nay, against humanity. First, President  Clinton should find a solution to this problem before he invites  us for meetings to continue the negotiations. Ways and means  must be forged to protect the Palestinian people. International  resolutions must be adopted to condemn this heinous crime, in  which scores were killed. The world must know that this state  -- described as democratic -- is a false democracy. It is the  source of anxiety and tension in the region, it is the hotbed of  instability. Therefore, President Clinton should consider a  solution to this problem before he invites us to such meetings.  We are for peace and for the establishment of a just, durable  peace. This crime has struck the peace process in the heart.  This is because this is clear evidence that Israel does not  want peace. [end recording]    On the Palestinian side, Faruq Qaddumi said: [Begin Qaddumi  recording] We have asked the UN Security Council to adopt  resolutions to protect the Palestinian people. We are demanding  international forces to stop these massacres. We definitely  know the international group will not hesitate at all to adopt  the most stringent measures. Measures that clearly prove that  Israel wants peace must be adopted. First, measures must be  taken against Israel and against the perpetrators of this crime  against humanity. Before anything else, the international group  must not only condemn this, but make available means of  protection for the Palestinian people. [end recording]</p>

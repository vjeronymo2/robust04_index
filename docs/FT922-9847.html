			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / ANC criticises de Klerk reshuffle The African National Congress (ANC) yesterday criticised a reshuffle in President F W. de Klerk's all-white cabinet and called for the participation of blacks in a new government, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. The ANC said that while replacements had to be found for two ministers, who are stepping down due to exhaustion, rapid progress was needed in multi-party talks on a democratic constitution. 'President de Klerk's major cabinet reshuffle carries with it the implication that the government is proceeding with policies unilaterally,' an ANC statement said. The white-led government and the ANC are the main protagonists in 19-party democracy talks under way since December.</p>

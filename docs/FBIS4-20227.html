			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on Spanish Prime Minister Felipe </F> Gonzalez' 19 April "state of the nation" speech in parliament  building in Madrid: "The Debate: Gonzalez' Speech"]    [Text]  <H8>  Corruption </H8> <H5>  "Six Promises in Six Minutes" </H5>   Felipe Gonzalez yesterday turned corruption into a preamble  of just six minutes to his state of the nation speech. Before  analyzing the economic crisis, the impetus to autonomy, the  democratic impetus, and Europe, Gonzalez laid down his stance on  former Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio and former Civil  Guard Director General Luis Roldan.    "I wish to lay down the government's stance on the  accusations of corruption which have appeared over the past few  weeks, creating an atmosphere of great concern among the public.  In the election campaign, we promised to act vigorously and  energetically against the corruption cases which might arise,  trying to remove from public life those people who through their  conduct did not deserve the trust placed in them. We also want  the law to act with due dispatch to clarify matters which may be  criminal and correspondingly to elucidate responsibilities....    ``The government, fully accepting its responsibilities,  deems  it essential to tackle these problems and restore social  confidence. It is true that we are experiencing an atmosphere of  distrust, and even the danger of disaffection with democratic  values, weakening the ability to meet the challenges of the  crisis. In the case of the former Civil Guard director general,  a committee of enquiry has been set up in parliament. We have  handed over the material which will make it possible to clarify  the matters which are the committee's purpose, and so we will  act in any case that arises. We hope that with the utmost  dispatch it will reach conclusions which will enable us to see  clearly the problems reported in parliament's proper sphere. At  the same time, the law will elucidate whatever responsibilities  there were, and the tax inspectorate has been acting, gentlemen,  to the same end over the past few months....    "The setting up of another committee for the case of the  former Bank of Spain governor has also been requested by several  parliamentary groups, including our own. In this matter, too,  we have acted promptly and vigorously. I regard this case as  extremely important, and deem myself directly concerned by it in  having proposed his appointment and having supported the former  governor's honor at the time of the Ibercorps crisis. We have  tried unsuccessfully to induce the former governor to explain to  the public whether the accusations leveled against him are true  or not, whether or not he kept money concealed, whether or not  he fulfilled his tax obligations, and so forth. Not even his  appearance before the Economy and Finance Committee last Friday,  which we ourselves requested, has served to clarify his conduct."  <H5>  Elucidate Responsibilities </H5>   "At the same time, we have urged the government attorney's  office to act immediately, having placed all the material and  human resources at its disposal, and we have set the tax  inspectorate to work to investigate thoroughly and elucidate  responsibilities in its proper sphere. I must inform the house  that even before this parliament began its proceedings, the  government attorney's office and the tax inspectorate had  already done so.    ``We deem it desirable to improve the conditions and the  legal and instrumental resources to combat the phenomenon of  corruption in the rule-of-law state in which we live. So we are  not only prepared to amend this house's standing orders in order  to facilitate the investigation of these matters; we will  introduce, as we have promised, some changes in the rules, and  are willing to study the proposals which the groups may make.    ``In the first place, we will propose amending the law on  the  National Audit Office in order to widen its area of  responsibility and to increase the office's means of monitoring  and oversight.    ``Second, we will immediately introduce a more complete and  strict classification of conduct connected with corruption  offenses and greater severity in the penalties to be imposed in  amending the penal code.    ``Third, we will increase efficiency in the judicial  response  through procedural reforms.    ``Fourth, we will propose setting up a special attorney's  office charged with prosecuting economic and corruption offenses.    ``Fifth, we will set up a specific group in the General  Directorate of the State Legal Service, charged with defending  the public treasury's interests by taking part in any judicial  proceedings for offenses of this nature.    ``To this must be added the plan to amend the General Budget  Law, which will strengthen economic and financial oversight of  the public sector through mechanisms which will make possible  greater effectiveness in the examination of the Auditor  General's Office's audits and, where appropriate, elucidating  the corresponding political and administrative responsibilities.  These proposals are strengthened by the strong social  condemnation of corruption.''  <H8>  Economic Crisis </H8> <H5>  "Trend Reversed" </H5>   ``In this period, the government's activity as a whole has  pursued as its main aim surmounting the crisis with a view to  job creation.... Achieving this aim requires emerging from the  economic crisis which has affected Spain and the whole of Europe  over the past two years, and also emerging from it vigorously  and confidently....    ``During the past nine months, the recessionary trend has  been reversed, thanks to our economy's ability to respond, the  efforts of many employers and workers, and, overall, the  appropriate policy which we have been implementing....    ``The Budgets Law, the Fiscal and Financial Measures Law,  and  the package of reforms of the labor market are the most  important measures of the past nine months....    ``Our exchange rate has been put at levels more consistent  with our economy's basic characteristics.... Interest  rates...have fallen by over 5 percent....    ``With respect to inflation,...this year's figures are  encouraging.... The public deficit showed considerable strains  in 1992, was very high in 1993, and is forecast to remain high  in 1994....    ``(Foreign investment) will remain here insofar as  conditions  of competitiveness are right....    ``The social security pensions system is viable, makes it  possible to fund current pensions, and will also make it  possible to fund future pensions....''  <H8>  Impetus </H8> <H5>  Autonomous Communities </H5>   "We have now spent a good number of years in the process of  building them; a dynamic process which has changed the  distribution of power and the exercise of political activity in  our country. It is a process which neither can nor should stop,  but one in which it is perfectly desirable and possible to move  forward if we are guided by loyalty, territorial balance, and  solidarity. The aim is a more decentralized, more effective  state, closer to citizens -- a state of autonomous communities  -- with which to face the 21st century.    ``...The government's proposal (on the implementation of  autonomy) is meant to take shape in a joint interpretation of  the [autonomy] statutes, which, within the framework of the  consequent bilateral relations and the Constitutional Court's  jurisprudence, will make it possible to define by mutual  agreement the scope of the sections on powers contained in the  statutes.''  <H5>  Democracy </H5>   "All the other groups (except the People's Party) have  proposed to this house the election of a candidate for the post  of ombudsman; a proposal which, as you gentlemen know, will be  voted on next week. If the People's Party group's (blocking)  stance changes, and this election goes through, we will be able  immediately and with the greatest possible agreement to set  about filling the other vacancies in the institutional bodies,  including the Spanish Radio and Television System board.    ``However, if the current situation continues, the  government will immediately propose to the parliamentary groups  that we start studying amending the legal rules, with the aim,  while always ensuring a high level of agreement, of surmounting  the insurmountable obstacle posed by a political party's  deciding to practice an institutional blockage.''  <H8>  Europe </H8> <H5>  "Our Viewpoint Counts" </H5>   ``The entry into force of the treaty on European union, the  approval of the European initiative on growth and employment,  the white paper on growth, competitiveness, and employment, and  the negotiations on the Union's enlargement are developments  which decisively influence Spanish life.    ``Our future as a country is linked to the European Union's  future, and we will therefore continue to strive to ensure that  the political project of integration develops effectively for  the whole, but also satisfactorily for Spanish interests....    ``We must continue with our task of convergence with the  other countries in Economic and Monetary Union.... The fact  that some doubts about timetables or dates have arisen should be  no cause for concern....    ``No country is able today to surmount the economic crisis  in  isolation. In an interdependent world such as ours, the  solution to the crisis must necessarily be a European  solution.... In order to adopt a policy of economic revival, to  take decisions on the major infrastructures which must be  tackled in the future, and in order to design policies such as  environmental policy, the European sphere is a more appropriate  sphere than the national spheres. Spain aims increasingly not  just to be in Europe but to count in Europe, and to play the  role which befits it as one of the major European countries....  Our viewpoint counts increasingly in Europe....''</p>

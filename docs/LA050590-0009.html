			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RATIONAL MAYBE, MORAL NEVER;  </P> <P> HEALTH-CARE SHORTAGES VIVIDLY ILLUSTRATE THE HEARTBREAKING DILEMMA  </P> <P> The imaginative effort and the predictable failure of Alameda County to devise  a rational rationing of public- health services provides a lesson for every  county in the state. More than anything else, the failure measures the  inadequacy nationwide of basic health services, an inadequacy that is at once  dangerous in health terms and costly in fiscal terms.  </P> <P> Rationing of health care for the poor and uninsured already is a fact, imposed  by endless lines at clinics, the unavailability of specialists, the limited  access to diagnostic services and hospitals, and the enduring squeeze on  public-health budgets.  </P> <P> Alameda County decided to do by design what was being done by chance, and in  the process make more effective use of health-care dollars. Oregon's experiment  along similar lines was a model. Oregon made an open decision to focus limited  funds on primary care, thus ensuring such services as prenatal care, the most  cost-effective medical investment, but denying organ transplants. It was a  decision as honest as it was controversial. But the Alameda County study  quickly discovered that "The health care system for the poor and uninsured in  Alameda County is already stretched so thin that . . . rationing, prioritizing  . . . specific services or procedures relative to target populations or  diagnostic categories are impractical and morally indefensible."  </P> <P> The same conclusions apply to most of the counties, probably all of the states.  California has 5.2 million without health insurance, many of them children. The  most recent evidence of the failed health-safety net is the outbreak of  measles, accompanied by a record death toll, at a time when immunization can  provide protection.  </P> <P> At a time when artificial budget restraints dominate politics, it apparently  has been easier for legislators to postpone providing adequate health funds  even though they certainly know that postponement extracts a staggering  increase in the cost. That must change.  </P></p>

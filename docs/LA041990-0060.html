			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Garbo Really Alone: Greta Garbo described herself in a 1926 letter as a lonely  girl who was homesick for her native Sweden, according to a secret file opened  by officials at Stockholm's Royal Library.  </P> <P> "I live very lonely in a place where I am left absolutely alone, I go out for  walks sometimes alone, look at the sky and the water and talk to myself," Garbo  wrote from Hollywood to her actress friend, Vera Schmiterlov. The letter had a  drawing of a crying girl, topped by the word "homesick." The 84-year-old  reclusive star died in New York on Easter Sunday. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

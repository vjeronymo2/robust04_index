			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kresimir Meler: "Intelligence Offices Are </F> Merging"]    [Text] A secret agreement was signed at Plitvice on  joint work by the intelligence and counterintelligence services  of all three Serbian states; the normalization between Croatia  and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] is obviously only  an illusion for the naive.    From our associate.    Whenever you think that it will be easy for you to do  something, it usually turns out to be an unsolvable problem,  says one of Murphy's Laws, which, whether the Croats like it or  not, could have been invented precisely for the "presidium of  Catholicism," as President Tudjman likes so much to call  Croatia. Why?    Just a few days after the signing of the famous declaration  on the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations and on the  day that Milan Martic was proclaimed president of the Krajina,  something else extremely important happened. Specifically, as we  have learned from reliable sources, an agreement was concluded  at Plitvice on joint action by the intelligence and  counterintelligence services of the republic of Serbian Krajina  [RSK], the republic of Srpska [RS], and the FRY. At the same  time, it is also the first step toward the official merger of  the "Serbian republics" and the FRY into one state. After this  step, the establishment of a joint command for the armed forces  is planned; at first, it will only involve coordinating their  work. Then, by March 1995 at the latest, the three current  armies (the Yugoslav Army, the RS army, and the Serbian army of  the Krajina) will also officially become one army.    How important the agreement to merge the intelligence  services is to the FRY is also demonstrated by the fact that the  chief of the FRY's military intelligence service, General  Aleksandar Dimitrijevic, and his assistant for the  counterintelligence service, Radenko Radinovic, were in Korenica  personally, and General Bosko Kelecevic, Milan Gvero, and  Milisav Gagovic also attended the meeting on behalf of the  "Serbian armies."    Just a few days before, representatives of the newly  established Russian intelligence service, the SVR, visited Knin.  According to the protocol on joint action by the intelligence  services, they decided on this step for the sake of "effective  fulfillment of short-term and long-term strategic and security  interests, and more effective guarantees of internal and  external security." The joint intelligence service will have  four administrations: an administration for external relations,  an administration for analyses and investigations, an  operational administration, and an external security service.  The counterintelligence service will also operate as part of the  operational administration. The center of the administration  will be in Pancevo, and there will be "branches" in Banja Luka,  Pale, Knin, and Petrinja.    The "branches" will consist of groups that will each have 12  operatives/commanders, operatives who will take care of  coordination, and advisers on artillery, engineering, the air  force, and the infantry. A branch will be headed by a  coordinator whose task will be cooperation with "headquarters."  The "branches," in addition to their own coordinators, will also  have a joint coordinator, who will officially head the  intelligence services of the RS and RSK. General Bosko Kelecevic  will be appointed to that position, and his deputy will be  Smiljan Geric, who recently came from Belgrade. Both of them are  adherents of Ratko Mladic, and are considered the most competent  and most intelligent soldiers of the RS. In Knin, the  (counter)intelligence service will reportedly be completely  reorganized. That task has been entrusted to Generals Nedeljko  Boskovic and Vuk Obradovic, who sharply attacked the Knin  military leadership in their first reports.    In the future the Knin intelligence officers will not be  able  to act independently. At best, they will receive assignments  from Boskovic or Kelecevic. The coordinator (Kelecevic) will  decide on wiretaps and investigations, while the important fact  is, above all, that intelligence officers from Knin will not be  informed about certain actions (read: most actions)--even if  Martic or General Novakovic, commander of the RSK army, were to  be wiretapped or investigated.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Blake and Casken - Cheltenham Festival Cheltenham this year offers no less than 11 premieres, from the first performance of Michael Berkeley's opera Baa Baa Black Sheep (on which I reported last week) to the emergence of Alan Rawsthorne's Recorder Suite more than 40 years after it was written. New orchestral works by David Blake and John Casken fell somewhere between these poles - a cello concerto from Blake, a piece for string orchestra, Darting the skiff, from Casken. Blake's concerto was introduced by Moray Welsh and the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Alexander Lazarev on the first Sunday of the festival. It is his second concerto: the first, warmly expressive and full of Italianate lyricism, was written for violin in 1975 during work on the opera Toussaint, and the new one also has operatic affiliations, for its protracted gestation began in the aftermath of Blake's completion of The Plumber's Gift in 1989. The musical substance of the cello concerto, though, is entirely independent; it plays for 25 minutes in three connected movements, a discursive contrast of Lento and Allegro followed by the briefest of scherzos and a rangy set of variations which has ambitions to turn itself into a passacaglia. The structure is lucid and convincing, the solo writing thoroughly idiomatic, the thematic material more or less memorable. There are some striking moments - the sudden intrusion of a piano's incisive timbre into the texture of the first movement as if to kick the music into a different gear, the subversive triviality of the scherzo, the grand scheme of the finale which ultimately squares the thematic circle when the most intimate idea of the first movement returns in the final bars, lyrically adorned by the cello. Darting the skiff was also intended for a cellist. Heinrich Schiff was due to conduct the Cheltenham premiere with the Northern Sinfonia, but withdrew from the concert on Tuesday with illness and Casken himself took charge of the nimble first performance. The title comes from Gerard Manley Hopkins; the ghost of a pun is intended, but it also conjures images of boats moving on water and the play of reflected light that had provided the starting point for the work. Casken contrasts two types of material in the 17-minute span - sinewy, propulsive figuration and sustained, still meditation, as if the components of a string introduction and allegro had been cut up and interlaced. The music's range of mood and tempo is continually fascinating, the interplay of thematic elements and the textural variation always diverting; it seemed at a single hearing a most useful addition to the string orchestra's repertory.

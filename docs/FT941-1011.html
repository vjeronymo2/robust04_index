			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Lawrence wins cabinet seat Ms Carmen Lawrence, the former West Australian premier and a newcomer to Canberra politics, was yesterday given the health and human services portfolio and a seat in cabinet in the fourth reshuffle undertaken by Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, in as many months, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The decision to combine human services with the health job means that Mr Brian Howe, the deputy prime minister, loses these responsibilities but becomes minister for housing and regional development - picking up the regional job from industry minister Peter Cook. Mr Cook, in turn, takes on responsibilities for science. Mr John Faulkner becomes minister for the environment, sport and territories.</p>

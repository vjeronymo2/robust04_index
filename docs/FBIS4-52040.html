			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Japan's No. 2 opposition  party urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday [6 May] to  sack Shigeto Nagano as justice minister over his remark that the  1937 Nanjing massacre is "a fabrication." The Social Democratic  Party (SDP) will demand Nagano's dismissal unless Hata sacks  him, said Koken Nosaka, the SDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman.    In an interview with mass-circulation daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN  published Wednesday, Nagano denied that the Nanjing massacre  happened and said it is wrong to call Japan's World War II  campaign a war of aggression. Following the invasion of Nanjing  in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more  than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates.    Japanese historians, however, tend to cite much lower  estimates and some also contend that the mass killings were not  ordered but caused by troops that got out of hand. The  international war tribunal estimated the number at more than  200,000.    On Wednesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "a  Japanese cabinet member went so far as to publicly distort  history, deny the historical facts and defend the Japanese  militarists' aggression. We are shocked and indignant about  this."    South Korea's Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told Japanese  Ambassador to South Korea Toshio Goto on Friday that Nagano's  remarks are a distortion of historical facts.    Nagano, a member of the House of Councillors and a former  chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force, was given the  justice portfolio in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on April 28.    The SDP, whose members voted for Hata in the Diet's prime  ministerial elections April 25, quit the ruling coalition last  week in protest against the establishment of a large  parliamentary grouping by coalition partners, excluding the SDP.    The country's two largest parties, the Liberal Democratic  Party and the SDP, are now both in the opposition camp.    The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) also demanded Nagano's  dismissal, saying it cannot pardon his remark that completely  denies Japan's historic crime.    Kazuo Shii, chief of the JCP Secretariat, said Nagano's  remark "is an astonishingly wild one to defend the worst war  crimes by the Japanese militarism...The Nanjing massacre has  been proved by a number of concrete facts." Shii said if Hata  obscures the matter, it will lead to no confidence of the  cabinet.</p>

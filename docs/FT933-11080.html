New York investment funds used the turmoil in European currency markets as a launching point for another attack on a target they have been attempting to reach since the April campaign by high-profile financiers Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros re-ignited interest in the gold market. Gold jumped by Dollars 9.40 an ounce in London from Thursday's closing price to reach Dollars 404.50 early yesterday after overnight buying by the US funds drove it up in the Far East. More New York buying emerged late in the day to take gold to Dollars 405.75 an ounce, up Dollars 11.65, by the close of trading in London. Traders report that physical demand for the metal has virtually dried up because of the speed of the gold price rise from a seven-year low point of Dollars 327 an ounce in January.</p>

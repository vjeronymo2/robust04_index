			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARK DEDICATED WHILE BUDGET CUT PLAN DECRIED;  </P> <P> FUNDING: CONSERVANCY CHAIRWOMAN SAYS STATE'S PROPOSED REDUCTIONS WOULD GREATLY  HAMPER THE GROUP'S EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MORE PARKLAND.  </P> <P> The chairwoman of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy used what she called  the happiest of occasions -- the dedication of a new park Friday -- to call on  environmentalists to express outrage at proposed cuts in the state  organization's budget.  </P> <P> "This may be our last dedication," Carole Stevens told about 150 people who  gathered under shade trees to inaugurate Towsley Canyon Park, 145 acres of  pristine woodland in the mountains overlooking the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> Stevens said a proposal by the Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee would  greatly hamper the conservancy's efforts to acquire parkland. The subcommittee  proposed paying for measures to be taken under Proposition 117 -- the Wildlife  Protection Act approved by voters Tuesday -- by redirecting $1 million from  funds gathered to implement Proposition 70, the 1988 Park Bond Act. The money  would come out of the conservancy's budget.  </P> <P> Also, Stevens said, the conservancy cannot spend any of the $10 million in  Proposition 117 funds it will receive over the next five years to acquire any  lands that are not technically wildlife corridors, as specified in the  proposition.  </P> <P> This will hinder the conservancy's ability to acquire and protect mountain land  that does not qualify as a wildlife corridor, she said.  </P> <P> "We need your letters of support, your letters of outrage that when you voted  for Proposition 70 you expected parkland" and did not expect the money to go to  implement other propositions, Stevens said.  </P> <P> The diversion of money would jeopardize the purchase of land surrounding  Towsley Canyon Park, conservancy officials said. Environmentalists and local  elected officials see the dedication of the park at the mouth of the canyon as  the first step toward creating the proposed 6,000-acre Santa Clarita Woodlands  State Park, west of Santa Clarita and north of Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Laurene Weste, commissioner of the Santa Clarita Parks and Recreation  Department, called the woodlands proposal an effort to "save California for  Californians."  </P> <P> "We can't replace this," she said of Towsley Canyon. "This may not be in the  city of Los Angeles, but you know and I know that our residents are going to  use it," said Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter.  </P> <P> State Sen. Ed Davis, who authored a bill that enabled the conservancy to buy  the Towsley Canyon site for $500,000, said he would continue to help the agency  acquire land for a larger park.  </P> <P> Davis' aide, Hunt Braly, said he and his boss would work to make sure parkland  and wildlife funds are kept separate, making more money available for land  purchases.  </P> <P> Conservancy leaders turned the dedication into a testimonial to Sonia Thompson,  longtime conservancy staff member who is moving to Washington. Elected  officials from the state, Santa Clarita, Los Angeles, Agoura Hills and Los  Angeles and Ventura counties presented plaques and scrolls to Thompson.  </P> <P> "When we're all dead and gone, there will be trees that will say thank you to  Sonia Thompson," said Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director.  </P> <P> The conservancy also named a building in the park the Sonia Thompson Nature  Center.  </P></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Thailand's election raises the price of corruption / A look at some unusual alliances and the country's traditional polling practices THE PRICE of a Thai citizen's vote has risen sharply in brisk trading ahead of the country's general election on March 22. Record offers of between 800 baht and 1,000 baht (Pounds 18 to Pounds 23) for a single vote have been reported from the hotly contested northern region of Chiang Mai, reflecting four years of spectacular economic growth in Thailand since the last election in 1988. Many politicians, according to the Thai press, are also once again hiring professional liars at 200 baht a day to sit in coffee shops and spread malicious rumours about their opponents. The more sophisticated and powerful politicians - notorious for sudden switches of allegiance from one ideologically empty party to another in exchange for multi-million-baht transfer fees - can choose the more efficient method of vote-buying by purchasing officials at polling stations. This practice, known as 'booth-buying', has prompted the electoral authorities to threaten last-minute staff swaps between constituencies. More ominously, at least five people have been killed in violence related to the election campaign, some of them local party canvassers shot dead on the orders of their rivals. In short, the election promises to be typically Thai. It is being held on the instructions of the National Peacekeeping Council (NPKC), the military junta which, citing excessive corruption, overthrew a year ago last month the elected government of General Chatichai Choonhavan in Thailand's 18th coup or coup attempt. As canvassers from the 15 competing parties tour the countryside in vans mounted with loudspeakers and life-size posters of the candidates - many of them sporting military uniforms dripping medals and gold braid - Thais are debating some of the ironies of their topsy-turvy world. When the military took over they were so anxious to show their good intentions that they installed an eminently respectable interim government led by Cambridge-educated Anand Panyarachun as prime minister. He and his cabinet colleagues promptly pursued their own agenda of economic reform and declined to authorise the purchase of all the new aircraft demanded by the air force. Yet they could hardly be removed without acute embarrassment for the junta. Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, air force head and deputy chairman of the NPKC, announced last month that the NPKC was dissatisfied, complaining that, 'when the government refused to obey, we did not know what to do'. The junta then added to the confusion by making electoral alliances with the very politicians that it accused of corruption and overthrew last year. Samakki Tham, or Justice Unity, a new party formed after the coup by the military to promote the military, has joined forces with Chat Thai - Gen Chatichai's old fiefdom - and the Social Action Party. The Assets Examination Committee, established after the coup with the professed aim of tracking down the corrupt earnings of members of the Chatichai government, investigated 25 people, declared 10 of them to be 'unusually wealthy" and ordered the confiscation of 1.9bn baht in assets. However, the junta let them appeal in the courts and continue in politics, with the result that eight of the ten are standing in the election and may have the chance to grant themselves a pardon in a new government. 'Unusually wealthy' politicians are prominent in the alliance of pro-military parties. The moral high ground has proved equally elusive for the loose group of parties which are openly critical of military intervention in politics (and which are themselves dominated by retired generals). This is largely because the un-elected Anand government installed by the armed forces has proved to be one of the most competent the country has known. Mr Anand's cabinet has earned the respect of businessmen for implementing a series of much-needed economic reforms, although liberals have criticised it for crippling the labour movement by banning trade unions in state enterprises. The administration's solid performance has taken the sting out of the anti-NPKC statements of the Democrats, the New Aspiration Party and Palang Dharma, the Bangkok-based party led by Gen Chamlong Srimuang, a devout Buddhist and popular ex-mayor who goes by the nickname 'Mr Clean.' No party is likely to get close to an outright majority in the 360-seat House of Representatives. Liberals argue that the prime minister should at least be an elected member of parliament, rather than a military appointee, and the election will probably be followed by a period of intense horse-trading, with the transport, communications and commerce port-folios regarded as prizes because they offer exceptional opportunities for graft as the country's inadequate infrastructure is developed. Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, now leader of the Chat Thai party, and Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the army commander, are being tipped as possible prime ministers of a coalition government sympathetic to the military. In any event, the armed forces have little reason to fear the election. Under a new constitution devised by the military, Gen Sunthorn Kongsompong, the NPKC chairman, will appoint a 270-member Senate on election day which will have the right to vote together with the elected lower house in no-confidence debates, and thereby give pro-military parties a strong influence over the choice of a prime minister. If all else fails, the military could always stage a coup d'etat.</p>

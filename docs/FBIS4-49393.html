			<p>BFN     [Text] The opening ceremony for an exhibition on the facts  of the Sino-U.S. Cooperation Institute concentration camp [a  camp run by U.S. and Kuomintang forces for the imprisonment of  political dissidents, including communists, during the late  1940's] was held yesterday morning [4 May]. The exhibition was  sponsored by such units as the provincial party committee's  propaganda department, with the help of the provincial museum  and Chongqing's Keleshan Cemetery for Revolutionary Martyrs.  The exhibition displays 300 or so copies of photos, and close  to 100 precious historical relics. These things left behind by  history show the past facts of the heroic struggle carried out  by the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation in  order to make the Chinese revolution a success, as well as the  monstrous crimes committed by Chinese and foreign reactionaries  in the concentration camp. These vivid, lively, and moving  exhibits are lively material with which to conduct education in  patriotism, and will play a positive role in training youngsters  to love the motherland, will foster lofty ideals, and will  enrich the building of socialist spiritual civilization.    At the ceremony, more than 4,000 persons viewed the  exhibition, including party, government, and Army leaders from  the province and cities; officers and men of the People's  Liberation Army and armed police; and pupils from Xining's  (Xiacheng) and (Beiguan) district primary schools.</p>

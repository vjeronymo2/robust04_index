			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Joss takes the hot seat at Westpac - The problems facing the bank's new chief executive WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank, has a rule that only the chairman can be questioned by shareholders at its annual meeting. It is a convention that will be welcomed by Mr Robert Joss, the Californian banker appointed last week to Westpac's vacant chief executive's chair. Mr Joss, a vice-chairman of Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based regional bank, was not present at Westpac's vitriolic annual meeting, which ended last week after more than 16 argumentative hours spread over two days. But after studying Westpac over several weeks, he will know for certain what many shareholders already suspect: that things are likely to get worse before they get better. Mr John Uhrig, the no-nonsense miner who took over as chairman of Westpac in October, gave much the same message to shareholders at the annual meeting, warning that it would be 'unwise to assume that we will not have to contend with further setbacks.' Westpac shareholders have become all too familiar with bad news over the last year as the bank has been hit by a catalogue of disasters which reads like the script for a banker's nightmare. The year started with bad publicity about risky foreign currency loans and embarrassing leaked letters; it continued with a failed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue; and it ended with net losses of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 810.3m) for the year to September, after writing off bad debts of ADollars 2.6bn. Five directors quit in October, including Sir Eric Neal, chairman, followed in December by Mr Frank Conroy, chief executive, after a boardroom row over his recovery plan. Meanwhile, Mr Kerry Packer and an associate joined the board after acquiring 10 per cent of the shares, and promptly walked out of their first board meeting after another row. Mr Joss, who will inherit the mess when he arrives in Sydney later this month, will be uncomfortably aware of the giant shadows cast over Westpac by the enigmatic Mr Packer and the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, which owns 15 per cent of the bank. Both Mr Packer and Mr Ian Salmon, managing director of AMP, have made clear that they want to see a rapid improvement in the bank's fortunes. But there seems to be little agreement about how the new chief executive should go about it. Mr Conroy, a long-time Westpac executive who had held the top job for just 14 months, produced a recovery plan which initially commanded the support of the entire board. Under the Conroy plan, the bank would have cut costs and increased revenue by ADollars 300m by September; cut its non-interest expense to total income ratio from 70 per cent to 58 per cent over three years; and reduced gross assets by about ADollars 10bn from ADollars 110bn. Mr Conroy quit because the board, under pressure from Mr Packer, wanted him to speed up the restructuring. But the board balked at Mr Packer's plans to put the shake-up in the hands of his American lieutenant, Mr Al Dunlap, who has acquired the sobriquet 'chainsaw' for his zeal in slashing the costs of Mr Packer's private companies. Mr Joss says his broad strategy is to refocus the bank on its Australian retail operations, which he believes can be sharpened up sufficiently to close the gap between Westpac and National Australia Bank (NAB), which has an expense-to-income ratio of 57.5 per cent. US analysts say he is highly regarded for the part he played in guiding Wells to recovery from similar problems to those that face Westpac. 'It was a team effort, but he certainly played a big part in it, and that will stand him in good stead when he takes over at Westpac,' says Mr Ray Soifer, banking analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. But with no clear guidance from the board, it is not clear how Mr Joss will approach Westpac's three main problems: Poorly-performing international assets. Westpac has about 48 per cent of gross assets outside Australia, split fairly evenly between the US, Europe, New Zealand and Asia. The worst performing assets are in Europe and the US, where Westpac's inferior credit-rating, caused by its bad debt problems, makes it impossible to compete with domestic banks. 'They need to run these assets down as quickly as they can,' says Mr Craig Drummond, banking analyst at JB Were in Melbourne. 'But it is no good just sticking all the capital back in Australia because of the competition from NAB. So it has to be handled very carefully.' Poor return on assets and higher-than-average expenses. Since Mr Conroy's departure, Westpac has indicated that it is considering reducing staff by up to 20 per cent, or 4,000 people, to help drive down its expenses-to-income ratio. Redundancies on this scale would bring the bank's staffing into line with NAB, but if it is done too quickly it could damage the bank's core retail activities. 'In spite of all its problems, Westpac's share of the domestic loans and bills market has remained unchanged at about 17 per cent,' says Mr Drummond. 'The bank has to move quickly to protect that market share, but if it moves too quickly it will damage the retail franchise, and that is the heart of the business.' Bad debts. The key problem is the weak Australian commercial property market, which has significantly reduced the underlying assets against which many bad debts are secured. Mr Conroy tried to clear the decks last year. But Westpac is due to revalue its property portfolio in March, and analysts say the crucial Sydney market has fallen by more than 10 per cent since the last revaluation in March 1992. The revaluation, one of the 'further setbacks' feared by Mr Uhrig, is likely to cut a further ADollars 600m from Westpac's property portfolio. Westpac shareholders went away from last week's annual meeting less than convinced that the worst is over, but ready to give the new chief executive a chance. Can he deliver? 'Wells Fargo managers are among the best the US has,' says Mr Campbell Chaney, banking analyst at Sutro and Co in San Francisco. 'Several have gone on to clean up other banks, and Joss is equally capable of doing that.' Westpac shareholders will be waiting anxiously to see whether this judgment is correct. If it is not, Mr Uhrig can expect another rough ride at next year's annual meeting.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 2  February analyzing the statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry  spokesman denouncing the United States for `reversing' the  DPRK-U.S. agreement for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue  of the Korean peninsula.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a  1,200-word  article by reporter An Hui-chang, entitled "Background of the  Statement on Reviewing the Withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT." Noting that U.S.-North Korean  nuclear negotiations have entered "a new phase" with North  Korea's publication of a Foreign Ministry statement warning of  its withdrawal from the NPT, the article analyzes the North  Korean position as aimed at "strategic purposes." First, North  Korea wants to promptly secure "substantive fruit" by realizing  working-level contact with the United States, instead of talks  with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, through "a  strong message" to the United States. Describing the  substantive fruit as "attaining limited inspection" in  negotiations with IAEA and suspension of the Team Spirit  exercise, the article reports that North Korea must have judged  that it had better use "strong measures" toward the United  States in a bid to accomplish its goals rather than hoping for  results from negotiations with the IAEA; and that by using such  measures, the United States would eventually "make concessions,"  although initially showing "tough reactions."    The article cites observations of a National Unification  Board, NUB, official that although North Korea is "outwardly"  sternly denouncing the United States, it is maintaining the  position not to destroy "the frame of negotiation" as long as  the United States wants to continue dialogue. Basically, by  releasing the recent statement, North Korea is seeking to  "resume" negotiations with the United States to discuss the IAEA  inspections, the Team Spirit issue, and the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks; and in this way, wants to "secure" its own  practical interest. The paper also notes that North Korea  intends to "consolidate" its internal unity by further creating  "the atmosphere of tension" with the United States.    The liberal TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,300-word  article by reporter Kim Cha-su entitled "'Attempt to Drag on  Time' Aimed at Reducing Inspections." Noting the discussion  between North Korea and IAEA over "the scale of inspection" is  in the final stage, the article observes that by publishing the  statement, North Korea is using "delaying strategy" aimed at  dragging on time in discussions with IAEA because it is not in  the position of accepting IAEA inspections during Kim Chong-il's  birthday on 16 February. North Korea also thinks that if  inspections are conducted before the IAEA Board of Governors  meeting slated for 21 February, "heated discussions" will take  place concerning North Korea's "nuclear development suspicion"  by introducing the results of inspections.    The article observes that North Korea is attempting to  maintain "a favorable position" regarding inspections in  negotiations with the IAEA by expressing its "tough position" so  "the scale of inspections" will be reduced "as much as  possible." The article also points out the possibility that  North Korea and the United States interpreted the promise of  acceptance of IAEA inspections "differently." In other words,  during a 29 December contact in New York, North Korea promised  that it will accept IAEA inspections in such a way as to "ensure  continuity of nuclear safeguard measures." The United States,  however, might have interpreted this as acceptance of  inspections "to the extent demanded by IAEA." This  misinterpretation might have touched off North Korea's "tough  position."    Concerning such various observations, relevant government  officials predict that North Korea's "true intention" will be  revealed during this week in its reply letter to the IAEA on the  scope of inspections put forward by the IAEA, which North Korea  is committed to send "within this week." The article concludes  that the government views that although it is delaying time in  negotiations with IAEA, North Korea will accept inspections by  making "gradual concessions," and thus will not lead the  situation to a "catastrophe."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word  article by reporter Chong Pyong-chin entitled "The Government's  View on North Korean Statement on Withdrawal from NPT."  Regarding the recent North Korean statement as "a message" to  the United States, the article observes that North Korea is  attempting to "upgrade" its position during forthcoming  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks by stressing "the U.S.  violation of promise" as the main reason for deadlocked North  Korean-IAEA negotiations. Explaining differences in assertions  between North Korea and IAEA on the scope of inspections, the  article reports North Korea seems to wish to solve its problems  at talks with the United States, instead of talks with IAEA. The  article observes that there is "no change" in the North Korean  policy to "settle" the negotiation over the nuclear inspections  "in any form" before the IAEA's regular Board of Governors  meeting slated for 21 February. The article refers to some  observations on the ROK and U.S. side that North Korea will  likely allow the IAEA inspection team to visit North Korea  around 16 February -- Kim Chong-il's birthday.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 a  1,200-word article by Yang Sung-hyon analyzing the background of  the statement by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman.    Describing it as "a message to the United States," the  article analyzes that the statement has a long-term objective to  secure an advantageous position in future talks with the United  States by blaming the United States for breaking a promise, thus  causing a stalemate in the negotiations with the IAEA.    The article notes that "North Korea could not easily accept  the IAEA's requirements presented in the fourth contact on 17  January because North Korea had intended to use them as the  conditions for a package deal in the third round talks with the  United States."    The article speculates that the hard-line moves by the  United  States and the ROK, including discounting the meaning of the  suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and the discussion on the  deployment of Patriot missiles, may have stimulated North  Korea's intention to seek a resolution through U.S.-North Korean  contacts again.    The article ends by quoting a government official as saying:  "It will be difficult for North Korea to secure another contact  with the United States" due to the firm U.S. stance to side with  the IAEA.    The independent left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on  page 3 a 1,500-word article by Pak Chong-mun entitled "North  Korea's Nuclear Statement in the Final Stage, Is It a Tactic or  Does the North Mean It?"    Noting that the statement implies a probability that North  Korea may depart from a peaceful resolution of the nuclear  issue, the article reports the Foreign Ministry is gravely  concerned about the aggravation of the situation, although it  tries to appear calm.    The article analyzes that the Foreign Ministry is not  optimistic because: "First, if the statement is interpreted as  North Korea's actual refusal of overall inspection [chonmyon  sachal], the situation is in a deadlock because the United  States and the IAEA cannot make any more concessions. Second,  if the statement is interpreted as aiming at another contact  with the United States for further reduced scope of inspections,  there is still little possibility of settlement because the  United States has no reason to intervene between North Korea and  the IAEA."    The article quotes a Foreign Ministry official as saying:  "It  seems that North Korea began negotiations with the IAEA based on  the optimistic report by the negotiating team with the United  States, which had apparently only reported the advantageous part  of the agreement, but now the IAEA's requirements are facing  strong opposition inside the North."    The article ends by reiterating the threat implied by the  statement to reverse the resolution plan of the nuclear issue.</p>

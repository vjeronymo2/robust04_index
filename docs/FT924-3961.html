			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / GrandMet held to 5% decline by drinks side GRAND METROPOLITAN, the food, drinks and retailing group, yesterday reported a 5.1 per cent decline in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 902m. Strong gains from the IDV drinks division - which accounted for more than half the group's trading profits - were offset by reduced earnings from the Pillsbury and Green Giant food operations. A combination of weak consumer demand, a glut of vegetables, and pricing pressures hit the north American food market in the late summer, causing a sharp downturn in dollar sales. 'However, we believe the worst is now behind us,' said Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive. 'We are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead,' he added. Property and other exceptional items were Pounds 50m lower than last year, contributing to the reduction in taxable profits. Earnings per share declined 7.1 per cent to 30.1p; but a final dividend of 7.7p raises the total payment to 12.2p, an increase of 8.4 per cent. Group trading profit fell 7.6 per cent to Pounds 982m on turnover reduced from Pounds 8.75bn to Pounds 7.9bn. Overall food division profits of Pounds 210m were 16.3 per cent lower on marginally higher turnover of Pounds 2.63bn. The difficulties in the US market cut north American profits from Pounds 213m to Pounds 181m; and European operations recorded a 23.7 per cent fall to Pounds 29m as investment continued in the expansion of Pillsbury and Haagen-Dazs. Drinks profits increased 12 per cent to Pounds 509m on turnover Pounds 430m ahead at Pounds 2.86bn. Volume growth was helped by acquisitions of brands such as Cinzano. Retail trading profits were flat at Pounds 220m. Burger King, with growth of 9 per cent, accounted for Pounds 137m of the total. The Pearle eyecare chain recorded a loss of Pounds 18m, though 'a material improvement' showed in the second half. Profits of Chef &amp; Brewer managed pubs in the UK declined 4.7 per cent to Pounds 101m. GrandMet's share of operating losses in the Inntrepreneur pub joint venture with Courage were Pounds 14m. The group also had to write down Pounds 117m against reserves after a revaluation of Inntrepreneur's estate, and to inject Pounds 32m cash to comply with banking covenants.

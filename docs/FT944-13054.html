			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Power company rejects controls on prices Offer, the electricity regulator, is to ask the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to adjudicate after Scottish Hydro-Electric, the power company, announced yesterday it was not accepting price controls due to take effect next April. It will be the first MMC referral made by Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer director-general. ScottishPower yesterday accepted the price controls and regional power companies in England and Wales have already done so. The referral results from circumstances unique to Hydro. But analysts said yesterday that it could have wider implications. Although it is unlikely that the reviews of the other companies will be re-opened to allow changes, the MMC may look at how Prof Littlechild reached his conclusions throughout the sector. 'There is a danger for him that they will say he got it wrong,' said one analyst. Hydro's share price was steady yesterday, with most investors taking the view that it could gain but was unlikely to lose as a result of a review. The shares are already on the highest yield, and therefore the lowest rating, in the sector. The company said it would continue its policy, effective to the end of this year, of increasing dividends annually by between 6 per cent and 8 per cent in real terms. Hydro said yesterday that its prime concern was that Prof Littlechild's review implied a rate of return for the distribution business which, at 2 per cent, would effectively prevent funding the proper level of maintenance. All other companies in the sector will enjoy a considerably higher rate of return following their reviews, with the regional companies on about 7 per cent and ScottishPower 6 per cent. Mr Roger Young, Hydro's chief executive, said without a change to the price controls his company would not be able to invest in its distribution business. 'If we do not invest then shareholders' assets crumble and the number of power cuts rises,' he said. 'The acceptance of these proposals would place Hydro in an even more difficult position at the next price control review in 1999. The regulatory rules preclude unauthorised cross-subsidy of distribution from other business activities.' Hydro said it expected to be able to continue cutting electricity prices even with 'more appropriate' price controls. It already had among the lowest domestic prices in Britain. The company is also challenging the 'Hydro benefit' system which allows the company to cross-subsidise the transmission and distribution businesses from generation. The MMC reference is likely to take at least six months. Offer said it would hope to announce terms of reference in the next few weeks. Lex, Page 24</p>

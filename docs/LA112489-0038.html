			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: LESS BEEF MEANS LOWER-FAT MEAT PIE  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: Any way to modify this recipe to make it lower in fat? Perhaps the  crust? It's an easy-to-make, very tasty pie I've been making for years. The  only thing I would do is change the ground beef to half sirloin and half ground  turkey.  </P> <P>  -- BONNIE, Palm Harbor, Fla.  </P> <P> ITALIAN MEAT PIE  </P> <P> 1 pound lean ground beef  </P> <P> 1/3 cup chopped green pepper  </P> <P> 3/4 cup water  </P> <P> 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste  </P> <P> 1 (1 1/2-ounce) package spaghetti sauce mix  </P> <P> 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 1 frozen deep-dish pie-crust shell  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese  </P> <P> Brown beef in large skillet. Drain. Add green pepper and cook 2 minutes. Stir  in water, tomato paste and spaghetti sauce mix. Cover and simmer 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Sprinkle 1/2 Parmesan cheese over bottom of frozen pie shell. Spread 1/2 meat  mixture in pie shell. Sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella cheese over meat. Layer  remaining meat and Parmesan cheese.  </P> <P> Place pie on baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees 15 minutes. Sprinkle top with  remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Return to oven until cheese melts, about 5  minutes. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Pie freezes and reheats well.  </P> <P> DEAR BONNIE: There is always a big trade-off when taking advantage of packaged  and processed foods for convenience. In this case, though your pie is indeed  easy and delicious, it is loaded with undesirables that can be greatly reduced  or eliminated completely by using more basic ingredients.  </P> <P> The biggest change you can make in this recipe is to serve smaller portions. I  think it can easily serve six people, especially if you serve it with a fresh  green salad and crusty garlic bread. Also, by reducing the amount of meat and  increasing the vegetables, you can make a healthier finished product without  substantial change in taste, texture or appearance.  </P> <P> I haven't omitted the pie-crust shell in your recipe. However, to really  lighten this meat pie I would suggest you make your own crust -- ahead of time  and freeze it, if necessary -- so you can control the ingredients it contains.  Prepared crusts often list lard as the first ingredient; and since lard is  animal fat, it is highly saturated and contains cholesterol as well.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> LIGHT ITALIAN MEAT PIE  </P> <P> 3/4 pound extra-lean ground beef  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped green pepper  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 3/4 cup water  </P> <P> 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil, crushed  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped dehydrated onion  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon onion powder  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 1 frozen deep-dish pie shell  </P> <P> 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese  </P> <P> Brown beef in large non-stick skillet.

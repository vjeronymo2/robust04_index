			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Hero's welcome as rival Nigeria leader flies in CHIEF Moshood Abiola, victor in Nigeria's annulled presidential elections in June, yesterday flew back to Lagos to a hero's welcome. He was met by a huge crowd of supporters who defied security arrangements aimed at limiting the size of the reception. Thousands of people, many dressed in the green and white colours of his Social Democractic party, lined the roads and cheered the waving Chief Abiola as he was driven the two miles to his home. 'All we are saying is give MKO a chance,' his supporters sang to the tune of the popular John Lennon song, referring to Chief Abiola by his popular nickname. Chief Abiola, who has been abroad since August 3 seeking support after the military annulled an election he believed he won, said he was ready for dialogue to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. 'I am going to struggle with you for the materialisation of the mandate of June 12 for the benefit of our nation and people,' he told supporters. The annulment of the June election plunged Nigeria into its worst crisis since the 1967-70 civil war and still threatens the unity of Africa's most populous nation. While Chief Abiola was abroad the military government handed over power to an unelected interim government. Speaking at his Lagos headquarters, he said that during his travels he received appeals from many Nigerians to ensure peace and the unity and stability of Nigeria. 'Now that I am back. . . I am ready and willing to talk to anyone and encourage any discussion with any group of people as long as such discussion will take place on the basis of justice, fair play and the people's will as expressed on June 12,' he said. 'It is a statement of political fact that all problems can be resolved through dialogue. Indeed, even wars are finally resolved around the conference table,' Mr Abiola said. Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of the interim government, has said his administration was prepared to talk with Mr Abiola to end the political impasse. Despite his warm welcome in Lagos, the heart of his political stronghold, many of Mr Abiola's supporters fear he has missed the boat. A general strike failed to shift the new military-led government from its plans to hold fresh elections next March. Many of Mr Abiola's supporters have also been disappointed by his extended absence, which began when he fled Lagos in his private jet, fearing for his life. He nevertheless has the capacity to revive protest in the south, where his support is considerable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liang Chao: "Customs Crackdown Gets </F> $270M in Goods"]    [Text] Customs anti-contraband personnel seized a record  2.35 billion yuan ($270 million) in smuggled goods in 1993.    Of that, a record 1.78 billion yuan ($204 million) worth of  goods smuggled into the mainland were confiscated by customs  inspectors, China's major anti-smuggling force, said Qian  Guanlin, top official of the General Administration of Customs  (GAC).    The value of the two kinds of contraband were up 78 and 83  per cent over 1992 respectively, Qian said, indicating that  smuggling still remained as a serious threat to the country's  reform.    But, Qian gave no details about where the contraband such as  electrical appliances and cars came from and how many smugglers  were involved in cases uncovered by the GAC and its local  branches.    Yet, a government official who declined to be named said the  problem stemmed from businesses smuggling goods. "The  government was suffering from a stubborn headache last year as  more and more enterprises were found to have been involved in  large-scale smuggling despite harsh crackdowns," the official  said.    Qian pledged that Chinese customs authorities will intensify  the crackdown, beefing up its forces to investigate the biggest  cases.    The GAC is gradually establishing a centralized  anti-smuggling headquarters in charge of special investigations  on such stubborn cases, Qian said.    And, this year, a customs' national internal intelligence  network will be linked with other law-enforcement and  intelligence departments.    Meanwhile, China will further reform customs supervision  this  year by overhauling its external auditing system to follow  international practices.    That means, instead of simply examining imported and  exported  goods at customs' checking ports, supervisors will also pay more  attention to the management and accounts of enterprises engaged  in foreign trade.    It will make imports and exports passing the customs'  supervision more simple, fast and effective, and suit the needs  of China's ongoing economic reform.    Approved by the State Council, China's cabinet, the GAC will  establish and carry out its own auditing system this year.    Accordingly, the customs' current declaration practice will  also be improved by setting up service-oriented customs brokers.    It is expected that these brokers would be built into a kind  of business entities holding responsibility for both customs  authorities and enterprises engaged in foreign trade.</p>

The purpose of the public meeting is to gather information and solicit the views of interested parties regarding issues related to the application of informed consent requirements in clinical research performed in emergency circumstances. Presentations and discussions will address ethical, medical, scientific, regulatory, and legal standards for the conduct of clinical research in emergency circumstances where obtaining the consent of the research subject or the authorized representative is not possible. Here, research in emergency circumstances relates to the testing of experimental therapies for individuals in life threatening circumstances rather than to public health emergencies. Several case studies that illustrate relevant issues will be presented and discussed. Critical elements in the design of clinical trials to test new therapeutic approaches in emergency circumstances also will be discussed. Participants will be provided opportunities to share their views and information regarding protocol design, study conduct, and patient experiences in clinical research in emergency circumstances within current regulatory guidelines.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The public meeting will be held on January 9, 1995, 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and January 10, 1995, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Because seating space is limited, early registration is recommended and pre-registrants will have seating preference.

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEELS COLUMN DRAWS COMMENT  </P> <P> A Your Wheels column on May 4 recommended a method for combating mold in  automobile air conditioners. The process, suggested by an allergist who had  safely used it in the past, involved mixing vinegar and household bleach and  placing the solution in a pan in a car.  </P> <P> Several academic and industry experts have since raised objections to the  procedure, saying it could cause irritation in some individuals. In the worst  case, the experts said, the vinegar-bleach mixture could produce harmful or  irritating fumes.  </P> <P> Alternatives to the procedure will be discussed in a future Your Wheels column.  </P></p>

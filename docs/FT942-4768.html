			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tax and unemployment Sir, With reference to Samuel Brittan's excellent, if slightly technical, article, 'Sad jubilee for a white paper' (Economic Viewpoint, June 2), why not return to an old idea of 'negative income tax' with unemployment support equal to personal allowances and permitted earnings equal to the earned income allowance? The latter could be increased in times of high activity, taking some of the pressure off wage levels and increasing the 'pricing in' premium. It could then be correspondingly reduced when recession threatens. The whole could be simply administered (perhaps too simply to suit the bureaucrats) and would at least partly relate costs to taxation revenue. John A Chudley, Tripoleos 4, Nafplion 21100, Greece</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel: Simple lessons in life-saving - How to survive an air crash What if the plane crashes? It's the unthinkable idea, which - for a moment - invades the minds of many air travellers during take-offs and landings. Most of us shrug it off, counting on fate and the expertise of pilots. But while airline accidents are rare, they do happen. You can increase your chances of surviving by following some simple, common-sense steps. These range from the type of clothing to wear on your trip, to picking the best seat for survival, to how best to walk from a smoke-filled plane. Begin before you leave for the airport. When dressing for the flight, choose clothing made from natural fabrics such as cotton and wool. Artificial fibres, such as those in pantihose, can melt with heat intensity. Women should not wear tight skirts; trousers make climbing out of windows and other exits easier. Loop earrings should be avoided, because they can catch on something during an es-cape. At the airport try to book a seat close to the aisle over the wings, where the exit windows are located. If that is not possible, choose an aisle seat near other exits, such as those near the galleys, along the sides of the aircraft, at the passenger entry door and, in some aircraft, in the tail cone. When boarding, count the rows between your seat and the nearest exit and the number between your seat and an alternative exit. If the lights go out, you can feel your way out. In addition to the general airline safety instructions, some other tips may make you feel more secure. A full bladder could burst upon sudden impact. So your seat belt should be fastened low and tight on the hip bone, rather than across the stomach. Do not cross your legs underneath the seat in front of you. If the aircraft falls to earth in an aborted take-off, the seat of the person in front of you could collapse and break your ankles. The best brace position for emergency landings is to get down as low as you can to protect yourself from fire flashes overhead. Bend over and put your arms under your thighs. Grab your wrists under your legs and look downwards, rather than towards the aisle or windows. In an emergency, knowing how to leave the aircraft is crucial. In the absence of suitable supervisors, if you are next to the over-wing exit take charge of opening it. If the exit and the area outside are clear of flames, face the rear of the aircraft and put the adjacent seat arm rests up. Put your hand nearest the window on its lowest handle. Reach across your chest with your other hand and pull down the handle at the top of the window. Pull the window on to your shoulder, rotate it on to the seat row you have just cleared, and slide it six inches towards the aisle to give yourself and other passengers more room to exit. If you are strong enough, pitch the window out of the exit to create even more room. To exit properly from the galley section of the aircraft, you need to know the make of the aircraft. It is listed on the safety cards. On McDonnell Douglas-made planes, turn the handles on the galley-side exit right to left. With Boeing aircraft, it is left to right. It is likely that if there is a crash, you will be battling against smoke on your way out of the aircraft. Instead of standing up or crawling down the aisle, bend at the waist and walk like Groucho Marx.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> I CANTORI AT PASADENA PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH  </P> <P> Given the limitations of the hall and other technical shortcomings, a concert  by the vocal ensemble I Cantori at Pasadena Presbyterian Church managed to  offer some quality music making. Singing with conviction and insight, the  eight-person mixed chorus presented a large, diverse collection of American  vocal works from the 20th Century, giving intelligent attention to each work.  </P> <P> Five songs by Charles Ives, arranged for the group by conductor and founder  Edward Cansino, yielded the best results. Use of props and other theatrical  elements propelled the humor and flavor of the texts, most of them by Ives  himself.  </P> <P> Overall, the presentations Wednesday night resisted an easy temptation for  corniness, thoughtfully projecting Ives' sophisticated, sometimes eccentric  view of popular Americana. Flutist Lisa Edelstein fittingly supplied a part  originally for fife on the piccolo.  </P> <P> Similarly, a Suite from "Treemonisha" by Scott Joplin became a theatrical  presentation with dancing, sequined skimmers for the men and feather boas for  the women. The toe-tapping, ragtime songs joyfully set the joint a-jumpin'  although at times pianist Lorna Eder and percussionist Timm Boatman had a hard  time synchronizing with the ensemble.  </P> <P> Giving them a different kind of a challenge, two pieces for extended vocal  techniques by Joan La Barbara -- arranged for I Cantori by the composer --  produced varied results. The better of the two, "Time(d) Trials and Unscheduled  Events," cleverly satirizes the running events of the 1984 Olympics, for which  it was written, with pantings, coughs, grunts and groans carefully composed  into a fugue of sorts.  </P> <P> And there was a world premiere, Cansino's eclectic quodlibet "Design." Familiar  vocal pieces throughout history are layered together sometimes cacophonously,  other times with simplicity. A reflective text by Marcel Proust attempts to tie  the piece together, but falls short of giving the work a clear purpose.  </P> <P> Solo efforts included a set of chilling atonal songs by George Rochberg with  mezzo Sondra Stowe spellbindingly bringing out all the grotesque images and  obsessions in short texts by Rochberg's late son.  </P> <P> But the intricacies of George Crumb's "Madrigals, Book II," sung by soprano  Diane Thomas were lost due mostly to the boomy hall, but also a general lack of  energy.

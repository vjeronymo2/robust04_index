			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BP BP's disposal of its remaining interests in Canada through a Canadian securities house highlights how difficult it is to sell assets these days. The proceeds will be paid in instalments over two years. But at least the deal closes a frustrating chapter for BP. It also raises the larger question of what the group might look like when its disposal programme is complete. In broad terms, the balance of the business may not look that different, with upstream oil accounting for roughly two thirds of capital employed and the remaining third devoted to downstream oil and other odds and ends. Exploration will concentrate on the biggest, most profitable fields at the expense of riskier regions, where assets will eventually be sold. The big question concerns the future of the unprofitable chemicals division, which, at Pounds 3bn of annual turnover, is around the same size as the bulk chemicals business of ICI. It is once more under the cost-cutter's knife. If BP decides that its required rate of real growth is not achievable, it may seek outside help by way of an off-balance sheet alliance or joint venture. The attraction of that route is twofold. BP would share the formidable burden of petrochemical investment. It would also flatter its creaking balance sheet by shifting debt off the books. By going for scale, it might also turn the screw on a few other oil companies which share the decades-old delusion that chemicals provide a hedge against the oil industry cycle.</p>

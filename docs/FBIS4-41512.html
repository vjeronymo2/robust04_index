			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with ZVYAZDA on 25 June, Uladzimir  Zamyatalin, secretary to Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw  Kebich, commented on the results of the first round of  presidential elections. In particular, he said: "The prime  minister realizes that there have been no elections since 1990.  He understands the primary motives which guided people during  the presidential elections. The point is that the people voted  not against Kebich but against the current developments in the  Republic." Uladzimir Zamyatalin voiced doubts over fears that  when Lukashenka comes to power he will begin with repressions.    The press secretary refuted rumors that the Kebich team will  attempt to disrupt the second round of elections. He stated  that Kebich and his team have not yet discussed his withdrawal  from the elections.</p>

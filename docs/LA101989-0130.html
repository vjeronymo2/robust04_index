The production team broke for dinner  and then tried to resume shooting, but were thwarted by the power outage.  Production resumed Wednesday.  </P> <P> NBC's San Francisco-based "Midnight Caller" is revamping its production  schedule, which called for outside scenes to be shot in Oakland this week.  Executive Producer Bob Singer said the cast and crew were not hurt and that the  sets were not damaged. But the devasting effects of the earthquake are "going  to slow us down considerably," he said. "We'll have to get together with the  network to discuss scheduling." Singer said the next episode scheduled for  production calls for extensive exterior shooting "so we may have to move on to  something else.  </P> <P> ABC's upcoming Jacqueline Smith series "Christine Cromwell," which is set in  San Francisco had finished shooting scenes in the Bay Area last week. A  production company spokesperson said she did not know when the series, part of  the "ABC Mystery Movie" would return to San Francisco.  </P> <P> NBC was scheduled to broadcast the "Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw from San  Francisco on Wednesday night. "The Today Show's" Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel  will anchor their morning program from San Francisco on Thursday and Friday.  </P></p>

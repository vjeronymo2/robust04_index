			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: StorageTek stock falls on system delay STORAGE Technology's stock was down sharply yesterday when the company for the third time announced delays in the development of its much-anticipated Iceberg data storage system, writes Louise Kehoe. The stock suffered a 30 per cent fall to open at Dollars 22 1/4 on Monday, down from a Dollars 31 3/4 close on Friday. It closed after heavy trading at Dollars 23 5/8 . The company said it expected testing of Iceberg to extend into the second half of 1993 and was planning on only 'limited revenue contribution from the product for the year'. Iceberg installations had been expected to begin in the second quarter of 1992. StorageTek said it was encountering delays due to the complexity of integrating the software and hardware of the Iceberg system.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Pichot-Duclos, director of the Institute </F> for Economic Intelligence Studies and Strategy: "Toward a French  `Economic Intelligence' Model"]    [Text] As we announced in our December 1993 issue,  this article will present a model in the economic intelligence  sector that is desirable for our country.  <H5>  An Unsatisfactory Situation </H5> <H5>  The Facts </H5>   With the collapse of the USSR and the profound change in the  strategic stakes, France, even more than other countries, finds  itself forced to redefine its priorities. In the intelligence  sector, economic and technological concerns are becoming as  important as they are in the military and political sectors. The  time has come to improve the system for the acquisition,  processing, and dissemination of knowledge--a system that is  deemed inefficient. And so the formulation of the economic  intelligence concept comes at just the right time in terms of  meeting the vast and urgent needs of our country in this sector.    An examination of the national apparatus holds few  surprises.  It resembles a railroad map, with all the government  intelligence bodies (ministries, secretariats, departments,  agencies) converging on the central administration in Paris,  while what is missing is transverse communications routes! Thus  we have a perfectly centralized system, one that is designed to  serve the state alone (that is, its function) but lacks internal  flexibility. Most important, it does not have natural channels  to the business sector, even though that is the nurturing medium  in which the life of the whole complex develops.    Another schematic, expanded to include all of the public and  private sources, of which there are many, shows a dispersed  network in which the only strong link is that between the state  and the nationalized enterprises. Each of the other client  categories (territorial collectives, large enterprises, PME  [small- and medium-size businesses]-PMI [small- and medium-size  industries], banks, and trade unions) has very little  communication or poor communication--or none at all--with its  other economic partners.    Thus, one can identify the principal gaps in our system.  There is an absence of state policy on economic intelligence;  global disinterest in the matter on the part of the elected  officials; an almost total failure to exploit the remarkable  resource represented by the French-speaking world; very little  transfer of knowledge from the military-industrial complex to  civilian enterprises; very little use being made of intelligence  by the PME-PMI; total inactivity on the part of the trade  unions, contrary to the practice of their German counterparts;  and heavy foreign domination of the offices of private  consultants who, as everyone realizes, know everything about a  business after an audit.    Considering the matter from the point of view of the  business  sector, for the moment, we see that in the most important  businesses, the economic intelligence function is inadequately  integrated in the strategies of the top management and general  staffs. In the PME-PMI, the problem is most often ignored, or is  not dealt with due, one must assume, to the lack of resources or  the lack of time. The CCI [Chambers of Commerce and Industry],  for their part, are beginning to open up to economic  intelligence, some of them quite dynamically.    Overall, the use made of economic intelligence is limited,  for the most part, to the establishment of centers for  documentation or oversight, the creation or consultation of data  banks, and the organization of industrial safety or security  teams. It is true that these elements, often dealt with very  capably, are indispensable, but they are but a part of the  whole. They are scattered tools the use of which is not  integrated on the basis of a vision of the whole, much less a  collective dynamic. Having made this statement of what is  missing overall, it is useful to look for the causes thereof.  <H5>  The Causes </H5>   An earlier study devoted to intelligence[.sup]1[/]  provided me with an opportunity to express my regret that our  French character is hardly such as to direct us toward  collective effort, nor toward the somewhat strict disciplines  required for the mastery of information. Economic intelligence  is the twin of information--without being identical to it, if  only because of its open nature--"to a sufficient extent" to  justify using the same reason to explain the same effects. At  the outset, there are many cultural characteristics that result  in blockages in the structures, ways of thinking, and behaviors.    Where institutions are concerned, the longstanding trend  toward centralization, the cult of regalian power, the  difficulty of establishing procedures for dialogue--all of these  things are basically opposed to the circulation of information,  which, while it is not handed down the line willingly, does not  move up the line any more easily. Information is power, and it  will therefore be generated with such caution that it may  perhaps be obsolete even before it has served anyone's purposes.  The hierarchic procedures used in government departments for  disseminating information might thus prove counterproductive in  some cases. Moreover, the indispensable rules for protecting  confidentiality constitute obstacles, in a number of cases, such  that the sharing of the wealth contained in information is  impossible. And so it is that overall the norms for classifying  information in the public departments and the private sector,  with all texts being drafted in isolation, constitute a jungle  of prohibitions and procedures rather than a clear and  consistent system adapted to the operational needs imposed by  the new stakes in world economic competition.    The difficulty is even greater if the problem is considered  on the European level. The Europol project designed to combat  the traffic in drugs is coming up against national regulations  that are blocking the creation of a complete central index for  the use of the police and customs authorities in all of the  signatory nations.    Thus, the government departments, which are oriented more  toward the upper levels and toward themselves than downward, or  even toward their neighbors, constitute in themselves the  framework for constraints and major contradictions that are  hindering the establishment of a state economic intelligence  dynamic.    In the majority of the enterprises, the absence of an  economic intelligence background is reflected in numerous ways.  The problems include the intermingling of espionage and open  research (the only realm of interest to us here), the inadequate  mastery of the realities in the war of competition, the  resistance to the compartmentalization of sensitive intelligence  because of the fear of internal repercussions on human  relations, the difficulty of expressing information needs, the  refusal to recognize that useful information has its price, the  limitation of practical use to the single realm of technological  oversight, the lack of awareness of the collective aspect of the  problem on the part of personnel, and a decision-making process  that gives the owner's intuition priority over a rational  analysis of the factors involved. Within the context of the war  of competition, these errors spell eternal doom for those  enterprises--particularly those in the key industrial  sectors--that fail to learn to correct the situation through the  specific integration of economic intelligence, specifically in  their patterns of thinking and their practice.    In the banking sector, which is a pillar of the economy and  the information crossroads, one must mourn the lack of a global  apparatus for collecting and processing information. This is  "each man for himself" elevated to a system that does not work  to the benefit either of the cost price of information or the  adoption of a veritable economic intelligence process. For those  who realize that the banks are fundamentally more patrimonial  than speculative (despite the recent real estate disaster) or  industrial, this attitude comes as no surprise. Unlike the  Anglo-Saxon banks, they hesitate to take risks. They differ from  the German banks in that they reject commitments over the very  long term, as well as the partnership with businesses without  which there can be no veritable industrial policy.[.sup]2[/]  Thus they are more inclined to defend than to attack. In  pursuing this course, they carefully protect their own little  patch, and they have, for example, thus far effectively  contained the Japanese competition in the deposits sector,  thanks to a well-established network and extremely functional  internal organization. Although that is true, their offensive  approach is less well-established. Does the Credit Lyonnais  still remember that at the beginning of this century it had such  an exemplary information system that some Swedish banks sent spy  missions to Paris to learn how it operated? Are our commercial  banks offering our enterprises services as complete and dynamic  as those the German banks routinely provide to their clients?  Didn't the recent disaster in real estate investments cost  vastly more than would have been the case with a reasonable  economic intelligence apparatus involving a minimum of  structures, some resources, a special training plan, and, above  all, a minimum of exchange of information?    Thus, the same cultural causes give rise to the same losses  and inadequacies. Our well-known individualism is naturally  opposed to the sharing of information and to its joint  enrichment. It is indeed true that powerful networks exist, for  example that of the "old boys" who are the products of  prestigious crucibles (the "great schools") and who do  communicate, but mainly among their peers. And the sum of the  private interests does not always coincide with the overall  collective interest. Moreover, our Latin fondness for the spoken  word does not make us paragons of discretion. And in addition to  that, our curiosity is opposed to the application of the  frustrating "need-to-know" rule, which limits access to  information. And then, too, we prefer the appearance of  immediate results to the essential nature of long-term  undertakings. That having been said, self-flagellation is not an  end in itself, and we are not, after all, without certain  weapons for waging the necessary battle--with a view to winning  it, of course.  <H5>  The Planning Laboratory </H5>   The globalization of the economy and the stakes in the  integration of France into the European Community have led the  departments under the prime minister (General Planning Board,  Technological and Industrial Development Service) to reflect on  our industrial capacity to compete and, in particular, with Mr.  Henri Martre presiding, on the subject of "economic intelligence  and strategy in the business sector." For one whole year  (September 1992 to October 1993), therefore, some 50  representatives of all of the participants in economic life  (businesses, social partners, local agents, public authorities,  and members of the European Commission) labored on this new  theme, putting together a very important and original base of  knowledge, as presented in this article. Three working subgroups  studied the following complementary themes: comparative analysis  of the economic intelligence systems throughout the world;  economic intelligence within the enterprise sector; and national  considerations, prospects, and actions.    The first positive consequence of this work was that it  brought together the main agents in economic activities and the  professional users of information, which circumstances (and  compartmentalization) usually keep separate. An evident  synergetic effect favoring a subsequent horizontal  demultiplication of activity (proceeding within networks) could  be noted. A single example illustrates this statement. The work  done revealed that there has usually been a lack of studies  undertaken following commercial failures. As a result, the idea  of looking for the causes of an exemplary failure, such as the  failure to sell a weapons system to a foreign country because a  competing product won out, was born. The study pursued led to  pertinent conclusions that could be used immediately by the  interested parties, the most important being the great  difficulty encountered in using an approach of the economic  intelligence type. The second consequence was the identification  of the main sources of dysfunction, some of which have been  described above. The third consequence was a number of  recommendations that can provide a guide for perfecting a model  of a system adapted to our needs and our culture were inspired.  <H5>  A Possible National Model </H5>   The established importance of cultural factors in economic  intelligence points to the need for a French model. Thus for us,  it is a matter of incorporating the methods tested elsewhere and  deemed transposable, on the basis of what we are and the  nonvariable factors in our general organization, while at the  same time enriching this experience with the many contributions  our natural flexibility will make possible. While it is clearly  understood that business must be at the heart of the desired  system, it must also be noted that today it will be possible to  reach the critical mass needed for the efficiency of the whole  only with the power of the state apparatus. The German and  Japanese examples are explicit in this regard. Our lengthy  experience in mixed state and private sector structures may  prove a decisive trump, if we are able to make the mechanisms  run more smoothly and truly put them in the service of the  enterprises. It is in this way that it should be possible to  find "the most French solution."    In our research, we immediately rejected the Japanese model  based on a collective organization, real estate discipline, and  a desire to dominate that we do not have. We will maintain some  distance, as well, from the Anglo-Saxon model, the liberal  certainties of which are debatable. This will not be easy, for  the majority of our elite personnel have been steeped in this  model, and our training schools are not prepared for such a  development. However, the facts will force them to admit, along  with Christian Harbulot, that "an effective information strategy  today must be built around a national economy dominated by an  objective alliance between the private sector and the public  sector."    With this in mind, it could be noted that the German model  is  of great interest to us. Its power rests, on the one hand--we  saw this earlier--on a synergy realized among businesses, banks,  insurance companies, and the public authority, which includes  both the federal departments (information project-study  department) and the Lander (bodies working to develop  mixed-capital commercial ventures). We have noted that in France  the main poles of economic intelligence have been the  enterprises, the state (central departments and various bodies),  and the territorial collectives. The recommendations as to the  desirable directions to be pursued in the effort to make our  model, properly adapted and efficient, a reality, remain to be  proposed.  <H5>  The Role of the State </H5>   Without in any way taking the place of the enterprises, the  state should play a major role in the prospective path that  concerns us. It should be an institutional role, first, defining  a veritable economic security doctrine, which is the  indispensable framework for the articulation of the various  mechanisms making up the desired intelligence apparatus. The  existing texts were drafted with the prospect of a wartime  economy in mind. They must be adapted to the economic war in the  peacetime in which we are living our daily lives. This means,  first of all, a review of the conditions governing access to the  information in the hands of government departments[.sup]3[/];  a still more refined definition of economic crimes, including  those affecting information; and, finally, a drastic escalation  of the applicable penalties. It is true that the new Penal Code  will not go into effect until March 1994.    A second series of efforts will focus on the mastery of  information, both on the national level, where the complete  cycle should be improved, and on the level of Europe, with a  view, in particular, to the new threats of major economic crime.  A third improvement will involve filling in the prevailing gaps  separating the central and regional administrations and the  private sector. A special effort to make good use of the foreign  trade networks is also needed. Much could be done to make  standard information generally available.[.sup]4[/] On all  levels, the formats for access should be modified in order to  separate the portion of information that is protected from that  which can be disseminated. A veritable commercial logistics  system for information must be created to let the public know of  the existence of studies and reports that are not confidential,  to automate access to them and to organize independent  dissemination. All of this can be entirely profitable, because  information today has its price. Cooperation between government  experts and those in the user enterprises could also be  organized.    The role of the state in providing incentives might involve  sponsoring the development of new careers in the information  field, establishing pilot programs at the nationalized banks to  implement an economic intelligence policy of collective interest  in this professional sector, and encouraging individual and  group undertakings oriented toward the development of economic  intelligence. Thus, without creating additional structures, and  at the same time seeking out new sources of income, the state  could encourage the establishment of a veritable information  project-study system.  <H5>  The Territorial Organizations </H5>   The primary role of the territorial organizations should be  the coordination of activities. Each of these entities (regions,  departments, communes, CRCI [Republican Committee for Trade and  Industry], CCI, and professional associations) have, in fact,  quasi-independent relations with the state and with foreign  countries. One can imagine the duplication, the loss of  information, the blurring of our image abroad, and the bargains  made available to foreign competitors. On the basis of the  observations made in countries as dissimilar as Germany, South  Korea, and Sweden, it appears clear that the key role in the  organization of the circulation of economic information is  played by the regional councils, which have the power and the  financial means, and the chambers of commerce. Situated halfway  between the enterprises and the government departments, they  comprise the privileged level for contact with the PME-PMI. This  explains, for example, why they have given priority to  scientific and technical information (because of the proximity  of the ARIST's,[.sup]5[/]) as well as the protection of  assets (the main concern of the enterprises). On a parallel  basis, the 21 regional chambers and the 162 local chambers of  commerce should, then, make the best possible use of the  potential offered, first by the 25 ARIST's, which employ 150  information experts and 750 assistants distributed among the 25  regional centers, by helping them to develop their activities  and to play a larger role; and then by the 184 economic  information centers, the 25 regional international documentation  centers, the 29 "Euro-infocenters," etc. They could also  identify the relationships among the commercial forces in order  to establish the levels and the intersecting points for the  circulation of information and the improvement of operational  information. They could develop a broad sensitivity to economic  intelligence and training for the designated agents. They could  report on the use of the very numerous national data banks  (Delphes, Telefirm, Firmexport, Perene) and various others, of  which there are scores. They could further develop local  training and commercial English, the inevitable key to the  export sector. The field of desirable and possible actions  available to the regional councils and the chambers of commerce  is thus limitless.  <H5>  The Business Sector </H5>   For the business sector, the base of the economy, the  frequent source of, and the logical terminus for information,  the task involves giving the economic intelligence function the  place it deserves, on an urgent basis. If this is not done, it  will mean bankruptcy or the loss of autonomy. Business  structures must, first of all, explicitly integrate the  intelligence function in general management in which the  dominant information triad ideally includes strategy and two  principal adjuncts. One is "intelligence," which dictates what  one should do as a function of the "prior information" available  on the sector and the competition. Then there is the "logistics"  adjunct, which dictates what one can do with the existing  resources. Strategy then issues its instructions to the  operational agents. We have moved far away from our habitual  civilian and military practices. It is essential that it be  possible, within each enterprise, to identify the director of  "intelligence" as such. His authority will extend to the  "economic intelligence" structure, to the resources, the  procedures, and the training.    The structure should include a department  responsible for sponsoring research, the utilization of the  results, their dissemination, and information  security,[.sup]6[/] as well as cells in the various  departments of the enterprise. One employee will deal with  economic intelligence locally in each of its basic and daily  aspects. Experts will occupy the positions requiring lengthy  training.    Resources are absolutely essential. A budget must  be agreed upon, one sufficient to guarantee the establishment  and activity of networks, the tracking of competition, the  gathering and processing of documents, various equipment,  security, and training.    The procedures used must be precise, diversified,  and adapted to all the activities in professional life--contacts  and travel, conduct in the field, active security, the gathering  of information, accounting, the daily attitude toward internal  and external information, and daily protective procedures.    Training must be simultaneously broad (general  consciousness-raising) and specialized (for the economic  intelligence employees and the experts in utilization and  security), and it must have precise objectives (specific phases).    It is necessary to develop the conviction that economic  intelligence as a new weapon can only be effective in an  enterprise at the price of definitive commitment on the part of  the general management and real support from the personnel, and,  a fortiori, its representatives. Today, the threat of  unemployment is giving powerful impetus to the needed  development of thinking. Also, of course, the concept of  economic intelligence will inevitably contribute to the cohesion  of the enterprise.    Thus a mastery of understanding in the economy should lead  to  a whole spectrum of specific measures designed to produce a  French model, the characteristics of which might be summarized  as follows.    A flexible and well-adapted state structure:  Following the revision of the legislative and regulatory texts  and the establishment of an efficient administrative information  network oriented toward the business sector, specific measures  would allow a collective culture and practice to emerge,  particularly regarding auxiliary activities in the realm of  training and the sponsorship of innovative public and private  projects.    Territorial organizations taking the initiative,  financing projects, and more efficiently coordinating and  demultiplying information, to the direct benefit of businesses.    Banks making more dynamic prospective utilization  of information to the benefit of the client enterprises, which  ask only to become partners.    Simplified enterprises, routinely receiving  information from the government departments and the banks, and  experienced in aggressive and legal economic intelligence  practices.    It is therefore clearly with a view to a collective and  aggressive information culture that all of the protagonists in  our national economic life must unite their efforts. The  tribulations experienced by the SME [European Monetary System]  during the summer and the dispute about GATT have clearly  demonstrated that this national framework is not yet obsolete,  however necessary the search for a homogeneous European complex,  united against the two other continental economic blocs being  established, remains. We, too, can legitimately seek to have an  economic intelligence system adapted to our individual  characteristics and our interests.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The increasingly keen economic competition on the  international level has long since made the productivist logic  of Taylor obsolete. We have proceeded from "produce, first" to  "sell at any price," and this imperative has had as its  corollaries increasingly "harsh" practices, even approaching  criminality. This competitive confrontation has become a complex  phenomenon. With the globalization of the economy, everything is  developing as if the planet had shrunk. The commercial  opportunities are dwindling steadily, and competition is  becoming visible on various levels in the international market.  The business sector thus finds itself at the point where the  tensions and multiple contradictions described in the first part  of this article intersect. Management of this complexity  requires various tools, and economic intelligence is one of  those in the front rank.    Since our country failed to appreciate the dimensions of the  phenomenon in time, we find ourselves faced with the situation  familiar to all of us. The damage done is considerable, and it  has not yet been fully assessed. We note the unemployment, but  not the slow takeover of our best enterprises by foreign  capital--capital that in some cases is not even European. Is  anyone aware that a third of our PME-PMI that have more than 250  employees are no longer French?    Within this critical context, we can no longer afford to  savor the delights and the horrors of Gallic discord. We must  make the cultural leap recommended by Toffler because today  "knowledge is moving to the top of the list of resources," and  it can only be obtained on the basis of "the free flow of  information." And that, in turn, depends on the organization of  information channels. To achieve all this, we must change our  assessment of the world around us and learn to interweave  information and strategy, on the one hand, and innovation and  the assessment of competitive forces, on the other. Only a  collective advance in economic intelligence can enable us to  resolve this new and complex equation.    However, the game is far from lost. What has been our  weakness can become our strength. It has now been established  that only those information systems backed by the power of the  state can achieve critical mass. Our long tradition of ongoing  relations with the establishment gives us a real advantage--for  example, over the American society. Our Latin nature, keen and  curious, intuitive and "Cartesian," predisposes us to  intelligent research and the sensible employment of useful  information. There must be better coordination between these two  phases, just as down the line the distribution of information  must be organized. This latter is the realm in which the  Japanese and the Germans excel.    What we need now is a collective desire, properly adapted  tools, and coordinated undertakings by the practitioners  themselves, operating on functional levels. The state must  introduce some flexibility into its powerful and diversified  machinery. The territorial organizations must play their  intermediary role more effectively. Our banks must draw  inspiration from the German banks. And our enterprises must be  daring! In these times of grave crisis, this national ambition  can only be transformed into a reality through the joint actions  of the citizen--the individual economic operator whose concern  is his job--and the public and private enterprises and  bodies--the collective economic protagonists who are focused on  their tasks or their balance sheets. Let us all remember that  economic intelligence is a state of mind, that it is a matter of  a collective information culture...and that it will reward each  individual information recipient one hundredfold.    Following the end of the Cold War, this is the challenge of  the hour: the mastery of useful information, which is the new  key to power because it makes the adoption of decisions based on  a strategic perspective possible. Let us state it plainly.  Economic intelligence is legitimate, and all advanced countries  make use of it. This will not be easy, but we no longer have a  choice. And then, "where there is a will, there is a way." Let  us boldly take up the challenge that economic intelligence  represents.  Footnotes    1. "Toward an Intelligence Culture," DEFENSE NATIONALE, May  1992.    2. It must be said in their defense that the 1981  nationalizations affected the private banks owned by the  industrial groups in particular, interrupting a process "in the  German fashion" that is well-adapted to economic competition.    3. For example, the protection provided Ministerial  Instruction No. 486 by the notation "limited distribution" is  counterproductive. This useful document should be freely  circulated.    4. The Beatrice customs authorities' data bank, for example,  is not sufficiently well-known.    5. Regional scientific and technical information agencies.    6. There is an academic dispute between the advocates of  autonomous security and those who urge integrated security.  Since the real situations vary infinitely from one business to  the next, the proper solution is that which proves best adapted  locally.</p>

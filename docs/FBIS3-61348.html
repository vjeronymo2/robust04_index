The oblast has actively progressive western rayons  and passively conservative eastern rayons. These specifics  rooted in the historical divisions of the region between various  empires only reinforce the negative trend toward an increase in  the weight of regional candidates which is caused by the  majority electoral system. Consequently in Bukovyna the most  formidable basis might exist for the prediction that candidates  will give in to the temptation of populist promises colored in  keeping with the trends. In addition, it is recalled that during  the previous elections the obkom [oblast committee] nomenklatura  had no trouble in eastern rayons, where kolkhoz chairmen and  Communist Party secretaries "made it" without a hitch, and  committed all its propaganda efforts to the west, to  Kitsmanskiy, Vizhnitskiy, and Zastavnevskiy Rayons. Little has  changed since, except perhaps the fact that the democratic  publications of the region call the eastern Khotinskiy,  Kelmenetskiy, and Sokiryanskiy Rayons only the preserves, and no  longer the strongholds, of communism.    In turn, Chernovtsy enjoys the reputation of a politically  involved city, and even now many observers believe that the most  severe struggle among contenders will break out precisely in the  oblast city. Against this background, rayons in which Moldovans  and Romanians (20 percent of the population of the oblast) are  clustered, especially the recently created Gertsayevskiy Rayon,  stand apart. Politicians are uncertain about the tastes of their  residents. Some recall the December 1991 referendum in which an  overwhelming majority of residents in these rayons voted in  favor of Ukrainian independence. Others are concerned about the  likelihood of the obstruction of elections by these territories,  in which the chauvinistically disposed Eminescu Society  subscribing to the position that "Northern Bukovyna has been  Romanian land since time immemorial" enjoys a certain influence.    Religious factors may also influence the course of the  election race and its result. Bukovyna is an area with  traditionally strong Christian roots. Periodic flareups of the  flame of confrontation between the Kiev and Moscow Patriarchates  of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church may force members of the clergy  to seek support from political entities and, accordingly, give  them concealed support. Out of the three main denominations (the  Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow and Kiev Patriarchates  and the Greek Catholics), the lion's share of parishes (over  300) remain with the first church, with the attendant  consequences. Although the 50 parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox  Church of the Kiev Patriarchate are a quantitatively small  force, one would think it to be sufficient to undermine the  image of any contender.    Contenders themselves in Bukovyna, where almost 20 political  parties, public organizations, and ethnic cultural associations  operate, will represent considerably fewer political centers:  the party of power, the NRU-KUN [People's Rukh of  Ukraine-Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists], the DemPU-URP  [Democratic Party of Ukraine-Ukrainian Republican Party], the  SPU-KPU [Socialist Party of Ukraine-Communist Party of Ukraine],  and the DSU [State Independence of Ukraine].    In the oblast, which is considered both agrarian and  industrial, the party of power is realistically capable of  controlling the votes of the electorate, particularly in rural  areas. The nomenklatura proposes candidates from the power  structure of the oblast--popular people who at one time were  delegated there by the democrats. After all, it is known that  elections establish their own rules of the game. Consequently,  not wishing to become members of any party, these politicians  may, in order not to lose support, face the option of running as  independent candidates but with the blessing of the head of the  local state administration.    In general, the situation on the eve of the election to the  power structures is one of the most piquant in the community of  Bukovyna's democrats--if for no other reason than the top  leaders of regional Rukh, headed by its chairman Hryhoriy  Manchulenko, hold positions in the oblast state administration.  This may be the reason NRU spokesmen have so far been keeping  the assessment of the activities of the local authorities  balanced, thus incurring condemnation by the other wing of the  democrats--the Congress of National-Democratic Forces. There is  even the suspicion that the NRU has entered into an unadvertised  alliance with the party of power.    Meanwhile, through almost all of November the NRU and the  URP-DemPU called on one another to unite for the sake of  opposing the neocommunists in the elections. This resulted in  the establishment of the Zlahoda Committee of Democratic Forces.  However, before it managed to get on its feet, DemPU leader  Taras Kiyak announced, at its oblast conference, the creation of  the Poryadok electoral bloc within Zlahoda. In addition to the  DemPU, the URP, the "greens," the Prosvita Union of Officers,  and farmers who have asked for associate membership in the DemPU  agreed to join Poryadok. Having thus distanced itself from Rukh,  DemPU merely gave the local mass media the occasion to ponder  whether there would be less Zlahoda [accord] with such a  Poryadok [order]. However, it appears that everything blew over;  at any rate, from the outside it appears that Zlahoda has come  to an agreement concerning election strategy and tactics.    Meanwhile, the DSU association and the Communists vigorously  "reached out to the people." In the political array of Bukovyna,  the DSU clearly sympathizes with the URP. Strict discipline and  clear-cut slogans of the DSU, which are attractive to voters,  fit in harmoniously with the objectives of the already mentioned  bloc with the equally expressive name Poryadok. However, DSU  leaders offer assurances that they have no intention at all of  forming a bloc with anyone.    The recently held organizational meeting of the Chernovtsy  city committee of the Communists testifies to their  organizational activities. The "Reds" are clearly in a hurry to  create structures before the election. They are being helped in  this by the publication OBYEKTIVNAYA GAZETA, which is known for  its criminal disrespect for Ukrainian independence and whose  sources of financing are not known. The GAZETA is published and  edited by Volodymyr Dovheshko, who is also the first secretary  of the KPU oblast committee. Unlike the democrats, the comrade  secretary long ago released lists, which his name heads, of  candidates for deputies from the KPU. The KPU does not get along  well with the local Socialists, who are hardly different from  the Communists. That same Dovheshko just recently came from the  ranks of the SPU. However, by all signs mutual relations far  removed from "comradely" have developed between the two  secretaries of the oblast committees of the KPU and SPU  (Kostyantin Kovelchuk is the leader of the Socialists in  Bukovyna). The KPU is openly accusing the SPU of being soft on  all "Bandera's followers." However, it is quite probable that  this is merely a tactical device through which the KPU and the  SPU want to gain a maximum of the votes of the electorate.    In the second 10-day period of December, a "roundtable"  panel  on "The Crisis in Ukraine and Ways To Overcome It" organized by  the New Ukraine association met in Chernovtsy. New Ukrainians  who created a center in local areas the year before last and who  until recently did not make their presence known in any way  suddenly became active. Doctor of Economic Sciences Ihor Shkola,  professor of the University of Chernovtsy and cochairman of the  local center of New Ukraine, said that he had agreed to the  "roundtable" panel on the condition that specific measures for  stabilization in the country will be worked out by it. The New  Ukrainians of Bukovyna have made decentralization of the economy  and the endowment of administrative territories with more  extensive rights the cornerstone of their strategy. Here is why.  In Bukovyna, New Ukraine is actively supported by the directors  of local state enterprises, as well as leading personalities  from the oblast state administration. For his part, Professor  Shkola is one of the active supporters of a free economic zone  whose concept has gone astray in the offices of Kiev but is  quite popular in Bukovyna. Perhaps this idea may only be spoiled  by "Trojan horses"--candidates for deputies from the outside,  mainly from the capital city. According to some reports, the  functionary of the Cabinet of Ministers Buzduhan may become one  of these candidates.    As far as the political associations of entrepreneurs are  concerned, no information is available about them. However,  almost all observers agree that the local business community  will sooner or later articulate its program because even now it  has several brilliant personalities in its ranks. Some of the  entrepreneurs have probably already placed their bets on the  candidates of national-democratic forces. There are reports  about businessmen sounding out the positions of probable  candidates from the party of power.    As far as predictions are concerned, candidates who are  supported by strong, organized groups that have actually been  created already although not proclaimed will win. On the other  hand, candidates enjoying the patronage of the power structure  will have a chance in rural rayons. After that, the democratic  nominees will stand a real chance in Chernovtsy and one or two  rayons of the oblast, whereas in other rayons, candidates of the  party of power or those supported by it will win. However it  will be possible to consider even this outcome of elections  favorable, if it materializes, because the current deputies of  the Supreme Council from Bukovyna which have been dispatched  there by the late CPSU have for a long time now represented  nobody aside from themselves. The move by which the KPU and the  SPU want to get [published item ends in mid-sentence]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JWI: "European Union Calls On Turkey To </F> Respect Human Rights"]    [Text] Brussels, 31 Mar (BELGA) -- Following the arrest  last week in Turkey of six Turkish deputies of Kurdish origin  and the lifting of their immunity, the European Union (EU)  states, in a press release published in Brussels, "that the  right to freely express your ideas is a fundamental liberty for  all, a fortiori for members of Parliament."    The EU points out that "this right also forms the basis for  parliamentary immnunity of representatives elected in democratic  states."    More generally, the EU expresses in this text its "concern"  at the worsening human rights situation in Turkey and states  that "the fight against terrorism must be conducted with full  respect for the law and human rights."    The EU wants to renew its "appeal in favor of a political  solution to the problems posed in south-east Turkey" and is  earnestly requesting the Turkish Government "to honor its  commitments regarding constitutional reforms in the field of  human rights."</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Bankruptcy figure causes gloom THIRD-QUARTER figures on bankruptcy and corporate liquidation offer little prospect for economic recovery, KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, warned yesterday. The number of personal bankruptcies fell 3.7 per cent for the period July to September over the previous quarter to 7,506, but growth in the first three quarters was up 51.5 per cent on the same period last year. Company liquidations dropped 7 per cent to 5,562 between the second and third quarter, compared with 4,670 for the third quarter last year.</p>

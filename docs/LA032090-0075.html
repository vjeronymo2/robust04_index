			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE;  </P> <P> COMMENCEMENT TO RETURN TO CAMPUS  </P> <P> Graduation at Cal State Northridge will return to campus this spring in the  wake of last year's problem-plagued ceremony conducted at the Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> Commencement is scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. May 25 at the stadium, located  on the university's North Campus. Seating will be available for about 20,000  students, parents and other guests, said commencement planner Heidi Levy. Levy  said problems last year -- which included an hours-long traffic jam that  delayed the arrival of participants and guests, including university President  James W. Cleary -- had little to do with the change. "The desire was always to  hold it on campus whenever it could be," Levy said.  </P></p>

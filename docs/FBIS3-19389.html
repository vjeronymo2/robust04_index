Failure by Mr Hurd to prevail would set the stage for  Britain's influence to grow ever more marginal. It is, in fact,  a desperate struggle to preserve what remains of British  sovereignty in an ever-expanding Community.    Since 1987, when Mrs Thatcher signed the Single European Act  which first made it possible for Britain to be out-voted, the  majority of EC decisions have been taken on the basis of  Qualified Majority Voting (QMV).    Major issues -- such as taxation, budgets and foreign policy  -- are still taken by unanimous vote. But lesser decisions,  such as permitted food colourings, maximum working hours, water  quality or the fitting of catalytic converters, are all taken by  QMV, the scope of which was greatly extended by Maastricht.    Each country has a number of votes very approximately  determined by its population, the big countries getting 10  votes, and the smallest, Luxembourg, only two.    To prevent large countries dominating completely, QMV gives  the small countries more votes than their population merited.  So Britain has one vote per 5.6 million people, while Ireland  has one per 1.1 million.    With 12 EC members there are 76 votes. To pass a directive  requires a qualified majority of 54 votes -- 70 percent. So 23  votes constitutes a "blocking minority."    Yesterday's arguments which were suspended last night after  10 hours, arose because the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway  and Sweden, planned for 1995, will raise the total number of  votes to 90. The dispute was where to set the blocking minority.    Everyone except Britain and Spain wants to move it to 27,  thus keeping it at 30 percent, because of a fear that retaining  it at 23, which would be 25 percent of the votes, would lead to  more decisions being deadlocked.    Britain argues holding the blocking minority at 23 is vital  to reverse the erosion of the large countries' voting shares  brought about by the entry of small countries. Raise the  minority to 27, Mr Hurd says, and it becomes possible for  countries with 41 percent of the EC's population to be outvoted.    If that argument were as strong as Mr Hurd claims, France  and  Germany would be behind him. But they are not. It is only the  British who want the EC to slow down: the rest of the Community  believes in pressing ahead.    Mr Hurd's strongest argument is that Westminster may refuse  to ratify the enlargement treaty, which needs to be approved by  all 12 members and the European Parliament if the minority is  raised to 27. However, if Britain holds the minority to 23 the  European parliament might throw it out.    Were Britain to climb down now, the effect on Conservative  morale in the run-up to June's elections would be catastrophic.  At a stroke, Mr Hurd's attempt to draw a line in the sand  against further "deepening" of the EC would be invalidated.    Britain would also set a bad precedent for 1996, when an  inter-government conference is to review the entire  institutional framework of the EC, with a view to letting  eastern Europe countries join the EC over the following 10 years.    As the row wears on, the procedures for incorporating the  four new members are held in limbo. This can hardly endear  their electorates, who have to approve entry by referendum, to  the Brussels way of doing things.    Compromises litter the conference tables in Brussels. Mr  Hurd said yesterday none was acceptable, presumably including a  Spanish one which would set the blocking minority at 27 in  general and at 23 where three countries could muster that  number. None of the other members like Madrid's solution either.</p>

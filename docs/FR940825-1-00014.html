In open spaces of wood framing, firestops may be of approved noncombustible materials or of two-inch lumber installed with tight joints or the equivalent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The integrity of all firestopping and draftstopping materials shall be continuously maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Firestopping shall be installed in the locations specified in section f.11.(a), including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) concealed wall spaces;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) connections between horizontal and vertical spaces;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) concealed spaces between stairway stringers at the top and bottom of the run; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) ceilings and floor openings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Draftstopping shall be installed in ATCTs of Types III and IV construction in locations specified below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Floors. Where ceilings are suspended below solid wood joists or suspended or attached directly to the bottom of open-web wood floor trusses, the space between the ceiling and the floor above shall be divided by draftstopping installed so that horizontal areas do not exceed 1,000 square feet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Draftstopping materials shall not be less than half-inch gypsum board, 3/8-inch plywood or other approved materials adequately supported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Concealed roof spaces shall be provided with draftstopping such that no horizontal area exceeds 3,000 square feet. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Exception:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Draftstopping is not required in a concealed space when ATCTs are equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system, provided that automatic sprinklers are also installed in combustible concealed spaces.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Hazardous Areas. Rooms or Areas designated as hazardous areas shall be separated from the remainder of the ATCT by fire separation assemblies as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Boiler and furnace rooms. Boiler and furnace rooms shall be separated by 1-hour fire resistance rated construction or provided with an automatic fire suppression system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Storage rooms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Storage rooms greater than 50 square feet in area shall be separated by 1-hour fire resistance rated construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Storage rooms greater than 100 square feet in area shall be separated by 2-hour fire resistance rated construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Engine generator rooms shall be separated from the remainder of the ATCT by 2-hour fire resistance rated construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Other Electrical Equipment Rooms. Other electrical equipment rooms shall be separated by 1 hour fire resistance rated construction or provided with an automatic fire suppression system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Connections to Base Buildings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The base building shall be separated from the ATCT by a fire separation assembly with a minimum fire resistance rating equivalent to the rating required of the stair shaft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The exit stairway of an ATCT which is directly connected to a base building, or is connected to a base building by a link, shall be a smokeproof enclosure or pressurized in accordance with this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) ATCTs surrounded by a base building shall have the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. At least one smokeproof or pressurized stairway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. ATCT stairways that discharge into a base building at the level of exit discharge with these considerations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Means of Egress on the level of exit discharge shall be free and unobstructed to the exterior of the building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Entire level of exist discharge is provided with automatic sprinkler protection, and any nonsprinklered areas are separated by fire rated construction equivalent to the rating required for the stair shaft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Smoke detectors shall be provided in all hazardous areas of the base building not separated by fire rated construction equivalent to the rating required for the stairway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Smoke detectors shall be provided on the base building side of openings between the ATCT and the base building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.

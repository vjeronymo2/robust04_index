			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Trade as a means to green ends Sir, I refer to your leader 'Green thoughts and trade policy' (September 1). Trade can be of environmental benefit. But it does not make sense to use this fact to deny the wisdom of trade restrictions to achieve environmental ends. The Montreal Protocol is a classic example of an international instrument which 'entangles' trade and environment policy to achieve its objective. That objective is not to impose developed countries' domestic environmental policies on developing countries. It is to protect the ozone layer for the benefit of all countries. The Multilateral Fund and the technology transfer provisions of the protocol encourage developing countries to accept its terms. Crucially, the protocol also discourages non-participation by means of restrictions on trade in ozone-depleting substances with non-parties. Neither the integration of trade with environment policies nor the provision of compensation by way of funding mechanisms provides complete responses to disputes arising out of the existence of differing environmental standards. What is needed is a more holistic policy approach. We also need to ask what kind of structures would be most effective in settling disputes arising out of different environmental standards. What should be the relationship between law and politics in those structures? Most controversially, what role should they accord to individuals as opposed to states?

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities trade in thin range for third day Wall Street FOR THE third consecutive day US share prices traded in a narrow range yesterday, amid growing uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and equity values, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.45 at 3,404.14, having spent the entire day no more than a few points either side of Friday's close. There was a similar lack of significant movement in other indices, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 0.12 at 413.36 and the Amex composite off 0.73 at 396.43. The Nasdaq composite slipped 3.42 to 582.01. Turnover on the New York SE came to 161m shares. Although last Friday's unexpectedly weak May employment report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates once more to boost economic activity, there was enough uncertainty surrounding monetary policy, and the state of the economic recovery in general, to deter investors from buying stocks in anticipation of a rate reduction. Analysts also cited overnight weakness in foreign equity markets, notably in Tokyo and London, and the lack of a direction from bond prices as other reasons for the market's indecisive tone. Even a multi-billion dollar merger between two big regional energy providers failed to stir the market from its slumbers. Gulf States Utilities advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/4 in turnover of 2.06m shares after the company agreed to a Dollars 2.3bn link-up with Entergy Corp, which eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 27. After a delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side, General Dynamics jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 71 in heavy trading on news that the defence manufacturer will conduct a Dutch auction tender for up to 30 per cent of its stock. Analysts said the company could end up paying as much as Dollars 75 a share for its stock. Trading in Abbott Laboratories was also delayed at the start, and on its resumption the stock plunged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 27 3/4 in turnover of 9.3m shares as investors sold heavily on news that the company had withdrawn its Omniflox antibiotic drug from the market because several patients had suffered serious reactions to the drug. Other medical shares which weakened in the wake of Abbott's decline included Critical Care (already troubled by negative recent press coverage), down Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 42 5/8 , and Baxter International, Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars 36 1/8 . Asarco improved Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 3/8 after Mr Vahid Fahti, an analyst at Kemper Securities, raised his rating on the metals group from 'hold' to 'long-term buy', citing increasing demand for copper, which has pushed the metal's price higher in a tight commodity market. Canada THE Toronto market also closed little changed after a moderate day's trading. The TSE 300 index gained 1.9 at 3,394.5, but declines led advances by 283 to 222 after volume of 20.9m shares valued at CDollars 254.2m. Rio Algom fell CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 15 1/4 . The company said its parent, RTZ Corp, is selling its 51 per cent interest in Rio Algom at CDollars 16.50 a share.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Third of companies 'register pre-tax loss' ABOUT ONE-THIRD of British companies registered a pre-tax loss in 1992, casting doubts on government claims that UK industry had survived the recession with profits at a high level, according to a report from two City institutions. Robert Fleming Securities, a stockbroker, and Risk &amp; Opportunity Intelligence (ROI), an independent corporate analyst, said official figures highlighting robust real rates of return on capital employed and strong non-North Sea gross trading profits 'seriously misrepresent the traumas of . . . the past four years'. Drawing on figures from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, Mr Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming and Mr Niall Fraser of ROI said that 'healthy profits are the preserve of a few thousand firms, while tens of thousands have battled for survival'. Taking 1991 data on 113,600 companies, they said the top 250 UK companies contributed more than 30 per cent and the top 1,600 about 70 per cent of the pre-tax profits earned by British business that year. In an analysis of 16 UK industrial sectors Messrs Warburton and Fleming said 37.6 per cent of all companies registered a pre-tax loss in their 1991 accounts. A further 27.9 per cent reported 'trivial' profits of less than Pounds 50,000. On the strength of provisional data the researchers estimated that at least 33 per cent of British companies reported a pre-tax loss last year. They said that large companies, with annual sales of more than Pounds 50m, had emerged from the recession in a much stronger position. Mr Warburton took issue with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, who recently warned companies not to boost their margins excessively. The quest for high margins was an 'essential process in the rehabilitation of the corporate sector', he said.</p>

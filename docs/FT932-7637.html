			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Computer hackers jailed for 6 months TWO COMPUTER hackers who broke into systems belonging to companies and institutions around the world were imprisoned for six months yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr Neil Woods and Mr Karl Strickland had earlier pleaded guilty to offences under the Computer Misuse Act - legislation introduced in 1990 to outlaw computer hacking. For two years the two men hacked into computers belonging to the investment bank SG Warburg, British Telecommunications, the European Community and Nasa, the US space agency. The court heard that the cost of the damage they caused was conservatively estimated at more than Pounds 123,000. Passing sentence on the men at Southwark Crown Court in London Judge Michael Harris said he fully accepted that their hacking activities were not designed to damage systems, to misuse the information they contained or to make a profit from what they were doing. He told them custodial sentences were appropriate, however, 'to penalise you for what you have done and for the losses caused and to deter others who might be similarly tempted'. Mr Strickland, a Liverpool University research assistant, and Mr Woods, a computer salesman from Oldham, Greater Manchester, both pleaded guilty to conspiring to obtain telegraphic services dishonestly and to engaging in the unauthorised publication of computer information.</p>

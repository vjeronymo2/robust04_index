			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK regulation The stock exchange appears close to breaking the deadlock on the vexed issue of disclosure for market makers. An article in last week's Stock Exchange Quarterly prepares the ground for a relaxation of the existing disclosure rule on large transactions, which requires publication within 90 minutes. If recent history repeats itself, though, the text could yet serve as the basis for a submission to the Office of Fair Trading. Three years after the OFT's last intervention on the matter, the exchange is still trapped between dissatisfied marketmakers and regulators under pressure to get tough on investor protection. Marketmakers argue that the existing rule leaves them open to spoiling tactics from rival firms, since 90 minutes is not long enough to find buyers for a large block of shares. Yet institutional investors have few complaints about liquidity in the London market. Very large transactions are frequent, with the marketmaker given notice to line up customers on the other side of the trade before a deal is struck. That gets round the problem of publication. The danger is that more marketmakers will quit London if trading profits do not improve. Liquidity might then become a problem after all. Looser publication rules might help by generating more big, profitable transactions. But it is hard to believe the impact would be great. Besides, disclosure requirements can hardly be relaxed every time market participants start losing money. The fundamental problem remains too much capital chasing too little business. That should not be tackled by tinkering with marketmakers' privileges at the expense of transparency.</p>

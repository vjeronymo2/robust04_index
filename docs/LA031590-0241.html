			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH URGES BUSINESS AIM AT E. EUROPE;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: PRESIDENT SEES 'GROWTH DIVIDEND' IN WORLD CHANGES. HE URGES  MANUFACTURERS TO USE 'LONG-TERM THINKING' FOR NEW MARKETS.  </P> <P> President Bush called on U.S. manufacturers today to take changes in Eastern  Europe and elsewhere as opportunities to capture new world markets and cash in  on a "growth dividend."  </P> <P> And the President, apparently concerned that American business is too oriented  toward short-term profits, urged corporate executives to return to  old-fashioned values and take a long-term view of business prospects.  </P> <P> "This is a marathon, it isn't a sprint," he told the National Assn. of  Manufacturers.  </P> <P> Although conceding "our economy is not perfect and I don't want to paint an  unrealistic picture," Bush said: "We can't produce the products needed to  capture world markets by focusing on results one quarter at a time.  </P> <P> "We need to return not only to yesterday's values but also yesterday's thinking  -- the 'long-term thinking' and 'investment-in-the-future' way of doing  business," he added.  </P> <P> Citing recent improvements in the U.S. trade deficit, Bush told the  manufacturers that the United States "is once again the world's No. 1  exporter."  </P> <P> But, he said, "We must move aggressively to open markets, not just in Japan but  around the world, and expand our share of global trade."  </P> <P> Noting recent pro-democracy upheavals in Eastern Europe and Central America,  Bush said the "Revolution of '89 marks the triumph not only of free ideas --  but also of free markets. And, when it comes to free markets, America continues  to lead the way."  </P> <P> Bush referred to the "peace dividend" -- the savings on defense spending from  the relaxation of East-West tensions -- when he told his audience that U.S.  industry's resolve will be tested "as the dramatic new changes in the world  produce new challenges in the world market."  </P> <P> "We must prepare now to meet these challenges. My Administration is committed  to an agenda for growth. It is founded upon investing in our future -- and  every sound investment has its yield. America's yield is the growth dividend.  </P> <P> "The growth dividend will provide Americans with jobs and opportunity, higher  living standards and a legacy of prosperity," Bush said.  </P> <P> Even though he told a news conference earlier this week that he was not feuding  with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan over interest-rate policy,  he said, "We need to keep interest rates down."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Shchipanov report under the "News From the Very </F> Top" rubric: "Nothing Has Been Decided Yet"]    [Text] It came to light on 7 January that the Russia's  Choice executive council had made a strategic decision to cut  short the four-sided consultations with the Communists,  Agrarians, and Zhirinovskiy-Liberals on a preliminary  distribution of key positions in the State Duma.    Such a step may look quite symbolic. In fact, Russia's  Choice had previously been accused of being inconsistent: It  had promised "never to shake hands with Zhirinovskiyites," and  then went on and sat down with them at the same table as if  thereby sanctioning the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia as a  component part of the political establishment. In the given  case, however, Russia's Choice expressed a concrete protest  against the attempts by the remaining three parties to bring  coordinated pressure to bear on it while distributing the  positions of Duma committee chairmen. Zhirinovskiy, who had been  refused entry to a number of countries, is modestly soliciting  the position of chairman of the international affairs committee,  while the Communists, in league with the "bearers of the sickle"  -- the Agrarians -- are seeking the positions of heads of the  defense and security committees. As if this were not enough,  Yabloko went and demanded for itself leadership of the budget  committee, which Russia's Choice would have paid any price to  reserve for itself. So it is no accident that Russia's Choice  should decide to make such a tough move.    In the meantime, despite the clear desire of the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord leader, the factions have in fact  managed to agree on an exceptionally "narrow circle" of  contenders for State Duma speaker. Observers believe that  having the two hot bets down the home stretch are: A.  Adamishin, former first deputy foreign minister; and A.  Fedulova, the former "first Young Pioneer" of the land of  Soviets. According to our lights, A. Adamishin confirmed the  other day the seriousness of his parliamentary intentions,  having tendered his resignation from his Foreign Ministry  position. Unlike his boss, Kozyrev, he cannot simultaneously  have his seat in parliament and keep his ministerial seat.  (Incidentally, Adamishin's aides have resolutely declined any  comment about his intentions).    I. Ivanov, Russia's ex-ambassador to Spain, has already  become Kozyrev's new first deputy. Mrs. Fedulova, however,  seems to have some moral edge on the career diplomat. The  election of a woman to the position of speaker would send good  vibrations around this country and the world in addition to  cutting the ground from under the nascent feminist movement in  Russia.</p>

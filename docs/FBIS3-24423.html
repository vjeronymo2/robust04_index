			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with former prime minister and defense minister </F> Vazgen Manukyan by HAYLUR correspondent Artur Dokholyan; date  and place not specified]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]  <H5>  Rule by Triumvirate </H5>   [Manukyan] [Interview begins with answer as published]  [Former national security adviser to the president] Ashot  Manucharyan has always been in the business. Neither his or  [Minister of the Interior] Vano Siradeghyan's press conference  was unexpected. This is the logical continuation of domestic  politics, that is everything that has been done in the country  in the last few years.    When Levon Ter Petrosyan became president, a  triumvirate--which stood out even within the Karabakh  Committee--came to power. The triumvirate is: Levon Ter  Petrosyan, [speaker of the parliament] Babgen Ararktsyan and  Vano Siradeghyan. It appeared that all the conditions existed to  unite the people and to implement a state and national policy,  but that did not happen. On the contrary, everything was done to  divide the people and to prevent the presence of any independent  individuals or forces in the country. Meanwhile a wave of  gossips spread, and mutual accusations, justified or not, began  to be leveled.    Had that triumvirate chosen to pursue national goals, it  would have taken a different posture. But apparently its main  goal became to retain power at any cost. Generally, when a group  wants to retain power without an ideology it tries to mislead  the people to prevent it from uniting and usually relies on  armed force to do that. In order to accomplish that it is  necessary to give an incentive to the armed force so that it  becomes dependent on and associated with the government. To that  end the armed force is generally given the right to "plunder"  (are the quotation marks necessary?) the people. In such  circumstances, any change of government not only means material  losses for such a force but also becomes a question of life and  death, because it has allowed itself that which will never be  forgiven. In Armenia, the police became that force. From this  standpoint, I sometimes think that another nation has come and  conquered our state and our people. Sometimes I think that I am  living in the days of Mongol rule.    Thus what is happening in the country today can be explained  from this standpoint. Siradeghyan's press conference was one of  the steps of that policy. Perhaps it was not a very successful  step, perhaps it could have been taken more subtly as was done  in the past, but nevertheless the step has been taken.  Ironically, I see a positive point in all this. This may become  the last straw which may help or force the public to see or to  take an interest in what is happening in the government's  kitchen, to open up that kitchen and to lead to a certain amount  of housecleaning. This must not be done in the streets and at  the level of gossiping. It would be appropriate to create a  multiparty commission of the Supreme Council that includes  representatives from public organizations and worker unions from  enterprises. [passage omitted]    [HAYLUR] It has been said that this confrontation between  the  two branches of government is so dangerous that it may lead to  civil war. What do you think?    [Manukyan] First, I do not see a confrontation between two  branches of government, because even in the "good days" Ashot  Manucharyan was part of the second level of government even  though he had many levers of power in his hand as part of his  responsibilities. I repeat, it is the triumvirate that is the  government. Manucharyan is an individual who stood with the  government, and now he is outside it.    As for the prospect of a civil war, I do not see any such  danger. We, the Armenian nation, are different from our  neighbors.    [HAYLUR] Then, in your opinion, what course may these events  take?    [Manukyan] It is hard to say. In any event, if the  commission  I proposed is created and these issues are examined in a normal  manner, many things will surface. We will learn the kind of  government we have and what type of government we want to have.  Also, the people will be able to participate in politics to some  extent.    In the last few years, Armenia did not have real political  rivalry. Rather there was a practice of gossiping and mutual  attacks. From that standpoint, we may come out of all this  cleaner and ensure that political rivalry is waged not through  gossips or by misleading the people but through extensive  debates over serious political and economic issues.    [HAYLUR] Vano Siradeghyan said during his press conference  that there were no disagreements between you and Levon Ter  Petrosyan. He said that it was the "komsomol" wing of the  Karabakh Committee, led by Ashot Manucharyan, that worked to  create such disagreements.    [Manukyan] Of course we had disagreements, and it is  ridiculous to think that it was Ashot Manucharyan who created  them. We did have several disagreements but that is the subject  of a separate discussion. It is not proper to mix everything  together.    Let me say that from the time of the Karabakh Committee and  after we became a government I engaged in debates with Ashot  Manucharyan continually. He and I argued more than anyone else  in the National Security Council. However, those were all  debates of a political nature.    [HAYLUR] You have accused the government of pursuing an  antinational policy. You said that the said triumvirate stood  out even in the Karabakh Committee, that is, even in the  Armenian Pannational Movement [APM]. You were also a member of  that Committee. Then you became prime minister and later defense  minister and controlled certain levers of power. What did you do  to prevent the said triumvirate from pursuing an antinational  policy?    [Manukyan] At the beginning they probably got together out  of  friendship. During the time I was prime minister, they became a  political force which gained control of a powerful political  machine, the APM. I must say that they had to mislead certain  members of the APM to achieve that. Not all of APM was aware of  that ploy.    The office of prime minister was quite burdensome,  especially  since we were not prepared to become a government. Of course  there was a general program of independence, democratization and  privatization, but, except for these approaches that specified  general directions, there were no detailed programs. Also we had  a serious problem of cadres. We had to cope with Armenia's  economy in those conditions. That took all of my time, leaving  me no opportunity to focus on the internal politics of the APM.  <H5>  National Policy </H5>   [HAYLUR] How would you define or describe what you call  "national policy"? How do you see the resolution of the Karabakh  problem?    [Manukyan] For many, the word "national" has a mystical  meaning and appears to be a complex phenomenon. In reality,  national policy is a very simple concept. For example, the  conclusion of the Karabakh war is closely tied with the fate of  our people. I think that if we lose Karabakh we lose, as a  nation, something much bigger and more important than a few  thousand square kilometers of land.    Of course it is Karabakh that is at war, but what type of  Armenia stands beside it has a very big significance. This war  should have been transformed into a pannational war. Indeed, it  was like that. You recall how the entire nation wanted to help  and contribute to that liberation struggle. But everything was  done to ensure that the people stand aside. This is not how one  runs a national liberation struggle. Transforming that struggle  into a pannational struggle is a truly national objective.  Novice government officials think that they can solve this or  that problem only by state means and that there is no need to  incorporate the people in policymaking. [passage omitted]    When the president of the republic tells the people that  this  situation will last for many decades, he is once again pursuing  an antinational policy. In addition, I do not agree with what he  says. Also, I do not know any leader of any country who allows  himself to say something so cynical to his people--especially  when that does not correspond to the truth and when the only  purpose of saying such a thing is to justify and to consolidate  his own rule.    [HAYLUR] During his press conference Ashot Manucharyan urged  the creation of a government of conciliation and described it as  a coalition of parties, organizations and individuals around a  prime minister. What do you think about this issue?    [Manukyan] I do not find the present structure of  government,  in which the president appoints the prime minister and all the  ministers, very meaningful. During the time Khosrov Harutyunyan  was prime minister, we had an absurd situation: the prime  minister did not agree with the government program. When this  issue was being discussed in the National Security Council, my  position was that such contradictions may arise again if the  government is not formed by the prime minister, does not consist  of a group of people who agree on a common policy and is made up  of people who are appointed by the president even though they  have different economic and political views. I proposed to the  president that, in the future, he submit his candidate for prime  minister to the Supreme Council for its approval. In that event  the Supreme Council would be more participatory and more  responsible. Then let the prime minister appoint the ministers.  I stated that the president has ample powers even without that  authority, and that this concession would only help his work.  But the president did not agree. This is the first point.    About the issue of a coalition government: the president of  the republic is always formally correct on these issues. For  example, in a recent Supreme Council session he said that if 123  deputies vote for a bill, it means nothing for him, but if 124  vote for it then it is a law. From a standpoint of fairness this  is wrong. The leader of a state that is not fully established  must be much more careful in expressing such opinions (how many  voters are there behind 123 deputies?). In other words, this  issue cannot be treated like chess with its indisputable and  immutable rules.    In France, which has a government structure somewhat similar  to ours, various mechanisms as well as financial, economic and  political bodies have been created over many years. If the game  is played by those rules then it is meaningful. In our  conditions, when everything is being created from scratch, a  group of individuals who have risen to power can exploit the  situation in the absence of other mechanisms and keep the power  in their hands for decades to come. But if that group has a  national mentality it must help the creation of those  mechanisms. The president of the republic must see even the  development of opposition parties as one of his own objectives.  That is how high the president of a newly created state must  stand, instead of doing everything he can to block and break the  development of mechanisms opposing him.    [HAYLUR] Let us generalize and summarize.    [Manukyan] I am most distressed by the fact that our nation  appears to have lost its self-confidence and its faith in its  own strength. People are leaving this country; they do not  believe in the future of this state. I think that we can come  out of this situation. We do not need decades for that; we can  do it in a very short time. It is possible to achieve peace  without giving away Karabakh and to develop the economy.  [passage omitted]    [HAYLUR] To do that it is necessary to have a government  that  pursues national objectives. Do you think that the present  government is capable of doing that? If not, what is your  assessment of the idea of a coalition government which has been  proposed by the opposition?    [Manukyan] I think that this government cannot realize those  goals, because the people no longer trust it. We already  discussed the term "national": it means thinking about the  people and the state, uniting the Diaspora and the entire  Armenian nation.    As for the idea of a coalition government, formally it is  possible to bring together those parties in the Supreme Council  whose votes add up to just over half of the total and thus to  form a government. But in our conditions we cannot pursue that  path. It would be more natural if the leadership brought  together representatives of different parties in the government,  regardless of the number of votes they have in the parliament,  so that everyone becomes responsible for what is done. I think  that the time has come to elect a new parliament. We are slowly  moving toward the practices that determine the internal life of  a state. In these conditions government leaders are required to  engage in nonstandard thinking.    The people in the most senior positions today did not rise  to  those offices with such practices. It would be very dangerous if  their posture encourages the formation of a movement that  attempts to change the government by the same methods [that they  they used]. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Arts: Russia comes to Israel - Theatre A curious regathering of the clans is taking place in the Israeli theatre. Of the 400,000 or so Soviet immigrants to the country since the end of 1989, several hundred are actors and some of them, like Irina Selsiniova, the actress who left the Mali Theatre in Leningrad, would be stars the world over, in any language. They want to stay in Israel, learn Hebrew and go on acting. In general, Israeli reactions to the Russian influx are mixed. The immigrants create short-term problems, such as how they can be housed and fitted into the labour market. In the longer term, however, the influx should be the most dynamic peaceful development in the country for decades. Here are, for the most part, well-educated people who are prepared to work and wish to settle. So it is in the theatre. The curiosity is that there has been a Russian liaison before. In the old Hebrew culture, theatre did not exist. The first Hebrew theatre was founded in Moscow in 1917 under the guidance of Stanislavsky and played initially in Russian. It has been a voyage of discovery ever since, and while the word from the professionals is that in the last five years the theatre in Israel has been going through a dull patch, the arrival of the Russians is already producing new waves. Take just one example. A new company has been formed called the Gesher Theatre (Gesher means bridge). It has been to New York with a production of Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead in a version translated into Russian by Joseph Brodsky. I saw it in a small improvised hall in Tel Aviv. It is electric and one can see immediately why dissident Russians so admired the play. The man who plays Claudius looks as if he has stepped straight out of the old Politburo: Polonius is pure apparatchik - none of the old buffer of English performances; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are the informers so familiar in a communist society. Yet the Gesher Theatre is not stopping there. Its members are busy learning Hebrew several hours a day. Russian, on the other hand, will become the second language of the theatre in Israel. English is far behind, except in translation. Here again is a curious fact: nearly half of Shakespeare's plays have never been translated into Hebrew. The tragedies go down well - Hamlet is for all countries - but the comedies tend to be regarded as artificial and the history plays are irrelevant. None of the Henrys, I was told by Gary Bilu, the principle of the Beit Zvi School of Stage and Cinematic Art, has ever been put into Hebrew. Yet his own school is commissioning and performing Hebrew texts of virtually any modern English play you can find. We dropped in at a student rehearsal of Charlotte Keatley's My Mother Said I Never Should. Bilu said that his school is British-oriented and its principles based on RADA; what he wants to see, however, is practically the entire theatrical canon available in Hebrew. There is an absence of translations from Spanish. The Greek classics have been translated, but seldom performed. A forthcoming production of Oedipus at the Municipal Theatre in Haifa - one of Israel's top three venues - is regarded as important by its director because it will show how different Greek drama was. Thus the voyage of discovery continues, yet it would be strong to say that the indigenous theatre has gone to sleep. The fashionable view is that since the outbreak of the intifada on the west bank in 1987, Israeli dramatists have been practising a kind of self-censorship and have withdrawn from political theatre. That was probably true as the shock of the uprising sank in. Two recent productions, however, suggest a reawakening. The first is Ya'ir by Danny Horowitz at the Haifa Municipal. This is the story of Avraham Stern, the terrorist or freedom fighter who decided it was legitimate to seek an alliance with the Germans in the fight against the British. Stern was killed by the British in 1942 in circumstances that have never been wholly explained. Horowitz is a left-wing playwright and initially it was thought odd that he should take on such a subject. Stern emerges as rather a romantic figure, which indeed, with his academic background, he was. His widow gradually agreed to co-operate with the play and has been attending performances. As a production it is a trifle static, but it plainly breaks new ground. Horowitz says that he would like to go on to re-examine other parts of recent Israeli history. That is exactly what happens in Yehu at the Habimah National Theatre in Tel Aviv. Gilad Evron's central character is taken from the Book of Kings - Yehu is a tyrant par excellence who has 70 members of the royal family beheaded. The theme, however, is unmistakeably modern. It is that power corrupts today, just as it always has. No one seeing Yehu could fail to think of Israeli extremism run mad: it is also magnificently performed, notably a chilling mutual suicide scene. Perhaps the most interesting production is yet to come, and again it is a case of bringing different cultures together. Next year there will be a production of Romeo and Juliet by the Jerusalem Wall with the Montagues played by Arabs in Arabic and the Capulets by Israelis in Hebrew. Traditional Islam, like traditional Hebrew, never had much room for theatre, but some of the Arabs are beginning to play a role. A mixture of Arab and Hebrew has already been tried successfully in Waiting for Godot. As in the Market Theatre in Johannesburg a few years ago, drama has a healing as well as a disturbing influence.</p>

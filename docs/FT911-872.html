			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Foreign banks attack inaction on council swaps FOREIGN BANKS operating in the UK yesterday launched a strong attack on the government for its decision not to act over the local-authority swaps affair. In a sharply worded statement, the Foreign Banks and Securities Houses Association said the decision was 'appalling and represents the worst possible outcome for the UK and the international banking community'. It went on to question whether the City of London remained 'a fit and proper market place for international financial activities'. The association represents 175 mainly European banks, and some of its members are among the 80 banks that stand to lose up to Pounds 550m from the decision. The statement said the local-authority swaps market had been operating for more than eight years before the authorities questioned it. The foreign banks said: 'In our opinion the authorities should not have allowed such a substantial market to have become established and then turn round and 'erase' it as if it never existed.' The banks said that the decision meant there was now political risk in dealing with UK bodies. The affair was causing 'immense concern' to foreign regulators, and would benefit only financial centres that competed with London. On Tuesday, Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, decided not to seek retroactive legislation to validate swaps by local authorities that the Law Lords ruled were illegal. Mr Ben Brittain, chairman of the FBSHA, said: 'I would hesitate to say that my members have been deeply scarred financially by this, but we are deeply concerned about the principle.' The British Bankers Association is expected to make a statement today denying allegations by the government that banks were lax in checking out the legal status of local-authority swaps.

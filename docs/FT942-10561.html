			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds Having failed to tighten monetary policy yesterday, the Federal Reserve has little leeway before the end of the week. Barring a rate increase first thing today, it could not act without disrupting the Treasury's Dollars 29bn bond market refunding operation which takes place over the next two days. Concern about the impact on the bond market of another rate increase may have held up any move yesterday, but the Fed is between a rock and a hard place. If the dollar falls because the authorities have done nothing to back up last week's intervention, the bond market will probably weaken anyway. Indeed, the nervousness of both currency and bond markets argues increasingly for a substantial tightening when it finally happens. At current yields, US bonds offer fundamental value, but overseas investors are reluctant to jump in because of the Fed's gradualist approach. Only when the tightening process is perceived to be complete are overseas buyers likely to return in force. The resulting capital inflow might help the dollar too.</p>

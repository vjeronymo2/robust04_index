			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LAST PRINCE CHARLES;  </P> <P> BONNIE PRINCE CHARLIE BY CAROLLY ERICKSON (WILLIAM MORROW: $19.95; 348 PP.)  </P> <P> Under the wicked King Miraz, the children of C. S. Lewis' Narnia were forced to  learn their history from books as false as the most exciting novels and as dull  as the most exacting scholarship. Carolly Erickson has not quite written a book  that only King Miraz would love, but she has come dangerously close. "Bonnie  Prince Charlie" strips the Bonnie Prince of any romantic appeal that clings to  the last serious Stuart claimant to the British throne -- but leaves us without  an understanding either of Bonnie Prince Charlie as a man, or of the historical  forces that doomed the Stuart heir to a futile life on the fringes of  18th-Century European affairs.  </P> <P> Like many of his ill-fated ancestors, Charles was at his best in moments of  picturesque danger. After the defeat of his ill-starred attempt to invade  England and reclaim the throne in 1745, he wandered in the Scottish wilds for  months, sometimes dressed as a servant, sometimes as a woman, sleeping in the  open field and waiting for the ship that would take him back to France. At one  juncture, he was rescued by Flora MacDonald, a romantic Scot who later said  that she would have done as much for Charles' Hanoverian rival if he had needed  it, and who fled from America after siding with the Tories during our  Revolution. This is the moment that made Charles famous throughout Europe, and  this is the moment that made him a sentimental favorite of posterity.  </P> <P> Misfortune usually brought out the best in the Stuarts. Mary Queen of Scots and  Charles I faced the headman's ax with equanimity; even the indolent Charles II  managed to hide, very nobly and romantically, from pursuers in the branches of  an oak. But long life was the bane of the family. James I was a truly  undistinguished king best remembered for a bad book on witchcraft and the  imprisonment and execution of Sir Walter Raleigh. Charles I drove Parliament to  rebel; Charles II was in the pay of England's deadliest enemy, Louis XIV; James  II appalled even English Catholics by his ill-considered, illegal efforts to  impose an unpopular religion on his Protestant subjects. Bonnie Prince Charlie,  for his part, matured into a drunken, woman-beating lout.  </P> <P> We can only admire the Stuarts at a distance, or in their brief heroic moments.  The more we know about them, the less patient with, and the less interested we  are in them. To read a biography on such people is to lose sympathy, and  usually interest, in the central figure: a daunting problem for popular  biographers. The problem is worse in the case of Bonnie Prince Charlie; his  royal ancestors lived at the center of power and fashion; the poor Pretender  eked out a miserable existence at the margin.  </P> <P> The sources for Charles' life are also unsatisfactory. He wrote short and  impersonal letters, and the documents we have concerning him are generally the  reports of ambassadors and spies. We know what color shirt and what color  stockings he wore to dinner; we do not know what he thought or felt. Where  Erickson tries to supplement the scarcity of historical records with  psychological speculation, the results are unsatisfactory and thin. She tells  us many facts about Charles, but does not help us either pity or admire him.  </P> <P> The sad truth is that Bonnie Prince Charlie is not worth the whole book; if  Erickson was determined to write about him, she ought to have broadened her  focus, and looked at the whole Jacobite movement. Absence made the heart grow  fonder: There were many in England and Scotland who revered the Pretenders as  the rightful kings, and Jacobitism long held a romantic fascination for some of  the best minds in Britain. Where the power of Jacobitism lay, and why Charles  was never able to harness it, would make a valuable and fascinating work of  popular history.  </P> <P> It would also have corrected this book's chief defect: its murky picture of the  political context of Charles' life. The reader who starts out knowing little  about English politics in the period will learn little here; the reader who  knows more will be put off by a careless tendency to represent the struggle as  a personal one between the Stuart Pretender and the indolently porcine  Hanoverians.  </P> <P> The ideal reader for this book is someone who wishes to write a romance novel  loosely based on Bonnie Prince Charlie; such a reader will find a wealth of  detail and information here and, lacking Erickson's obligations to the historic  record, can freely re-create the dashing Charlie of legend. The rest of us will  do better to stick to older sources. Macaulay's masterful, if malicious,  "History of England" explains why the Stuarts lost their throne; Thackeray's  brilliant novel, "Henry Esmond," explains why they could never regain it. These  two books, one a frankly partisan attack and the other a historical novel,  bring the reader closer to the spirit of the age of that era than Erickson  does, for all her historical scruples and careful research.  </P></p>

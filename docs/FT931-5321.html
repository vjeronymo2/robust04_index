			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Letter: Whining and dining with the food-loving Belgians Sir, I was sorry to see that Jancis Robinson ('Baffling Belgians in the course of a meal', Weekend, February 20/21) has been left with the indelible impression that all Belgians behave as if we're more Catholic than the Pope in matters gastronomic. We restaurateurs certainly have to hack our share of old fogeys here, and it sounds as if Ms Robinson met most of them on her truffle, foie-gras and wine-tasting binge in Leuven. What bad luck some of them even took it upon themselves to pursue her to London. I'm sorry to say some members of the Belgian foodie press take themselves more seriously than we do. It's a shame they're more impressed with ritual than content. Few have expertise to rival that of the FT's resident Master of Wine. As president of Belgium's Association of Professional Sommeliers, raised in the business, I agree we take food and wine extremely seriously here. That's why many of us are dedicated to innovation on all fronts. We like trying out the best from nowhere and elsewhere, and we do not vet our guests to check if they're worthy of our services. I personally stock over three dozen new world wines, and Ms Robinson is welcome to try any or all of them with her soup any time. It's easier to get a good, well-priced, attractive meal without stifling ceremony in Brussels than in London or Paris. Even the very best in the country wouldn't intimidate or bankrupt a young couple once in a while. Ms Robinson should come to Belgium again. Next time, she should find out what's going on in the street and keep out of high temples of gastronomy where it's still heresy to drink wine for fun and have a good time.

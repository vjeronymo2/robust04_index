			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: South Africa in Gulf trade link KANOO, one of the Gulf's leading trade and shipping groups, yesterday signed a groundbreaking agreement in Bahrain with Omega Investment, a South African business consultancy, to encourage direct trade and investment between the republic and the Gulf - signalling a shift away from the Gulf states' enforcement of trade sanctions against Pretoria. Both sides said they hoped the agreement would marry the Gulf states' hunger for investment in high-technology manufacturing to South Africa's desire to formalise overt trade ties with Middle Eastern countries. Trade has previously been handled essentially through third parties. Kanoo will act as Omega's sponsor in Bahrain but, according to Mr Michael Parsons, general manager, will try to promote links between a range of Gulf and South African companies. The agreement's first fruit will be mutual trade and investment missions between Bahrain and the republic. The deal is the first formal attempt to improve trade links between the two regions, but caps growing interest from Bahrain in cultivating links with South Africa. Gulf Air, the Bahrain-based Gulf airline, has in the past year begun flights to Johannesburg, while Flight Star, a South African charter airline, has won reciprocal rights to fly into Manama. Mr Denis Worrall, director general of Omega and former South African ambassador to Britain, said businessmen travelling with him on a 12-day visit to Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Bahrain were encouraged by opportunities in retailing, air conditioning manufacture and food processing. Petrochemical exports are sure to dominate any expanded trade.</p>

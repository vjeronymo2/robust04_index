			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sanaa, May 12 (AFP)--Northern forces in Yemen's  civil war claimed Wednesday to have captured a mechanised  brigade belonging to the south as southern leader 'Ali Salim  al-Bid demanded northern forces withdraw before a ceasefire.    A northern military statement published here said northern  forces had captured all the tanks and artillery of the pro-south  25th mechanised brigade based at Haraz.    An unspecified number of the 1,200 soldiers had surrendered  to the northern side, according to the statement published by  the SABA' news agency here.    Southern leaders told AFP Wednesday that the north was  attempting to open up a new front in the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb  region to the west of the main southern town of Aden.    A statement published in Sanaa said northern forces  inflicted  "heavy losses" on southern troops in the al-'Anad and al-Hutah  areas 50 kilometres (30 miles) north of Aden.    The northerners were "moving towards their objectives" in  the  al- Dali' sector.    In the Abyan province, east of Aden, southern forces had  attempted to launch a counter-offensive but had been "forced to  beat a retreat," the statement said.    At Abyan, a southern spokesman said their forces were  concentrating their attacks on northern pockets in the Zinjibar  region, on the coast and in Ja'ar and Bakis to the east.    Al-Bid, stripped of the office of vice-president by the  northern- dominated parliament last week, said a ceasefire was  dependent on a withdrawal of northern forces from the southern  part of the country.    "The return of forces to their positions (before the north  and south were united in 1990) is an important condition for the  end of fighting," al-Bid, looking relaxed and smiling, told  reporters at his home overlooking Aden.    "There are no longer southern forces in the north after they  were destroyed" by troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, al-Bid said.    He said the war had been "imposed by the dictator 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and the family" of parliamentary speaker Shaykh  'Abdallah al- Ahmar.    "We did not start the war. It was forced on us. And we  continue to resist the invasion forces. We will not allow the  al-'Amaliqah (northern) forces to progress one inch towards  Aden," he said.    Al-Bid said "to date there is no sign of a political  dialogue  or mediation," with Salih and ruled out a meeting with the  northern leader.    "We sat together with Salih to agree on unity (in 1990) but  after the blow he has struck we cannot sit around the same  table," he said.    The civil war in Yemen has pitched the socialist south, led  by al-Bid, against the conservative Islamic north, four years  after the two were united.    Yemeni Muslim fundamentalists "are in league with  fundamentalists abroad who are attempting to prevent the Arab  nation from getting into the 21st century," al-Bid said  Wednesday.

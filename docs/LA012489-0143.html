			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 14 REBELS SURRENDER IN ARGENTINA  </P> <P> Fourteen civilian commandos surrendered this morning after holding off hundreds  of tank- and artillery-backed soldiers and police at an army base for a day,  the Argentine government news agency said.  </P> <P> At least 25 people were killed in fighting after about 40 commandos, who the  government said were leftist guerrillas, broke through the base's main gate in  a stolen truck early Monday, authorities said. The state-run Telam news agency  said 13 men and one woman walked out of the base early this morning, their  hands in the air and one waving a white shirt as a flag of surrender. Sporadic  shots and mortar rounds were heard for about an hour afterward, but two hours  later all was silent.  </P></p>

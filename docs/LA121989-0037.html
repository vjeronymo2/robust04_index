			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> PARK PERILS SPARK EMPLOYEE PETITION  </P> <P> Gardeners and other city workers who tend San Francisco's Golden Gate Park say  crime and filth make their jobs dangerous, and they are seeking a crackdown on  transients. Park workers -- who have drawn up a petition asking for strict  enforcement of park rules, especially those against camping -- say they often  find drug paraphernalia, feces and bloody clothing. They also say transients  threaten them. "I just pruned and found three needles. You've got to have eyes  behind your head. You always walk around with something in your hand," said one  gardener who declined to give her name. The petition, which will be sent to  Cal/OSHA, the job safety agency, was drafted with a new neighborhood group,  Committee of Concerned Park Neighbors. In one of nearly 30 statements also  being submitted, area resident William Rothrum wrote: "The entire east end is  effectively blocked from family use because of the degree of filth and crime  being tolerated by the city authorities." Parks Commission President Keith  Eichman said the Recreation and Parks Department does not have control over who  can enter the park.  </P></p>

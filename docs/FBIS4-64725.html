			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Following UN Cyprus envoy Joe Clark's  failure to overcome a deadlock in talks on confidence building  measures, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas sent a letter to  Clark, reminding him of "facts of the Cyprus question."    Denktas, who wrote the letter to Clark earlier this week,  said he had been "puzzled and surprised" by Clark's remarks at a  meeting organized by the Carnegie Endowment for International  Peace on April 23.    The Turkish Cypriot president said he was "disappointed" by  Clark's remarks on the following points.    The failure to mention the reasons for Turkish intervention:  "Naturally, not every one may be aware of the Greek junta led  military coup in Cyprus of July 1974 and the discrimination,  suppression, and ethnic cleansing which preceded it for eleven  years. Also not many would know the legal right of the guarantor  powers (Turkey, Greece, and the United Kingdom) to intervene in  Cyprus when the state of affairs established by the  international treaties of 1960 creating a bicommunal partnership  Republic of Cyprus is violated. Turkey's timely and legitimate  intervention in 1974 resulted in the presence of Turkish troops  in Cyprus and closed the doors for ENOSIS. In the absence of  this information, Turkey would be seen as an aggressor and the  positive contribution and sacrifice it has been making on the  island since 1974 in order to maintain peace and prepare the  ground for an overall settlement would not be understood and  appreciated. Turkey has repeatedly stated that it has no  intention of staying on the island forever and would withdraw  its troops within the terms of an overall agreement between the  equal communities of the island," Denktas wrote to Clark.    The lack of reference to the Greek troops:    Denktas reminded Clark that 10,000 Greek troops were present  on the island, along with 15,000 National Guard, 10,000  commandos and a 80,000 fully trained reserve force.    "Furthermore, no mention was made of the money spent on  armaments and the joint Greek/Greek Cypriot side is starting the  construction of a Greek naval and air base in the south while  expenditure on arms and armament have reached a record high,"  Denktas said in the letter.    Stress on size, rather than political equality:    In his letter, Denktas also criticized Clark for his  reference to the Turkish Cypriot community "that constitutes  roughly 20 percent of the population on the island."    "(This) does not take account of the fact that the criteria  for political equality of constituent communities is not the  arithmetic size or proportion of their respective populations,"  Denktas said. "The equal political status of the two communities  is a well established fact and forms the very basis of the  current mission of good offices of the UN secretary-general. As  such, your emphasis on the proportion of the Turkish Cypriot  population and not its politically equal constituent was very  unfortunate."    In a similar vein with the letter sent to Clark, Denktas  also  sent an open message to the world announcing the collapse of  talks on the confidence-building measures.    "Not because of any fault of ours but because certain things  were done which upset the balance between the two parties, which  upset what we had agreed to do and changed the complete  picture," Denktas said.    Denktas said a new map was introduced to the Turkish Cypriot  side. "We cannot say yes to this map because (the new map)  trespassed into our number one security area," he said,  referring to the closed town of Varosha.</p>

Clinton failed to resolve differences with Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during a summit meeting last Friday  over U.S. demands for reducing Japan's trade surplus and  increasing the sale of foreign goods in Japan. "Ever since the  talks I had with Prime Minister Hosokawa, we've been reviewing  our options, consulting with our friends, trying to assess what  course we ought to take," Clinton said.    "I think sometime in the next few days, my economic team...  [ellipses as received] and our national security team will come  back with a set of options and recommendations to me and then  I'll have something to say," he told reporters during a White  House ceremony announcing a 6 billion dollar sale of civilian  aircraft to Saudi Arabia.    Clinton said the policy measures under review are different  from the sanctions the U.S. Government announced Tuesday over a  dispute with Japan on access to the Japanese cellular phone  market. "That's an issue of longstanding development," he said.    The policy options under consideration reportedly include  the  resurrection of a U.S. trade law that allows punitive measures  against countries which refuse to change what Washington deems  unfair trade practices.    U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the  "Super 301" trade measure through executive order is imminent,  possibly by Thursday. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said the  White House has made no decision on the "Super 301" measure but  predicted that Clinton will take some kind of action against  Japan.    "We are absolutely bound to act. We are reviewing options  now," Brown said in a television interview.    Asked about the possibility of a trade war with Japan, Brown  said, "We don't even like to use that kind of language." Brown  said the United States is faced with "a very difficult  situation" but reiterated that the Clinton administration is  determined to "open (Japanese) markets to American goods,  products and services."    "We're going to do everything we can to get that done." He  said. "We have said to Japan, `we have to have measurable,  monitorable results. Your markets must be opened because  American exports mean American jobs.'"</p>

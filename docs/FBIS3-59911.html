			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Petrov report under the "From the Government" rubric: </F> "Baykonur Will Remain Russian, If It Survives at All"]    [Text] A routine working conference chaired by First  Deputy Chairman of the Government Oleg Soskovets was devoted to  questions of ensuring the Baykonur cosmodrome's viability.    The representatives of the military and civilian space  departments who spoke there wasted many words trying to persuade  those present -- for which there was not the slightest need --  that the Baykonur cosmodrome is a unique scientific and  technical facility and that Russia needs it to attain its  strategic goals in space exploration and to improve its rocket  technology.    Expenditure on its upkeep, which has been agreed with the  Kazakhstani Government, should come this year to 37 billion  rubles [R]. Kazakhstan's share of this is R5.8 billion, but in  actual fact the republic has appropriated R1.9 billion.  Specialists estimate that at least R169.9 billion will be  required next year to ensure the facility's normal operations.  Who will bear the cost? Russia, of course, as it has the  primary interest in the space programs being carried out and in  using this facility. But what then is Kazakhstan's interest in  this? Nobody at the conference could provide a comprehensible  answer to this key question. Nor could they propose a package  of measures which would offer any social guarantees at all to  the people working in the harsh conditions at Baykonur today.    It is clear that, unless these questions are answered, the  draft memorandum the Russian side is preparing for discussion by  the two states' presidents may also become unviable or even  useless. At least three such documents on the cosmodrome have  been signed, but in the meantime the boiler houses are shutting  down, the living quarters are going unheated, ultramodern  equipment is being spoiled, and, most important, specialists are  leaving.    So will the destruction of this unique space facility come  to  an end? There is some hope that it will, but with one small  proviso: If we finally learn not to impose our conditions on our  partners but come to an agreement with them.</p>

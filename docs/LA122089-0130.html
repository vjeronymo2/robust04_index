			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE SENATE CANDIDATE ACCUSES RIVAL OF 'SPECIAL-INTEREST' TIES  </P> <P> Republican State Senate candidate Ron Isles launched his first attack Tuesday  in what could be a messy campaign by charging that Republican opponent Frank  Hill "is moonlighting for special interests."  </P> <P> Isles, a candidate for the special election to replace State Sen. William  Campbell, issued a statement saying the Whittier assemblyman collected $52,412  last year in gifts and honorariums. That is more than Hill's $44,000  legislative salary, he said.  </P> <P> "Where I come from, it looks like Frank Hill has a second job; he is  moonlighting for the special interests," said Isles, a Brea City Council  member.  </P> <P> Hill did not return repeated telephone calls to his office Monday or Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's announcement Tuesday that the primary for the 31st  Senate District will be held Feb. 6 has forced the three announced Republican  candidates into a quick campaign that has already seen Assemblyman Gil Ferguson  (R-Newport Beach), the other Republican running for the GOP-dominated district,  accuse Hill of being involved in a "Machiavellian scheme" to eliminate him from  the race.  </P> <P> Isles' campaign manager, Harvey Englander, promised that the issue of ethics --  believed heightened in the public's mind by recent scandals in Sacramento and  Washington -- will play a major role in the race.  </P> <P> Isles' statement Tuesday noted that Hill was a subject of the FBI's  investigation into influence-peddling at the state Capitol. Hill's office was  searched as part of the investigation, but no charges have been filed against  him. Hill has declined to comment on the sting operation.  </P></p>

Here is Mario Espinosa's report:    [Begin recording] [Espinosa] Drug trafficking continues to  be  of paramount importance here in Bolivia, and particularly in  Congress. Five people who were arrested in Chonchocorro have  visited the Human Rights Committee office. They are testifying  in the case of the DEA safe houses, and what they call the  constant human rights violations by DEA agents. This is why  policemen can now be seen at Congress.    The Human Rights Committee has several reasons for beginning  this investigation: One originated in the United States, where a  communique reports that human rights violations are being  committed under the guise of the antinarcotics struggle.    Outside the committee's office, people were saying the  arrested people were giving detailed reports of the torture  sessions they endured at the DEA safe houses.    This was confirmed by Juan del Granado, president of the  Chamber of Deputies Human Rights Committee:    [Granado] We will continue the investigations to prove or  disprove charges that have been made public and which we  received today. These are the starting point for the  investigation. We are concerned about this situation because we  have repeatedly received charges that Special Antinarcotics  Force, FELCN, agents are torturing Bolivian citizens under the  guise of judicial police investigations. If this is the case,  the legislative branch will adopt drastic measures.    [Espinosa] Juan del Granado clearly said it: We cannot  accept  that one crime should used to fight other crimes. If the  charges are proven there will be sanctions. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY'S MAJOR ASSIGNMENT  </P> <P> As he begins his unprecedented fifth term in office today, Los Angeles Mayor  Tom Bradley can look back on a career that already stands as a landmark in the  city's history.  </P> <P> During his 16-year Administration, the longest ever, the mayor has helped to  encourage a period of economic expansion that has made Los Angeles one of the  first cities not only of America, but also of the Pacific Rim. As a champion of  equal rights and opportunities, he has opened the corridors of civic power to  men and women of all races and creeds. The changes he has wrought in this  regard are so sweeping that it is difficult now to recall that he was the first  black Angeleno elected to the City Council and the first ever to occupy the  mayor's office. Perhaps it was his personal experience of bigotry that lead  Bradley to work so hard -- and with such notable success -- to keep Los Angeles  free of the communal rancor and racial divisiveness that have afflicted so much  of urban America over the past two decades.  </P> <P> But despite the successes of the mayor's four previous terms, thoughts of what  likely will be his last Administration inevitably are characterized by an  anxious uncertainty. The serious questions of conflict of interest arising from  Bradley's irregular handling of his personal finances and business transactions  have yet to be resolved. Until the facts of this matter are fully laid bare and  their consequences determined, conduct of the city's business is bound to be  halting and distracted.  </P> <P> For that reason, bringing an open and equitable end to this affair remains the  No. 1 item on the city's agenda. The second is to enact a clear, comprehensive  and enforceable code of ethics binding on all Los Angeles' elected officials.  Without these things, there can be no restoration of the public's badly eroded  confidence in the city government's basic integrity.  </P> <P> Recent public opinion polls here and elsewhere have found that popular faith in  the ability of government -- particularly local government -- to solve  society's most onerous problems is at an all-time low. This is doubly true in  Los Angeles, where the city's most vexing difficulties have assumed a sweeping  and fundamental aspect.  </P> <P> A recent study by scholars from UCLA, for example, revealed that the economic  boom of the past decade has obscured an alarming acceleration of income  disparity. If it is not arrested, we confront a future in which an affluent,  overwhelmingly white minority assumes the privileges and opportunities of a  permanent ascendancy, while the nonwhite, non-Anglo mass of working people are  relegated to the status of hereditary bondsmen, left to scavenge in the bleak  wastes between the drudgery of dead-end jobs and the misery of utter  destitution.  </P> <P> Providing every man and woman with the means to achieve a decent livelihood and  a healthy and humane environment in which to enjoy it are the only goals worthy  of a great city. If Los Angeles is to make a start toward their realization,  the people's basic belief in their city government's competence and honesty  must be restored.  </P></p>

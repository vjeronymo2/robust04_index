			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / New McDonnel Douglas helicopter to participate at Farnborough Out for a spin: the US-built McDonnell Douglas MD 520N helicopter, which is built without a tail rotor, flies over Farnborough as the site is made ready for next week's international air show, Paul Betts writes. In spite of a challenge from the new Berlin show, Farnborough and Paris remain the leading international shows. Farnborough has been chosen this year by the Russian aerospace industry for an unprecedented marketing drive to sell military and commercial aircraft in the west and seek joint ventures. Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, which organises the show, said yesterday that 437 Russian officials were expected at Farnborough. The group will include 81 leading figures from the Russian government and from leading aerospace companies and design bureaux. 'We've never had such an attendance with all the Russian decision-makers present,' Sir Barry said. 'They clearly see aerospace as one of the few areas from which they can derive economic benefit.' Russia will exhibit 20 aircraft including seven never yet shown in the west. The display will include the YAK-38 and YAK-141 vertical take-off fighters, the Sukhoi Su-24MP swing-wing attack aircraft and the Su-35 twin turbofan fighter.</p>

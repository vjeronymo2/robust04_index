			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Sin Yong-pae] </F>   [Text] The National Assembly yesterday opened a 20-day  extraordinary session to elect the new parliamentary leadership  and to deal with other pending issues.    After an opening ceremony, ruling and opposition lawmakers  passed a revision of the National Assembly Law through a plenary  session.    On Tuesday, the Assembly is scheduled to select the new  parliamentary speaker, the two vice speakers and chairmen of  standing committees.    Rep. Hwang Nak-chu nominated by the ruling Democratic  Liberal  Party (DLP) is the sole candidate for the successor to outgoing  Speaker Yi Man-sop.    Rep. Yi failed to be renominated by the DLP because he has  allegedly been feuding with party leaders. The feud is said to  have been triggered when Yi refused to cooperate in the DLP's  plan to railroad the controversial budget bill for fiscal 1994  through the Assembly in December last year.    Hwang, a five-term lawmaker, is a close associate of  President Kim Yong-sam and draws support from the mainstream in  the DLP, most of whom are Kim loyalists.    The nomination of Hwang is expected to gain swift approval  from the Assembly members given that the DLP controls the  299-member unicameral legislature.    DLP lawmaker Yi Chun-ku and opposition Democratic Party  lawmaker Hong Yong-ki will most likely become vice Assembly  speakers. The Assembly will also deal with the appointment of  new justices of the Supreme Court during a plenary session July  9.    But there is a possibility that opposition lawmakers may  take  issue over the past careers of some appointees who have been  accused because their "politicized" rules under previous  military-backed government.    The first summit meeting being pushed by the two Koreas is  expected to be capped in the interpellation session during July  4 to 8. The government's policy on the North Korean nuclear  standoff is also expected to become an issue of contention  between lawmakers of the ruling and opposition parties.    In addition, the Assembly will handle the  government-proposed  supplementary budget scaled at 384 billion won (about $476  million). The bill is designed to help ease the economic plight  of farmers and fishermen in the wake of the partial opening of  domestic agro-fisheries markets to foreign supplies.    But political observers predict that the Assembly session is  unlikely to draw much attention because of the focus of public  interest on the World Cup and the first inter-Korean summit.  Furthermore, major parties' preparations for two upcoming  by-elections for the Assembly slated for around the end of next  month are expected to reduce their concentration on  parliamentary activities.</p>

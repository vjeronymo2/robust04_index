			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, Jan 26 (CTK) -- Slovak  Premier and Chairman of the government coalition Movement For a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Vladimir Meciar, is trying hard to  corrupt several parliamentary deputies from the Democratic Left  Party (SDL), the latest issue of the Slovak weekly DOMINO EFEKT  quotes SDL Deputy Chairwoman Alzbeta Borzova as saying.    "It is clear that the goal of Meciar's efforts is the  gradual  split of the Peter Weiss-led SDL into two parts, of which one  will be finally swallowed by Meciar in the form of the so-called  functional coalition," the weekly writes. It adds that the  resistance of SDL deputies so far probably results from the  disturbing example of the Slovak National Party (SNS) the HZDS's  coalition partner now facing a split due to similar reasons.    However, Meciar believes that everybody can be bought, its  only the price what matters, the paper writes. That is why  Meciar's offers have been still higher and have been repeated  with "incredible persistence." The SDL leadership is aware that  if Meciar gains more economic power, he would finally destroy  their party. "Forty-eight HZDS deputies of the total of 66 run  their own businesses, and Meciar has promised them that they  will also privatize in a short time," DOMINO EFEKT quotes  Borzova as saying. "Therefore it is politically unbearable for  the SDL that the posts of privatization minister and chairman of  the National Property Fund continue to be held by the Premier,"  the paper states. If the government draft amendment to the  large privatization law is passed at the current parliamentary  session, the opposition could definitively "give up everything,"  it adds.    The weekly notes that Meciar has asked Defense Minister  Imrich Andrejcak to appoint him general. "Fortunately this is  not aimed at gaining further powers, but making an impression,"  DOMINO EFEKT comments, adding that the appointment is to take  place within two months.</p>

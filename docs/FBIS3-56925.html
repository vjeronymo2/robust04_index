			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkovski] </F>   [Text] After an extended parliamentary holiday, people's  deputies of our Republic resumed their legislative work today.  As I have learned at the press center of the Supreme Soviet  Presidium, legislators in the Supreme Soviet are to discuss  approximately 60 issues.    Today's session was opened by Supreme Soviet Chairman  Stanislav Shushkevich. The first half hour was devoted to  so-called miscellaneous time. Deputies delivered speeches  dedicated to different issues connected with our complex  socioeconomic and political life. Many of them appealed for the  restoration of order in the Republic and for government  officials not to work for themselves, taking advantage of their  offices, but to work for the greater good of society and our  Republic. The floor was taken by People's Deputies Zhykovskiy,  Kholod, Antonchuk, Sudys, and others. Deputies agreed to hear  speeches from Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and  government representatives concerning Belarus forming a common  monetary system with Russia. Later, the Supreme Soviet chairman  came forward with a proposal to hold debate on the 44th item on  the agenda -- ratification of the CIS Charter. Deputy Prime  Minister Uladimir Zalamay delivered a speech on this topic.    [Begin Zalamay recording] The main goals of the CIS which  are included in this bill are the comprehensive and balanced  socioeconomic development of CIS states in the framework of a  common economic zone, the improvement of international  cooperation and integration, cooperation in protecting peace and  international security, implementation of effective measures for  reducing weapons and defense expenditures, liquidation of  nuclear arms and other types of weapons of mass destruction,  accomplishment of complete global disarmament, and the  protection of human rights and basic freedoms in accordance with  widely recognized norms of international law. [end recording]    Later, the floor was taken by Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Kebich. He assessed the situation which has developed concerning  the proposed unification of our Republic's monetary-credit  system with Russia's. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich point  out that although this is a very complex issue, the government  course on unification of the monetary systems is real.    People's Deputy Mikhail Zhebryk delivered a speech on  ratification of the CIS Charter. Foreign Minister Petr  Kravchanka and Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovski also  participated in the debate on this issue. The opposition was  represented by People's Deputies Uladimir Nolik and Aleh Trusaw.  I have invited Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovski to comment on  this issue.    [Begin recording] [Rutkovskiy] Pavel Pavlovich, deputies are  criticizing the CIS Charter, particularly, the part concerning  military union. What is your opinion on this issue?    [Kozlovskiy, in Russian] We in the [Defense] Ministry  believe that this charter [on collective security] should be  unconditionally ratified, if we want to become a full member of  the CIS; and we have spoken about this. The charter includes a  paragraph which directly concerns our military -- the Republic  and the Defense Ministry -- and talks about the system of  collective security. Addressing this issue at the session, I  emphasized that we cannot consider ourselves to be a purely  neutral state. Those who once declared their neutrality are now  reviewing their statements. Countries are cooperating in  Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, to reduce military  expenditures and improve budgets -- to take less from a common  taxpayer. Therefore, such a system is not a military union.  This is a system of coordinating military cooperation, which is  currently being established in the CIS on a parity basis. This  (?department) is to help establish the National Armed Forces.  [end recording]</p>

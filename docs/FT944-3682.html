			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise consolidates Norwegian side Enterprise Oil Norge, a subsidiary of London-based Enterprise Oil, has consolidated its presence in the Norwegian North Sea oil sector through a series of disposals and acquisitions, for which it did not disclose financial details. Enterprise said that it had agreed to sell to Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, a 10 per cent stake in licence PL-034 in the Norwegian Sea covering two blocks which comprise the Smoerbukk field, situated on the Halten Bank. The field contains estimated reserves of 3.3 trillion feet of gas and 230m barrels of oil and condensate. Enterprise said the disposal amounted to less than one per cent of the joint Smoerbukk, Smoerbukk South and Midgard fields for which Statoil next year will seek approval for a joint NKr35bn (Pounds 3.3bn) development. 'We decided that to remain in the forthcoming Halten Bank development project with our very small participating share would not be making the best use of our resources. We will therefore use the cash raised in this sale to actively pursue exploration and development opportunities where we have a stronger presence elsewhere on the Norwegian continental shelf,' explained Mr John Bullough, general manager of Enterprise Oil Norge. Statoil recently increased its shareholding in the area and took over operational responsibility from Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, following a complex series of deals. Enterprise also announced a separate series of transactions in which it boosted its shareholdings in three Norwegian North Sea exploration licences through farm-in arrangements in blocks where the company considers there exists significant potential for oil discoveries to be made. In block 30/8, where drilling has started and which Enterprise considers to be of high quality, the company lifted its stake from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, while in block 1/3 Enterprise doubled its stake to 20 per cent. The company said an appraisal well is scheduled for 1995. In block 24/9, where an oil discovery was recently appraised successfully, Enterprise increased its shareholding to 40 (30) per cent.</p>

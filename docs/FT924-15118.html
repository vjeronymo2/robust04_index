			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (5): Programmes in their mother tongue - Joel Kibazo views the growing number of channels aimed at ethnic minorities THE growth of satellite television in the UK over the past two years has allowed the expansion of channels directly targeted at ethnic minorities. The new channels not only offer tailor-made programmes for communities which felt ignored by mainstream television, but also broadcast in mother languages. This new wave now includes stations broadcasting in Arabic, Hindi and Japanese. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, a 10-year satellite broadcasting licence is issued more or less on request by the Independent Television Commission (ITC), provided the applicant meets ITC guidelines laid down by the ITC codes. The cost of application and the first year's licence fee comes to Pounds 381 and unlike in the recent allocation of franchises for the ITV network, there is no quality threshold for satellite broadcasters. Mr Jon Davey, director of cable and satellite at the ITC, said: 'I think it is a good thing for those minorities that are not currently provided for.' One of the new licensees is TV Asia. Launched last August it is aimed at the 1.3m people in Britain of Asian origin. It is not the first station for the Asian community. Several services on cable have come and gone; one of the survivors is Asia Vision, which remains popular with London's Bengali community. However, TV Asia, set up with an Pounds 8m budget, is the first to be transmitted via satellite (though it is also available on selected cable systems) and has already quickly established a high profile. Broadcast in two blocks via the Comedy Channel and Sky One, both on the Astra satellite, TV Asia offers a mix of news, current affairs and light entertainment and draws heavily on the ready supply of Indian films from the sub-continent. Hindi, Urdu and English are the main broadcast languages, with special programmes broadcast in Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali, and Tamil. The potpourri of languages is having some unexpected results: the emergence of 'Hinglish', a hybrid of English and Hindi, which already features in many Hindi pop songs and big screen films produced in India. Backed by a consortium from Pakistan and India, the station draws its revenue from subscription (handled by Sky's subscription department) and advertising. Charging Pounds 11.99 for a monthly subscription, it claims to have signed up 12,000 subscribers in the first month and says it is likely to break even within a year. Mr Faisal Sherjan, chief executive, claims the station is going for 'quality' programming, a claim loudly dismissed by some viewers who describe the programmes as the TV equivalent of 'heavily diluted curry'. Needless to say, it is this scheduling based on the lowest common denominator approach which holds out the greatest commercial potential, a fact which the station founders acknowledge. Mr Sherjan said: 'The Asian community is an affluent community which does not spend its money in pubs and clubs. They are also big buyers of video cassette players and videos and we can offer the kind of product they want.' The channel also hopes to reach Asian communities in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries. While TV Asia's target audience only extends to western Europe, Middle East Broadcasting Centre, launched in September 1991, provides family entertainment, films, current affairs and international news for Arabic speakers in the UK, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. MBC plans to start beaming programmes to the US within the next few months. Backed by businessmen in Saudi Arabia, MBC broadcasts 9 1/2 hours a day with programmes transmitted via satellites operated by Eutelsat and Arabsat. It claims a potential audience of more than 100m people and its chief executive expects it to break even after five years. In spite of MBC's ambitious global aspirations the distinction of being the first pan-Europe, non-European language channel was achieved by Japan Satellite Television (JSTV), launched two years ago. Aimed at the Japanese expatriate community in Europe, which mostly consists of middle and senior management, it broadcasts daily between 7pm and 6am on Astra 1b (also known as the children's channel), and draws its menu of news, general entertainment, drama and educational programmes from both NHK, Japan's public broadcasting corporation, and commercial stations. A particular feature is the simultaneous broadcasting of news and current affairs programmes from Japan to Europe, though at Pounds 30 a month, subscription is above the average for satellite services. In spite of the growing number of satellite stations, services continue to be launched on cable and in some cases in more imaginative forms. One such station is the Multicultural Televison launched last month by Videotron, the UK's fourth largest cable operator. The five-hour service broadcasts only in London on Saturday and Sunday evenings on the parliamentary channel and its schedule is a mix of programmes to cater for London's Asian, Greek, Turkish Afro-Caribbean and Iranian community. Not all minority channels are directly targeted at their own communities. Next month sees the launch of China News Europe, backed by Hong Kong tycoon TT Tsui and businessman David Tang. Based in London, CNE plans to broadcast news and business programmes from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Programmes will be primarily in English, though repeated in Mandarin and Cantonese. Ms Betty Yao, general manager of CNE, is adamant about her target audience. 'Our primary audience is English-speaking business people with an interest in greater China. We are not an ethnic station,' she said.</p>

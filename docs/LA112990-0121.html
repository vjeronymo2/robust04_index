			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> PROJECT FOES OPPOSE PARKLAND DONATION  </P> <P> Ojai residents have scorned a developer's offer to donate a $500,000 chunk of  land to the city or a nature conservancy, calling it a bribe and a Trojan  horse.  </P> <P> About 80 people attended a town forum Monday that Anaheim developer Howard M.  Palmer sponsored to pitch a proposal he has submitted to the city.  </P> <P> Palmer, who lost a 10-year battle with the city to build a shopping center next  to Nordhoff High School, now wants to create a 26-lot subdivision on the  30-acre parcel, donate about 12 acres of the parcel for a park and wetland  habitat, and help finance a recreation center, auditorium or child-care center  at the site.  </P> <P> "I'm still knocking my head against the door," Palmer said after the audience  urged him to drop the plan, although he said it could offset traffic and other  impacts from the subdivision along California 33.  </P> <P> Stan Greene, president of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, accused Palmer of  bribing the community to support the subdivision.  </P> <P> John Christianson of the Besant Meadow Preservation Group called the offer "an  Ojai Trojan horse." He asked Palmer to "make a real gift" by donating the  entire 30 acres for open space.  </P> <P> City Councilman Joe DeVito said the city appreciates Palmer's proposal but will  have to look closely at the environmental effects before making a decision.  </P> <P> The Ojai Planning Commission is scheduled to review the plan Dec. 19.

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spandex rises 6% to Pounds 4.46m Spandex, which distributes and supplies signmaking computers and materials, raised pre-tax profits by 6 per cent from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 4.46m in 1992, on sales also 6 per cent higher at Pounds 55m. Earnings per share rose from 20.4p to 22.5p, while a final dividend of 4.6p makes a total for the year of 6.5p (6p). Mr Charles Dobson, chairman of the USM-traded group, said net debt had been reduced from Pounds 7.2m at the end of 1991 to Pounds 4.3m at December 31 1992, thereby reducing gearing from 56 per cent to 29 per cent. Sales of signmaking materials continued to grow in the year, increasing from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 34.6m. Sales of Gerber computerised signmaking systems declined however, from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 15m. Ultramark, the self-adhesive materials manufacturing side, recorded a 20 per cent sales increase from Pounds 4.58m to Pounds 5.48m.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Reinventing the golf cart Who says there is no point in reinventing the wheel? Hugh O'Neil has done just that with a revolutionary golf cart which features slits on the outer rim of the tire. They follow the contours of the ground, changing shape from a round to an oval as they traverse. The result is a machine which can go anywhere in extreme weather conditions but which exerts about a quarter of the pressure of an average man's foot. The three-wheeled Elite golf cart is battery driven, carries one person at 14kph and costs Pounds 1,800. Elite Golf Products: UK; 0306 743945.</p>

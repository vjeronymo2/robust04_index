Filippov: "Role of the U.S. Navy in </F> Providing Antiballistic Missile Defense in a TMO"]    [Text] Modern U.S. military strategy is based on the  assumption that use of armed forces in regional conflicts is to  become, now and in the immediate future, the most probable  variant of protecting vitally important American interests. The  spread of missile weapons into developing countries, the advent  of a real possibility for their creation of mass destruction  weapons, political instability in the former USSR, and  difficulties in suppressing mobile missile systems (from combat  experience in the Persian Gulf) are making it necessary to  develop and deploy effective antiballistic missile (ABM) systems  in theaters of military operations (TMOs) to protect friendly  forces and objectives from strikes by operational-tactical and  tactical ballistic missiles. A report to Congress by U.S. Armed  Services Chairman of the Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Colin L. Powell (February 1993) states that "equipped with  chemical or biological warheads, the enemy's ballistic missiles  can present a significant threat to our mobile forces, which are  the principal forces in the USA's new regional strategy."    In accordance with the state's military strategy, the  command  of the U.S. Navy is activating efforts to create sea-based ABM  systems. Three fundamental studies were carried there in 1991:  "Requirements on Tactical ABM Systems in 2010" (U.S. Navy  Consultative Committee for Scientific Research and Experimental  Design Work"); "Tactical Sea-Based ABM Systems" (staff of the  naval secretary's advisor on armament development and  purchases); "Research on Antiballistic Missile Defense"  (Scientific Council of the U.S. Department of Defense).    The following conclusions were reached on the basis of this  research:    1. The threat of the use of ballistic missiles in a TMO is  real, and continues to grow. More than 30 countries have  operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles, and a  large number of countries are aspiring to acquire them.  Ballistic missiles already adopted could be upgraded with the  purpose of increasing their combat effectiveness. Creation of  warheads fitted with mass destruction weapons may be one of the  routes of upgrading in this case.    2. Naval forces and resources can make a significant  contribution to creating ABM systems in a TMO. The strategy of  creating sea-based antimissile systems is based on factors  inherent to the navy, such as accessibility to most regions,  mobility, flexibility, and the capability for lengthy operation  not only to protect the navy's most important facilities but  also to defend mobile and expeditionary forces (assault forces),  their landing ports, maritime airfields and cities, and other  important facilities within their range. In addition such  systems are capable of significantly increasing the  effectiveness of regional ABM systems by providing support to  ground-based antimissile systems.    It was noted that the modern Aegis ship automated weapon  combat control system outfitted with Standard-2 surface-to-air  guided missiles is capable of carrying out limited ABM missions.  On the whole, its specifications and performance characteristics  are not optimized for antimissile defense, but there is a  possibility for upgrading them for these purposes.    The foreign press writes that the command of the U.S. Navy  has drawn up a plan to create ship ABM systems in two phases.  The first entails efforts to upgrade existing ship  surface-to-air missile systems for ABM missions in the TMO,  while the second entails development of future sea-based  antimissile systems. The main elements of the plan for their  creation were coordinated with the leadership of the SDI program.    The work of the first phase includes upgrading the Aegis  system and the Standard-2 SAM. Changes in the system itself will  be insignificant. The MK 99 Mod.2 fire control system and the  MK-41 vertical launcher remain as before. Some changes are being  made in the program and work algorithm of the AN/SPY-18 radar  station, the control and decision making instrumentation, and  the displays. The upgrade is most visible in the Standard-2  missile, which is being fitted with a new warhead, an improved  homing head and an improved fuze. The upgraded missile will have  the greater killing power and speed to destroy  operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles.    The work of upgrading the SAMs is being carried out by  America's Raytheon, which has experience in similar work on the  Patriot system, which was used to defeat Iraqi ballistic  missiles during combat operations in the Persian Gulf.    The upgrade program was drawn up in such a way that flight  tests of the block 4 Standard-2 SAM would begin upon completion  of the work of improving the fuze and homing head and creating a  new warhead, and that it would be finished in 1995. Ships are to  be armed with an antiballistic missile capable of close  interception of operational-tactical and tactical ballistic  missiles in 1996. It is anticipated that as with the Patriot  surface-to-air guided missile, the modernized block 4 Standard-2  missile will be able to effectively hit both aerodynamic and  ballistic targets.    The official point of view on the justifications of work in  the first phase is based on the following premises:     -  the navy already has radar stations and vertical  launchers, so all it needs is to develop antiballistic missiles,  while the ground forces have to develop new radar stations,  launchers and antiballistic missiles for the future ground-based  THAAD ABM system;    -  naval ships are a mobile force, and they are  capable of reaching regions of crisis rather quickly, while  deployment of a ground-based ABM system in a TMO would require  from 1 to 3 weeks;    -  sea-based ABM systems make it possible for  the local command to use them more efficiently in crisis  situations, for example in the first days of a conflict, while  the naval ABM component in the TMO could afford protection to  troop airlifts by providing cover against missile strikes to  coastal airfields.       American specialists assert that a zonal ABM system would  play the most important role in regions of crisis, because of  the 37 potential trajectories of ballistic missiles with a range  of around 1,000 km, 26 pass over the water surface. Therefore,  presence of a ship carrying an ABM system at the need spot would  allow it to destroy a ballistic missile in flight (Figure 1).  Moreover, according to estimates of the same specialists, from  50 to 60 percent of the most important cities and industrial  centers in the Western Pacific may be protected by sea-based ABM  systems.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-59A>           Figure 1. Interception of an </FIG>       American ships armed with ABM systems and located in the  Mediterranean Sea could defend their bases in Europe from a  missile attack from the African coast, particularly in the case  of an attack on Italy by Libya, while ships deployed in the  Persian Gulf could defeat ballistic missiles launched from  countries in the Near East.    Development of the next generation of the Aegis ship  automated weapon combat control system, with greater ballistic  missile detection and tracking range, is planned in the second  phase.    Both individual components of the ABM system (computers,  radar stations, radar signal processors etc.) and the software  will be subjected to upgrade. There are plans for developing an  antiballistic missile capable of fighting operational-tactical  and tactical ballistic missiles of the future with a range from  hundreds to tens of thousands of kilometers and equipped with  different kinds of warheads, including nuclear, chemical and  biological. The upgraded Standard-2 SAM and the THAAD  antiballistic missile presently being developed for the ground  forces (with a planned range of ballistic target destruction of  up to 200 km, and an altitude of 150 km) could serve this role.    Concurrently there are plans for improving the control and  data transmission system, which will be brought together into a  unified system utilizing ground, air and space ballistic missile  detection and tracking resources in order to raise the  effectiveness of ABM systems. Around 25 percent of the planned  appropriations for work to create ABM systems for TMOs in the  1993-1999 fiscal years are being allocated to the navy.    In future upgrading of the Standard-2 SAM, a third Thiokol  accelerating stage and the LEAP small homing hyperfast  projectile, developed on a competitive basis by America's  Boeing, Hughes and Rockwell International, are to be installed  in it.    LEAP ammunition, which weighs around 10 kg, will be able to  destroy operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles due  to kinetic energy released upon striking the target. It is to be  outfitted with an optical homing head, which will be used at  altitudes above 70 km in order to exclude the harmful influence  of atmospheric optic effects (distortions of the optical viewing  axis, considerable heating etc.)(Figure 2).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-60A>           Figure 2. LEAP Small Homing Hyperfast </FIG>       Work on LEAP technology for the Standard-2 missile was  started in 1992. In that same year the first flight test was  conducted with the purpose of demonstrating the missile's  ability to deliver the LEAP projectile to an altitude above 90  km. The testing was done in the Eastern Atlantic. A target  rocket was launched from the eastern missile range at Cape  Canaveral, Florida to a distance of 800 km. The tests showed  that the Standard-2 SAM can deliver a mockup of the LEAP  projectile to an altitude of 110 km, while together with an  AN/SPY-1B radar station the Aegis system is capable persistently  tracking a ballistic missile and guiding a SAM to a prescribed  point.    During the next tests, planned for mid-1993, a Standard-2 is  to be launched carrying a mockup of the LEAP projectile of  actual size in order to work out the mechanism of its separation  from the rocket.    The next three tests of the first series are planned for  1994  with the additional Thiokol third accelerating stage. The shock,  vibration and thermal loads will be determined and the operation  of the autopilot will be evaluated during these tests. The  faring of the missile is to be jettisoned at an altitude of 80  km and the third stage is to be started to accelerate the LEAP  ammunition during the testing. The mockup of the LEAP ammunition  is to separate from the accelerating stage 145 seconds after the  missile's lift-off (at an altitude of 150 km); all components of  the missile, including the accelerating stage, the LEAP  ammunition and the work of the homing head will be checked.  There are also plans for carrying out a real interception of a  ballistic missile launched from Cape Canaveral to a distance of  1,000 km over the Atlantic Ocean; the intercept will occur at an  altitude of 100 km, 800 km from the launch site of the  operational-tactical ballistic missile. The target rocket will  have a speed of 2-3 km/sec.    After the first series of flight tests are evaluated, the  navy will begin the second, which will include five real  interceptions of ballistic missiles in 1995-1997. Concurrently,  naval specialists will study the experience of associates from  the ground forces in creating the THAAD ABM systems, and work  out the problems, as necessary, of installing this system or its  antimissiles aboard ships.    In the year 2000 the U.S. Navy plans to install ABM systems  aboard 22 "Ticonderoga" class guided missile cruisers and 26  "Berk" class guided missile destroyers. According to U.S. Naval  specialists, sea-based ABM systems equipped with the Standard-2  SAM carrying LEAP ammunition (Figure 3), deployed by the western  and eastern shores of America, could be used to repel a limited  nuclear missile strike against the USA.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-60B>           Figure 3. Standard-2 Sea-Based </FIG>       In order to afford protection to Marine Corps units against  missile strikes, the Improved Hawk SAM system with which they  are armed is to be upgraded. This system contains an AN/TPS-51  radar station capable of identifying ballistic targets and  calculating the trajectory, the launch point and the warhead's  point of impact. In addition, the radar station can detect small  targets like cruise missiles. Data are transmitted automatically  by communication lines from the radar station to Improved Hawk  SAM system batteries. The range of detection is 740 km for  ballistic targets and 550 for small targets. The radar station  has a device for automatic determination of its coordinates, the  same as the kind in SAM batteries.    Tests carried out at the White Sands Proving Grounds (New  Mexico) in May 1991 confirmed the capability of the radar  station for detecting and tracking ballistic missiles. During  the tests it persistently tracked and transmitted information to  the SAM system, which was located 120 km from the missile's  launch site and 85 km from the SAM battery. There are plans for  acquiring nine AN/TPS-59 radar stations for Improved Hawk  missile systems possessed by the Marine Corps.    The war in the Persian Gulf confirmed the operational and  strategic necessity of creating ABM systems in a TMO, including  sea-based ones, to neutralize the threat from ballistic missiles  in regional conflicts. The American plans for creating ABM  systems in TMOs are acquiring an increasingly more integrated  and definite nature. The timetable and directions of development  of technology have been determined rather specifically. However,  the possibility of further adjustment of the technical makeup of  TMO ABM systems, including sea-based systems, is not excluded.  The USA generally possesses sufficient financial, economic and  technical possibilities for deploying such systems by planned  deadlines.    COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1993.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: ENDEARING SIMPLICITY AND HARLEY-DAVIDSONS MEET AT COOK'S CORNER  </P> <P> Its exterior and furnishings are as rough as the canyons that surround this  South County establishment, which is on a fork where El Toro Road ends and  Santiago Canyon and Live Oak Canyon roads begin.  </P> <P> Cook's Corner is one of perhaps the last country bars in Orange County.  </P> <P> If you are looking for ferns, mineral water and yuppie snacks, then it's best  to head out to El Toro, Mission Viejo or beyond.  </P> <P> There is an endearing simplicity about this bar. It serves only beer (including  European and Mexican labels) and wine.  </P> <P> A short-order cook fries up burgers and the like. Recommended are the roast  beef and turkey sandwiches, each for $3.50. Side orders of calorie-rich potato  salad will fill you up.  </P> <P> Two pool tables attract a steady stream of players at 50 cents a game.  </P> <P> Customers can watch sports on a large TV screen and two smaller screens. During  "Monday Night Football," the bar offers two rounds of draft beer for $1.  </P> <P> The jukebox is heavy on nostalgia rock and country music. No piped-in Cocteau  Twins or Joni Mitchell here.  </P> <P> The place has a patio, and always nearby it seems are several Harley-Davidsons  and their riders exchanging road talk.  </P> <P> A historian once called Cook's Corner the "last rebel outpost" in Orange County  because of the bikers who roar in and out of this place.  </P> <P> It may look like a rough place to spend an evening, but it's strictly a  live-and-let-live atmosphere. It's country, not urban; rustic, not  sophisticated. The regulars are laid back and friendly.  </P> <P> So if you are looking for hyper, fast-talking professional types, well . . .  have you considered moving to Chicago?  </P> <P>  Cook's Corner, 19122 El Toro Road, El Toro. Open daily 8 a.m. (bar opens at  9:30 a.m.) to 2 a.m. (714) 858-0266.  </P> <P> GUILLERMO TORRES  </P></p>

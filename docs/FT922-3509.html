			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / TI Group wins bid battle for Dowty: Enlarged engineering company to join FT-SE 100 - Combined sales will reach Pounds 1.2bn TI GROUP, the specialist engineering company, yesterday won overwhelming support for its hostile bid for Dowty Group, the Cheltenham-based aerospace and information technology group that is among the best-known names in British engineering. By the close of the bid yesterday, 60.23 per cent of Dowty's shareholders had accepted the share and cash offers which valued Dowty at about Pounds 510m. The successful bid will leapfrog TI into the FT-SE 100 index and will make the group the second largest UK engineering company behind British Aerospace. The enlarged group will have three divisions - aerospace, engineered seals and pipes - each with sales of about Pounds 400m - operating throughout the world. Dowty's aerospace division, which is the prize in yesterday's successful bid, will remain in Cheltenham where it made landing gear for all Royal Air Force aeroplanes that flew during the Second World War. 'We are clearly delighted with the result,' said Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, 'Our priority now is to get down to the real task of returning Dowty to its core specialised engineering businesses of aerospace and polymer engineering.' Mr Lewinton will meet the Dowty board in London today. 'I will explain that we are trying to build a great British engineering company,' he said. 'The takeover is good news for Dowty, good news for TI and good news for British engineering.' Among the first steps TI will take is to establish with its advisers Barings, the merchant bank, whether its assumptions about Dowty's Information Technology division fit with the actual situation ahead of a likely sale. The division was most responsible for Dowty's weak earnings and profits performance in recent years and contributed perhaps more than anything to TI's victory yesterday. TI's advisers and its finance team will go to Cheltenham tomorrow to look over Information Technology and to begin the process of putting Dowty's management accounts on to TI's reporting system. Mr Lewinton yesterday dismissed fears about the company's future expressed during the bid by Dowty's labour force. The fears were based on uncertainty and stemmed from the large numbers of redundancies in the aerospace industry in recent years. First indications last night were that of the 60.23 per cent acceptances from shareholders, the majority took the four-for-fifteen share offer in preference to the 175p cash alternative.</p>

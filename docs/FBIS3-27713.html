South Korea has offered to sell Thailand F-5s jet-fighters  reportedly for one million to 1.5 million dollars each, but the  RTAF has yet to enter into discussions on the proposed deal, the  RTAF secretary said.    South Korea has also offered to provide spare parts for  their  combat aircraft, he said, but Assistant Air Force  Commander-in-Chief ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Samat Sotsathit and  Air Force Chief-of-Staff ACM Kriangkrai Sinthawanon are yet to  respond to the offer.    RTAF Secretary VM Nan dismissed a report by South Korea's  CHOSON ILBO newspaper that the F-5 deal between Thailand and  South Korea was being negotiated with US approval.    The South Korean newspaper quoted a South Korean Defence  Ministry spokesman as saying that both sides were in the process  of finalizing the deal and were discussing how many aircraft to  sell, the price and other details.    Thailand will buy about 10 F-5A Tiger jet-fighters and F-5B  Phantom jet-fighters, the newspaper said.    House Armed Services Committee Chairman Gen Athit Kamlang-ek  earlier in the week expressed support for the reported sale of  the F-5s, saying they would be reliable, maintainable and  cost-effective.    The Royal Thai Air Force has repair and maintenance crews  for  the F-5 which Thailand also has in commission, he said.    In other developments VM Nan disclosed that 36 Czech-made  L-39 trainer/combat aircraft will be deployed well before  schedule at Air Wing 1 in Nakhon Ratchasima and Air Wing 4 in  Nakhon Sawan, beginning this month.    The first batch of four two-seat L-39s were delivered to Air  Wing 1 in October last year, roughly three months before  schedule.    The Royal Thai Air Force secretary said Air Wing 1 would  deploy 22 of the Czech combat aircraft and Air Wing 4 would  deploy 14.    The Royal Thai Air Force and Cathay Pacific, meanwhile, are  discussing damage compensation that the Hong Kong-based airline  will pay for unlawfully making a short-cut flight over Thai  airspace earlier this month, VM Nan said.    The short-cut route prompted F-16 Fighting Falcon  jet-fighters from Air Wing 1 to intercept the commercial  airliner on January 8.    The normal route for commercial airliners is Surat Thani--U-  Taphao--Bangkok--Nakhon Ratchasima--Laos.    But the Cathay Pacific plane made a short cut by not passing  over Bangkok and flying straight from U-Taphao to Nakhon  Ratchasima to save fuel.    This kind of breach in airspace regulations has not taken  place very often in Thailand, he said.</p>

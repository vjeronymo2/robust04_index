			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PHILLIES MAKE MARTINEZ START A WASHOUT, 8-3;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: DODGER PITCHER GIVES UP FOUR RUNS IN FIRST INNING. RAIN DELAYS COME  BEFORE GAME AND DURING THE SIXTH.  </P> <P> Ramon Martinez entered Friday's game at Veterans Stadium with two consecutive  victories and two complete games.  </P> <P> He exited three innings later after reminding everyone of a more important set  of twos in his life: He is still 22.  </P> <P> The youngest Dodger was confused by the rain delay, the signs from catcher Rick  Dempsey, and ultimately by the Philadelphia Phillies during the Dodgers' 8-3  loss.  </P> <P> Martinez gave up five runs -- four in the first inning -- on four hits in his  shortest outing since becoming a regular starter last July. That is only two  fewer runs than he had allowed in his previous 28 innings this season, during  which he had a 2-0 record, a 2.25 earned-run average and a growing reputation  as one of the league's best young pitchers.  </P> <P> Friday, you could place emphasis on the word young.  </P> <P> "Every time I go out there, I learn a lot of things," Martinez said. "And I  know I need to learn a lot more."  </P> <P> He was not helped by a Dodger offense that scored its three runs on 11 hits,  which translated to 10 runners left on base.  </P> <P> "And all of that was in the first six innings!" said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda  after the final 12 hitters were retired by Phillie reliever Don Carman.  </P> <P> But perhaps the Dodger hitters could be excused. Perhaps like the 8,926 fans,  they were merely bored. The start of the game was delayed 18 minutes by rain,  and then play was halted 1 hour 9 minutes by rain with none out in the Dodgers'  half of the sixth.  </P> <P> By the time the game resumed, there were about 50 people in the stands. If any  of them were fans of hitting, they didn't miss much. With the Dodgers trailing,  5-3, and runners on first and second, Carman retired Kal Daniels and Eddie  Murray on fly-ball outs and then struck out Hubie Brooks to end the inning.  </P> <P> Dodger reliever Tim Crews gave up three more runs on a couple of walks and  three singles in the seventh. Carman did not allow another Dodger to reach  base. His four scoreless innings lowered his ERA to 0.69 through 13 innings.  Last year he was 5-15 as a starter; this year he has given up only four hits.  </P> <P> Before Friday, Martinez appeared to be headed toward similar low numbers. But  he said he began the night feeling awkward because he was given only 13 minutes  warning before the delayed start of the game. He has never pitched after a rain  delay before.  </P> <P> "I was warmed up, but not like you are when you know what time the game is  going to start," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Once he took the mound, with a one-run cushion thanks to Daniels' first-inning  homer, he looked awkward. Catcher Rick Dempsey ran out for a conference even  before Martinez's first pitch to discuss the signs.  </P> <P> "We got just a little bit confused," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Said Dempsey, who had two hits in his first start since missing 19 games with  back spasms: "I give the signs different from Mike Scioscia -- the proper  signs, but different, and Ramon and I just need to communicate better."  </P> <P> It was the first of three mound meetings in that inning. After Martinez gave up  a leadoff walk to Len Dykstra and a run-scoring double to Tommy Herr, he was  visited by pitching coach Ron Perranoski.  </P> <P> "He told me to calm down," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Martinez promptly gave up a run-scoring single to Ricky Jordan, and then John  Kruk hit a fly ball that eluded a diving Juan Samuel and rolled through the  left-field gap for a triple. Out ran Dempsey and in came shortstop Alfredo  Griffin, who appeared to be both scolding and exhorting Martinez.  </P> <P> He allowed a run-scoring grounder to Dickie Thon, and then retired Darren  Daulton on a grounder to end the inning. By then, he was nearly worn out. He  had thrown 32 pitches in the inning, nearly half of the 66 total pitches he  would throw in three innings.  </P> <P> Two innings later, on a 2-and-0 pitch, he allowed Von Hayes' fourth homer, and  he was finished.  </P> <P> "You cannot pitch behind the hitters like that, statistics prove they will hit  you harder, and that's what Ramon did," Lasorda said. "And age had nothing to  do with that. Even guys 30 years old do it. And if you do, it's tough to win,  plain as the nose on your face."  </P> <P> Or in Martinez's case, the egg.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> In his Jim Gott's first rehabilitation assignment, the reliever threw three  innings, giving up two runs on four hits with one strikeout and two walks while  pitching Friday for Class-A Bakersfield at San Bernardino. Gott hopes to be  ready to join the active roster when the team returns from the current trip May  14.  </P> <P> Jeff Hamilton will be sidelined for at least six weeks after arthroscopic  surgery Friday revealed torn cartilage in his shoulder. The Dodger third  baseman will have to wait at least a month before swinging a bat or throwing a  ball. The platoon of Lenny Harris and Mike Sharperson will continue to play  third base. The news of Hamilton's extended absence, not unexpected, gave  Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda another chance to proclaim that this team will not  let injuries beat it. "If the fate of this organization rests on one or two  players, then we're in trouble," he said. "Like I've been telling the players,  this cannot beat us . . . we can win with those players, and we can win without  them." Several Dodgers followed Lasorda's enthusiastic lead Friday by taking  extra, early batting practice even though much of the Veterans Stadium wet  infield was covered with a tarp.  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser, who underwent shoulder surgery April 27, was discharged Friday  from Centinela Hospital Medical Center for a second time after being readmitted  Wednesday because of dehydration caused by a virus. . . . The Dodger bullpen  received a potential boost Friday with a successful simulated game by Pat  Perry. The left-handed reliever, recovering from off-season shoulder surgery,  threw 48 pitches, eight more than scheduled because he felt so good. If he can  pitch two more good simulated games on this trip, he could be ready for a minor  league rehabilitation assignment when the team returns home May 14. If all goes  well, he could join the active roster a week later. "I think he looked great  for a first time out," said Mark Cresse, bullpen coach. "He showed us a pitch,  a curveball, that nobody has ever put into his game before. And it was a great  curveball." Perry, signed as a free agent this winter after going 0-1 with a  1.77 ERA in 19 games for the Chicago Cubs last season, said his rehabilitation  has reached a high point. "Three weeks ago, I was beginning to wonder if I  would ever be ready," he said. "But today, I know I'm getting close."  </P> <P> Despite the cold weather, Kirk Gibson ran in the outfield Friday, and hopes to  begin taking batting practice by the end of this trip. If so, he could be ready  to join the roster by the end of May. "It all depends on when I can run hard,  and I still can't run hard," said Gibson, who had hoped to begin taking batting  practice during the recent home stand. "I'm beyond being disappointed. I'm just  working as hard as I can and hopefully something will happen soon." Gibson has  said that as soon as he begins taking batting practice, he will probably be  able to play within three weeks.  </P></p>

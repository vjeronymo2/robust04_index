			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / German health spending winding down: Insurance reforms are working MR Horst Seehofer, Germany's federal health minister, bore a radiant face when he recently announced that his six-month-old reforms had already reversed the insidious trend of seemingly ever-higher health spending. His smile was an achievement in itself for a man who has made enemies across the German medical profession and pharmaceutical industry. The state-subsidised health insurance scheme, which offers nearly full health cover to 90 per cent of the population, reported a healthy surplus of DM2.6bn (Pounds 1.04bn) for the period, after a DM9bn loss in 1992. Per-member treatment-related spending has decreased by 2.7 per cent since reforms took effect on January 1, after a 9 per cent increase last year. Spending dropped as a result of severe budgetary restrictions under the reforms for drugs and treatments. In answer to these, the medical profession prescribed less than in previous years. 'We have succeeded in changing the behaviour of everyone involved in the healthcare system,' Mr Seehofer said. Some members of the medical profession welcome the change. 'A patient in Germany would never leave his doctor without a prescription before,' says Mr Frank Montgomery, from an independent association of doctors.' But the reforms have also sparked bitter complaints from doctors and the drugs industry. Both groups have seen their revenues decline as a result of the ceilings on their fees and say the reforms could undermine the ability of the system to continue to provide state-of-the-art drugs and treatments. According to pharmaceutical associations, the budget ceilings are threatening 20,000 jobs in pharmacies. Dentists say they are increasingly refusing to treat non-privately insured patients because lower fees do not cover costs. To cap the rising spending borne by the insurance scheme, which is compulsory only for those who earn less than DM6,000 a month, the reforms introduced budgetary ceilings equal to 1991 levels of expenditure plus a marginal increase reflecting the yearly average growth in personal income. Heavy financial penalties are incurred if these ceilings are exceeded. For drugs sold in pharmacies, spending covered by the health scheme has been limited to DM24bn for the year. Physicians and dentists prescribing over this limit are legally obliged to pay up to DM280m a year (estimated to be 1 per cent of annual doctors' fees) from their own pockets. Their medical associations will be charged with examining individual cases of over-prescribing and will impose fees to cover this amount. The pharmaceutical industry must pay the costs of the next DM280m tranche of over-spending to the insurance schemes. For treatments, doctors and dentists' fees will be automatically reduced if doctors over-prescribe, and hospitals will have to open credits to cover over-spending rather than charge the insurance scheme. The results of the reforms have been immediate. Prescriptions decreased sharply in the first six months. Mr Seehofer hopes the insurance schemes will save up to DM7bn this year in non-prescribed medicines and treatments. However, retail sales in pharmacies have fallen by 21 per cent for the half year, with pharmacists bitterly protesting. They say their profits could fall by 32 per cent this year. While doctors agree that the budgets for medicines are cutting excessive over-prescriptions, they say the ceilings could undermine their own budgeting. With declining profit margins, they fear that lack of investment will undermine the quality of services. 'The reforms are purely monetary and do not address structural change,' says Mr Montgomery. 'They are in fact destroying existing healthcare structures without creating viable new ones.' Dentists are angered by a series of fees reductions forced on them . These include a 10 per cent price reduction on crown and bridge work, areas where dentists earn most of their income. Sales in the pharmaceutical industry fell by 11 per cent from January to June. Moreover, the market share between original products and cheaper generic medicines has changed to the detriment of companies investing in research. Sales of generic medicines rose by 12 per cent in the six months. Mr Walter Wenninger, head of the healthcare division of Bayer, predicts that sales for pharmaceutical groups could drop by 25 per cent this year and says the reforms clash with the government's aim of securing Germany as a competitive industrial base. The medical profession and the industry say further reforms are needed to improve the structures of the healthcare system. The medical profession also advocates greater participation by the patient in the final health bill. German patients, accustomed to cheap healthcare, must develop an awareness of its cost, they say. Above all, they fear a victorious health minister will increase budgetary restrictions next year or bring in new ones, further threatening incomes.</p>

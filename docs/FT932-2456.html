			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Devro float gives Pounds 224m valuation DEVRO, the Scotland-based company which claims to be the world's leading maker of sausage casings made from the natural protein collagen, is valued at Pounds 224m in a flotation in which the issue price is 170p. It will raise Pounds 76.6m for the company. The flotation, sponsored by Charterhouse with NatWest Wood Mackenzie as brokers, involves placing 52m ordinary shares, primarily with UK institutions, and offering 28m shares to the public. Dealings begin on June 30. On the basis of pro-forma earnings of 10.5p and a dividend of 5.5p for 1992, the shares have an historic p/e of 16.2 and yield of 4 per cent. Devro made operating profits of Pounds 22.1m on sales of Pounds 82.7m last year. COMMENT This flotation offers investors the chance to buy a niche company with the market and technological power of a multinational. It has a commanding position in a world that few people think about, or even care to. But investors need not squirm. With a share of its main market three times that of its nearest international competitor (and there are only three of them) Devro's operating ratios and cash flow are astonishingly robust. Barriers to entry by competitors are high. Any downside includes exposure to EC legislation on food, developing country risk and continuing competition from cheaper gut which is dominant in Germany. The offer is finely priced exactly in line with the rest of the food sector with a prospective p/e of 13, assuming pre-tax profits for the full year of about Pounds 25m. It should be popular with institutions. Retail investors may require more education. The shares should go to a premium.</p>

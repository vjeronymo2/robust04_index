			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (13): Market upswing sparks a revival - The US THE US venture capital industry, which enjoyed a feast of funds in the 1980s, followed by a famine in the early 1990s, is now enjoying growth once more. During 1992, US venture capital funds raised Dollars 2.54bn, double the Dollars 1.27bn of 1991, which represented a 10-year low for the industry, according to figures from Venture Economics, a New Jersey based statistical service. And in the first six months of this year funds raised totalled Dollars 1.29bn. Disbursement of funds to US entrepreneurial companies, which usually follow a roughly similar pattern to the amount of money raised, totalled Dollars 2.54bn in 1992, up 54 per cent on the Dollars 1.65bn of 1991. Why the revival? The main reason is the upswing in US equity markets over the past two years and the particularly strong markets for small company stocks and for initial public offerings of stocks in small company flotations. The sight of shareholders in small companies which have come to market making huge gains on their investments has spurred portfolio managers to take a fresh look at putting money into venture funds. A healthy public offering market, which enables fund managers to liquidate their portfolios more easily, also encourages them to put new money into this area. Many fund managers argue that they have leant a lot from the problems they experienced in the late 1980s, when so much money was poured indiscriminately into venture funds that returns from many were poor. They intend to be much more selective this time round. Others add that with conventional stock and bond portfolios expected to show much more modest growth in the 1990s than in the preceding decade, venture capital funds hold out the hope of relatively attractive capital appreciation. A recent survey of venture capital fund performance by Venture Economics showed an overall industry internal rate of return of 13.9 per cent in 1992. Another factor which could provide some stimulation to the industry is the budget package recently pushed through Congress by President Clinton, which gave tax breaks to individuals who invest in small companies for a five year period. The sector able to attract most funds is software and services, which drew in Dollars 561.8m in 1992, up 67 per cent over 1991. However, its share of disbursements fell from 24.8 per cent to 22.1 per cent, thanks to the strength of some other fields. Medical and healthcare businesses received Dollars 442m, nearly three times the 1991 total, and accounted for 17.4 per cent of 1992 disbursements, according to Venture Economics. Keen investor interest in the area was underlined by the fact that it produced the greatest number of venture capital initial public offerings in both 1991 and 1992. However, uncertainty over the Clinton Government's healthcare reform package may have slowed growth in this sector in 1993. TELEPHONE and data communications companies received Dollars 366m in 1992 as the US geared up for the much-forecast multi-media revolution which is supposed to transform communications practices over the next few decades. Biotechnology companies gathered Dollars 261m in 1992, more than double the previous year, with their share of total outlays advancing from 8.2 per cent to 10.3 per cent. By contrast, computer hardware companies attracted only 5.4 per cent outlays, down from 12.4 per cent. The latter figure points up a long-term change in the US industry, which began just after world war two with the foundation of ARD, a venture fund established in Boston by a group of entrepreneurs involved in Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The single most important event in ARD's history - and a landmark in the growth of the entire venture capital business - was its investment in the late 1950s in the then tiny Digital Equipment, which grew into the world's second largest computer manufacturer. Other important landmarks in the growth of the sector included providing the seed money for Apple Computer, and at one point computer hardware companies accounted for almost 40 per cent of venture capital disbursements. The change in the sectoral distribution of funds has been matched by changes in the type of investor involved in the industry, and the age of company in which they put their funds. Initially, wealthy families and individuals provided the main source of funds, but legislative changes in the late 1970s - to capital gains tax rates and investment guidelines - encouraged institutional investors to enter the arena much more aggressively. Pension funds now account for over 40 per cent of venture fund pools, compared to around 10 per cent for endowments and foundations and roughly similar proportions for individuals and corporations. Large US corporations have been reducing their exposure to the venture capital sector, due in no small measure to the global recession of the past few years and a need to cut costs. A survey by Venture Economics shows that 79 big US international corporations still have formal, strategically-oriented venture capital investment programmes, compared with 100 identified in 1990. Mr Robert Mast, vice-president of Venture Economics, explains that 'the economic climate of the past few years has been hard on corporate venture programmes, which tend to be strongly impacted by acquisitions, management changes and other shifts in corporate strategy.' However, the survey did identify 15 new venture capital programmes formed since 1990, led by investments in medical and healthcare companies. THE bulk of venture capital funds is going into already established companies which need money for expansion, rather than into pure start-up businesses. So-called ' later stage' deals gathered three quarters of disbursements last year, compared with 68 per cent in 1991. Some analysts say the move away from early stage deals reflects the strength of the initial public offering market, with investors keen to take a stake in businesses not long before they are floated. Others complain that the prominence in the market of institutional funds, with their eyes on short-term returns, has meant a 'perversion' of classic venture fund investing, with its focus on start-up companies and patient, long-term investing.</p>

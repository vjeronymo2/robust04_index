			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS SUITABILITY FOR JOB IS DEBATED;  </P> <P> NEW SOVIET CONGRESS ELECTS GORBACHEV TO PRESIDENCY  </P> <P> Mikhail S. Gorbachev, general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, was  elected overwhelmingly Thursday at the first meeting of the Soviet Union's new  congress to fill the country's strengthened executive presidency.  </P> <P> Gorbachev immediately pledged to use his increased powers to accelerate the  pace of his political and economic reforms and to broaden their scope.  </P> <P> His election by the first democratically elected Soviet legislature in 70 years  gives Gorbachev, 58, broad executive authority to shape the nation's foreign  and domestic policies and makes him the leader of the new congress as well. He  also remains the party's general secretary.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who became the sole candidate for president after other nominees  withdrew or were rejected, received nearly 96% of the 2,210 ballots cast in the  Congress of People's Deputies. Eighty-seven members voted against him in the  secret ballot.  </P> <P> Although his election was never in doubt, Gorbachev's suitability for the  presidency was debated, often sharply, for several hours, with the deputies  taking their new responsibilities quite seriously.  </P> <P> Replying to their questions, Gorbachev declared his intention to speed the  democratization of the Soviet political system, replacing a decades-old system  of commands from the top with dialogue at all levels.  </P> <P> Referring to his program of political and economic restructuring, he  acknowledged that perestroika is facing great difficulties now, but these  latest reforms should, he repeated, help break through the conservative  resistance to them.  </P> <P> The first meeting of the Congress of People's Deputies was itself a major step  -- participants again and again stressed its historic character -- in the  reform process here.  </P> <P> The 2,250 deputies were chosen for the most part in the first truly contested  elections since the earliest days of the Soviet state, and the new Congress  has, as the result of constitutional changes, far more authority and  independence than any previous legislature. Past legislatures are now  acknowledged here to have been little more than rubber stamps for party  decisions.  </P> <P> The new executive presidency makes Gorbachev the formulator of the country's  domestic and foreign policies. He recommends the appointment of the premier for  approval by the legislature; he heads the country's defense council, and he can  exercise broad, and so far undefined, authority under a constitutional  provision saying simply that the president "shall issue orders." The old  presidency, which Gorbachev had held since last Oct. 1, was largely ceremonial.  </P> <P> The Congress of People's Deputies will also elect about 540 of its members to  serve in the Supreme Soviet, which has been reconstituted as a standing  legislature with full lawmaking authority but under the congress.  </P> <P> Together, the strengthened presidency and legislature are part of Gorbachev's  broad reform effort, ending the Communist Party's long monopoly on power by  sharing it with other segments of Soviet society.  </P> <P> With millions around the country watching the session on television -- even the  debates over rules were broadcast live -- the proceedings at the Palace of  Congresses in the Kremlin conveyed the drama and excitement of a nation setting  out, with both hope and trepidation, on a new course.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boldly Challenged  </P> <P> In scenes unprecedented since the earliest days of the Soviet state, deputies  boldly called on Gorbachev to explain the country's deepening economic crisis  and its mounting inter-ethnic tensions.  </P> <P> "Please tell us is it right to use the army for punitive operations against our  own people?" a deputy from the Baltic republic of Estonia asked Gorbachev,  recalling the deaths of 21 people when troops were sent into Tbilisi in the  southern Soviet Republic of Georgia last month.  </P> <P> "Was a country house built for you in the Crimea?" a Leningrad deputy demanded,  wanting to know how Gorbachev stood on the highly sensitive issue of  privileges, often verging on corruption, that the Soviet leadership has  enjoyed.  </P> <P> His wife, Raisa, was both criticized and defended for the prominent role she  plays at home and abroad. "Napoleon started out as a national leader," one  deputy said, "but because of the ambitions of his wife ended up as an emperor."  </P> <P> And Andrei D. Sakharov, the nuclear physicist and human rights campaigner, said  that, although he respected Gorbachev and believed that only he could lead the  country at this time, he could not vote for him without first hearing his  program for future reforms.  </P> <P> "Do we have the right to elect the head of state before discussions, before  debates and before the resolution of political questions that will define the  future of our country?" Sakharov asked, opening the session.  </P> <P> "We shall disgrace ourselves in front of our people if we do this. I supported  Gorbachev many times, and I do not see another person for the post. But this  support of mine is conditional in nature.  </P> <P> "I think that Gorbachev gave birth to perestroika, and he must say what has  happened to the country during the past four years," Sakharov said. "We must  say what achievements and what mistakes we have made and also what we are going  to do in the nearest future to overcome the extremely difficult situation of  our country."  </P> <P> There was even a challenge to the legitimacy of Gorbachev's presiding over the  opening debates on procedural matters, and the discussions were stopped briefly  to reconfirm his temporary chairmanship of the session.  </P> <P> "What is happening in this hall is totally out of the ordinary for all of us,"  Gorbachev said later as the debate over his leadership grew increasingly frank.  "And I see it," he added, amid thunderous applause, "as the most convincing  proof that perestroika is pressing firmly ahead."  </P> <P> Most speakers praised Gorbachev for launching the reforms that have transformed  the Soviet political scene, restoring the hope for the "bright future" that  socialism had promised and giving the country a sense of confidence that it  could achieve it.  </P> <P> "He is the man who shook the sleeping kingdom of stagnation," writer Chingiz  Aitmatov declared, nominating Gorbachev. "He had the valor to start a new  revolution."  </P> <P> Yet, even Aitmatov was critical. Gorbachev and his supporters have to recognize  "the errors that have been committed in perestroika up till now, in the economy  and in inter-ethnic relations," Aitmatov said, touching the three most  sensitive issues here.  </P> <P> The most serious criticism of Gorbachev came on the question of combining the  posts of president and party leader. Many deputies said flatly that no man, not  even Gorbachev, should occupy the two most powerful posts in the country.  </P> <P> "To ensure that the party autocracy is excluded from influencing the direction  of the state," one Moscow deputy said, "the posts of president and general  secretary must be separated."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who listened carefully to all the criticism, argued in reply that it  was necessary to bring together the two jobs, at least for the next five years,  to push through further changes, but he promised that the arrangement would be  reviewed before the next parliamentary election in 1994.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Use of Troops Discussed  </P> <P> He assured the deputies that he and the party's ruling Politburo opposed the  use of combat troops to police the country, but he said that the government  also had an obligation to maintain stability and avoid bloodshed, particularly  from inter-ethnic clashes.  </P> <P> To settle the question of privileges -- he said his only country house, or  dacha, was one owned by the state -- Gorbachev proposed a special legislative  commission to "do a full inventory of all we have and the decide what to do  about it."  </P> <P> In an effort to ensure a contested election, a construction engineer from  northern Russia had put forward his own candidacy for president, outlining an  alternative, more radical reform program and drawing some support.  </P> <P> Alexander Obolensky, the engineer, argued that a choice was essential for the  country's emerging democracy, but he was rejected as a candidate when only 689  of the deputies voted for inclusion of his name on the ballot rather than the  50% needed.  </P> <P> "I am no fool," Obolensky said. "I know I don't stand any chance whatsoever,  but I think we should create the precedent for all future elections."  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, the Communist Party maverick, who quit his ministerial post  this week to sit as a deputy representing the Moscow at-large constituency, was  nominated by supporters, who said that his boldness was needed in the top  leadership.  </P> <P> But Yeltsin immediately withdrew himself from consideration, saying that he  supported the party's nominee, Gorbachev, out of adherence to "party  discipline."  </P> <P> FULL OF SURPRISES -- Spontaneity ruled as the new congress opened. Page 18  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINTS OF REFORM IN SOVIET CONGRESS  </P> <P> Some proposals that reformist representatives will bring to the new Congress of  People's Deputies, which convened Thursday:  </P> <P> Revision of a government decree that allows internal security troops to be used  to clear demonstrations.  </P> <P> Repeal of a law making it illegal to insult or discredit the government and  officials.  </P> <P> Decentralization of the Soviet economy, allowing the country's 15 constituent  republics to run their own industries.  </P> <P> Sovereignty for the republics.  </P> <P> Replacement of a decree that limits the actions of private cooperatives with a  new, more liberal law.  </P> <P> Creation of congressional watchdog commissions for the KGB and the military.  </P> <P> Investigation of the fatal clash between troops and demonstrators last month in  Tbilisi, capital of Soviet Georgia.  </P> <P> Transfer of legislative power from the 540-member Supreme Soviet to the  2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies.  </P> <P> Revision of the election law to have the public elect the Supreme Soviet  directly and to limit each citizen to one vote.  </P> <P> SOURCE: Associated Press  </P></p>

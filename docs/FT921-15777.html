			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Fabius set to lead French Socialists MR LAURENT FABIUS, speaker of the French national assembly and former prime minister, is expected to be elected to succeed Mr Pierre Mauroy as the Socialist party's first secretary when its governing committee meets tomorrow, writes Ian Davidson in Paris. Mr Mauroy resigned yesterday He has won the appointment largely because of the decisive support of Mr Michel Rocard, also a former prime minister and leader of the third largest faction in the party. Between them the two men command the support of more than half the votes in the committee. The deal, hammered out by party barons, significantly strengthens Mr Rocard's chances of selection as the Socialist candidate in the 1995 presidential election. Mr Mauroy yesterday described him as 'the virtual candidate' of the party.</p>

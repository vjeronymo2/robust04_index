			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Scandals bring bad start to the year for Miyazawa: Japan's PM could come under fire from his party MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, will run into a barrage of criticism from MPs after the Diet assembles today for its first session of 1992. Top of the government's agenda is securing the smooth passage of the budget for the financial year starting in April. The bill includes plans for increased public works spending, which Mr Miyazawa promised Mr George Bush during the US president's recent visit to Japan. But Mr Miyazawa will be under pressure from opposition parties to give priority to debate over a financial scandal involving Mr Fumio Abe, a former minister and close associate of the prime minister, who is under arrest on suspicion of taking bribes. Opposition MPs may also demand an inquiry into a separate affair concerning payments made to politicians by Sagawa Kyubin, a transport group under investigation for alleged links with gangster-owned companies. Both the ruling Liberal Democratic party and the opposition will be manoeuvring with one event on their minds - the election in July for the upper house of the Diet. The LDP has a majority in the lower house but not in the upper house, where it lost control in 1989 at the height of the Recruit bribery scandal. In extremis, the LDP could call an election of the lower house at the same time, since the ruling party tends to fare better in double elections. But party leaders will be loath to do this because lower house elections swallow large amounts of campaign funds. Mr Miyazawa is in an awkward position. Because of the LDP's lack of a majority in the upper house, he has to seek a compromise with the opposition parties. But for all his renowned intelligence, he is poor at backroom politicking, and his personal support in the LDP is weak; so, if he does badly, he may find himself under attack from snipers in his own party. There are already suggestions floating around Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, that the prime minister should resign. The matter of Mr Abe makes things much worse. Mr Abe is suspected of accepting Y80bn (Pounds 350m) in political donations from Kyowa, a steelframe maker turned property developer, in return for leaking road planning information during his stint as director general of the Hokkaido Development Agency in 1989. Mr Abe was, until a month ago, Mr Miyazawa's faction manager. How close the two men were is a matter of speculation and the opposition parties want to question Mr Miyazawa as soon as possible. The Sagawa Kyubin affair is a more difficult target for the opposition because details have yet to be made public and because opposition MPs are among those suspected to have received money from the scandal-hit company. Mr Miyazawa's planned response to questions about political financing is to introduce a fund-raising reform bill which would force politicians to disclose more information about their sources of money. However, opposition parties do not see the plan as a substitute to probing current scandals. Besides, MPs from all parties are in little hurry to enact a law which might reduce the flow of donations. Even if the prime minister safely negotiates the quicksands of scandal he could be swamped by the difficulties of the other bills before the Diet. The opposition Social Democratic party (the former Japan Socialist party) wants cuts in proposed defence spending. Opposition parties also have serious doubts about a controversial bill authorising the despatch of Japanese troops overseas on United Nations peacekeeping missions. The government will come under further fire over Japan's position in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt trade talks. MPs of all parties are likely to press the government for assurances that it will not lift the ban on rice imports. Mr Miyazawa's position was strengthened this month when Mr Shin Kanemaru, LDP elder statesman, became party vice president at Mr Miyazawa's request. But it seems unlikely that Mr Kanemaru will be standing close to the prime minister when Mr Miyazawa comes under fire in the Diet. The next few weeks could be a lonely time for Mr Miyazawa.</p>

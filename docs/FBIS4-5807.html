			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Futoshi Shirai,  administrative vice minister of posts and telecommunications,  said Thursday [14 April] he will admonish the ministry's  broadcasting bureau chief for inadvertent remarks on action that  might be taken against telecasting companies which made  erroneous forecasts of poll results in last July's general  election. Shirai made the remark in a press conference,  commenting on what was said by Akimasa Egawa in a press  conference Monday.    The bureau chief told the press some broadcasting companies  had reported that certain candidates were considered safe bets  for election, but that several of them were found later to have  been unsuccessful.    Egawa said some administrative action, such as admonition,  verbal or in writing, will be given to such companies.    The vice minister said his ministry will decide whether or  not to ask the companies to be more careful in making forecasts  while giving due consideration to freedom in editing programs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "ip": "Inflation Slowing, Reserves Growing; Good </F> News From the Slovak National Bank Directorate"]    [Text] Bratislava--Yesterday's meeting of the Slovak  National Bank [NBS] Directorate considered the main trends of  monetary development to be favorable, NBS Vice Governor Marian  Jusko said after the meeting.    The rate of inflation continued to slow in March. It went up  0.5 percent in March and 2.6 percent since the beginning of the  year. According to preliminary data, the money supply expressed  in terms of the M2 aggregate declined by 5 billion korunas [Sk]  in March, compared with February. In terms of the M1 aggregate  (money in circulation and nonterm deposits), it declined by  Sk4.2 billion. The aggregate volume of primary deposits declined  by Sk6.1 billion in March, which was caused, to a decisive  extent, by the deadline for filing tax returns [last day of  March].    Refinancing credits declined by Sk2.5 billion in March. The  state budget deficit was reduced by Sk700 million and amounted  to Sk4.5 billion as of 27 April. The government's net position  vis-a-vis the banking system is approximately Sk60 billion.    The NBS's foreign exchange reserves are growing gradually.  At the beginning of January, they stood at $340.17 million, in  mid-February at $350 million, by 23 March at $427.54 million,  and by 21 April at $536.4 million (all these figures exclude  gold reserves). The share of new loans in the increase has been  minimal; purchases from commercial banks at the foreign exchange  fixing have been decisive. The entire banking sector availed  itself of foreign exchange reserves of $1.896 billion as of 20  April.    The deficit on the clearing account with the Czech Republic  is declining. At the end of December 1993, Slovakia had a  deficit of 168.9 million XCU's [clearing European Currency  Units] (Sk6.6 billion), at the end of January 1994 a deficit of  176.1 million XCU's (Sk6.9 million), and at the end of February  a deficit of 125.9 million XCU's (Sk5.4 billion). By 1 April,  the deficit dropped to 59.9 million XCU's (Sk2.3 billion), by 15  April to 42.1 million XCU's, and by 27 April to 12 million XCU's  (Sk489.4 million).    NBS Vice Governor Marian Jusko said that the NBS measures to  reduce the amount of money in circulation, made necessary by the  rapid increase in the state budget deficit in the last two weeks  of last year, fulfilled their purpose and that the granting of  refinancing credits is gradually being renewed. Promissory  notes to finance agriculture have started being rediscounted  [reeskontovat] again. The Sk500 million, which is the limit set  aside for this purpose, should help bridge the shortage of funds  in laying foundations for the new harvest.</p>

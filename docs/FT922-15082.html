			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Venezuela central bank chief quits under fire THE president of Venezuela's central bank, Mr Miguel Rodriguez, has resigned in an effort to ease political pressure on the beleagured government of President Carlos Andres Perez. He named, late on Wednesday, Ms Ruth de Krivoy, a respected economist and the first woman to hold the job, to head the central bank. Mr Rodriguez, who only took the post in late February, had come under attack from Mr Perez's opponents. The outgoing central bank chief was the main architect of the highly unpopular economic reform programme the Perez government initiated three years ago. It is not clear, however, whether his departure will much reduce pressure on the president and on other free-market proponents in the cabinet. Ms de Krivoy held an executive post in the central bank in the 1970s, but has spent most of her professional life as a private sector economist.</p>

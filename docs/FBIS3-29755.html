"Rice demand from Japan is artificial. It will go on for a  while, not forever," said a source. Japan allowed rice imports  for the first time in decades this year after an unusually wet  summer damaged its crops. Under a new Gatt accord, the country  is also required to import four per cent of total domestic rice  consumption starting in 1995.    Thai rice farmers enjoy high prices due to Japan's demand  for  at least 800,000 tonnes of premium grain, said the source.  Demand has steadily pushed up global prices for the product.  To ensure supplies, Thai exporters helped bolster the domestic  price of premium rice. Tokyo agreed to buy 457,000 tonnes of  100 per cent and sticky rice in four lots. Last year's price  for the first lot started at US$273 per tonne and soared to $450  for the fourth. Thailand plans to expedite delivery of the  latest 194,000 tonnes at a freight-on-board price of $495 to  Japan.    Currently, the domestic price of rice is Bt510 per 60 kg,  while it is normally Bt490 at this time of year. The source  warned that if Japanese demand for rice increases, "Thais,  perhaps, could be forced to pay more for the same rice." But if  Japan halts its orders, the price plunge would cause havoc  primarily among farmers, the source said. Japan's rice imports  mainly benefit large Thai companies, the source added. Under  Japan's system, rice import quotas are allocated to 11 major  Japanese trading firms. Amounts assigned depend on each  company's performance since World War II.    These semi-cartels are then paired with major Thai rice  exporters to facilitate orders. Small and medium-sized Thai  exporters are barred from competing. Among the pairs are  Japan's Mitsui with Thailand's Hong Yiah Seng; Mitsubishi with  Capital Rice; Marubeni with Thai Hua; Tomen with Huay Chuan  Rice; Seto with EPC Rice; and Nichiman with Soon Hua Seng.    The same source told THE NATION that Capital Rice's venture  with Mitsubishi resulted in a 60,000 tonne order for the former  when Tokyo agreed to import an additional 194,000 tonnes.    "It is believed that a company could have a profit of $100  per tonne," the source said.    Small and medium-sized Thai rice exporters have rushed to  Japan to lobby for quota allocation changes enabling them to  share in the wealth, the source said, as Tokyo plans to import  200,000 tonnes from Bangkok in addition to its 800,000 tonne  order last year.</p>

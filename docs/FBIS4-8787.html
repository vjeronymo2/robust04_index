			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmet Begicevic for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and </F> Television from Travnik]    [Text] A general alert was sounded in Travnik this evening  because the aggressor fired several tank shells at the town from  the foothills of Mount Vlasic.    A child was wounded by shrapnel and, at the same time, an  artillery attack was launched on the first defense lines in  Turbe, a Muslim-held town west of Travnik.    At dusk the inhabitants of Travnik witnessed how NATO  aircraft chased after a Serb plane that had suddenly appeared in  our country's airspace, flying at a low altitude. According to  eye-witness accounts, it is most likely that this was a MiG-21  plane which acrobatically fled toward Banja Luka in panic after  the NATO planes appeared. Due to low clouds we are not able to  inform you about the epilogue of this close air encounter, but  we can say that the (?NATO) air force was active above central  Bosnia for almost one hour, which is an unusually long period  and is a sign that something indeed took place in the sky.</p>

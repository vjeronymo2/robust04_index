			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Dyno seeks US joint venture Dyno Industrier, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in chemicals, said yesterday that its US unit Ireco was holding talks with Imperial Chemical Industries' US unit, Atlas Powder, to establish a joint venture to produce dynamite for the North American market, writes Karen Fossli. Dyno said that the aim of a new joint company was to take over, rationalise and continue the dynamite production of the existing two companies. 'It is expected that the parties will complete negotiations during the summer of 1992,' Dyno said. The company explained that negotiations on the consolidation come as a result of the continuing fall in demand for dynamite in North America. Dyno said Ireco and Atlas Powder had combined annual dynamite production of 36,000 tonnes. Last year worldwide explosives sales accounted for 22 per cent of Dyno's NKr3.5bn turnover.</p>

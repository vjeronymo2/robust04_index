			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said here today that China places great importance on the  growth of its friendly relations and cooperation with the  Republic of Korea (ROK).    Meeting with ROK President Kim Yong-sam at the Diaoyutai  State Guest House this evening Li said that President Kim had  come to visit China just a year after taking office, which  demonstrated that the president highly valued the development of  ROK-China ties.    He said that though the two countries established diplomatic  ties not long ago, their relationship has developed rapidly due  to the common efforts. Personnel exchanges have increased  rapidly while bilateral economic cooperation has expanded  continually, he added.    Developing the good-neighborly ties between the two  countries  will conform to the aspirations and fundamental interests of the  two peoples, he said.    Kim said he was satisfied with his fruitful talks with  Chinese President Jiang Zemin and pleased to have the chance to  meet with Premier Li.    Noting that the ROK and China have enjoyed long traditional  relations, he said there is great potential for furthering  bilateral economic ties and trade.    Kim said that the ROK encourages its enterprises to invest  more in China. As long as the two sides strengthen cooperation,  the future for such relationship will be brighter, he said.    Talking about the situation on the Korean peninsula, Li said  that China pays great attention to having a good surrounding  environment.    Therefore, he said, China hopes that the Korean peninsula  will maintain a peaceful and stable situation. This, he  continued, conforms to the fundamental interests of the Chinese  people and the people of the north and the south of the Korean  peninsula as well.    The Chinese premier said there had been some progress  recently on solving the nuclear issue concerning the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea. But now there appeared difficulties  and twists.    Of course, he said, it needs time to accomplish anything. As  long as the parties concerned conduct dialogue patiently,  finally a way to solve this issue properly can be found.    It was just like erecting a bridge to cross a river. One  needs to create a good atmosphere and an environment of  relaxation in order to resume the dialogue among the four  parties, he said.    Kim said he agreed with Li Peng's view on the settlement of  the nuclear issue through negotiations.    He said it is the most effective way to conduct sincere and  direct dialogue between the parties involved in the issue. It  is the ROK's hope that such dialogue will be resumed, so as to  find a proper solution to the issue.    During the meeting, Kim invited Li to visit the ROK at a  time  convenient to the premier. Li expressed thanks and accepted the  invitation with pleasure.    Li Peng's wife and Kim's wife attended the meeting.    Also participating in the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen; Wang Zhongyu, minister in  charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission Wu Jichuan,  chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and  minister of posts and communications; as well as Yun Tong-yun,  ROK minister of telecommunications and posts; Kim Chol-su,  minister of trade, industry, and energy; Kim Si-chung, minister  of science and techology; and others.    After the meeting, Li Peng and his wife gave a dinner in  honor of Kim and his wife and their party.</p>

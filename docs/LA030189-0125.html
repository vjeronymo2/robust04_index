Golan and Globus headed the Los  Angeles-based movie company from 1979 until last April, when its new European  backers, led by Florio Fiorini and Giancarlo Parretti, took control.  </P> <P> Globus, who will serve on the parent's executive committee with Fiorini and  Parretti, said he was glad to be working with them to put together "a major  motion picture company." The Fiorini-Parretti group recently started Pathe  Entertainment with Alan Ladd Jr. as chairman and agreed to buy New World  Entertainment.  </P></p>

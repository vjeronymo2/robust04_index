The agenda for  this conference entitled "Democracy in Haiti is the Solution to  the Refugee Crisis" might be changed at the request of the  United States, according to a diplomat who wanted to remain  anonymous. The conference on the Haitian crisis, the question of  human rights, and the rights of refugees could take place from  14 to 16 January.    According to the HAITIAN PRESS AGENCY, there will be many  observers such as guests from the UN conference, guests from the  four countries friendly to Haiti, and delegates from the 10th  Department [the Haitian diaspora]. They also plan to invite  delegates from [political] parties represented in the Haitian  parliament, particularly those that signed the New York pact.  People from Haitian democratic organizations and representatives  of the religious community here (?will also be invited).    The purpose of this summit, according to explanations, is to  establish a dialogue between experts on human rights protection  and those working in the diplomatic sectors and the democratic  movements in order to find a quick means to resolve the Haitian  crisis and allow the restoration of democracy.    The refugee problem remains a particularly thorny issue for  the United States, which has maintained a naval blockade around  Haiti since October 1993 to prevent the boat people's entering  the United States. It also decided to repatriate those Haitians  as soon as the U.S. Coast Guard catches them. The U.S. State  Department adopted this position in May 1992. Diplomats from  Haiti's four friendly countries say that they will merely be in  attendance and that they will have a very low profile; others  say (?their attitude will depend on) the agenda set. AFP has  reported that they [not further identified] also let it be  understood that they will do their best to ensure adherence to  the agenda.    The OAS does not take an official stand on that issue.  According to diplomatic sources, President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide asked OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares  to participate in this meeting. Soares said that the OAS cannot  involve itself in such an adventure, according to a diplomat who  wanted to remain anonymous.    President Aristide has called for the Miami conference in  response to the idea of the national conference in Haiti that  Prime Minister Robert Malval advocated. Since then, there has  been a divergence between the United States and (?President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide) as to the policy he would like to adopt  regarding a national conference. Up to the present, the United  States has supported a national conference to untangle the  crisis situation in Haiti, although it does not share President  Aristide's idea of a conference on refugees in Miami on 14, 15,  and 16 January.

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> '42ND STREET' IN SANTA BARBARA  </P> <P> When Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera opened "42nd Street" in June, the  organization was just a kid. But when the show closes next week, Santa Barbara  Civic Light Opera will have emerged as -- a star.  </P> <P>  Well, maybe not a star -- civic light operas don't get that kind of publicity.  But the Santa Barbara production of "42nd Street," the 1980 musical based on  the 1933 movie about a chorine's big break on Broadway, is so crisply executed  that it's easy to get carried away by its spirit.  </P> <P> And there are statistics that support the notion that "42nd Street" is Santa  Barbara Civic Light Opera's big break. The production has broken box-office  records at the Lobero Theater, selling out virtually every performance. This is  a well-drilled ensemble, directed and choreographed by Jon Engstrom, a member  of the original Broadway company. For the extension of the show, which began  last week (after a hiatus following the initial five-week run) Engstrom also  plays the role of the choreographer.  </P> <P> Sherri Sperling Bannister sparkles as the kid who becomes an overnight  sensation. Fred Lehto isn't as cynical as some of his predecessors in the role  of the hard-driving director -- this guy really believes in Broadway.  </P> <P> Catherine Dougher and Carol Swarbrick are properly tart-tongued and  full-throated as the prima donna and the wisecracking writer, respectively, and  Kirby Ward is immensely likable as the company's fleet-footed leading man.  </P> <P> Robin Wagner's set comes from the national touring company but a local  costumer, Janice Martin, created 300 outfits (with a budget of $35,000). The  look is almost as lavish as the original production's. Except for slight  intonation problems early in Act II, Elise Unruh's musical direction is  top-notch.  </P> <P>  At 33 E. Canon Perdido, Santa Barbara, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.,  Sundays at 7 p.m., Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m., through Sept. 10.  Tickets: $15.75-$17.25; (805) 963-0761.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As a draft proposal for raising the consumption tax  rate, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] has firmed up its plan to  submit to the government's Tax System Research Council (an  advisory organ to the prime minister) several choices centered  on the idea of setting the tax rate at 7 percent. Since the  council had decided to hold hearings in local cities in early  June to explain the several choices in tax system reform, the  MOF, which serves as the council's executive office [jimukyoku],  mapped out the draft to be used as a base of discussion. It is  expected that opposition parties and other organizations will  oppose the proposal because a 7-percent tax increase is  incorporated, as did the national welfare tax proposed by former  Prime Minister Hosokawa. It seems that lively debate will also  be held in the council regarding efforts to trim expenditures,  on the assumption of increasing taxes later through  administrative reform and as to how much a tax increase will  improve the government's welfare services.    According to parties concerned, the proposal will call  mainly  for an increase in the consumption tax to either 1) 7 percent  in two years; 2) 7 percent in three years; or 3) 8 percent in  two years. These choices will be offered on the assumption that  the government will continue to have a 5.5 trillion yen tax  reduction even after this fiscal year by uniformly reducing  income and resident taxes by 20 percent. Either way, the  proposal is designed for an actual tax increase that exceeds the  scale of tax reduction.    Of the choices, it seems that the one to increase the  consumption tax to "7 percent in three years," which was a tax  increase rate of the national welfare tax concept, will serve as  a base of discussion at the council. However, the MOF--in  addition to proposing the idea of increasing the consumption tax  to 8 percent as a case for significantly increasing a source of  revenue on the assumption that expenditures are related to  welfare services -- is studying the possibility of submitting a  proposal designed to increase the consumption tax rate to some  10 percent as an example of further increasing financial  resources. It seems that among other things, the ministry will  explain, for each choice, how much revenue will be generated,  how to secure a source of revenue to make up for a shortfall  that will be created as a result of the planned tax reduction,  and what the future financial situation will be like.    Under the national welfare tax concept, which was proposed  out of the blue, only about 800 billion yen, even if inflation  is taken into consideration, would have been allocated for  welfare expenditures although it would have made some 3.5  trillion yen in tax revenues after tax reduction. Because of  this, some people criticized the concept, saying it is an idea  far from improving the welfare system.    Regarding the fact that the MOF worked out these choices, a  senior MOF official said: "A consumption tax rate of less than  7 percent is not enough to secure financial resources to cover a  shortfall from the tax reduction." However, it is expected that  opposition parties and other organizations, which oppose  increasing taxes above the 7-percent rate of the national  welfare tax, will demand the government keep down the tax rate.  It seems that the proposal to set the tax rate at 7 percent  will become an actual base of discussion.    After explaining the proposal, the Tax System Research  Council plans to listen to people's opinions at the local  sessions, slated to be held on 7 and 10 June. The TSRC plans to  reflect opinions of the people in its recommendation, which will  be prepared by the end of June.</p>

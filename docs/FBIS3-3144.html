			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Xu Xingtang (1776 5281 1016), Pu Liye </F> (5543 4539 2814), and Wu Yilong (1566 1150 7893): "The Origin  of Xiamen's Application for Local Legislative Power -- An  Interview With Zhang Binsheng, Xiamen City People's Congress  Standing Committee Vice Chairman"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- As the Second Session  of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] will soon  deliberate the "Decision on Empowering the Xiamen City People's  Congress and Its Standing Committee and the Xiamen City People's  Government To Enact Laws, Regulations, and Rules for Enforcement  in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone [SEZ]," these reporters  today interviewed Zhang Binsheng, Xiamen City People's Congress  Standing Committee vice chairman, on this issue.    In 1989 and 1993, 30 or so deputies from the Fujian  deputation submitted a joint motion first to the Second Session  of the Seventh NPC and then to the First Session of the Eighth  NPC, and had it included in the agenda of both NPC Standing  Committees.    Zhang Binsheng said: The Xiamen SEZ was established in 1980.  Viewed from the angle of the legal system, a SEZ only exists as  a result of a stipulation by policy and takes the form of a  special zone in the economic sense with an unclear legal status  but no legal distinction from other localities. Practice has  shown that the authority and credibility of some special  economic policies implemented in a SEZ would be in doubt if  these policies are not affirmed by any forms of corresponding  legislation. After the NPC adopted a resolution in 1981 to  empower Fujian Province to formulate separate economic laws and  regulations for its SEZ, the provincial people's congress has  done a lot of work in enacting a number of economic laws and  regulations for getting economic development off the ground in  its SEZ. Because of too much red tape and the legislative  progress' lagging behind the needs of practical development,  however, the provincial authorities had found some specific  problems lying beyond their reach in terms of powers and pace.  In view of this reality, the Xiamen SEZ's application for local  legislative power was placed on their agenda.    On the significance of Xiamen's application for local  legislative power, Zhang Binsheng said: The most important  point is Xiamen's desire to become a pilot zone for making  legislations related to Taiwan. NPC Chairman Qiao Shi had  repeatedly stressed the need to move ahead with local  legislation first and to set up experimental zones for  legislation. If Shenzhen is called an experimental zone for  legislation related to Hong Kong and Macao, then Xiamen would be  the most ideal place for setting up a zone for experimenting  with legislation involving Taiwan.    Zhang Binsheng went a step further and said: Once the issue  of "three exchanges" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait  is settled, Xiamen will be the top choice for a direct shipping  port. It has a unique advantage in cross-strait relations that  should be given a greater role. Being the mainland area with  the highest concentration of Taiwan investment as well as the  mainland port most frequently visited by Taiwan compatriots at  present, Xiamen has seen the endless emergence of Taiwan-related  legal affairs, including those of an economic nature such as  trade, economic exchanges, and investment; a floodgate of civil  legal relationships such as Taiwan- related marriages and estate  inheritances; as well as criminal cases such as sea smuggling  and airplane hijacking which have begun to crop up in recent  years. As these Taiwan-related legal affairs are rather  concentrated in Xiamen, the granting of local legislative power  to Xiamen is thus an issue concerning not only Xiamen itself but  whether Xiamen will have a chance to play a greater role and  make greater contribution to the great cause of reunifying the  motherland.    He said: This year is important to promoting and achieving  a breakthrough in the reform of the economic structure in an  all-round way. The extent, range, and difficulty of new reform  measures are all unprecedented. Xiamen as a SEZ should take the  lead in establishing a socialist market economic structure and  following international practice and play a demonstrative role  for the whole country. This is another important reason to give  legislative power to the Xiamen SEZ.    Zhang Binsheng said: The people in Fujian and Xiamen have  been expecting to obtain local legislative power for Xiamen and  have understood their great responsibility. If the on-going NPC  session will adopt the decision, people in Xiamen will certainly  cherish and properly use this power. In recent years, Xiamen  has been making long-term and annual plans for legislative work,  has made a lot of social investigations, and has gained  experience. The Xiamen City People's Congress Law Committee and  the city government's legislative bureau have always considered  it their main task. Xiamen has adequate legislative  organizations and legal personnel. The legislative forces of  Xiamen and Fujian can certainly handle the heavy task of local  legislation properly with the assistance of experts from the  central authorities and Beijing and by absorbing the advanced  experiences of the Shenzhen SEZ. Besides, the Fujian CPC  Committee and government have always supported Xiamen in  obtaining local legislative power.    He said: Xiamen has accumulated some experience in  legislation. Eight laws and regulations drafted by Xiamen have  been adopted by the Fujian Provincial People's Congress Standing  Committee. In addition, Xiamen has formulated more than 200  standardized administrative documents [xing zheng gui fan xing  wen jian 5887 2398 6016 5400 1840 2429 0115].</p>

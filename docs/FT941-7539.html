			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Observer: Ticking trousers Talk about red tape. A group of hacks wanting to visit the Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk have been asked for their national insurance numbers. Apparently, the government's health and safety regulations require compliance. But at least the visitors can hope to keep their trousers on, unlike a German doctor who visited Scotland's Dounreay power station recently. Unbeknownst to the poor man, his trews contained a drop of radioactive iodine used in treating a patient. Alarm bells rang and, since he was inside the plant, the regulations forbade his departing with radioactive material. He made his exit in a pair of Dounreay overalls.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Observer: Kudlow's high Lawrence Kudlow, Bear Stearns' chief economist, who has resigned after eight years with the company, says he wants to spend more time with his politics. He's got the experience - General Motors thinks he has broad public appeal, having long used him as a TV salesman for Cadillac cars. He's also got the connections, as former deputy budget director in the Reagan administration and more recently the economic brains behind Christine Whitman's successful campaign for the governorship of New Jersey. He turned down Whitman's offer of New Jersey state treasurer, probably seeking a bigger pool to swim in. Word is he will run for the Republicans against Daniel Moynihan, the celebrated Democrat senator from New York.</p>

			<p>Removal    [.sub]2[/]  <F P=102> 94FE0326E Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Dec 93 p 1 --  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0326E </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Air-Conditioning Research Institute of  Matsushita Seiko Co., Ltd. (Matsushita Seiko), has successfully  developed a chelating resin-based NO[.sub]x[/] remover that  was found to be highly effective in eliminating NO[.sub]2[/]  (nitrogen dioxide), the most harmful among NO[.sub]x[/]  (nitrogen oxides).    Matsushita Seiko plans, for the time being, to apply this  NO[.sub]x[/]-removal agent to filters that will be  incorporated in its own commercial products, including air  cleaners, air-supply-type ventilators and heat-exchanger-type  ventilators, to upgrade the functions of these products.    The developed NO[.sub]x[/] remover is based on the matrix  of a copolymer of styrene and divinyl-benzene, which is a  porous, polymeric, chelating resin. This matrix is derivatized  with a special functional group that undergoes a chemical  reaction with adsorbed NO[.sub]2[/] for removal. The agent is  capable of effectively removing NO[.sub]2[/] at an ultra-low  concentration (approximately 0.01 ppm) in air, and the  effectiveness lasts approximately 30 times longer than activated  charcoal on a unit weight basis. The resin is made in 0.8- to  1.2mm-sized spheres, so it can easily be attached to a piece of  urethane to produce a filter that yields little pressure loss,  and it is easy to handle. The resin is also capable of removing  other harmful gas components (including SO[.sub]x[/], i.e.,  sulfur oxides, and acetaldehyde).    In recent years, the atmospheric pollution by nitrogen  oxides  generated by automobiles has become a serious issue. Among  nitrogen oxides, NO[.sub]2[/] is considered to be one of  several causes for pediatric asthma and allergies, and the  atmospheric concentration of NO[.sub]2[/] is known to exceed  the environmental standard in some cases. Such outdoor air is  causing the worsening of indoor air quality.</p>

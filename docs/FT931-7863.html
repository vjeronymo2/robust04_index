			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (14): The price of fresh air - Diesel makers submit to tighter exhaust rules BY next October all new diesel-engined commercial vehicles must meet European exhaust emission limits on four different pollutants - three gases and dust. It is relatively easy to cut emissions, but marketing men and engineers want to do it with minimum cost and loss of fuel economy. Companies such as Mercedes-Benz and the proprietary engine maker Cummins have grasped the nettle by 'wrapping' the emission-related changes into a broader package of improvements. The cost penalties of meeting new environmental legislation from Brussels are hidden in a list price increase justified by other improvements. Many manufacturers' engine horsepower ratings have been revised upwards to overcome the loss of hill-climbing and acceleration performance which would otherwise result from the tighter emission limits. Independent road tests on the latest 'Euro 1' (emission compliant) 38-tonne articulated tractor units from Mercedes, MAN, Scania and ERF show that the latest 400-plus horsepower models can complete their journeys more rapidly with less fuel than their 1980s counterparts. Among heavy trucks introduced in the past 12 months are Iveco's EuroTech and the 75/85-series models from DAF. Both have performed well under road test conditions. Their cab and chassis designs have a refinement unknown a decade ago, which makes for safer driving over the longest inter-city hauls, at 38 or 40 tonnes all-up weight. Though their cabs and chassis mark them as undeniably new models, the EuroTech and 75/85 rivals are surprisingly conventional in the engine and driveline. The truck industry's more profound technical developments of the 1990s have appeared behind the more familiar images of established heavies, notably from Sweden. Scania is unique in offering a turbocompound engine - a 400 horsepower diesel whose exhaust gases are routed first through the familiar enforced-aspiration turbocharger, but then into a further small turbine (made by Holset in Huddersfield) which drives directly on to the engine flywheel. Turbocompounding raises the overall efficiency of the diesel engine to a new high of about 46 per cent, though its critics say its full benefits are felt only on continuous high-speed, high-load truck operation, such as American coast-to-coast running. Road test performance and fuel economy on the 11-litre Scania turbocompound have been satisfactory but not spectacular. Meanwhile, Volvo has concentrated on making heavy trucks easier to drive, with the introduction of its Geartronic gearshift system. It is the world's first electronically-controlled mechanical transmission to be offered to commercial truck buyers which needs no clutch pedal. It functions as a car-type fully automatic gearbox, but without the formidable cost, weight and fuel consumption penalties associated with the latter's torque converter drive. Geartronic is likely to add some Pounds 3,000 to the price of a right-hand-drive Volvo FL10 chassis when the option becomes available in June. On all the latest specification truck chassis there is a downside, in the form of additional tare weight. Engines tend to be heavier, because of their more elaborate fuel systems, which are being called upon to deliver more precisely metered quantities of fuel at much higher pressures. An intercooler - looking like a second radiator - has become almost unavoidable under the new emission laws, adding inevitable further weight. So too, of course, do 'perceived value' features, such as wind spoilers and cab interior embellishments, which now tend to be standard rather than optional. At lower truck weights, notably at the HGV driving licence breakpoint of 7.5 tonnes, competition is no less fierce, though buyers are more likely to look first at the selling price and then at the specification. Independent assessments of the three UK main contenders at 7.5 tonnes show the best-selling DAF 45-series, the Iveco EuroCargo and Mercedes' well-established 814 chassis to be all operationally-attractive vehicles.</p>

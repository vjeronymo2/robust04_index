			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Trade News: Miyazawa confident of import rise MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, leaves Tokyo today for Washington, confident that the Dollars 117bn domestic economic package announced on Tuesday, and the benefits it will have in increasing domestic demand for imports, is sufficient to soothe US concerns about its Dollars 46bn merchandise trade deficit with Japan. But he will not, by all official accounts, be bringing a new trade initiative to his first meeting with President Bill Clinton. The latter will have to be satisfied, for the time being, with a stimulant package designed to lift the Japanese economy out of its doldrums and thereby help boost world growth, and with a Japanese willingness to lend an attentive ear to any US ideas on how Japan might help reduce its massive trade surplus. Mr Miyazawa will convey his belief to Mr Clinton that the package will put the Japanese economy firmly on the road to recovery and that such macro-economic measures are the proper way to address the nagging problem of the two countries' trade imbalance. The lift that the new measures will give to imports is estimated by Japan's ministry of international trade and industry at more than Dollars 8bn. Also, the package includes government procurement of many products in which the US is competitive, such as medical equipment and computers. Mr Miyazawa may find, however, that US enthusiasm for Japan's efforts is not quite what he had expected. US government officials now in Tokyo, for the meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers, have shown a measured response to the economic package. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, while acknowledging Japan's recent efforts to reduce the deficit, suggested that the US expects more. He stressed the need for continued stimulation and increasing demand, calling the economic package 'a step forward - but you need to look beyond the headlines.' Mr Clinton is unlikely to be pleasantly surprised by a Japanese proposal on addressing sectoral issues. Japan has repeatedly stated that it will not discuss quantitative market-opening targets, which are favoured by US officials as a means to reduce the trade deficit with Japan. However, leading trade officials in Tokyo indicate that, targets aside, they are prepared to be flexible towards any proposals the US has on trade issues, including the setting-up of a new forum for discussing bilateral issues. Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: In an effort to boost sales of US auto parts in Japan, the US Commerce Department and Japan's Miti will sponsor a two-day conference on June 2-3 at Dearborn, Michigan. The aim is to lift sales to Dollars 19bn in 1994. In 1991, the US sold some Dollars 10.5bn of auto parts to Japan. US parts producers have complained that they are being discriminated against by Japanese companies manufacturing in the US. The conference will bring together senior Japanese auto executives and US parts suppliers to discuss Japanese procurement practices and future opportunities for the sale of US auto parts in Japan.</p>

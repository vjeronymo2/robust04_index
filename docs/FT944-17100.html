			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: New York In spite of last Friday's surprisingly resilient performance by the bond market, investors are likely to be in an apprehensive mood when trading reopens tomorrow after the Columbus Day holiday. The rally in prices - which helped the long bond yield drop back below 8 per cent after a brief period above that psychologically-important mark - was prompted by an analysis of the September employment data that judged the figures to be generally neutral for the Treasury market, and unlikely to push the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates again. The analysis came as a relief to investors, who had feared before the jobs figures were released that they might be so strong as to trigger a monetary policy tightening. That relief, however, may prove short-lived. Later this week the September producer and consumer prices data are published, and any sign of resurgent inflation may persuade the Fed that another increase in interest rates is required to slow the economy and restrain inflation. With this fear in mind, trading is likely to be subdued over the next two days as investors choose not to commit funds to the market ahead of such sensitive data. If there is any movement, it could be on the upside, as most analysts do not expect September inflation figures to be threatening.</p>

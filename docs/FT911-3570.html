			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recoups losses on futures-related buying SHARE PRICES fell initially on news of a leasing company in financial trouble, but staged a recovery later on futures-related buying. Activity remained dull ahead of the Golden Week holidays next week, when the market will be open only on Tuesday to Thursday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225-share average closed up 254.56 at 26,491.57 after losing 305 points on Monday. The index started on a weak note and recorded a day's low of 26,078.31 on reports that Shizushin Lease had filed for court protection under the bankruptcy law, as a result of its extensive loans to faltering real estate companies. Investment trusts came in as buyers at that level and the index reached a day's high of 26,568.89. Volume picked up to 360m shares from 250m as some investors were encouraged by expectations of Y7bn worth of cash coming into the market from new investment trust funds due to be set up at the end of the week. Declines still led gains at the close by 562 to 392, with 176 issues unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks put on 6.99 to 1,982.52. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.65 to 1,501.76. Mr Yoichi Kamina at SG Warburg said there was no evident change in sentiment, and buying was for technical reasons. 'We expect the market to go up after Golden Week, so it is not surprising that some investors wanted to buy at the lower levels,' he added. Mr John Courtney at WI Carr said investors were cautious, and did not expect a big market move until publication of corporate results which could give it new direction. Focus moved back to large-capital stocks, depressed recently by the interest rate uncertainty. Kobe Steel rallied Y13 to Y552 and Nippon Steel firmed Y1 to Y472. Companies which were reported to be creditors of Shizushin Lease lost ground in the morning but recovered in the afternoon. Mitsui Trust Bank opened Y20 lower at Y1,450, but closed up Y40 at Y1,510. Tokio Marine &amp; Fire, which holds a 5 per cent stake in Shizushin, lost Y20 at the opening but closed up Y10 at Y1,350. Nippon Yakin Kogyo fell Y40 to Y1,000 on profit-taking. The issue has risen recently on buy recommendations from major Japanese brokers, on the back of strong earnings for the current year. High-priced shares which had been popular on favourable earnings forecasts lost ground as interest turned to big board issues. Family Mart, the convenience store chain, receded Y200 to Y10,600, and Keyence, the measuring equipment maker, lost Y200 to Y16,500. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 287.61 to 29,269.64, its fourth decline in a row, on volume of 30.9m shares. Investors who had bought shares for the short term took profits. New Japan Chemical rose Y30 to Y1,180. The company expects sales of its additive which raises the transparency of polypropylene to double to Y3bn for the current year. Roundup MAJOR EXTERNAL influences on the Pacific Basin, Wall Street overnight and Tokyo, were in conflict yesterday and a number of markets reflected this. HONG KONG, which dipped to an intraday low of 3,549, was pushed briefly into positive territory by bargain hunting, but closed with the Hang Seng index a net 12.85 lower at 3,569.64. Turnover eased from HKDollars 1.41bn to HKDollars 1.28bn. Property shares and the commercial and industrial sector posted moderate losses, while banks and utilities were narrowly mixed. Traders were keeping an eye on the airport issue, where there is now the debate that a private sector solution to the stalemate in negotiations between the Colony and China might be bad for the Hong Kong government but good for the stock market. SEOUL, which tested its January 4 low for 1991 of 614.60 on the composite index with a 12.72 or 2 per cent fall on Monday, rebounded yesterday with a jump of 22.23 or 3.6 per cent to 637.84. Turnover climbed too, but it was still moderate after a rise from Won91.6bn to Won142.3bn. The market has suffered from tight monetary conditions, but there was an unofficial report of lower inflation from the Bank of Korea yesterday, and subsequent talk of a loosening in monetary policy. AUSTRALIA saw turnover rise from ADollars 202m to ADollars 233m as the All Ordinaries index eased 2.4 to 1,510.5; a parcel of 5.66m shares in Advance Bank Australia - 9 per cent of its share capital - was sold at ADollars 5.20 a share by ANZ Bank. Advance closed down 10 cents at ADollars 5.10. TAIWAN retreated 1.6 per cent and broke a five-day winning run, the weighted index sliding 91.91 to 5,732.09. BANGKOK followed Wall Street down, the SET index losing 15.71 to 893.19. KARACHI registered record volume of 4.8m shares, up from 3.9m last Sunday when the KSE index rose 24 to 1,675. A KSE spokesman said an additional 650,000 shares were traded after hours following news of further government initiatives to boost exports and trim red tape.</p>

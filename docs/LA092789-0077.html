			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE BLOCKS CUTBACKS AT LOPEZ CANYON;  </P> <P> OPPONENTS VOW TO FIGHT FURTHER LANDFILL DUMPING  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday barred state officials from scaling  back trash dumping at the city's Lopez Canyon Landfill, prompting the state to  vow to appeal and neighborhood opponents to promise to escalate their battle.  </P> <P> Judge Dzintra I. Janavs ruled that the 1978 permit state officials used to try  to restrict dumping in the landfill -- destination for two-thirds of the city  of Los Angeles' residential waste -- is out of date and vague.  </P> <P> City officials maintained that had the judge enforced the 1978 limits, the city  would have to close the landfill within days, at least temporarily,  exacerbating Los Angeles' mounting trash disposal problem.  </P> <P> "It's good news for the people of Los Angeles," said Deputy City Atty.  Christopher M. Westhoff, who filed a lawsuit for the city against the state.  "Now they know they have a place to put their trash."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agency Attorneys Concede Loss  </P> <P> Attorneys for the California Waste Management Board, the state agency that  issued an order in July reducing trash dumping in accordance with the 1978  permit, conceded Tuesday that they had lost this court fight.  </P> <P> However, they said they would appeal and called Janavs' ruling "dead wrong."  </P> <P> "She just sent a message to the whole state of California that landfill  operators can operate any way they want," said attorney Robert F. Conheim. "If  they happen to get away with it . . . and if enough time passes, then they're  home free."  </P> <P> The judge's ruling caps months of wrangling between the city and state over  whether the landfill should continue accepting trash at current levels, which  have alarmed neighbors.  </P> <P> Activists who live near the northeast San Fernando Valley landfill threatened  to resume displays of civil disobedience, including protesters massing at the  dump's gate, blocking trucks from entering.  </P> <P> They also said they hope to file a lawsuit against the city that would cite  continuing complaints about odors, noise and litter emanating from the dump.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Smell It Every Night'  </P> <P> "We live with it every single day. We smell it every night. We cannot forget  about it," said Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners  Assn.  </P> <P> Encouraged by Tuesday's victory, Westhoff said the city plans to apply for  state permission to allow even more trash to be dumped at Lopez Canyon,  although he said he does not know how large an increase will be requested. Any  such increase ultimately must be approved by the state waste board. Lawyers for  both sides said they are unsure if that would lead to a renewal of the battle.  </P> <P> In reaching her decision, Janavs said she had to put aside issues of possible  air and noise pollution at the dump. Instead, she said she reviewed the 1978  permit, which she said "is vague, is ambiguous and is somewhat inconsistent,"  primarily because it talks about estimates instead of setting precise limits.  </P> <P> The 1978 permit set the dump's top elevation at about 1,725 feet -- instead of  the 1,770-foot level recently reached -- limited truck traffic to about 400  trucks per day and restricted dumping to 140 acres of the 392-acre site. The  city said imposing the height restrictions would have caused the landfill to  close within days until another canyon area could be prepared to accept the  4,000 tons of trash dumped there daily.  </P> <P> Janavs agreed with the city's contention that a more liberal 1983 engineering  report prepared by the city should either have been considered an update of the  earlier permit or should have triggered a review by the state six years ago,  when it was submitted.  </P> <P> The engineering report was requested by the state after torrential rains caused  a hill of trash to slide onto streets and into back yards in nearby Kagel  Canyon in 1982.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. David A. Eissler, who represented the state in court Tuesday,  said the state never intended that report to substitute for a formal review of  the permit's conditions. He said the waste board did not realize until several  years later that Los Angeles was overdue for its five-year permit review, which  should have taken place in 1983.  </P> <P> But Janavs said that even when faced with revised numbers included in the 1983  report -- a 1,740-foot elevation and 500 trucks per day -- the state "didn't  come in and say, 'Hey, you're violating the 1978 permit, you cannot do that.' "  </P> <P> For the present, Westhoff said, the city will operate under a combination of  limits set in the 1983 engineering report and those outlined in an order issued  this summer by the county, which acts as the state's local policing body for  the landfill. He said the city had reduced daily truck traffic from 500 to 400  trips, but would continue to dump 45 feet or more above the 1,725-foot  elevation the state was trying to enforce.  </P> <P> The waste board began reviewing operations at Lopez Canyon earlier this year  and stepped up its investigation after two landfill workers were overcome there  in March by toxic gas generated by decaying waste. Simultaneously, the South  Coast Air Quality Management District began looking into odor complaints raised  by neighbors, resulting in an order to the city to speed up completion of a  system to extract and burn the landfill gas.  </P> <P> City sanitation and public works officials maintain that the waste board used  Lopez Canyon to flex its muscle after state legislators and the Little Hoover  Commission criticized it as impotent. Waste board members have repeatedly  denied politics played a role in their actions.  </P></p>

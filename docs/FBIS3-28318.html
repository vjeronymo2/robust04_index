Konstantin Sarkisov, director of the Center for Japanese  Studies at the Institute of Oriental Studies, told KYODO NEWS  SERVICE that democratization in Russia has made it possible for  opponents of the former communist regime to air their views. He  said this has made a solution to the territorial dispute more  difficult than it might have been when Russia was part of the  Soviet Union.    The disputed islands, known in Japan as the northern  territories, are Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai  group of islets. The islands, which lie off the northernmost  main Japanese island of Hokkaido, were seized from Japan by the  former Soviet Union at the end of World War II.    Sarkisov, 51, an Armenian educated at Leningrad State  University, said the new Russian Constitution ensures that  President Boris Yeltsin has the final say over foreign policy  decisions in Russia.    But he said the December election in Russia in which  conservatives, including ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  scored a big success, had made it more difficult for Yeltsin to  take a strong stand on a controversial issue like the disputed  islands.    Sarkisov said this could result in the present  administration  leaving any decision on the islands "to the next generation of  politicians."    Sarkisov predicted there will be no dramatic change in  Russo-  Japanese relations under the current Yeltsin administration.    "It is just a matter of keeping up our contacts on a daily  basis," he said.    The territorial dispute remains a stumbling block to  normalization of relations between the two countries. Tokyo  maintains it will not conclude a peace treaty with Moscow unless  the territorial dispute is resolved.    Sarkisov said Russia has a "duty" to return at least  Shikotan  and the Habomais under the terms of a 1956 Japan-Soviet joint  declaration to return the two islands on condition that the  actual transfer would take place after the signing of a  bilateral peace treaty.    Sarkisov said a settlement to the dispute would include the  return of at least these two islands as well as a number of  possible other options which he described as lying between "zero  and the return of the remaining two islands." He said the  options could include United Nations administration of the  islands, or even their joint economic development.    "It's a problem of Russian pride," Sarkisov said. "First you  must explain the facts to the Russian people."</p>

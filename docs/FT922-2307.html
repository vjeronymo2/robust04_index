			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Carolco cuts Live shareholding CAROLCO Pictures has cut its stake in Live Entertainment to a minority holding of 49.9 per cent by selling 360,000 shares in the video distribution company to three Carolco investors. The deal is yet another complex manoeuvre to keep the troubled, independent Hollywood studio in business. Carolco said it sold the Live shares, for about Dollars 2.19 each, to protect itself from a possible cross-default in its public and private debt. This follows Live's failure to make the latest interest payment on its 14.5 per cent senior subordinated notes. As a 53 per cent majority shareholder in Live, Carolco was vulnerable to a possible default by the video distribution company. Earlier this year, the same three Carolco investors - Pioneer LDCA, an affiliate of Tokyo's Pioneer Electronics, Le Studio Canal Plus, a unit of France's Canal Plus, and RCS Video International Services, an affiliate of Italy's Rizzoli Corriere della Sera - agreed to a Dollars 73.8m financing package for Carolco in a move to keep the company operating. Carolco, however, still faces a serious cash shortfall. The studio is still struggling to survive in spite of the outstanding success of a number of recent Carolco productions, including the Terminator films and Basic Instinct. The company has been hurt by a combination of factors, including its 'open purse' policy of paying generous amounts for box-office stars, such as Arnold Swarzenegger. Earlier this month, Carolco said it could not draw on a Dollars 22.8m line of credit because it had not met certain terms. In the first quarter, a gain of Dollars 4.9m from the purchase of debt helped Carolco reduce its net loss to Dollars 4.3m, or 20 cents a share, from Dollars 6.3m, or 27 cents, but the company's operating loss grew to Dollars 9.2m from Dollars 6.3m. Revenues were virtually flat at Dollars 136.5m.</p>

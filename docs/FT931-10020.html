			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Commercial Union launches Pounds 428m rights issue: UK insurer plans further expansion as profits return to the black COMMERCIAL Union, the UK insurance company, yesterday signalled its intention to pursue further expansion in the UK and international general and life markets by launching a Pounds 428m rights issue. The group also announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 31.4m, compared with a loss of Pounds 68.8m, after bringing forward the announcement of its 1992 results by three weeks. CU declared a final dividend of 15.1p per share, giving a full dividend for the year of 24.35p, a rise of 3 per cent. Shareholders were offered one new share for every five ordinary shares at a price of 490p per share. The issue was underwritten by Kleinwort Benson and Morgan Stanley International. Brokers were Cazenove and Hoare Govett Corporate Finance. Mr Tony Wyand, executive director, said the recent increases in premium rates in the UK general insurance market had produced an 'unprecedented opportunity' for the company. Many of CU's competitors were hampered by losses from domestic mortgage indemnity insurance, a market in which CU has scaled down its exposure since the mid-1980s. The company had begun to expand in 1991 said Mr Wyand, but expansion has accelerated during 1992, especially in the fourth quarter. Overall life premiums rose 31 per cent to Pounds 2.01bn and general premiums were up 13 per cent to Pounds 3.57bn. Life profits increased from Pounds 114.3m to Pounds 118m, offsetting losses of Pounds 86.6m on non-life business, down from losses of Pounds 182.9m in 1991. Non-life business was helped by a strong performance in the UK, where premium income rose 27 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn. Operating profits were Pounds 12.8m, compared with a loss of Pounds 85.1m in 1991. In the UK, CU achieved underwriting profits in domestic and private motor business (compared with a Pounds 50.7m loss last year) - largely as a result of increases in rates. Motor underwriting profits amounted to Pounds 5m, in spite of a 47.3 per cent increase in premiums to Pounds 213.7m. CU's shares, which had lost ground recently, were boosted by the better than expected results, rising 12p to close at 610p. Lex, Page 20; Observer, Page 19</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / How to Spend It: Fake is fine for that Christmas sparkle - From old gold to modern costume jewellery, there are plenty of pretty baubles to put under your tree I have not met a woman yet who has complained of having too much jewellery. Not enough, perhaps, or even too much that is too cheap but too much per se? Never. If in doubt when seeking to please your nearest and dearest, just think small. Think of an intimate little packet, exquisitely wrapped, that comes charged with meaning, that speaks of love and caring, of forethought and generosity. These may be the days of equal opportunity, when so many women buy their own jewellery. Even so there is nothing finer than a piece bought by He Who Cares. There are those, diminishing in number, for whom the only jewellery that matters is real. Apart from the grand joailliers, the Boucherons and Cartiers, the Garrards and Chaumets and Bulgaris, there is now a group of jewellery designers which has realised there is a market for those who want their jewels real but up-to-date. The grand soirees of yesterday have been replaced by a raft of business meetings. The need for a sculptured brooch or carefully-chosen necklace which can see today's working woman through from the school-run in the morning to the dinner party has grown. Jewellers such as Kiki McDonough are sought after because they have intrinsic value, a reasonable price and are wearable in a modern context. Although they are far from rock-bottom, they are infinitely more affordable than those at the traditional haut joailliers. Kiki has a host of fashionable customers who like her jewellery because it is real but does not shout. As Juliet Hambro, one of her devoted fans, says: 'I wear Kiki's necklaces and earrings all the time because it adds a finishing touch to an outfit and yet it never clamours for too much attention. In my job (financial investment consultant) I often have to travel all day and attend luncheons, meetings and dinners. I can wear Kiki's ebony and gold ear-rings or her haematite necklace from morning until night.' At Kiki McDonough there are lots of gifts at under Pounds 1,000 - 18-carat gold and malachite ear-rings, for instance, bold and stylish at Pounds 495, simpler nine-carat gold earrings for Pounds 295. Boodle &amp; Dunthorne is an old-established jewellers from Liverpool which this year opened a grand new store in Regent Street. There are antique pieces but also lots of choice for those who need a brooch to enliven a working suit, some earrings to add a little glamour to an all-purpose coat. Choose from bold earrings in gold (Pounds 455) or a mixture of silver and gold (Pounds 300) or some of Leo de Vroomen's strong enamelled pieces (Pounds 3,450). More strong pieces are to be found at Tiffany (and, of course, there is something deliciously enticing about those turquoise blue little boxes). Avoid, unless you come into that category of never having to inquire about the cost, the ones in the brochure which are marked 'prices upon request'. Turn instead to more affordable items - such as Tiffany's own signature collection, Paloma Picasso's pink tourmaline earrings (Pounds 1,575) and Elsa Peretti's sculpture sterling silver pieces which start at Pounds 50. There is also a delicate gold chain with a floating diamond which at Pounds 315 would make a lovely present for a favourite god-daughter. Those for whom these prices would cause Micawberish unhappiness should not be downhearted. Fake these days is fine. In the real world even those women who have beautiful inherited pieces often mix them with fake. Countess Alexander of Tunis, for instance, is a great fan of the reproduction jewellery of Fior. 'I work as a special events organiser and when I did this for Chaumet I used to have access to their splendid real jewels. Now that they have closed down their London operation I miss it. I often mix pieces from Fior or Butler &amp; Wilson with real pieces. Buying costume jewellery enables one to have much more variety - for instance: I have long 'pearls', short 'pearls', 'pearl' chokers,' she says. Besides Fior and Butler &amp; Wilson, many an aristocratic lady who lunches is actually glinting away in inexpensive costume jewellery sold by each other to each other. Becky Blandford, for instance, mother to the future Duke of Marlborough, sells the Caura range of jewellery designed by Eric van Peterson to her well-connected friends. From the Caura catalogue bold gold earrings (base metal dipped in 22-carat gold) sell for Pounds 19.15 a pair, a necklace of 'gold' baubles for Pounds 60, three rows of 'pearls' for Pounds 33 and some fashionably classical 'gold' and 'amethyst' ear-rings for Pounds 19.15. There is much more in similar vein. I have seen Agatha's earrings adorning some very aristocratic lobes indeed. It is a very clever costume jewellery enterprise brought over from Paris. It has all the fashionable icons of the day - the 'pearl' cross (Pounds 19), the plain bold 'gold' ear-rings (Pounds 17), the big, bold ring with classical overtones (Pounds 19), the 'amber' heart-shaped pendant (Pounds 12) and the 'ebony' cross (Pounds 10). So take heart: it really is the thought that counts. Kiki McDonough is at 77c Walton St, London SW3 2HT. Telephone: 071-581-1777.

'I always think about big jewellery that you need a man to buy it for you and a man to undo it at the end of the day. Obviously there was a time in my life when I used to wear the big stuff which was bought by Richard and which now sits in a vault in the bank. Now that my life has changed I still like real jewellery but I go for quieter, more subdued ranges. 'I also like costume jewellery such as Chanel's great big earrings and I collect pieces from Merola in Walton Street - all the beautiful 20s stuff. I have dress-clips in diamante and dangly Bakelite earrings - most of the materials are intrinsically inexpensive but it is the design that appeals. 'I have been collecting pieces from Garrard's One One Two collection for some time. Almost every day I wear bangles from the range and on Christmas day I will almost certain be wearing them together with these wonderful big looped ear-rings and the necklace. As I shall be spending the day with four-year-old twin nephews who are hugely excitable I shan't be wearing anything grand.' The One One Two collection has gold rings from Pounds 370, bangles from about Pounds 1,000. *** Shebah Ronay is a 22-year-old actress and daughter of Edina Ronay, the designer, who will shortly be appearing on TV in a new series of House of Eliott and Love Hurts. When it comes to jewellery she likes it simple. 'Often I make my own - I buy beads from a shop called Hobby Horse and make necklaces and bracelets. There are two rings that I always wear - a heavy gold wedding band which was a present from my grandmother and a ruby ring that I bought for myself. Many of the pieces I own have been given me as Christmas presents but I am lucky in that my mother has the most amazing collection of costume jewellery which she has collected from places like Merola and antique shops and so I often borrow from her when I'm going out.' For Christmas Eve she will be wearing a maroon velvet jacket designed by her mother (Pounds 425 from Edina Ronay, 171 King's Road, Chelsea, London SW3). 'I love its long cuffs and lapels,' says Shebah. 'It is subtle, yet glamorous in a classic way. There are trousers to match (Pounds 225) but I'm actually going to wear them with some viscose trousers also designed by my mother.' She is photographed here wearing it with the sort of jewellery she likes: 'very simple and yet complementing the clothes'. The gilt and pearl earrings are Pounds 75, the bracelet is Pounds 85, both are from Celine, 6f Sloane Street, Knightsbridge, London SW3 and 28 New Bond Street, London W1. *** Chloe Annett, who stars in Jewels, this week's infinitely forgettable mini-TV series, is young and pretty. And since the plot required her to wear lots of baubles she has become interested in jewellery. Fior, the Knightsbridge and Bond Street jewellers which specialises in making finely-crafted costume pieces that look like the real thing, and Buccellati, the Italian jewellers, have between them supplied all the jewels for the series. To Chloe Annett it was a revelation seeing just how well-made some modern costume jewellery can be. 'I thought the jewellery was wonderful. Until then I had mostly worn pieces given to me by my grandmother - I might attach them to lengths of velvet and wear them as a choker. I have a large mother-of-pearl cross which I would wear, for instance, with my Kenzo dress with the shorts underneath. I also have a lovely gold and platinum ring with two tiny diamonds given to me by my boyfriend.' She is photographed here wearing what she intends to wear on Christmas Day - a black Lycra-velvet mini-dress (Pounds 295) by Michele Holden of 42 Beauchamp Place, Knightsbridge, London SW1. Michele Holden is a dressmaker who (unusually) combines a made-to-measure business with ready-to-wear. With the dress she is wearing a set of necklets (Pounds 235.50), bracelet (Pounds 185) and ear-rings (Pounds 39.95) worn during filming. All are rhodium plated, hand set with diamante and synthetic rubies and all come from Fior, 27 Brompton Road, Knightsbridge, London SW3 or 31, New Bond Street, Mayfair, London W1.</p>

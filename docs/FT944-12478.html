			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: BHP cuts ties with Woodside Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest company, yesterday cut its ties with Woodside Petroleum, the energy group which is the leading participant and operator of the North West Shelf gas project, through an institutional placing of its remaining share interests in the company. Late yesterday, BHP announced that it had sold the 28.3m shares in Woodside which it owned directly at ADollars 4.765 each, raising ADollars 135m (USDollars 100m). It also said that a further 76.8m shares owned by North West Shelf Development, a joint venture company held equally by BHP and Shell Australia, had been offloaded. The second tranche of shares was disposed of at the same price, raising ADollars 366m in total. Shell said the latter sale did not affect its 'long-term commitment to Woodside', in which it still holds a 34.27 per cent interest, and to the North West Shelf project. BHP also said it retained some links to the North West Shelf project through a 16.67 per cent interest in the LNG export project, and a 8.33 per cent share in the domestic gas phase. The BHP-related shares were sold to Were Stockbroking, which planned to place them with a range of institutional and portfolio investors. Woodside shares closed 7 cents higher at ADollars 5.02 on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday. BHP shares gained 12 cents to A420.64.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Time for Action"] </F>   [Text] The most important and the main implication of the  report presented by the joint parliamentary committee  investigating the century's greatest financial scam is that our  finance ministry is criminally negligent in following its  procedures and that the accused persons must not be let go. The  committee found Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, Health Minister  B. Shankranand, and Village Development Minister of State  Rameshwar Thakur guilty. It has also put Satya Prakash  Maulaviya, minister of petroleum in former Prime Minister  Chandra Shekhar's cabinet, and the ministries of railways, civil  aviation, petroleum, and fertilizers in the line of the accused.  It appears that the whole structure of our economic system is  rotten. Manmohan Singh was declared to be responsible for the  horrible negligence by his ministry, banks, and financial  institutions. Rameshwar Thakur is blamed for holding a circular  letter written against Harshad Mehta for about one month and not  taking any action on it when he was the minister of state for  finance. What vested interests had forced then-Petroleum  Minister B. Shankaranand to ridicule the rules of the Petroleum  Industries Development Board and invest money in Canfina Bank  and Syndicate Bank? Former Civil Aviation Minister Madho Rao  Scindia is also accused of dragging his feet in investigating  the Vayudut officials who had invested money without following  procedures.    The committee found that our economic system had started to  corrode in 1982. One hand did not know what the other was doing.  There was looting every where, and the vested interests were  taking advantage of it all by ignoring all laws and procedures.  The vested interests had found loopholes in the economic  policies formed after 1982, and the administrations of Indira  Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, V.P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar, and P.V.  Narasimha Rao all stood in "one posture in the bath house."  Narasimha Rao was unfortunately accused of taking 10 million  rupees in bribes in the Pratibhuti scam. This sent the message  to every corner of the nation that if our major leaders are  taking bribes and making money by spurious means, then why  should not [the common people] also make money. A similar  message was sent by the Bofors scandal. Anyhow, the joint  committee has cleared the prime minister of the accusation of  receiving 10 million rupees bribe. However, it has recommended  investigation of Gold Star Company with the prime minister's  son, Prabhakar Rao, is associated. Former minister Chidambaram  can also be involved in this investigation because he was also  associated with Gold Star. It is obvious that Manmohan Singh,  Shankranand, and Rameshwar Thakur have been put on trial, and if  they are even minimally ethical, they should either admit to  their wrongdoing or offer believable refutation.    Just below the line of the cabinet members, the  parliamentary  committee has lined up S. Venktaraman, governor of the Reserve  Bank, and two deputy governors, Amitabh Ghosh and Janaki Raman  with their heads bowed and hands joined in prayer. The fact is  that if our Reserve Bank and the finance ministry had been  alert, no one would have dared to break the laws and loot money.  We do not know what special attraction was there for them to  ignore established interest rates in the public sector and  invest money in absurd places? And we do not know which one was  sucking out billions of rupees each minute. The committee has  given detailed information on how this scam was pulled, and who  were the people who had their eyes closed to it when all this  was happening. However, this report is silent about who  benefitted from this scam and who were the real villains of this  drama. Yes, they have identified four foreign banks and have  recommended canceling their licenses. We should not, however, do  things hastily. The present atmosphere in the nation and the  image that our country has abroad can be hurt by any extreme  action. What is necessary is that we keep a close eye on all  banks, and not just these banks.    The whole system was rotten, and one or two sharp people  were  influencing the investigation. It is proved by the mention of  the CBI and other agencies in the report. These agencies,  despite enough evidence against Harshad Mehta and others, did  not register any case, and if they did start a case, the speed  of investigation was kept very slow. There was no cooperation  among these investigation agencies. Not only this, the personnel  from these agencies who were invited by the joint committee, did  not give full information. The committee has asked that cases be  registered against the nationalized bank officials who were  involved in the Pratibhuti scam. The recommendation made to  investigate Gold Star Company and some public sector  institutions should be followed up diligently so that the trust  of the people is not broken. The report has also condemned  provision of shares from the promotor quota to 531 government  and banks officials. The tradition of bribing government  employees needs to be curbed.    Members of all political parties were included in the joint  parliamentary commission, therefore, we should accept this  report to be above all bias and have full debate on it in the  House even if the session has to be extended by two or three  days. The committee has presented the report after 16 months of  very hard work and Ram Niwas Mirdha has included the letter  which were not unanimous in this report, therefore, we have to  believe that the committee has done a historical job by rising  above prejudices. This work should be given proper respect and  the guilty persons should be punished without delay. At the same  time, we must make sure that no one damages our financial system  again and embarrassing incidents like the Pratibhuti scams are  not repeated. The country waited for a long time for the joint  parliamentary committee's report. Now we wait for action on  it.</p>

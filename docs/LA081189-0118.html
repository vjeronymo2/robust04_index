			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIELD SURVEYS SHOW REBOUND FROM DROUGHT;  </P> <P> CORN CROP UP 49% OVER '88, USDA SAYS  </P> <P> Corn production is rebounding from last year's drought, the Agriculture  Department said Thursday, estimating the 1989 crop at 7.35 billion bushels, an  increase of 49% over last fall's stunted harvest of 4.9 billion bushels.  </P> <P> The estimates were based on USDA's first field surveys of the year and  reflected conditions as of Aug. 1.  </P> <P> Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board put total U.S. crop  production at 103% of the 1977 average, a scale used to compare output from  year to year.  </P> <P> The latest figures came a week after Congress, responding to flooding in the  South and drought in the Great Plains, approved an $897-million disaster relief  bill for farmers.  </P> <P> While corn and soybean production were estimated at about average for the  decade, wheat production across the Grain Belt was forecast at weaker than  usual levels, with fields losing substantial moisture since early July.  </P> <P> Corn is the largest and most important crop grown on American farms and, used  as feed, is essential to meat, poultry and dairy production.  </P> <P> Agriculture Department economists had projected the corn crop at 7.85 billion  bushels in June and revised that to 7.45 billion last month due in part to late  plantings in the eastern Corn Belt and dry fields in the West.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Much Better Yield  </P> <P> In the Midwest, however, rains starting in mid-July replenished some of the  subsoil moisture that had been lost.  </P> <P> USDA economists estimated the yield per acre of corn in 1989 at 112.8 bushels  an acre, up 28.2 bushels from last year but 6.6 bushels below the record high  of 119.4 bushels produced in 1987.  </P> <P> They estimated that 65.2 million acres would be harvested, up 12% from 1988 but  1% less than the July forecast.  </P> <P> Soybean production was estimated at 1.91 billion bushels, up 24% from last  year's harvest of 1.54 billion.  </P> <P> USDA economists forecast the soybean yield at 32.3 bushels an acre, the fourth  highest on record and 24% above a year ago.  </P> <P> Production of all wheat was estimated at 2.04 billion bushels, up 13% from the  1988 harvest of 1.81 billion bushels. That was 3% below the July estimate from  USDA.  </P> <P> Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down 6% from  last year. Durum wheat was indicated at 90.7 million bushels, up 102% from the  1988 harvest but down 19% from the July forecast because of drought problems in  the Dakotas.  </P> <P> The average yield for all wheat was forecast at 32.6 bushels an acre, just 1.5  below last year's level, with an estimated area for harvest of 62.7 million  acres.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drop in Supplies  </P> <P> Other spring wheat was forecast at 487 million bushels, down 10% from the July  forecast but more than double the 1988 crop.  </P> <P> With the Soviet grain crop forecast down and export prospects good, stocks of  wheat next June are projected at 474 million bushels, almost 120 million below  last month and 220 million below the start of the year.  </P> <P> Cotton production was estimated at 11.8 million bales, down 23% from last year  and 20% below 1987.  </P> <P> Consumer prices for food rose at an annualized rate of 7% in the first half of  1989 as cold weather hit vegetable fields in Florida, California and Mexico.  Poultry prices also rose sharply on increased demand.  </P> <P> But USDA economists are expecting consumer prices to rise no more than 1% on an  annualized basis in the second half.  </P></p>

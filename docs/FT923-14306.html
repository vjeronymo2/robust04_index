			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Merit pay may hit women THE GROWTH of per-formance-related pay may widen the gap between male and female earnings, the Equal Opportunities Commission said yesterday. The EOC says merit pay tends to reward men more than women because employers use it to adjust earnings to the market rate. Women's earnings are less likely to contain a merit element, and the subjective and general nature of many appraisal processes allows managers to make sexist judgments. However its investigation into why women's earnings have stayed at about two thirds of men's found evidence of a gradual move of women into higher-paid posts previously filled by men.

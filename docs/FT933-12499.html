			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BICC drops Andover flotation plan Shares in BICC slipped 8p to 390p yesterday as the international cables and construction group announced that it had cancelled its plans to float some 60 per cent of Andover Controls, its US subsidiary, on Nasdaq. Mr Tim Sharp, for BICC, said the flotation - which at an issue price of Dollars 15 would have given Andover a market capitalisation of Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m) - would have had to go ahead 'in a very crowded and competitive environment for new issues' and that it was thought that institutions considered it 'not as attractive as others on offer'. Mr Sharp said that BICC could have sent Andover back with a lower price tag, but was not keen to accept a price that was not 'proper' for the business. BICC wanted to float or dispose of Andover as part of its reversion to its core, but Mr Sharp said it was the most successful of BICC's technology companies and it was 'not a painful business to run'. Andover designs heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting systems for 'smart' buildings.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Prisoners' output replaces imports Prisons are making their contribution to improving Britain's balance of payments by manufacturing goods previously imported into the country - and helping change attitudes to work among staff and inmates. Longer working days and higher pay are being encouraged and prison enterprises are making a growing contribution to prison running costs. Strangeways prison in Manchester - refurbished at a cost of Pounds 80m after being almost destroyed four years ago in Britain's worst prison riot - yesterday announced a 35-hour working week for prisoners. The prison has negotiated a contract with a Warrington company to make 2,000 polypropylene bulk containers a week, undercutting a supplier in Turkey. Import substitution is one way to expand output without arousing allegations of cheap prison labour undercutting outside suppliers and destroying local jobs. The containers - used for moving granular or powder products in palletised loads - are to be marketed throughout Europe. Other Strangeways prisoners carry out upholstery for a local furniture company which used to buy finished products from France; now it imports the wooden frames, which are completed in the prison workshops. The Strangeways laundry has so many orders that Mr Pat Smith, the manager, says he is starting double-shift working. Customers include local restaurants, and Barnardos children's homes. The prisoners earn up to Pounds 10 a week. There is another reward for co-operative behaviour at Strangeways - a television set in the cell, which must be paid for from prison earnings.</p>

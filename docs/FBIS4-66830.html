			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mahfoud Nahnah, president of Hamas (Islamic </F> Society Movement), by M.T. Messaoudi and Zineb O.; place and  date not given: "Favor Political Solution Over All-Out  Security"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] Despite the dramatic situation being  experienced by our country, Mahfoud Nahnah, president of Hamas  [Islamic Society Movement] remains optimistic regarding a  possible return to civil peace and constitutional legality,  provided that "armed action is isolated from politics." In this  interview granted to us, Nahnah tells us that his party has not  yet stated whether it will participate in the CNT [National  Transitional Council] and that it would have preferred to see  the formation of the Sifi government preceded by consultation  with the parties.    [EL WATAN] Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah, is your political group going  to participate in the National Transitional Council?    [Nahnah] Our movement held a lengthy meeting on that subject  last Thursday, and several opinions were expressed. Some were  opposed to the movement's participation in the CNT, while  others, on the other hand, were in favor of it.    Personally, I think that if the CNT is going to be like the  old National Advisory Council, which has no prerogatives or  power to solve the problems of a legislative nature that are  facing the country or to debate the position of the government  and state, I do not see why anyone should go to great lengths to  set up such a body.    If, on the other hand, the CNT is there to overcome the  crisis of legitimacy and amend government bills so as to  facilitate a rapid return to elections through more substantial  dialogue with all the parties that might find themselves within  that structure for dialogue, I am completely in favor of it. The  main objective of that dialogue must be the higher interest of  the country, with no one-upmanship or Byzantine discussions. If  that is the CNT's objective, our movement will participate in it  either inside or outside that body in defense of the  Constitution against all attempts--illegitimate in any case--to  amend it and in defense of the citizens.    [EL WATAN] Your definition of the CNT is practically the  same  as that contained in the platform of the national conference;  participation by Hamas seems to be a sure thing.    [Nahnah] As you know, our movement applies the principle of  shura [consultation] literally. Everyone gives his opinion, and  my point of view does not count for any more than that of others.    [EL WATAN] Has the question been settled within your party?    [Nahnah] The question has not been settled. We are holding a  meeting today (Editor's note: yesterday) at the office of the  president of the republic. If we see that there is a sincere  willingness to work in accordance with the principles we have  set forth, we will be part of the CNT.    [EL WATAN] Won't it bother you to be the only one among the  country's most important parties to be in the CNT?    [Nahnah] Our movement does not want to be in the shadow of  any party whatever. We are free to take the stand we consider  appropriate without being influenced by one or more parties. We  may be right or wrong, but the main thing is that we should work  for the good of the country and for its interests.    [EL WATAN] Yesterday--Tuesday--you had a meeting with some  political parties (Editor's note: the MDA [Movement for  Democracy in Algeria], the FLN [National Liberation Front], and  al-Nahdah). Was there any connection between that and the CNT?    [Nahnah] Our meeting with a certain number of parties  yesterday was concerned with something else. We were concerned  to find ways to restore the citizens' confidence and  rehabilitate party activity in the eyes of public opinion. The  second topic discussed during that meeting was the action to be  taken to drive the specter of despair away from the citizens. In  the reality of Algeria, the policy of aggravating the crisis and  that of deterioration have long prevailed. That situation needs  to be remedied quickly. Our movement is one of those asking the  current government to provide more transparence and open the  doors of the economy to domestic and then to international  initiatives.    Domestic and international investors are still reluctant  because they have no confidence in the laws. By way of example,  domestic importers have been caught unawares by the devaluation  of the dinar when their goods arrive in port. Are they supposed  to pay the old rate or the new one? I consider that a form of  violence. Our movement's basic concern is to neutralize all the  reasons or paths leading to violence.    [EL WATAN] What do you expect to result from that meeting?    [Nahnah] We are still at the stage of drawing up a platform  that we plan to submit to the office of the President as a  contribution on our part in proposing solutions to the crisis.    [EL WATAN] You are one of the parties and associations that  have called for a march this coming 8 May. What are your words  of command?    [Nahnah] The march on 8 May will be like the other marches  that have taken place in our country. Political groups have  expressed their stand on dialogue. We have another approach--one  leaning more toward intensified political dialogue--because we  feel that the current political deadlock cannot be permanently  resolved by an antiterrorist law and the policy of all-out  security. We want the demonstration on 8 May to work toward the  country's development and unity. It must not serve narrow  partisan interests. If people try to divert the march to other  objectives, they will have to assume the responsibility.    [EL WATAN] You support dialogue with no one excluded, but  the  armed groups in the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] reject any  negotiation with the government. In your opinion, what is the  proper reaction to that obstinacy?    [Nahnah] For our part, we feel that anyone who rejects  dialogue must present an alternative. That alternative must not  take the form of a Mahchoucha (Editor's note: sawed-off shotgun)  or that of an armored vehicle, and it must not be inspired by  any imported ideology. The tragedy that we are experiencing must  be resolved by and among Algerians. Algeria belongs to Algerians  of all kinds and all political convictions. Extremism must not  have a place in a country that is rich in history and in natural  and human potentialities.    [EL WATAN] Don't you think that the wise men among men of  religion have failed to do their part to prevent young people in  particular from being prey to extremism?    [Nahnah] Extremism is the phenomenon of this century. It  does  not exist only among Islamists. You will find it among  Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and so on.    Extremism has historical causes and objective,  psychological,  economic, and social causes. The various regimes in the Arab  countries were unable or unwilling to get control of this  problem before it appeared. The intellectuals and men of  knowledge also failed to take steps to tackle the phenomenon in  a rigorous scientific manner. And in Algeria, the state did not  train high-level cadres in the theological area soon enough.  That is why the doors were thrown open to all comers. The  single-party system, with all the defects it  engendered--corruption, for example--also enabled extremism to  take root.    [EL WATAN] What do you think of the Berber cultural demands?    [Nahnah] Our movement feels that if any issue concerning the  country is not taken into consideration and debated, it will  sooner or later have a snowball effect with harmful  consequences. There is no objection to a debate on Berber  culture; the main thing is to be able to express oneself and try  to persuade others. All the same, it is amazing to see that in a  country like Switzerland, where four different languages are  spoken, society is stable, united, and above all prosperous.    [EL WATAN] What is your opinion of Mokdad Sifi's government?    [Nahnah] It is like all the governments that preceded it.  The  winning numbers are drawn by the government out of the same hat.  We had hoped that this government would not be cooked up in a  pressure cooker but formed as the result of consultation with  the parties. Because in our opinion, this government concerns  the political parties and the citizens generally. The current  government will meet the same fate as the other governments. But  what I fear is the fact that these governments may be just a  means of playing for time.    [EL WATAN] Did you meet with certain officials of the former  FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] during your tour of Europe and the  Middle East?    [Nahnah] We have never met with Rabah Kebir, as some of the  media have reported, or with officials of the FIS either inside  or outside the country, except for certain of that party's  founding members with whom we spoke long before all this.    But our hope is that Djeddi and Boukhamkham will strive to  contact their elected brothers who are members of the Majlis  al-Shura [consultative council] and the political class with no  one being excluded. The armed groups will remain, however, and I  won't conceal from you the fact that we think a solution the  crisis is very close.    [EL WATAN] Do you think that only Islamist extremists are  behind the terrorism?    [Nahnah] The former FIS provides "cover" for a very wide  spectrum. Many people who do not wish the country well are  hiding in it. It is true that certain methods of assassination,  and the confessions of the perpetrators of those assassinations,  as well as everything we learned in connection with the  assassination of Shaykh Bouslimani by Djaafar El-Afghani's or  Sayeh Attia's groups, are the work of Islamist extremists  pending proof to the contrary. [sentence as published]    Also hiding behind that "cover," however, are all those who  like to fish in troubled waters: organized crime, thieves,  gangsters, harkis [Algerians who fought for France during the  revolution], and the sons of members of France's Arab units. So  Algerians must learn to tell the difference between those people  and the others. And the political class must be able to  distinguish between those groups so that politics will emerge  with democratic freedoms and respect for the Constitution.  Without those two parameters, the violence will continue.    Moreover, it must be pointed out that there is violence in  every country: Spain, Italy, the United States, and so on. We  feel that the phenomenon of violence requires a rapid return to  legality so that every individual who wants to destroy the  country and sow destruction can be immediately isolated.</p>

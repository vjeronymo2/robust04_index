			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dialogue between station reporters Chong Song-kan and Yi </F> In- chun: "Self-Defense Measure Reflecting Our People's Firm  Will"]    [Text] [Chong Song-kan] Hello.    [Yi In-chun] Hello.    [Chong] On 13 June, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign  Ministry issued a statement on the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] Secretariat's creation of a grave situation  [omjunghan sataerul chosongsikin kotkwa kwallyonhaeso] that  poses great threats to our people's dignity and our country's  safety by following the U.S. policy of crushing Korea. We are  going to discuss this matter in today's program.    [Yi] Yes, let us do so. As has been reported in the  statement, our country's Foreign Ministry spokesman sternly  denounced [chunyorhi kyutan] the United States, which is opposed  to our people, and the IAEA Board of Governors, which follows  the United States, for adopting an unreasonable resolution  [chonman pudanghan kyorui] against us, and strictly declared  that we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA to defend the  nation's dignity and sovereignty.    The spokesman also declared that we can no longer allow the  inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards which  we have accepted in our special capacity, and strongly  reaffirmed our position that UN sanctions will be regarded  immediately as a declaration of war.    This is our due self-defense measure [ungdanghan chawijok  chochi] that was inevitably taken because our peaceful nuclear  activities hit a bigger snag [uriui pyonghwajok haekhwaltongi  kumankum changaeman patke toegi ttaemune] due to the abnormal  situation [pijongsangjogin satae] created by anti-Republic  maneuvers of the United States and some officials [kyechung] of  the IAEA that follows the United States. It is also our  Republic's revolutionary response to the wrong acts [kuruttoen  chosa] of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and some officials of  the IAEA Secretariat.    [Chong] Yes, it is.    [Yi] Our people are now actively supporting the decision of  the Republic's government to withdraw from the IAEA, regarding  it as a just measure to defend the nation's dignity and the  country's sovereignty.    [Chong] Yes, they are. Our Republic's declaration to  withdraw from the IAEA is a just measure to cope with the  insidious maneuvers [pulsunhan chaektonge chudongjoguro  taechohagiwihan chongdanghan chochi] by the U.S. imperialists  and some officials of the agency's Secretariat to crush [apsal]  our socialist system.    [Yi] Surely it is.    [Chong] As everyone knows, the world recognizes that even in  our special status, we have made all possible, well-intended,  efforts to prove the transparency of our nuclear activities.  However, the more we accepted inspections by the agency, the  more the pressure on us has increased and the more things have  become complicated, so that the security and sovereignty of our  Republic are being threatened at every moment. This is an  intolerable, serious matter.    [Yi] Yes, it really is.    [Chong] Frankly speaking, human patience has its limits,  doesn't it?    [Yi] Yes, it does. Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat  have escalated the anti-Republic crushing maneuver  [pangonghwaguk apsal chaektongul kyedansiguro hwaktaehae watko],  ignoring all our good intentions and tolerance [sonuiwa aryang].  On 10 June, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted an unreasonable  resolution on suspension of the agency's assistance for our  country while demanding the opening of our military sites [kunsa  taesangdul] over the nuclear issue. This is the agency's  sanction against us and, in essence, a prelude to UN sanctions.  In this, the United States and the agency's Secretariat openly  revealed their attempt to infringe upon our sovereignty and  crush us by using the inspection lever [sachal konggan].    [Chong] You are right. The IAEA Secretariat's forcible  demand that we allow overall inspection [chonmyon sachal] by the  agency and its threat to impose so-called sanctions on us are an  intolerable insult to our people who regard independence as  their lives.    [Yi] I agree.    [Chong] Our people are not the sort of people who take  insults to their national sovereignty and dignity. The more  pressure and sanctions are imposed on us, the stronger our will  will grow and the more free our peaceful nuclear activities will  become.    As we declared on many occasions, any brigandish logic or  strong-armed action can never work with us. If hostile forces  [choktae seryoktul] impose new sanctions on us despite our  repeated warnings, we will take stern self-defensive measures  commensurate with it.    [Yi] I believe so. With our country's Foreign Ministry  spokesman's 13 June statement that plainly reflects our people's  firm will, we will consider all unreasonable resolutions adopted  by the IAEA with regard to our issue up to the present as  invalid and will not be bound to any rule or decision of the  agency hereafter. Without the agency, we can develop our  independent nuclear power industry and expand international  cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities [haekhwaltong  punya].    Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed until we  decide whether to return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  or to completely withdraw from it. Hence, there is nothing for  the agency's inspectors to do any further in our country.    As sanctions cannot coexist with dialogue, it is our  inevitable choice to respond to further sanctions by the United  States, some officials of the IAEA, and the hostile forces with  further self-defensive measures. Our steadfast position will  never change until the nuclear issue is fairly resolved through  dialogue and negotiations.    [Chong] You are right. Our people value the national  dignity and sovereignty as their lives. Our people will never  allow any act by the U.S. imperialists and some officials of the  IAEA Secretariat to infringe upon our sovereignty and to crush  us.    [Yi] Absolutely not.    [Chong] The United States, some officials of the IAEA  Secretariat, and hostile forces had better discreetly act while  facing reality in the face.    [Yi] Right.    [Chong] We must now conclude our dialogue.    [Yi] All right.</p>

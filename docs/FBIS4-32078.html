			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Party of Yugoslavs in Macedonia  [DPJM] has protested after the Macedonian authorities banned the  entry and stay in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] of some Serbian Orthodox priests, and  considers that this cannot be compatible with a democratic  society.    The DPJM has also protested because yesterday some other  Serbian Orthodox priests were not allowed to enter Macedonia as  civilians either, which represents a serious violation of the  democratic and constitutional principles of Macedonia, and it is  another instance of the tough repression of the population of  Serbian nationality, which has already been deprived of its  rights.    The DPMJ has also protested the irrational and, in its view,  irresponsible statements by the Head of the Macedonian Orthodox  Church Mihail.</p>

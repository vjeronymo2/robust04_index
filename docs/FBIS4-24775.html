			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 3 KYODO -- The Chinese Government  will soon allow the young spiritual head of the Kagyu sect of  Tibetan Buddhism to make his first visit to his seat in Rumtek  monastery in northeast India, sources belonging to the sect said  Thursday [2 June].    The 11-year-old Ugyen Thinley Dorjee, whose identity as the  reincarnation of the sect's 16th karmapa was revealed in 1992,  currently lives in the sect's former headquarters in Tsurphu  monastery, some 50 kilometers from the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.    "The Chinese Government has agreed to allow the new karmapa  to go to India for a brief visit," the sources said. The timing  and duration of the visit is still unknown, they said.    A high-level team of lamas, including Tai Situ Rimponche who  was largely responsible for the discovery of the sect's 17th  living god, returned to the Indian capital of New Delhi after  successful negotiations with the Chinese Government in the last  week of May, the sources said.    The reincarnation of the 16th karmapa was found with Chinese  help through a prediction letter which Tai Situ Rimpoche, a  regent of the last karmapa, discovered in 1989 almost a decade  after the last karmapa's death.    All 15 karmapas since 1193 were identified in their  childhood  on the basis of prediction letters left by their predecessors.    However, a rival group of lamas questioning the authenticity  of the letter this March enthroned a 10-year-old Tibetan boy,  Tenzin Chentse, in a Buddhist monastery in New Delhi claiming he  is the last karmapa's true reincarnation.    According to a Tibetan follower of the sect, it is the first  time that two karmapas have been enthroned, although numerous  succession struggles have occurred throughout the sect's  900-year history.    Both vie for control over Rumtek monastery, which became the  sect's center after the last Karmapa fled Tibet during the 1959  uprising. The karmapa is considered No. 3 in Tibet's  religio-political hierarchy after the dalai lama and the panchen  lama.    By retaining the new karmapa in Tibet, Beijing is trying to  calm the restive Tibetan populace there, one expert on Tibet  said.    Beijing needs a religious figure compliant to its policies,  with the panchen lama dead in early 1989 and no successor in  sight, and the dalai lama remaining in his self-imposed Indian  exile, he said.</p>

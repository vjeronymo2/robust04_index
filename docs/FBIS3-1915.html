			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Lie the Differences?"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the British side violated the principle  of keeping the talks confidential and unilaterally published a  White Paper entitled "Hong Kong's Representative Government."  This was a remarkable piece of writing and a very good negative  example which may serve as a lesson. The fourth part of the  White Paper, "Conclusion and the Way Forward," says: "Many of  the individual issues covered in the talks were, in themselves,  technical. But the fundamental difference between the two sides  was simple." This remark is quite true; however, the British  side's description of the "fundamental difference" was  absolutely absurd. According to its White Paper, the difference  was that the British side's proposal on the political structure  was prodemocratic, but the Chinese side's proposal was  antidemocratic. Here, facts were simply stood on their head,  and things were turned completely upside down.    The differences between the Chinese and British sides were  absolutely not about whether there should be democracy or how  much democracy should be adopted. What Britain is now  practicing is a system of constitutional monarchy, and the  British people themselves may judge whether such a system is  good or bad. Britain, however, has no right to impose its  system on other countries. Hong Kong is a place that belongs to  China, and China will soon resume sovereignty over Hong Kong.  It is a matter of course that Britain has no right to demand  that China also adopt its system in Hong Kong. The appointment  of a failed politician by the British ruling authorities to be  governor in a territory forcefully occupied by Britain was  itself not an event representative of democracy at all, and this  is self-evident. When Chris Patten took office as governor of  Hong Kong, he decided to play tricks like he did in the British  political circles and stir up trouble in Hong Kong. The  so-called democratic political reform was just a fig leaf.  Proceeding from some Westerners' prejudices, he blamed China  for not practicing democracy and not allowing Hong Kong to  practice democracy. Using the Western mass media to spread this  point of view was Patten's primary method for deceiving the Hong  Kong people. However, British Foreign Secretary Hurd said in  the preface for the White Paper: "The Sino-British Joint  Declaration of 1984 and China's Basic Law for Hong Kong, which  will come into force as of 1 July 1997, between them set the  pace for democratic development in Hong Kong. There is no  argument about that." Here, Hurd slapped his own face as well  as Patten's. Since the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law have  already set the pace of democracy in Hong Kong, why did the  British not adopt a constitutional package which converges with  the Basic Law, and why did the British authorities abet the  Legislative Council members they had appointed to attack such  convergence by saying that "the theory of convergence is our  enemy"? Obviously, the British side had another intention, and  what they actually hoped was to extend colonial rule under the  pretense of seeking "democracy."    People have often pointed out that the fundamental  differences between the Chinese side and the British side lay in  whether one should keep one's promise in international  relations. Hurd admitted that the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law already set the pace of democracy in Hong Kong, but  the British authorities still perversely went against the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law. The consultation mechanism  specified by the Joint Declaration was also cast aside by the  British authorities. Hurd avoided mentioning the seven letters  he exchanged with the Chinese foreign minister in early 1990 on  the election arrangements in Hong Kong and the agreements and  understandings reached by these letters. The White Paper even  said that the seven diplomatic letters "did not reach any  agreement (on the 1995 election arrangements)." What Patten did  in the first 18 months after he took office in Hong Kong showed  that the British completely disregarded the basic norm of acting  in good faith in international relations, and moved as far as  shamelessly denying that the process of democracy in Hong Kong  had been specified by the Joint Declaration and the seven  diplomatic letters and insisting that Patten's "three violation"  package be arbitrarily enforced in the last months of British  colonial rule. Britain is a major power, but it still can  behave so shamelessly as ignoring diplomatic documents which it  had already signed. What international credibility will such a  country maintain? The behavior of the British authorities since  Patten become governor of Hong Kong only recorded their perfidy.  This time, they violated the principle of keeping the talks  confidential and unilaterally published the White Paper. This  just added one more page to the record of their dishonor. Will  they still be able to really bring any democracy to Hong Kong in  the last 40 months of their rule? By contrast, the Chinese  Government always faithfully honors its international  commitments, and this is a fact admitted by the international  community.    The British side behaved perfidiously under the pretense of  "democracy." What was their real intention? Patten's package  and the political structure that the British side tried to  impose on Hong Kong beyond 1997 as revealed by the White Paper  showed that they were unwilling to give up the territory that  they had occupied for over 150 years. That is to say, London  was trying by every possible means to extend its rule in Hong  Kong. The British authorities have been attempting to simply  return Hong Kong to China in a formalistic way and continue  their de facto control over Hong Kong. This was self-evident.  Approximately 10 years ago, Mrs Thatcher tried to impede China  from resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and  she inevitably ran into snags. Deng Xiaoping made it clear to  her: "Sovereignty is not a question which is open for  discussion." In July 1984, when meeting with then British  Foreign Secretary Howe, Deng Xiaoping showed his foresight and  pointed out: "We hope that the British Hong Kong Government  will not set up a body in order to impose it on the government  of the Special Administrative Region." Patten's constitutional  package was precisely a plan for unilaterally setting up a body  in the transitional period in an attempt to impose it on the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This represented a  serious challenge to China's sovereign power. Sovereignty is  the crucial issue and the essence of the fundamental nature of  the Sino-British fundamental differences over Hong Kong's  political structure. On this issue, the British side was unable  to advance further arguments and justify itself and had no  strength to confront itself with China. Patten and his ilk were  as ridiculous as an ant trying to topple a giant tree.</p>

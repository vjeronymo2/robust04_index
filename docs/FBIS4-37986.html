			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Presidency </F> Council"; place and date not given]    [Text] From the first moment, the Democratic Republic of  Yemen has accepted the Security Council Resolution 924, and that  the Sanaa regime was the one which refused to accept and  actually adhere to the Security Council's resolution and all the  international and Arab initiatives and appeals as evidenced by  its attacks [passage indistinct] and that what the Democratic  Republic of Yemen was doing was to defend itself and its  citizens.    Therefore, we welcome the Security Council's decision issued  last night and announce our commitment to it. [Passage  indistinct] our right to defend ourselves and our citizens  against [passage indistinct] be it on the battle fronts or on  the innocent civilian citizens in Aden which the forces of the  north shell them with all types of weapon of destruction in  front of the whole world.    The question which exists today is about this unjustified  delay in [passage indistinct] brother Lakhdar Brahimi's meetings.    We have accepted brother Lakhdar Brahimi's initiative to  hold  talks with the other side without conditions, and it became  clear to his excellency and to the world that the other side was  the one which was putting conditions [passage indistinct].    Once more, we accept the contents of the Security Council's  statement in an immediate cease-fire and the holding of  unconditional talks under the auspices of the United Nations.    At the same time, we do not want our acceptance to be taken  either by the Security Council as a reason to postpone taking  the necessary measures to implement its resolution, nor by the  international sides to postpone recognizing the Democratic  Republic of Yemen, which was established to stay, and which our  people have sacrificed hundreds of martyrs to defend it [passage  indistinct], or for our acceptance to be taken as usual to give  more time to the Sanaa regime to continue usurping our lands  [passage indistinct] and our vital installations. This  aggression [words indistinct] Arab and international community.    The presidency council in the Democratic Republic of Yemen  felt proud and exalted by this steadfastness which the history  of our region has never witnessed anything similar, the high  morale and the readiness to offer sacrifices [passage  indistinct] aggression.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: US sellers unsettle Reuters News and financial information group Reuters experienced a dramatic turnaround in its share price yesterday after a number of investors, particularly in the US, decided that the stock had become overpriced. In early trading, the stock moved steadily upwards with the market to hit a high of 1788p. The share price was driven forward by a bear squeeze - marketmakers short of stock struggling to square their trading books. It was also influenced by news that Reuters is to invest Dollars 125m in the purchase of Teknekron Software Systems of California. Then in the afternoon, Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, turned seller arguing that the stock had risen too far. Lehman analyst Mr Alastair Smellie said: 'The software deal is definitely a good acquisition, which alleviates Reuters cash pile problem. But given that the shares have risen by 30 per cent since July, consolidation must be a very real possibility.' There was also some concern that the company's big grip on dealing room technology might lay it open to criticism from the UK Monopolies and Merger Commission. The share price turned the corner in the afternoon and slid back to close a net 2 lower on the day at 1758p with 1.3m traded.</p>

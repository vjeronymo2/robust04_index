			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORALE OF MARINES IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> The Times takes exception to the order of the Marine Corps commandant. It goes  on to say that he should be taking steps to increase morale by providing  various recreational facilities and so on.  </P> <P> The Times obviously knows nothing of the history of the Marine Corps or of the  way Marines talk to each other. When surrounded by more than 100,000 Chinese  during the Korean war, the commander of the 1st Marine Division said, "Now we  have them just where we want them; we can attack in any direction." Another  Marine colonel during a desperate Pacific battle urged a reluctant Marine  forward by saying "Get out of that foxhole. Do you want to live forever!"  </P> <P> In addressing his Marines in Saudi Arabia, probably on the eve of a great  battle, Gray was acutely aware of the hardships they are going through and  probably raised morale a little by "ordering" that there be morale.  </P> <P> Lighten up, Times; that's the way Marines are.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. JACK SWALLOWS  </P> <P> USMCR (Ret.)  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: US broker fined Dollars 36m MORGAN STANLEY, the US broker, was fined Dollars 36m on charges by the state of West Virginia that it was responsible for trades that lost millions of dollars from the state's investment fund in 1987, Reuter reports from Charleston. A spokeswoman for the firm said it planned to appeal. 'We expect it to be overturned on appeal,' she said. West Virginia sued Morgan Stanley over about Dollars 40m lost in three deals in which the firm was involved in 1987. Judge Andrew MacQueen had ruled it owed the state Dollars 32m from those trades, leaving the jury to rule on whether Morgan Stanley was guilty of fraud. The spokeswoman said the West Virginia Consolidated Fund, involved in the transactions, realised gains of more than Dollars 500m during the period in question, even as it was losing the Dollars 32m. Judge MacQueen had ruled before the trial opened that those trades violated the Consolidated Fund's guidelines.</p>

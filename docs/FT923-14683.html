			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: An Ideal Husband With the comment 'Only people who look dull ever go into the House of Commons, and only the dull ever succeed there.' Oscar Wilde was not writing political commentary 1992 style but comedy 1895 style. The week Lady Thatcher took her seat in the Lords, Wilde's An Ideal Husband at The Royal Exchange, Manchester, claimed that joining the Upper House signalled that one has ended one's political ambitions. James Maxwell's fine production touches the wit and the wisdom in Wilde. An Ideal Husband has the usual Wilde serve-and-volley wit with sporadic passing shots. The epigrams are delivered with point, and the deeper rhythms of this highly moral play emerge clearly. An Ideal Husband balances public virtue and private vice. Politics means realpolitik: 'Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons, and what this century regards is wealth.' Sir Robert Chiltern, the Dorian Gray of the financial markets, has based his spotless political career on trading information for money in Suez Canal shares. Twenty years on, a blackmailer (Mrs Cheveley) threatens to expose him unless he trades his influence for his reputation by manipulating a Commons Commission on Argentinian waterways. Chiltern, the ideal husband, stands to lose his wife's respect: by dishonestly fixing the Commission, or by having his duplicitous past revealed. The acting, particularly from Robert Glenister (Lord Goring, 'the idlest man in London') as Chiltern's worldly and dandyish friend, draws on the moral scope in Wilde's text. Chiltern and his wife (Tom Chadbon and Emily Morgan) resist the machinations of Brenda Blethyn's Mrs Cheveley and emerge with moral as well as social dignity; but they uncover the woe that is in marriage. As Lord Goring's father says: 'Dammit, Sir, it's your duty to get married, you can't always be living for pleasure.' Wilde's advice is to marry a tolerant partner. For he knew that life can be neither understood nor lived without charity. This serious play lightly figured, delivers a fine lesson showing how truth is rarely pure and never simple. Royal Exchange, Manchester (061) 833 9833, until 8 August</p>

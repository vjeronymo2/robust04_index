			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo counts its blessings, up 25% in Dollars terms - After some pessimism latterly, analysts are beginning to be hopeful about 1995 In spite of the pessimism which shrouded the Tokyo stock market for the latter half of this year, the holiday season seems to have brightened sentiment. Investors trying to look on the brighter side of things might have focused on the fact that, to date, the leading Nikkei index is still 12 per cent higher in local currency terms since the end of last year, and 25 per cent higher in dollar terms thanks to the sharp appreciation of the yen. However, the 225 average is off 9.7 per cent from the year's high of 21,552.81 in mid-June. Although share prices surged in the first few months of this year thanks to buying by overseas fund managers trying to join the expected economic recovery, the reluctance of domestic institutions to follow suit has been partly responsible for the slack performance. Not only have Japanese institutional investors, life assurers and banks, failed to purchase shares during the past year due to the decline in unrealised profits on stock holdings, but they have been selling shares to counter losses from bad loans and insurance payouts. According to Credit Suisse, unrealised gains of stock holdings at the country's top 18 life assurers for the year to March this year totalled Y12,500bn, down 72 per cent from the peak in 1988. In short, demand for Japanese shares this year has almost been limited to foreign fund managers and public pension and postal insurance funds which have bought shares to prop up the equity market rather than for strictly investment reasons. In the midst of this low demand, the government, in November, proceeded to float Japan Tobacco. The cigarette monopoly absorbed about Y570bn from the market. Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, expects buying by life assurers to remain muted as their investment strategies continue to be conservative. He believes that life companies have a problem with their solvency margin levels and that they are plagued by bad debts. Investment trusts, which have been sellers during the past few months, are not expected to return to the stock market in the short term. So it is noteworthy that Japanese analysts, who have largely been painting a weak scenario for the Tokyo stock market for most of the year, have become more optimistic. Some market participants are becoming cautiously confident, and see the Nikkei index rising above the 20,000 early in 1995. Mr Yuichi Matsushita, strategist and manager of Nikko Securities investment strategy section, feels that share prices have now discounted many of the unfavourable factors surrounding the Japanese economy and corporate profits. "The bad loan situation at the banks, corporate restructuring and the high yen are not going to go away, but have been around for some time now,' he says. He places his hopes with overseas investors, who remain underweight in Japan. According to James Capel, UK pension funds, for instance, had average weightings of 5.1 per cent in Japan at the end of September against a neutral weighting within the overall overseas equity component of around 6.3 per cent. Mr Matsushita also detects waning enthusiasm towards emerging markets, and increasing wariness towards senior competitors like New York and Hong Kong. Overseas investors, reassessing their asset allocation for the new year, are once again looking at Japanese shares, he says. He sees the Nikkei index rising to between 23,000 to 24,000 next year. 'On a global level Japan is still attractive and Japanese investors could be left behind if they are too pessimistic,' he says. The economic argument for a rise in share prices is still strong. Overall corporate profits are expected to rise by 8 per cent for the year ending next March and companies are expecting a further rise in profitability for the following year. Higher corporate profits means less pressure for companies to sell stock in order to prop up their profit and loss accounts. 'In retrospect, the market this year has risen in line with corporate profits,' says one Japanese fund manager. Meanwhile Mr Kazuo Tamayama, fund manager at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, notes a recovery in the liquidity situation. Excess liquidity,he says, has stabilised and seems to be on the verge of bottoming out. In spite of the favourable economic fundamentals, however, most analysts agree that heavy selling is expected around the 20,500 to 21,500 levels. Mr James reckons that the Nikkei may not clear the 21,500 level until late next year.</p>

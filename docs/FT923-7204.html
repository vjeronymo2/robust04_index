			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Market value of Brazilian foreign debt slips 10% THE market value of Brazil's foreign bank debt has dropped by 10 per cent since the end of last week, leading a wave of bearishness that has swept through all less developed country debt markets in recent days. The slide in the value of Brazilian debt, prompted by the allegations of corruption that threaten to engulf President Fernando Collor, is widely regarded by LDC debt traders as one of the main causes for negative sentiment in the debt of countries from Mexico to Poland. Fears that Japanese banks may be forced by their capital adequacy problems to sell debt holdings ahead of the end of their half year on 30 September have also contributed to the decline. 'When the Japanese banks want to sell, you don't know whether it's going to be Dollars 10m, or Dollars 10,000m,' said Mr Ric Haller, head of the LDC debt unit at Morgan Grenfell. Selling by Japanese banks would be likely to have the biggest effects on markets such as Mexico and Venezuela, where debt prices are at a level where they more than cover the banks' provisions against losses. Inadequate provisioning, on the other hand, would be likely to prevent them from selling Brazilian debt. In late trading in London yesterday, Brazilian DFA bank debt was quoted at 27 1/4 per cent of face value. It had hovered at just above 30 per cent before selling in New York late on Friday pushed it lower. Traders said yesterday that Brazilian debt now offered the chance of substantial capital gains, although concern about the political situation meant that few buyers were likely to emerge. If Brazil converts its debt into Brady bonds at current levels and on terms so far announced, investors would receive 'incredibly high yields of more than 30 per cent a year in dollar terms,' said Mr Peter West, economic adviser at Chartered WestLB in London. The market has become increasingly concerned that the threat of impeachment to President Collor could threaten the debt restructuring deal agreed in principle with banks earlier this summer. Since the scandal first broke in June, the value of Brazilian debt has dropped from 40 per cent, returning to its level at the beginning of the year. Venezuelan debt dropped from 65 to 63 5/8 per cent yesterday, while the debt of both Poland and Morocco lost more than a percentage point. Bondholders of Control Securities, the UK company whose former chief executive, Mr Nazmu Virani, has been charged in connection with the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, have agreed to a delay in interest payments until October 12. The delay affects two Swiss franc issues, the 7 1/2 bonds due 1994 and the 8 7/8 due 1997.</p>

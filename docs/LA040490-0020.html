			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3.9 EARTHQUAKE RATTLES LAKE ARROWHEAD  </P> <P> A 3.9-magnitude earthquake shook the mountainous area around Lake Arrowhead  Tuesday evening, apparently causing no serious damage.  </P> <P> Caltech seismologists said the quake at 7:13 p.m. was centered six miles  northeast of the lake.  </P> <P> Few residents of San Bernardino or other areas below Lake Arrowhead reported  feeling the temblor.  </P> <P> "It was just one sharp jolt," said Stella Kerkvliet, manager of Jensen's Minute  Shoppe in the village of Cedar Glen on the east side of the lake. "Then the  liquor bottles started shaking, and they were ringing just like bells all in a  row. But none of them fell off the shelves."  </P></p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Hard times ahead for Serb democrats A FLEDGLING democratic movement is trying to establish itself in Serbia against overwhelmingly odds, in the form of an uncompromising domestic regime and international isolation. Mr Dobrica Cosic, recently elected president of the reconstituted Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), is now engaged in extensive talks with opposition movements in Serbia, with the aim of eroding the powers of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president. Although Mr Cosic was one of the architects of the plan for a greater Serbia promoted by Mr Milosevic, he now recognises that this plan has failed miserably. Already, the Serbian president has lost control over sections of the army, which in theory is now directly under the control of Mr Cosic. In addition, he has lost the support of the influential Serbian Academy of Sciences, the Orthodox church, and the university. Managers of major enterprises have denounced Mr Milosevic for his catastrophic economic policies, while the students, on strike now for 11 days, are demanding his resignation. For his part, Mr Cosic, whose authority in Serbia is considerable, wants to create a broad platform of support to pave the way for free and democratic elections later this year. 'The question is whether Mr Cosic has the strength to carry out his plan . . . and prevent the country from sliding into civil war,' said a senior European Community diplomat. 'We do not know how Milosevic will react. He is still capable of generating conflicts, for instance in Kosovo,' the diplomat said. 'Moreover, when the people reach a certain level of economic deprivation, they will take to the streets, and nobody will be able to control masses which will not be demanding democracy,' he explained. These efforts are also being hindered by fears that additional sanctions will be imposed. 'The small democratic movement will be completely destroyed', he adds.</p>

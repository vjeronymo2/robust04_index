			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Poll victory for socialists shakes Greek government GREECE'S conservative government was shaken yesterday after a 35 per cent swing to the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) in an Athens by-election at the weekend. The Athens Stock Exchange index dropped by 2 per cent after the final result was announced, giving Pasok an unexpected 68 per cent of the poll as voters protested against the government's austerity policy. The by-election was held in a large suburban Athens constituency where unemployment is rising and many residents are affected by a public sector pay freeze imposed by the ruling conservatives. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, called on the government to resign, saying its foreign policy 'is highly dangerous and its economic policy unpopular and unjust.' Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, said the government had 'got the message' but was determined to press on with economic reforms to bring the Greek economy into line with its EC partners.</p>

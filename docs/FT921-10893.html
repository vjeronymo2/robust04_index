			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Good showing in Japan lifts world index A strong showing in Japan, on the back of futures-linked buying, helped lift the overall performance of global stock markets last week. According to the FT-Actuaries World indices, the world index rose 0.5 per cent in local currency terms, but it would have fallen by the same amount if Japan's 2.9 per cent increase had been excluded. Nomura International says that although sentiment in Tokyo remains depressed, due to tokkin and mutual fund selling to meet redemptions and the prospect of further political scandals, the oversold nature of the stock market could prompt a recovery. Another pointer to an upward equity correction is the increased volatility in index options, which have increased their influence on the Tokyo stock market during the past few months. Europe performed better than the world index with a 1.2 per cent rise on the week, thanks mainly to a 2.4 per cent rise in the UK. Europe also produced the week's best rise in the FT-A world indices, with Austria rising 4.3 per cent. The Austrian market fell by 14.2 per cent last year as civil unrest in Yugoslavia prompted an exodus by international investors. Mr Martin Gollner, Austrian analyst at Baring Securities, says that foreigners had started to return and were keen to pick up cheap, cyclical companies in anticipation of an economic recovery in Europe in 1993. Radex and Veitscher, two producers of refractory bricks for furnaces, were in demand. Volume also improved, and stood at Sch758m (Dollars 66m) last Friday, well up on September's average daily volume of Sch539m. However, Mr Gollner is cautious about the overall outlook for Austria, which is restricted by high interest rates in neighbouring Germany, depressed economies in eastern Europe and the prospect of a flood of rights issues which were delayed last year. Sweden was the week's worst faller, on opposition to the Volvo/Procordia merger.</p>

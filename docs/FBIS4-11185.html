			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 23 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- In a message of  condolence addressed to Richard Nixon's family, Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today lamented the former  U.S. President's death. Salinas expressed his condolences to  Nixon's daughters Patricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower, the  president's office reported in a press communique.    Nixon, 81, died in a New York hospital on Friday night. On  Monday, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, which kept him in a  coma until his death. He had to step down in 1974 as the result  of the Watergate scandal. Nixon's funeral will take place at  Yorba Linda, his birthplace in California, next Wednesday.</p>

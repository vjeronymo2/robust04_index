			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: One huge gamble - Off the Wall 'WHAT'S happening?' enquire arts administrators of journalists, artists of their agents. The answer is a resounding silence. Since David Mellor took over as Secretary of State for the new Ministry of the National Heritage the arts world has been coated in aspic, and is likely to remain so for the next three months. Sensibly Mellor will closely scrutinise every aspect of his rag-tag empire, which embraces the performing arts and broadcasting, sport and the heritage, before making the profound changes destined to come from a man with his ambition, energy and inclination. The first priorityis to find an architecturally distinguished home for his 350 strong work force, assembled from a host of ministries and currently based around the old Office of Arts and Libraries. At least the team is in place, and Mellor plans no additional junior ministers to handle the arts or sport on a daily basis. He will take all the major decisions, allowing his number two, Robert Key, to over-see the one area Mellor still feels ill at ease with - the national heritage. A new PS, Hayden Phillips, has been brought in from the Treasury to try and restrain expenditure. Mellor made it clear this week that everything will be reviewed, including the Arts Council. He will read with interest the Council's 'National Strategy for the Arts', the first draft of which emerges next week, but there are already signs that the new Ministry regards this as the unfinished business of the old regime. Under Mellor the drift towards regional funding, to the devolution of the arts, may well be halted, but the key funding decisions are likely to be made by Mellor rather than a re-inforced Arts Council. 'I don't want this Ministry to be regarded as the old Office of Arts and Libraries on wheels' said Mellor this week. He obviously envisages a much more streamlined conveyance. Pushing the mobile metaphors further he is also loathe to be regarded 'as a stage coach packed with gold travelling through Indian territory and in danger of losing a few gold bars here, a few more there, in skirmishes with Indians.' The gold is obviously the proceeds of the National Lottery. The best estimate is that the Lottery should be up and running by 1994 and capable of generating up to Pounds 1.5b a year. This is an amazing amount of money. It is just dawning on Mellor and his team (it has yet to penetrate the arts world generally) that instead of being one of the smallest and most impoverished of departments the Ministry for National Heritage could be amazingly well endowed. The arts in the UK are about to embark on a period of largesse not seen since the Prince Regent went on a buying spree. Just consider the facts. The arts could receive Pounds 250m as its share of the Lottery. It plans to concentrate the money on refurbishing the superstructure of the arts, museum buildings and such like. In Year One it could commit enough to shore up for a century the V&amp;A, the Tate, the British Museum, and the National Gallery. In Year Two (if it was feeling soft hearted) it could give Covent Garden the Pounds 90m it needs for its re-development and fund a national dance house. But what on earth is it going to spend the money on in Years Three, Four, etc? No doubt the expenditure on the performing arts, which, in theory, comes from a separate budget, will be trimmed somewhat, but you can just imagine the picture stories in the popular tabloids - of derelict hospitals wards, prefab schools on the one hand, while great palaces for culture, providing nourishment for the middle classes, arise elsewhere. The arts will have a fight on their hands holding on to the money if life and death public services seem under funded. No one has yet worked out whether the arts can handle all the extra money which is targetted its way. If Mellor is looking for another transportation metaphor to describe his department he might consider, then quickly reject, 'a gravy train'. In his brief three month incarnation as Arts Minister in 1990 Mellor raised hackles by his tangible support for the London Philharmonic Orchestra, of which he had been a board member. The febrile world of London music will be alert for more favouritism, especially as the LPO has made itself unpopular since assuming the position of 'house' orchestra at the South Bank Centre from the autumn. The LPO has undoubted privileges, spelt out in the Tooley Report which heralded its appointment. But it seems to want more and has run into conflict with the Philharmonia, which acquired the status of 'best friend' of the South Bank. In terms of performances there is not much between them - 50 subscription concerts a season for the LP0; 45 for the Philharmonia. Both get the chance to rehearse in the Festival Hall. But the Philharmonia's position of power without responsibility is irritating the LPO and already there are clashes appearing in the musical calendar. Next May for example the Philharmonia is performing Mahler's 7th Symphony under Sinopoli and in the same month the LPO is entrusting the work to Tennstedt. This is just the kind of thing that the residency was designed to avoid. In theory London's four commercial orchestras are entering a period of calm. The LSO is resident at the Barbican, the LPO and the Philharmonia nestle on the South Bank and enjoyseasons at Glyndebourne and Paris respectively, while the RPO is free to tour the world and be commercial. But the new scenario carries seeds of disaster. Next season the Festival Hall will be dark on well over 50 nights for rehearsal time. Audiences have been thinned by the recession and on average the Hall is less than two thirds full. The LPO will be asked to present challenging concerts. We could see a public reaction against a South Bank which appears to be either closed or presenting music of the third Viennese School. But if audiences yearn for the good old days of populist works the musicians have never had it so good. Big increases in subsidy to the favoured orchestras mean that earnings have more than doubled in the past four years as the orchestras compete for the best players. The Philharmonia has even introduced holidays and sabbaticals - on the strict understanding that the musicians do not moonlight during their breaks.</p>

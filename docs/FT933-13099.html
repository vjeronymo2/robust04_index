			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / People: New md at Carlton June de Moller was reading for the bar and had every intention of becoming a barrister - until she became completely fascinated by commerce. After various jobs in the printing industry more than 20 years ago, she joined a small printing company called Tangent Industries which was run by two brothers - Michael and David Green. Yesterday June de Moller became managing director of the company that grew out of Tangent - Carlton Communications, the media group now capitalised at Pounds 1.46bn. She replaces Keith Edelman who was headhunted to replace David Dworkin as chief executive of Storehouse, the retail group. De Moller has run individual divisions of Carlton, where she has been a director since 1983, but for the past two years has been in charge of corporate strategy and business development. 'I think that extra experience in strategy from a more global view made the difference,' says de Moller. At 46 she is a non-executive director of Anglian Water and on the board of the Riverside Mental Health Trust. At the same time as promoting de Moller, the Carlton board has reorganised directors' responsibilities. Thomas Epley, chief executive of Technicolor, Carlton's video cassette and film duplication subsidiary, joins the board with responsibility for group video and film services. Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television, the ITV company which holds the London weekday licence, will now be responsible for all broadcasting and software businesses including Pickwick, the video producer and distributor. Both will report to de Moller, who never did become a barrister. She will have direct responsibility for Carlton's television equipment businesses. Bernard Cragg, Carlton's finance director, will take on the extra responsibility of strategy.</p>

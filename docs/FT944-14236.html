			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort China Fund placing to raise Pounds 19m Kleinwort Benson's China Investment &amp; Development Fund is seeking to raise Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m) of new capital through a placing of new shares and warrants. Units of five shares and one warrant are priced at Dollars 55. The fund is also making a scrip issue of one warrant for every five shares held on October 14. The Guernsey-incorporated, London-listed fund was launched in 1992 to invest in joint ventures in China. It now has investments in 10 joint ventures, accounting for 90 per cent of its capital. Results for the year to September 30 showed a net asset value of Dollars 10.10 per share, with losses of 11 cents per share. In July the fund announced plans to double its size with a Dollars 60m fund raising exercise. That has been scaled back, but the placing could be expanded to a maximum of Dollars 60m if there is sufficient demand. The placing closes on October 28.</p>

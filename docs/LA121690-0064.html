			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIVERSITY OF U.S. RELIGIONS  </P> <P> The recent study on schoolbook challenges ("Schoolbook Challenges on Steady  Course," Dec. 7) is only going to get worse.  </P> <P> The far-too-often-quoted Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of the Coalition for Traditional  (Christian Fundamentalist) Values in Anaheim is going to have an even greater  challenge to his effort to establish Christian Fundamentalism as the one and  only true and established state religion in his Christian America.  </P> <P> Soon the now 10 million American Moslems (latest count and growing) are going  to be making their voices heard in the public school system. Soon, the likes of  the Rev. Pat Robertson and the Rev. Lou Sheldon will have to face the reality  that America is now, in 1990, a Judeo-Christian-Islamic nation with a strong  and growing minority of Buddhists from Vietnam, China, Japan and Cambodia, all  legally voting and intelligent American citizens.  </P> <P> Soon the educational system is going to have realities from all over the world  that will turn the hair of Sheldon and Robertson Santa Claus white. And it's  about time.  </P> <P> America is fast becoming the first international and universal nation on earth.  Let's all wake up and smell the coffee, Rev. Lou and Rev. Pat!  </P> <P> ALAN ALBERT SNOW, Balboa Island  </P></p>

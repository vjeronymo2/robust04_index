"I cannot add anything to what he said,"  Kozyrev added.    On Tuesday, Boris Yeltsin said Russia is not yet linking the  situation in Bosnia to membership in NATO's Partnership for  Peace scheme. "But Russia is also in no hurry to sign that  programme," the Russian president said on Tuesday.    Asked if he is planning a trip to the former Yugoslavia,  Andrey Kozyrev replied "not in the next day or two".</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / India may face snap poll if Rao loses vote today INDIA'S political parties were yesterday facing the possibility of a snap general election if Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's government is defeated in a key parliamentary vote today. Most observers believe an early election remains unlikely. But hurried meetings yesterday of the Congress party and the opposition groupings reflect the politicians' nervousness. Mr Rao's government is not sure of obtaining an absolute majority to defeat an opposition motion condemning the administration's handling of inflation and unemployment. The initial intention of the Opposition Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the left-wing parties had been simply to humiliate the government through defeating it on an amendment. But at the end of last week, the prime minister responded with brinkmanship of his own by declaring that he would regard any defeat as bringing about the resignation of his government. Mr Rao took such an extreme step in part to ensure full party support in today's vote. But his move also reflects a cold calculation by Congress that it might substantially improve its parliamentary position in an early poll. Congress did unexpectedly well in recent local elections in the Punjab and Bombay. The BJP, however, responded to the prime minister's brinkmanship yesterday with a display of cold nerves itself. The party's spokesman said that 'nothing can be ruled out in Monday's showdown'. But he added that, if the government fell, it would be the responsibility of Congress. The political crisis comes as the country's stock markets are due to reopen today after their closure since Wednesday to curb speculative fever. The presidents of the main stock markets called on investors to be cautious.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] A plan to reform party and government organizations  in Anhui Province was officially adopted recently. With the  permission of the party Central Committee and State Council, the  number of party and government departments in organizations  directly under the provincial authority will be cut down after  the reform to 55, which is 15 less than the present 70.  Basically, the reform will be carried out simultaneously in the  provincial people's congress, the provincial committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the  provincial people's court, the provincial people's  procuratorate, in nongovernment provincial organizations, and in  democratic parties.    The provincial party committee and provincial government  held  a work meeting on the reform of organizations directly under the  provincial authority at the provincial party committee assembly  hall on the afternoon of 20 April. At the meeting, there was a  mobilization talk, and specific arrangements were made for  reforming organizations directly under the provincial authority  and for implementing the national public service system. The  meeting was presided over by Yang Yongliang, deputy secretary of  the provincial party committee. Vice Governor Yang Duoliang  announced the plan to reform organizations directly under the  provincial authority and made specific demands concerning its  implementation. Liu Guangcai, standing committee member and  organization department head of the provincial party committee,  attended the meeting. Yang Yongliang delivered an important  speech before the meeting concluded.    Yang Yongliang said: Organizational reform and the  implementation of the national public service system are one of  the 10 major tasks proposed by the 14th national party congress  and are a major event in the political life of our province.  The effective implementation of the organizational reform is of  great significance to efforts to deepen the reform in all  aspects, open up wider, promote development, and maintain  stability. Leaders at all levels and the vast numbers of  government functionaries should be more aware of the importance  of organizational reform; earnestly unify their thoughts around  the arrangements made by the party Central Committee, State  Council, provincial party committee, and provincial government;  adopt an overall point of view; willingly subordinate local  interests to overall interests, departments to the overall  situation, and individuals to the organizations; and  enthusiastically support and participate in reform. The vast  numbers of party members, particularly those who are also  responsible cadres, should lead cadres, workers, and staff  members in organizations directly under the provincial authority  -- and even cadres, workers, and staff members of province-wide  organizations -- by setting an example in implementing reform.    Yang Yongliang pointed out: Leaders at all levels should  involve themselves in the organizational reform and  implementation of the national public service system in a spirit  of reform. They should use reformative methods to solve  problems which occur during the transition from the old to the  new system so that the organizational reform and implementation  of the public service system can proceed from an advanced level  in the initial stage. They should focus on completing the  reform of organizations directly under the provincial authority  and on implementing the national public service system at the  fastest possible pace and in a relatively short time while  ensuring quality at the same time. They should use  organizational reform to achieve major breakthroughs in  transforming government functions. They should regard  organizational reform and the implementation of national public  service system as the turning point, give government  functionaries comprehensive public service training and  education, further change their work style, and improve  efficiency at work so that an honest, capable, steady, and  highly efficient national public service team will be formed in  the government.    Yang Yongliang said: The difficult part of organizational  reform is transferring and distributing surplus government  workers. We must widen channels through which we can properly  assign government workers, and we must open channels for cadres  to show off their talent at the front line of economic  construction.    Yang Yongliang said emphatically: Departments at all levels  should earnestly strengthen their leadership over this task and  ensure that reform is implemented systematically and step by  step. We should enhance our sense of organization and  discipline, strictly observe all policies for organizational  reform, and strictly forbid actions which violate laws and  discipline.    In conclusion, Yang Yongliang asked the vast numbers of  government functionaries, workers, and staff members to stand  fast at their posts, fulfill their duties and responsibilities,  work hard at reform, and do solid work to achieve the desired  objectives for the reform of organizations under the provincial  authority and the implementation of the state public servant  system, and to promote the organizational reform and  implementation of the national public service system.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Doubts grow on gas power costs DOUBTS over the economics of gas-fired power stations intensified yesterday as Mr Ed Wallis, the chief executive of electricity generator PowerGen, told MPs it was unlikely that some of those being built in the UK would provide power cheaper than coal. Mr Wallis's comments to a Commons select committee inquiry into energy policy come ahead of a report next month by the electricity industry regulator on the viability of the gas stations. The construction of these is partly behind a projected slump in the demand for coal. If the regulator were to agree with PowerGen and others including its rival generator National Power, there would be widespread implications for the regional electricity companies that are in ventures to build gas stations and for the government's review of energy policy. However, the problems of British Coal finding a growing market for its products were underlined when Mr Wallis said that even if BC could compete in world markets his company would expect to reduce its share of the company's fuel input to 60 per cent. That compares with a current total of 75 per cent. In several years' time it would equate to about 18m tonnes compared with a total in the current financial year of 24m. The reduction would be a result of PowerGen's wish to have a more diversified fuel portfolio. On the economics of combined cycle gas turbine power stations, Mr Wallis said the Killingholme power station in Humberside already operated by his company would be able to supply electricity at 2.5p per unit. This compares with the 2.8p possible from a coal-powered station in 1992-3, assuming prices in contracts tentatively agreed with British Coal but still to be ratified. The select committee also heard strong criticism of the regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, from Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Association. The Institute for Public Policy Research, a left-of-centre think tank, wants a government group to be established with responsible for energy policy. It is also urging the government to adopt a national electricity generation capacity plan to make the best of fuel resources.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO WILL PAY $50,000 TO MOVE HOUSE  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach City Council, reacting to an application to demolish the  Queen Anne Cottage on South Broadway, has agreed to pay the estimated $50,000  cost of moving it to Dominguez Park, where the city hopes to establish a  "Heritage Court."  </P> <P> City officials were urged by council members to make haste in making  arrangements, since the cottage is destined for demolition to make way for a  two-unit condominium project. The property owner, Dan Murillo, agreed to delay  the razing for up to 60 days, said City Manager Tim Casey.  </P> <P> In March, the city moved another historic building, the Morrell House, from  North Catalina Street to the Perry Allison Playfield in North Redondo Beach.  However, when nearby residents protested that they didn't want their  neighborhood play field used for that purpose, the council decided on the  Dominguez Park location.  </P> <P> Neither the Morrell House nor the Queen Anne Cottage can be moved to Dominguez  Park until the Planning Commission issues a special-use permit. The matter is  scheduled for a public hearing Sept. 7.  </P></p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Boycott threat to university exams recedes THE ASSOCIATION of Uni-versity Teachers (AUT) has backed away from industrial action in pursuit of this year's pay claim. Results of the ballot of university lecturers, declared yesterday, showed only a small majority in favour of industrial action, making an examination boycott now unlikely. On a low turnout - 42 per cent - a majority of only 1,310 favoured boycotting the marking of university exams. The total poll was less than 13,000. 'University staff are grossly underpaid,' said Ms Diana Warwick, AUT general secretary. 'Our claim for a 16 per cent increase was, and is, fair and moderate, but in seeking to achieve our aim our members wish to act reasonably and professionally.' University employers last week imposed an interim settlement of 5 per cent outside the normal negotiating machinery. No further meetings with the union have been arranged. The AUT claim for 16 per cent was part of a three-year strategy to make up for a long-term shortfall in lecturers' salaries. The AUT executive decided yesterday to seek an urgent meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, to discuss extending to lecturers the pay review body already promised to school teachers. Ms Warwick kept open the possibility of industrial action should 'all avenues' of resolving the pay dispute prove unsuccessful. The issue will be debated at the union's conference next month. The AUT will concentrate instead on pressing the case for a new method of salary determination for academic staff.</p>

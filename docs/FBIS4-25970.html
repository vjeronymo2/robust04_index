			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- According to a WEN  HUI BAO report, over the last few years, party committees and  governments at all levels in Shanghai have effectively  strengthened comprehensive management of public security -- all  relevant departments, circles, and units have joined forces in  improving public security and motivated the masses to take part  in the work. Currently, a mass public security defense and  management network has covered Shanghai's urban and rural areas.    Some 400,000 people in Shanghai annually take part in mass  efforts to improve public security; 586 residents committees  (villages) have been named "small safe districts" by district,  county, or neighborhood (township, town) authorities; and not a  single criminal case took place in 1,491 residents committees  (villages) last year.</p>

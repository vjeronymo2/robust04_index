			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AD EXECUTIVE LEAVES AC&amp;R FOR COSTA MESA FIRM  </P> <P> Gary Cunningham, senior vice president and creative director at the Irvine  office of national advertising firm AC&amp;R, has jumped ship to become a  partner with an Orange County shop.  </P> <P> Cunningham plans to join Costa Mesa-based Roberts/Mealer/Emerson on Wednesday.  The firm will become Roberts/Mealer/Cunningham on Jan. 1, dropping the name of  James Emerson, who retired in June.  </P> <P> AC&amp;R was Cochrane Chase, Livingston &amp; Co. until about a year ago, when  it merged into AC&amp;R Advertising Inc., a New York-based agency. Cunningham  said the change in corporate culture is the main reason he is moving after 16  years with the same shop.  </P> <P> "AC&amp;R is completely different from anything that Cochrane Chase ever was,"  he said. "There's no home control anymore . . . (and) too much stress on  profitability rather than doing great work."  </P> <P> Roberts/Mealer/Emerson is a 38-year-old advertising and public relations firm  with about 20 people and has yearly billings of "less than $10 million,"  according to Jack Mealer, chairman of the firm.  </P> <P> Roberts/Mealer clients include Magnavox and Emerson Electronic.  </P> <P> Mealer said he expects that Cunningham will attract a number of new clients and  hopes that the firm will increase its annual billings to $20 million within  three years.  </P> <P> AC&amp;R has 70 to 80 employees and West Coast annual billings -- including the  Los Angeles, Irvine and San Diego offices -- of $80 million to $100 million.  </P></p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Polish state sell-off advances Poland's long delayed mass privatisation programme took a significant step forward yesterday when Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and Peasant party leader, approved the board members for 15 investment funds. The funds are to be handed equity in 444 state companies due to be privatised under the plan. Shares in the funds, which are to be run by mixed foreign and local managers, are to distributed to the population at a nominal fee. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently allocated Dollars 54m in loans to the programme to cover the funds' initial costs. Mr Pawlak has misgivings about the scheme, which he thinks gives too great a role to foreign managers, and long delays in approving successive steps in the programme have served to demonstrate his doubts. These are not shared by the former communist SLD party, the other member of the governing coalition. The latest decision means the funds can now be formally registered and talks with 19 shortlisted fund managers can start in January.</p>

			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: No-win on the concert front Sir, I was mystified by Max Loppert's claim that the London concert season in recent years has become 'a good deal less rich in term of novelty . . . variety and chance-taking' ('Musical jewels in tawdry settings', March 28). It seems but yesterday that the South Bank Centre in particular was being berated for precisely such adventurous 'chance-taking' programming. We did, after all, put on for the first time every, anywhere, the complete works of Schoenberg and introduced to London the first substantial appraisals of Elliott Carter, Szymanowski, Ligeti, Maxwell Davies and others, as well as our 'Brave New Worlds' modernism festival. I feel in a no-win situation. Help] Where do we go next? Nicholas Snowman, general director (arts), South Bank Centre, Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 8XX</p>

[Kliridhis] Right now, we have given the UN secretary  general's representative our views on two basic issues:    Safe access to the fenced-off part of Famagusta, along with  which we also include the issue of the security of the  fenced-off part under UN control. We cannot build by day, while  they go in and steal by night. There are two issues: Safe  access and the security of the fenced-off area. We believe the  United Nations should have responsibility for both and that  there should be access through an area under UN control.    We have also given our views on the second issue of the  timetable the secretary general wants. We have adopted the  clear position that if we reach an agreement, as soon as we sign  it the entire fenced-off area of Famagusta should be turned over  to the United Nations and placed in UN custody. According to  the agreement [on accepting the confidence-building measures],  residents should begin to return within two months in order to  proceed with repairs and so on.    These are our positions. I do not know what the Turkish  side's positions are, but if they are positive I would know  about it. So they have positions that are different from ours.    [Kaouris] Do you see the picture becoming clear in the next  two to three weeks and things going somewhere with either  positive or negative results?    [Kliridhis] As far as I know, the secretary general will now  prepare a report, which, as both sides have been told, will be  preliminary. In three weeks, he will submit another report that  will clarify things. Don't forget that the time limit is two  months. In three weeks, the new report should say whether views  have converged on the points that he has stressed are  substantive for the implementation of the confidence-building  measures.    [Kaouris] Why do you think Rauf Denktas does not accept  these  measures? The Turkish Cypriots have much to gain from them.    [Kliridhis] I believe the Turkish side--and this was crystal  clear--regarded these measures as much more in our favor because  they return the entire fenced-off part of Famagusta, which means  all the municipal boundaries of Famagusta. Denktas does not  seem as interested as we might think in operating the airport;  he does not know what airlines will use it. The airlines will  use it if there is traffic.    [Kaouris] When we discuss access, do we mean a road, a big  area, or merely the road that would have led to Famagusta?    [Kliridhis] We mean an area that will include a road and  will  be under UN control.    [Kaouris] Would it have some guardposts through which we  would cross?    [Kliridhis] Yes.    [Kaouris] Does the international element, particularly the  Americans and the British, play some positive role at this phase  and do you see at least some indications that its efforts are  turned toward Turkey?    [Kliridhis] We should first define the UN role. There is no  doubt that referring to the United Nations I mean the permanent  Security Council members. There is unanimity among the  permanent members on the confidence-building measures, and they  are watching closely to establish which side is trying to  torpedo their implementation. The latest joint move by the  Americans and Russians stresses this thing -- that is, that the  United Nations, or, if you like, at least these two permanent  members of the Security Council will work to realize the  confidence-building measures. But other permanent members also  support the confidence-building measures and warn that it would  benefit no one to reject them. I am telling you what the  permanent Security Council members say. Consequently, the  confidence-building measures enjoy the support of the permanent  Security Council members.    [Kaouris] Has the Russian element intervened actively  recently? Lamb [U.S. State Department special coordinator on  the Cyprus issue] gets a call to go to Moscow. How do we  interpret that?    [Kliridhis] It seems that for some time, Russia left the  initiative on international issues completely to the U.S.  element. But now it appears that we are entering a new period in  which, with regard to particular areas, Russia has decided to  return to the position of the big power that should be playing a  role. We saw this in Serbia. The Russian intervention had two  interpretations:    First, it appeared that a NATO military action in Serbia  could jeopardize U.S.-Russian relations, and it seems that this  was considered quite seriously. Russia pointed out that it had  both a say and influence in that area and intervened in the  direction of the Serbs so that in return, a peacekeeping force  of 400 men would be dispatched from Russia to remove the heavy  weapons. You can see that it was the first cease-fire agreement  that was kept; none of the others were kept. You cannot say  that this wasn't due to the Russian intervention.    Second, the U.S. coordinator left Washington for Moscow to  be  briefed and to align his policy. This is very important. Why  should the U.S. official visit Moscow? It is also very  important for another reason: All those who were dealing with  the Cyprus issue earlier, Nelson Ledsky and the others, made  stopovers. If they were coming from the United States, they  stopped in London and had talks with the British Government  before going to Ankara, Athens, and Nicosia. This time, there  was no visit to Cyprus. He did not leave Moscow and go to  Ankara, Athens, and Nicosia. His trip was Washington, Moscow,  and back. The question being raised is: Whose idea was this  visit? Was it a thought by the Americans to meet and coordinate  with the Russians, or was it Russia's demand to which the  Americans responded? This is the first time we have seen the  man who is entrusted with coordinating the Cyprus issue go in  another direction and make a joint decision instead of doing the  customary triangle. The United States appears to be realizing  that for particular problems to be solved, it should cooperate  with Russia.    [Kaouris] The foreign news agencies reported that Lamb was  invited by Moscow... [ellipses as published]    [Kliridhis] He responded. Don't forget that some time in the  past, when the Russians began demanding a say, the Americans  refused completely. There is a big difference now. Whether or  not the Russians asked for this--they might have asked for  it--it is now proven that Russia says there are particular areas  in which my own involvement is also needed to solve the problems.</p>

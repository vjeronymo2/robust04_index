			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Energy utility companies' monopoly under challenge THE right of Germany's large utility companies to be the sole providers of energy in urban areas has been challenged by the Bundeskartellamt, the federal cartel office. In a move which could start to open Germany's energy market to foreign competition, the Bundeskartellamt said RWE Energie AG Essen, one of the country's three main utility companies, 'had not the exclusive right to provide' energy to the town of Kleve, on the German-Dutch border. Mr Dieter Wolf, president of the Bundeskartellamt, said the relationship between local communities, towns and state utility companies, whereby utility companies had the sole, automatic right to provide power, contravened European Community competition policy. But he added that Brussels had not yet agreed how far it would go in breaking down these monopolies. 'If towns want to buy energy from other countries, and if neighbouring countries want to supply them, then these communities should have the choice,' a Bundeskartellamt official said. However, even if there is reform over the next few months, analysts believe Germany's three utility companies will in practice retain the monopoly. 'Both the town, and any new supplier would have to invest a great deal - in some cases we would be talking about a new grid system,' an analyst said. 'Furthermore, a certain amount of co-operation would be needed from the German utility companies themselves. I cannot see the utility companies competing against each other,' he added. The outcome will be watched closely by the local authorities in eastern Germany which are challenging the terms of the unification treaty which essentially gave west German companies the monopoly.</p>

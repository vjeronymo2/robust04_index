			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DIVIDED SOLIDARITY MARKS ITS 10TH YEAR;  </P> <P> POLAND: CAMPAIGN TENSIONS CHIP AWAY AT THE PARTY'S ONCE-FIERCE UNITY. SOME  OBSERVERS SEE THE SPLIT AS A SIGN OF GROWING POLITICAL MATURITY.  </P> <P> The key figures in Solidarity observed the 10th anniversary Friday of the  movement's founding -- not so much a celebration of unity as a parting of the  ways.  </P> <P> Union leader Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who seem set to  oppose each other in the campaign for the Polish presidency, both paid homage  to the spirit of 1980 in the Gdansk shipyard where Solidarity was born. It was  here that the two men sat side by side and signed the historic Gdansk accords  in which the Communist government recognized the East Bloc's first independent  trade union.  </P> <P> But Walesa delivered what could be interpreted as the opening shot of his  presidential campaign, still not officially declared despite many strong  suggestions that he is preparing to run.  </P> <P> "The revolution," he declared, "is not yet over."  </P> <P> Mazowiecki, who is milder by nature, countered, "Let us be political opponents,  but never enemies."  </P> <P> Walesa, taking up a theme sounded by his supporters, that the Mazowiecki  government has been too deliberate in initiating changes, said, "We have done a  great job, but many things have gone too slowly."  </P> <P> In a speech Thursday to shipyard workers, Mazowiecki had attempted to deflect  the criticism of the Walesa camp.  </P> <P> "This government has not been hindering, is not hindering and will not hinder  political changes," he said. "We have been speeding up, not by arguing but by  acting."  </P> <P> As many Polish political commentators noted in the days preceding the  anniversary, the deep split in Solidarity may be a sign of growing political  maturity after a period in which the normal divisions in society were papered  over by the Communist monolith.  </P> <P> In that context, the division in Solidarity represents a return to a "civil  society," where issues of public policy are openly and sometimes bitterly  debated.  </P> <P> There is nostalgia in some quarters for the fierce unity that characterized  Solidarity's decade-long fight against the Communists, a period when  Solidarity's voice was largely Walesa's. But there are philosophical divisions  in the movement, principally among those who advocate a slower and less painful  transition to a market system, accompanied by strong social welfare supports,  and those who advocate a faster and harder course.  </P> <P> The split has been exacerbated by the role of Walesa, who clearly wants the  Polish presidency. Although his goal of winning the office seems more  compelling to him than any particular difference with the Mazowiecki  government, his complaint that things are moving too slowly in the new Poland  is shared by many who complain about the archaic banking system and the  government's seeming inability to deal with telecommunications problems.  </P> <P> Walesa has said he would be the "accelerator" for Poland or would serve as "the  ax."  </P> <P> Mazowiecki's supporters say Walesa is unpredictable, inconsistent and  impetuous, and the government's spokeswoman, Malgorzata Niezabitowska, has  taken to referring to Walesa as "the accelerator with an ax."  </P> <P> Longtime Solidarity activists complain that Walesa has always had a dictatorial  streak as the head of the union, a trait they say they would not want to see in  the president.  </P> <P> And while some Poles say they resent the idea that Walesa somehow deserves the  presidency for his long years at the forefront of the fight against the  Communists, others say his determination, impatience and ability to arouse the  nation would indeed speed things up.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki and Walesa met privately for nearly an hour Friday at the shipyards  in Gdansk, their first session together since early July, and emerged smiling  but with little to say.  </P> <P> There was a brief impasse as the two prepared to get into a car to depart.  After a moment, Walesa got in at the front.  </P> <P> "I've been in the front of this fight," he said, "so I will take the front  seat."  </P></p>

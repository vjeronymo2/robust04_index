			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, in addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, these amended special conditions are issued for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes with a staggered main aisle. Other conditions may be developed as needed based on further FAA review and discussions with the manufacturer and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the amended special conditions would be applicable initially to the 30-passenger version of the Jetstream Aircraft Limited Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. Should Jetstream apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model of the 4100 series incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, these amended special conditions would apply to that model, as well, under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream, in their petition, requested that the amended special conditions be promulgated without delay as a final rule and in time to permit delivery of 30 passenger airplanes during August 1994. The FAA determined that public comment was in the public interest, but shortened the comment period to 20 days in order to expedite the issuance of these amended special conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. SC&hyph;91&hyph;4&hyph;NM for the Jetstream Aircraft Ltd. Model 4101 airplane was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 13, 1994 (59 FR 46939). Comments were received from two labor organizations and two airlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both operators comment on the improved productivity that could be realized with the additional seat on the Jetstream 4101 and strongly support the proposed amendment. One operator notes that the Joint Aviation Authorities have already approved the airplane for 30 passengers and only the FAA special conditions limit its capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third commenter is not in favor of the proposed amendment to the special conditions. This commenter argues that the exit arrangement and flight attendant seat location on the airplane are confusing and awkward. The commenter specifically criticizes the location of the flight attendant seat and the potential for the flight attendant to disrupt evacuation through the right rear exit. The FAA does not agree that the exit arrangement on this airplane in conjunction with the flight attendant seat location is in any way inadequate. The exit arrangement complies fully with all applicable regulations and provides good uniformity for the number of passengers on board. The FAA also participated in an evaluation of the flight attendant's ability to assist passengers through the right rear exit and found that this could be accomplished quite effectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter also does not feel that the emergency evacuation conducted as part of the original special conditions was adequate, and should be repeated before an increase in passengers could be considered. The commenter notes that there has been a change to the regulations regarding evacuation demonstrations since the issuance of the special conditions and believes that the new provisions were not complied with in the original demonstration. This commenter also questions whether the demonstration met the FAA's stated objective of maximizing the number of passengers who must use the aisle, and feels that the aft right-hand door should have been used for the demonstration. Additionally, the commenter interprets FAA comments to mean that the passengers were ``zig-zagging'' around the seats backs. The commenter also suggests that Jetstream should relocate the flight attendant seat to the forward bulkhead. The commenter believes that this would enhance both passenger and flight attendant safety. This last comment is not germane to these amended special conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the demonstration conditions, these were chosen by the FAA for the purpose of complying with the special conditions, and not to show compliance with the specific regulations regarding evacuation demonstrations. Therefore, changes to these regulations since the special conditions were issued are not relevant. In any case, the new provisions in the regulation were encompassed in the demonstration done for the special conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to the second concern, that the demonstration did not maximize usage of the aisle, the FAA does not agree. The evacuation demonstration was conducted with a full passenger and crew complement using only the forward entry door. This scheme was chosen for several reasons. First, the end of cabin location meant that passengers at the extreme end of the cabin would have to traverse the entire cabin in order to reach an exit, thus making maximum use of the aisle. Second, the forward exit, a Type I exit, was specifically selected because it was expected to provide for an increased evacuation rate capability over the aft exit, which is a Type II. Thus, the door rate would not mask any effect due to the aisle. Had the aft exit been used, it is not clear that the rate capability of the door is sufficiently higher than that of the aisle to identify effects due to the aisle only. In addition, the aft location of the flight attendant seat meant that passengers had to negotiate the aisle without crew assistance, which is the more critical case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the FAA's observations of the evacuation demonstration, as expressed above, were not intended as an implication that passengers were required to ``zig-zag'' around the seat backs. The passengers proceeded in a straight line along the aisle, but did seem to use the seat backs as hand-holds to a higher degree than is usually seen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the FAA will not require a new evacuation demonstration since the results of the previous demonstration are still valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth commenter opposes the amendment to the special conditions, and reiterated opposition to the original special conditions. The commenter's principal objection is the projected width of the aisle at heights more than 25 inches above the floor. The commenter notes that the special conditions require a 20 inches projected width at 43 inches above the floor, but expresses frustration at not knowing the projected width below that height. The commenter assumes that 43 inches represents the tops of the seat backs. This commenter also interprets the FAA's observations of the evacuation demonstration as indicating that there is a safety problem with the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the projected aisle width, this varies essentially linearly from approximately 16 inches (at a height of 25 inches above the floor) to 20 inches (at a height of 43 inches above the floor). However, since the seat rows are longitudinally offset, there is never any point where the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> transverse  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> measurement between seats is less than 20 inches. As noted in the original final special conditions, the actual seat back height is almost 50 inches. Forty-three inches represents a typical seat back height for airplanes where the seats are mounted at the same level as the main aisle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted previously, an indication of some additional problems should not be inferred from the FAA's observations of the evacuation demonstration. They are simply the factual observations of the demonstrations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conclusion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action affects only certain novel or unusual design features on one model of airplanes. It is not a rule of general applicability, and it affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Amended Special Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the following amended special conditions are issued as part of the type certification basis for the Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes with an offset main cabin aisle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party Deputy Chairman Servet </F> Pellumbi by Timo Luto in Tirana; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Luto] A meeting organized  by the Bulgarian Socialist Party was held in Sofia, in which a  Socialist Party [PS] delegation took part. What was this meeting  about and who were the participants from the Socialist Party?    [Pellumbi] Yes, I think this problem has been largely  politicized by the mass media and has been presented as if a  party meeting was held there between the PS representatives and  representatives from the Serbian party. In fact, this was a  scientific meeting where scholars from 13 countries  participated. Two of our people took part: Luan Shahollari, a  well-known economist, and Vasillaq Kureta, a philosopher and  doctor of sciences who deals precisely with national and ethnic  problems.    In the framework of this seminar, or rather scientific  international meeting, these comrades met with all the  participants of this conference. They met with the Serbian  representatives, but it was not a meeting between the two  parties. Our friends that were sent to Sofia had no status or  mandate to hold party talks with representatives of the Serbian  Socialist Party. That is why this was not a party meeting, but  it was a meeting just like the meeting with all the participants  in this conference, discussing well-known problems that the  Balkans is facing.    As our friends have informed us, they presented to the  Serbian representatives all our options on the national question  and the Kosova issue by upholding the already well-known stances  that the PS maintains but also predicted by other political  forces, which are much or less the same.

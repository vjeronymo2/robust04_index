			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: RWE lifted by turnover growth RWE, Germany's largest energy company, managed to increase net profits by DM1m to DM1.05bn (Dollars 655m) in the year ending June 3 after a 2.6 per cent rise in net sales to DM53.1bn. Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chairman, said the growth in sales was largely due to the inclusion of east German companies, including petrol stations run by DEA, the petroleum products division, in the consolidated accounts. Without them turnover growth would have been restrained to 0.4 per cent. The dividend will remain at DM12. Turnover in RWE's energy division was 0.6 per cent down on the previous year, caused by a cyclical decline of the group's electricity sales volume by 3 per cent, but there was a rise of 4.7 per cent in gas sales. Mr Gieske said increases in labour and personnel costs 'are increasingly creating problems for the energy division'. He said that it was time to consider a change in the price structures for its electricity customers, who, he said, 'were paying 23 per cent less for energy than eight years ago'. RWE had kept electricity prices stable since 1986 and had lowered them by about 5 per cent in 1990, the chairman added. Sales of Rheinbraun, the brown coal division, increased to DM2.32bn from DM1.69bn. But Mr Gieske explained that the turnover of 37.6 per cent included east German fuel trading companies. Otherwise, Rheinbraun's turnover would have increased by 7.4 per cent on the previous year.</p>

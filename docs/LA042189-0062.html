Military authorities said 72 people were arrested and 20 of  those were released. The raids followed the assassination of Atty. Gen. Roberto  Garcia Alvarado, who was killed by a bomb placed atop his vehicle. Military  spokesmen said the military had information linking the groups to leftist  guerrillas, but a union official said the raids were part of "an escalation of  repression by the armed forces and Arena," the rightist party whose candidate  won last month's presidential election.  </P></p>

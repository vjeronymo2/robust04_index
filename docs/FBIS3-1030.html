			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Ayite Gachin Mivedor, chairman for the Rally of  the Togolese People [RPT] electoral campaign, met the media this  morning to shed some light on revelations made yesterday by the  Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]. According to these reports,  Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] lawyer Yaovi Agboyibor  allegedly offered the post of National Assembly speaker to the  presidential group. Let us listen to Mr. Mivedor:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Chairman,  in a clarification note to the media, the UTD disclosed that the  CAR and RPT had allegedly held contacts. Thus, we learned that  after the publication of the results by the Supreme Court, the  CAR proposed the National Assembly speakership to the  presidential group. Can you tell us what actually happened?    [Mivedor] Yes, that is true. The CAR has made us that  proposal, and we thank it for taking such an initiative, but as  far as our group is concerned, we consider that by arrogating  the post of prime minister to itself and allocating the other  posts to other political parties, the CAR has implemented a  policy which reminds us of what is called politicking, and this  takes us many years back into the past. This is why the RPT has  rejected this spontaneous proposal by the CAR concerning the  National Assembly speaker's post. It rather hopes that new  orientations for the political and economic reconstruction of  the country will spring out of discussions among the various  political parties who were involved in the elections. The RPT  calls on everyone for moderation, so that a serene dialogue can  be established among the various political parties. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] Does the RPT have certain demands to make  concerning the formation of the new government?    [Midevor] The RPT is not making any demands. It adhered to  the proposal made by the head of state a long time ago to form a  broad-based union government. As far as the type of democracy  that we know in our African countries is concerned, the RPT is  for a participatory democracy, as opposed to an exclusionary  democracy, that is, you lose and I win. The RPT is for the  joint management of public property, which helps ensure national  unity and the country's development. That is why the RPT is for  a broad-based national union government. [passage omitted] [end  recording]    Concerning the new political situation in the country, the  RPT issued the following statement:    The RPT received from Mr. Agboyibor himself proposals  relating to the distribution of responsibilities within the  future government. The RPT thanks Mr. Agboyibor for his  initiative, but wants all political parties participate in the  negotiations.    [Signed] For the RPT secretary general: Daouko Pere, RPT  deputy general secretary.    For its part, the CAR denies it has proposed the National  Assembly speaker's post to the RPT, contrary to what was said.  However, the party is happy about the fact that in a statement  published on 16 March the CAR and the UTD reaffirmed that they  constitute an absolute majority within the National Assembly and  intend to jointly handle, along with the other democratic  forces, the victory of the Togolese people for the actual advent  of the change so called for by the people.</p>

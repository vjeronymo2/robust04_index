			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA BREAKING THROUGH DIPLOMATIC BARRIERS;  </P> <P> APARTHEID: DE KLERK'S REFORMS TURN THE TIDE FOR ONCE-SHUNNED REGIME.  </P> <P> The scene in President Frederik W. de Klerk's anteroom this week was his  government's dream come true: Heads of state and foreign ministers cooled their  heels for half-hour meetings with South Africa's white leader.  </P> <P> "I'm just flabbergasted by the whole thing," said Alayne Reesberg, a Foreign  Ministry spokeswoman who watched the parade. "We couldn't even process all the  requests to see him. If only he'd grow a twin. We could have used one."  </P> <P> For nearly a half-century, South African officials have been walked out on,  stood up, snubbed, burned in effigy and even assaulted by foreigners at  international forums.  </P> <P> What they have never been is in demand.  </P> <P> But almost every leader attending Namibia's independence festivities this week  wanted to meet De Klerk, who has released black political expression and  scheduled "talks about talks" with the African National Congress, the  government's primary black-nationalist opposition.  </P> <P> In three days, De Klerk met with the presidents or foreign ministers of 19  countries, most of which have no diplomatic ties with Pretoria.  </P> <P> Not since the apartheid system of racial segregation became the law in South  Africa, shortly after World War II, "has there been such a demand from so many  world leaders to see a South African head of state," South African Foreign  Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha said, clearly enjoying the brief diplomatic thaw  occasioned by Namibia's independence.  </P> <P> De Klerk's meetings marked an important turning point for South Africa's  white-minority-led government, which has chafed for years under diplomatic  isolation.  </P> <P> "In the past, people didn't even want to be seen having contact with South  African politicians," said Michael Hough, director of the Institute for  Strategic Studies at the University of Pretoria. "But it's not a disgrace to  talk to them any more. That is an important psychological barrier that's been  crossed."  </P> <P> None of the foreign leaders promised to establish formal links with South  Africa or to end international sanctions, imposed because of the apartheid  system. But there was great interest in De Klerk and his desire to launch  negotiations with the voteless black majority.  </P> <P> "I told them that our aim was a new constitution, which will have the support  of the majority of all South Africans," De Klerk said. "While white domination  should come to an end, care should be taken to avoid a situation where one form  of domination is replaced by another."  </P> <P> However, the recently legalized African National Congress has renewed its call  on foreign powers to sever diplomatic relations with Pretoria. And ANC Deputy  President Nelson R. Mandela criticized Secretary of State James A. Baker III  for traveling to South Africa to see De Klerk this week.  </P> <P> Mandela, who met Baker and many others in Namibia, maintained that such a  high-profile visit by Baker, the first by an American secretary of state in 12  years, would suggest that De Klerk has dismantled key parts of the apartheid  system, which he hasn't. Baker replied that De Klerk needs to be encouraged to  continue reform.  </P> <P> However, most world leaders preferred the neutral ground of Namibia, which  celebrated independence after 75 years of South African colonial rule, to meet  De Klerk. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was among those who  held lengthy talks there.  </P> <P> Some of the more diplomatically significant meetings were those with South  Africa's harshest critics. These included the chairman of the Organization of  African Unity; Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak; the chairman of the Nonaligned  Movement, Janez Drnovsek, of Yugoslavia, and Nigerian President Ibrahim  Babangida.  </P> <P> The willingness to talk to De Klerk indicates that Pretoria's image is slowly  beginning to improve, analysts say. But increasing contact with foreign  governments also invites pressure on South Africa to move faster on reform,  they add.  </P></p>

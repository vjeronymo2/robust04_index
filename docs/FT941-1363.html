			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Observer: Spaghetti spiral False alarm. Earlier speculation that Birmingham, the biggest authority in England, might make a bit of history by appointing a woman as chief executive was wide of the mark. At the end of the day it has done the orthodox thing. Michael Lyons, now chief executive of Nottinghamshire, will be its next chief executive. He knows his way around already. One resting place on his path of upward mobility was none other than the Birmingham City Council. He was a Labour member, but before Labour won control in 1984. The background knowledge could help when the going gets tough, as it no doubt will.</p>

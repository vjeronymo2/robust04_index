			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CHEF WALLY BACK IN THE GAME;  </P> <P> MENU TOUTS OLD FRIENDS AT NEW BISTRO  </P> <P> Chef Ernest Wally finally has opened his own restaurant, Chef Wally's Bistro,  in the Sports Arena-area premises that formerly housed the likable Cafe  Chanticleer.  </P> <P> The menu bills the place as serving "coastal cuisine," a term at once  expressive and vague. But, true to form, Wally has made room for some of his  old friends, including alligator, wild boar and venison. This is reminiscent of  the mid-1980's, when he donned the chef's tall toque at the now-defunct  Judson's in Loma Portal, where rattlesnakes slithered across his appetizer  list, buffalo roamed among the entrees, and lions and bears (no tigers, though)  prowled through the nightly specials.  </P> <P> Every chef dreams of having his own establishment, and, although Wally really  belongs downtown (he also was chef for a time at the Ida Bailey dining room at  the Horton Grand Hotel), he seems intent to do his best -- which can be quite  impressive -- in this shopping center location. To find a menu and wine list of  this scale in a neighborhood place is to find a luxury that San Diego could use  more of. The tone taken by the cooking seems at odds with the rather kitschy  decor that Wally inherited from Cafe Chanticleer, but time doubtless will bring  a more contemporary look to the dining room.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Order Ahead by Fax  </P> <P> The restaurant unquestionably is up-to-date on one rather odd point. Patrons  who wish to fax orders ahead may do so, a service that might become commonplace  over time. The menu suggests an intriguing possibility by encouraging  first-time diners to also fax an identification photo. "We will be able to  recognize you when you arrive," it reads. "That should impress your friends."  </P> <P> Although he has trimmed down to a mere 265 pounds, the still bear-like Wally is  not one to pussyfoot around the kitchen. There is a sophistication and subtlety  to his cooking, but he definitely likes strong, direct flavors. For example, a  potent red bell pepper puree laces the unctuous corn chowder, cayenne heats the  "sambal" rice served with some entrees and poached pear garnishes are spiced --  most exotically and most deliciously -- with cardamom.  </P> <P> Wally's insistence upon definite flavors extends to such details as the small  dish of pesto that arrives with the sourdough bread and makes a good  alternative to butter. This gesture is double-edged, though, because the intent  here is not merely gustatory, but health-conscious; Wally, to a degree, watches  his customers' cholesterol counts for them, and even makes his hollandaise  sauce with egg substitute. It is surprisingly good, by the way, and virtually  indistinguishable from the genuine article based on the lavish use of egg  yolks.  </P> <P> Some dishes twist classic recipes into new shapes, while others seem strictly  Wally's own. The appetizer list, in addition to sampler plates of grilled  alligator, wild boar and venison, offers that old standby, stuffed mushrooms.  These could be said to be new and improved, though, because Wally uses fragrant  shiitake mushrooms, crams them with a sherry-spiked melange of shrimp, scallops  and Dungeness crab, and tops them not with the usual grated cheese, but with  hollandaise -- which is altogether nicer.  </P> <P> Meals include the choice of salad or one of the soups of the day. The soups  recently have included an unusual, creamed seafood gumbo that seemed a cross  between a bisque and a chowder, and a deeply toned French onion. Salads consist  of jumbles of luxury greens, such as radicchio, oak leaf and limestone  lettuces, served with a trio of homemade dressings on the side. The walnut oil  vinaigrette is nicely herbal and the hot bacon dressing is sweet-sour and  richly indulgent, but the red Roquefort seems in flavor rather too close to  bottled, commercial French dressing to be enjoyable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Game, Other Entrees  </P> <P> Game, in larger portions of the dishes mentioned on the appetizer list,  reappears among the entrees, where it gets a good deal of competition from a  long list of fish and shellfish and some very handsomely done meat dishes. The  lamb loin was especially impressive, the meat nicely crusted but also quite  rosy, and the accompanying blackberry sauce based on brown sauce enriched with  only a little fruit puree. The result was savory rather than sweet, which is  exactly as it should have been.  </P> <P> A well-balanced mustard sauce moistened grilled pork tenderloin medallions, and  was creamed just enough to suggest richness; the same remark applies to the  particularly savory porcini mushroom sauce that lapped a mound of tender  sweetbreads. Wally's own hollandaise brought a unifying richness to the house  version of veal Oscar, here called simply veal scaloppine, which teamed  butter-crisped veal slices with lumps of fresh crab meat and tender-crisp  asparagus spears.  </P> <P> A similar dish appears on the fish list, this time announced by name as  swordfish Oscar. To make the preparation a tad unusual, Wally garnishes it with  Peruvian blue potatoes. Rather further afield is grilled swordfish in a  gingered garlic sauce, which sounds quite nice, and grilled sea scallops in a  lovely, pungent cream sauce; these were garnished with cardamom-scented pears,  a clever and beautiful addition to the plate. Both Norwegian salmon and  Hawaiian ahi are served with black peppercorn sauces, which is unusual but well  within the range of the possible, especially with the ahi, which Wally  flash-chars so that it is quite rare in the center. Many people prefer ahi and  other fish done this way, but the result, quite frankly, could only be called  an acquired taste.  </P> <P> At present, desserts are catered from off premises by a well-known baker, but  Wally said that his own pastries will appear on the cart as soon as he is able  to install the proper ovens. In the meantime, his guests can content themselves  with an excellent lemon tart and with sweet memories of an occasionally exotic  but very well-handled cuisine.  </P> <P> CHEF WALLY'S BISTRO  </P> <P> 3916 W. Point Loma Blvd., Suite E  </P> <P> 226-7473  </P> <P> Lunch served Sunday through Friday, dinner nightly.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, with a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $35 to $60.  </P></p>

We  begin the new training period of the Western Army. The Playa  Giron border guard fighter plane brigade [words indistinct] and  to a certain degree the important perfecting process which has  taken place in the defensive structure of the western part of  the country.    As many of you know, during the second semester of 1993, a  group of important units of the Antiaircraft Defense and  Revolutionary Air Force [DAAFAR] and the Revolutionary Navy  located in this territory became part of the Western Army, which  elevated considerably the combat capacity and the  responsibilities of this Army, which defends one of the most  important strategic areas.    This measure, which had been previously taken by the East  and  Central Armies, considerably elevates the operational  independence and the combat capabilities of the main commands of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. It was not for the  purpose of symbolizing that union which motivated the selection  of this site for the ceremony. Rather, it was the results of the  work done by this great unit, which has gathered more than  enough historic and current achievements to host this important  ceremony on behalf of the combat glory [words indistinct] it  joins the long trajectory of heroism in the battle together with  the dedicated work of thousands of men and women.    Almost 31 years ago, on 16 April 1963, in this same spot  Fidel said that we would not have an air force of weaklings or  an air force of wealthy children [burguesitos] but a force of  the people, the best of the people. Today we can say with pride  that the path set by the commander in chief has been carried out  fully. Our pilots as well as the rest of the combatants of the  [words indistinct] have given a solid example of modesty and  maturity with their understanding and support for the drastic  reductions that were necessary in this type of a concentrated  force. This was the same attitude taken by the members of the  Revolutionary Navy where it was necessary to make cutbacks that  correspond with the [words indistinct] in a shared manner by all  our combatants and civil workers.    [Words indistinct] the past 25 December, in summarizing the  good results obtained by this army during its inspection, what  the last three years have been for all the armed forces in this  effort and work. More than ever before, it has been an eloquent  demonstration of the permanent disposition by all the members of  the FAR to confront any task and of the enormous amount of  intelligence that our units have. We have been capable of  fulfilling the difficult challenge that being the armed forces  of a country with a revolution like ours represents, remaining  in harmony with the sacrifices and efforts of our people.    All of you know, that I am not likely to exaggerate  achievements and much less to fall into complacency. But I can  say that what we have seen, together with the officers that have  accompanied us in the recent tours of the three armies, is truly  impressive. Not only have we carried out a gigantic effort to  put the armed forces in shape to successfully confront the  current economic difficulties, and in continuing its refinement  and development under these difficult conditions, but we did it  without affecting the fulfillment of the FAR's missions, which  can be summarized in the five main goals that we established  last year.    In combat readiness, a vital aspect for the Armed Forces,  all  the commands exceeded the results of previous years in the  elevated number of inspections that were carried out. The work  that has been necessary to carry out with the technique is  [words indistinct]. It is enough to mention the millions in  material conserved or reconditioned, ranging from rifles to  airplanes. This task being fundamentally completed, we have  instructed that this experience be employed to preserve the  costly investment made by the country in agricultural machinery,  construction equipment, and equipment of other branches of the  economy, with the goal of continuing their use when we overcome  the special period, a task in which the first steps have already  been taken.    Tens of thousands of professionals, workers, and rank and  file soldiers, have dedicated their talents and energy to  maintain military equipment and weapons in operational, and  perfect, condition. Just a few days ago, during a visit to a  great unit of the DAAFAR of the Eastern Army, I recalled the  ample reference to this effort made by the commander in chief  during the Eighth Forum [of Science and Technology] especially  what he said about the difficulties of maintaining airplanes,  tanks, and the rest of the modern equipment of the armed forces  in operational condition after three years of not receiving  spare parts. He concluded by saying that someday history would  note these heroic deeds. Neither did we forget the tasks of the  military theater of operations during 1993 in which substantial  progress was made, despite the limitation of resources; in the  people's defense tunnels in which the year's goal was exceeded,  as well as in the projects of more technical complexity.    As I have insisted on other occasions, we will continue  advancing in this direction no matter the circumstances and with  the available means. The agroindustrial activity directed  towards self-sufficiency has been a path of permanent priority.  We can already see important results in this area. As we have  said on other occasions, except for sugar and salt, which would  be senseless to produce, we will continue developing the  production of all other foods.    We have already reached high levels of self-sufficiency in  all the agricultural-livestock sectors. For example, the FAR is  already self-sufficient in the production of rice in many units,  as in the case of an artillery regiment of the Eastern Army that  I recently visited that was 72 percent self-sufficient in 1993.  It received 22 percent of its needs from the army. It only  depended on the national economy for the remaining 5 percent.  Like this unit, there are many other examples. We are also  giving great attention to aquatic production, which we will  significantly boost this year because this is an important  source of animal protein [words indistinct].    All the main commands of the FAR have achieved important  results in herbal remedies, which has meant a significant  savings for the country in imported medicines. It has allowed us  to obtain adequate health levels in our units, where herbal  remedies currently make up 70 percent of the medicines that are  used. In a recent visit to the Eastern Naval Base, we were able  to verify that they are producing 104 of the 109 formulas. This  allows them to provide substitutes for 93 percent of the  industrial medicines.    That is not all. Our combatants are making an important  contribution to the country's food program and seeking new ways  to make the defense expenses weigh less each day on the national  budget. We have the firm goal of making the armed forces weigh  as little as possible on the people. In that sense, we are  advancing toward the goal of self-financing. It is a difficult  goal but possible to reach in a reasonable period. That is why,  next year, this goal will be added to the other five we had  already defined as the main goals.    An example of this was the visible progress experienced by  the Youth Labor Army [EJT] whose combatants without abandoning  any of the important [words indistinct] in the Turquino plan,  tobacco production, and many other areas. They have taken on the  responsibility of cultivating 49 percent of state lands  dedicated to miscellaneous crops in Havana Province. They are  working in these farms with only half of the fuel these farms  had before they were taken over by the EJT.    Furthermore, they remain ready to carry out the combat  missions they are assigned. They must maintain their elevated  political and moral state and the satisfactory discipline that  exists in our units under the complex circumstances that the  country is facing.    To achieve these results it does not take an army of  priviledged people, but an Army that is expressly linked to the  population, with whom the combatants share their problems and  difficulties. It is an important example of the FAR's firmness.  Our three main commands are developing a healthy and fraternal  emulation with the population. The Eastern, and Central Armies  have just been challenged by the Western Army, [words  indistinct] apart from all formalism, it has been an important  factor in achieving these results; an essential element of the  defensive power of our country. It is its combatants: the  millions of prepared men and women, who are determined to take  up their weapons.    This preparation will continue to be the center of our work.  In 1994, we will consolidate the system of preparation of  personnel which should allow us to concentrate efforts and  resources in vital matters. We will continue adjusting the  preparation of our officers, sergeants, regular soldiers,  reserves, and the people's militiamen to our current conditions.  We will continue developing the tactical thought on the basis of  harmoniously combining the universal with the autochthonous. We  will continue giving special attention to the living conditions  of all our combatants and civilian workers, especially to the  corps of officers, which carries out a decisive role as a solid  pillar of [words indistinct] made up of men and women with a  high level of professionalism, modesty, and dedication.    Lieutenant Ermis Brooks Chivas recently lost his leg as he  rescued a group of irresponsible people who attempted to abandon  the country through the perimeter that borders the Guantanamo  Base. They entered a minefield. The only demand of this young  man, who is only 22 years old, was that he be allowed to remain  active in the FAR as part of the heroic border brigade. Our  officers are of that type. They are the inheritors of the Mambi  and rebellious traditions. They are children of a people for  whom heroism is an everyday occurrence.    One cannot be amazed that from a people like ours, in the  past year, despite the greatest shortages and difficulties of  the revolution, there was an unprecedented number of new members  in the the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and the Union of Young  Communists [UJC] within the country, including the armed forces.    This confirms, once again, the statement made by our  commander in chief that the current moment is the most difficult  one, but, at the same time, the most glorious of our history.  [applause]    Deeds are demonstrating that time is on our side. To the  same  degree that we resist, solidarity increases as well as the  number of people who, even though they do not totally agree with  our ideas, are convinced that the Cuban revolution is not at the  mercy of the reactionary winds and that its deep popular roots  allow it to confront these winds successfully despite their  strength.    We have difficulties, but we are not at a dead end. We know  very well what our deficiencies are, where our problems lay, and  what we have to do to overcome them. We will continue acting  energetically, analyzing the pros and cons of every decision  without letting ourselves be provoked, but without allowing the  initiative to be taken for us in any field. The enemy must  undoubtedly know that the battle with us is until death. In  Cuba, they cannot dream of mass surrenders or general  desertions. [applause]    As the commander in chief said in his report to the first  congress of the PCC about the rebellious army, the FAR has not  ceased to be the soul of the revolution. To the contrary, we  have the duty of being one of its most solid pillars. To be able  to maintain that position in the ranks we must preserve our  monolithic unity which is based on the ideological firmness and  the absolute [word indistinct], the revolution, and the  commander in chief. With the visible results that you have been  obtaining in all fields, for the solidarity and working spirit  that we have been able to see in the large number of units that  we recently visited we are sure that the combatants of the  Western Army will be the vanguard [words indistinct] for our  people in the great battles that are ahead of us.    On behalf of myself and the commander in chief, I  congratulate you for the good results obtained in 1993 and I  ratify my assurance that in 1994 those results be even greater.  Long live our commander in chief! [Crowd shouts: "Viva!"] Long  live our invincible revolution! [Crowd shouts: "Viva!"]  Socialism or [pauses] [Crowd shouts: "or death"]; fatherland or  death... [pauses] [Crowd shouts: "We will win!"] [applause]</p>

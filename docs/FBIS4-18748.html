			<p>BFN     [Text] We now have the main points of the communique issued  by the restricted cabinet meeting convened this afternoon.    First, there is an appeal to UN Secretary General Butrus  Ghali. On behalf of the government, the prime minister and the  foreign minister reminded the UN secretary general of the urgent  need to reinforce the safety of the Blue Helmets stationed in  Rwanda. Mr. Butrus Ghali made remarks to that effect today.    The government also expressed its concern for the safety of  Belgian nationals living in Rwanda. This terse sentence  follows: The government stresses that it has consequently  decided on measures needed to guarantee the safety of our  nationals. No further details are given. These measures can be  interpreted as the protection of Belgians living in Rwanda and,  most probably, an operation to evacuate them.</p>

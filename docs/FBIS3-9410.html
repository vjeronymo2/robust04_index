			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Jez commentary: "The King Is Naked, Where Is the </F> Happy End?"]    [Text] There is no doubt that the president of the state  [Milan Kucan] "was taught a lesson" at the Monday session of the  prime minister's political coordinating group. He spoke of  illegal structures, quasi-intelligence services,  disqualifications, and physical liquidations in Nova Gorica --  and now the government's leadership publicly tells him that, on  the basis of the verified information, there is no proof for his  claims. Therefore, the president is speaking without any basis,  which in a normal democracy would already be enough to make one  think.    The political coordinating group is a term from the past,  but  one cannot deny the competence of the team that met on Monday.  In addition to the main ministers, the chiefs of both (legal)  intelligence services were also present there, and who could  judge about the state and its security matters more  authoritatively! If this "security leadership" therefore agreed  on all the most important issues, it would be difficult to  object, and even more difficult to say that president's opinion  is more "authoritative." Kucan thus remained isolated with his  claims. This cannot be eased even by the fact that his main  opponent, the defense minister [Janez Jansa], attended the  Monday meeting. It was almost certainly the prime minister  [Janez Drnovsek] who decided about "the outcome" of the meeting  and who approved the final version of the statement.    Knowing Drnovsek well, along with his skill and tact when it  comes to current dilemmas, last Monday could not qualify as one  of Jansa's triumphant days. The prime minister could not  "establish" that illegal secret services are rummaging around  Slovenia and that the country is facing its disintegration; that  is why the wording in the statement appears to be to the liking  of Janez Jansa, but it was not necessarily put on the paper in  this form because of him and his interests.    The fact that the defense minister cannot celebrate victory  does not mean, however, that Kucan did not suffer (at least) a  temporary defeat. In a way this was also confirmed by a letter  that he addressed to the prime minister on the very same day and  in which he allegedly again warned him of some of his meetings  with senior police officers and the SOVA [the Slovene  Information-Security Agency]. It was supposedly precisely these  people who told him about the organized groups that engage  unlawfully in intelligence activities and exceed their  authority, all to the possible detriment of security. Kucan's  letter in itself reflects the highly unfavorable position in  which he has found himself: Not only that he has been saying  things in Nova Gorica that "the security leadership"  subsequently coolly denied, but the senior state officials  misinform him! Perhaps they are even doing this deliberately.  How could one otherwise interpret the fact that they  subsequently attended a meeting with the prime minister at which  they concluded that the activity of which the president spoke  did not take place! Or have they changed sides in the meantime?!    If Kucan wishes to retain authority, it probably will not be  very good for him to tackle such and similar issues in front of  the public tribunal -- although he will, on the other hand, be  forced to explain to this tribunal what he meant by everything  he said in Nova Gorica. In other words, the Monday "ruling" of  the political coordinating group literally stripped the  president naked before the public; he will now find it hard to  explain what sort of clothes he actually has.    The people can merely observe this mysterious political  supergame -- which appears increasingly less likely to have a  happy ending, even if only a tiny one -- with their jaws agape.  The fact is that even after the "qualified ruling" put forward  by Drnovsek's political coordinating group, very few people  believe that nothing worth mentioning is happening in the  country. The prime minister's sense of tact inspires hope that  he will gradually neutralize all those antagonisms that are  escalating matters dangerously through skillful maneuvering;  despite this, the Slovene state has absolutely no guarantees for  the future. If everything regarding Kucan and Jansa is merely a  metaphor for some deeper ongoing thing, for example, the  conquest of strategic economic and political positions in the  future Slovene society, then any possible "disciplining" of the  participating factors can only be short-lived. Either way, the  processes will have to run their course deep down.    The question is, of course, whether the Slovene organism  will  survive these efforts. Are there sufficient economic,  international, psychological, and other resources for this  supergame, which chooses one metaphor today and an entirely  different one tomorrow, to finally run to its end? Nobody any  longer expects a happy ending, but we cannot leave the cinema  either.</p>

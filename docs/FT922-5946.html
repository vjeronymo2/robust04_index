			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Wash &amp; get into a lather in Poland - A hair-raising tale about selling shampoo Procter &amp; Gamble, the large US consumer products manufacturer, is widely credited with inventing the principles of modern marketing. But the company's hard-sell techniques have met their come-uppance in Poland, where its plans to take the shampoo market by storm have whipped up a lather. The cause of all the fuss is P&amp;G's Vidal Sassoon Wash &amp; Go, an all-in-one shampoo and conditioner which is a best-seller in the west. Launched in Poland last August, the product was supported by a marketing blitz on a scale never before seen in the country. At first, the campaign worked brilliantly. Though Poland's most expensive shampoo, Wash &amp; Go quickly became the most popular, capturing more than a third of the market. But earlier this year, sales suddenly plummeted. Then, the rumours began. From street markets to dinner parties, a whispering campaign spread that Wash &amp; Go caused dandruff and hair loss  - allegations which P&amp;G has strenuously denied. 'There have been lots of rumours,' says Barbara Fig, owner of the Palo Palo cosmetics shop in Warsaw, who says she sells little Wash &amp; Go these days. 'Maybe they started because a lot of acid rain fell last year.' The shampoo has also inspired countless local jokes. 'I washed my car with it, and the tyres went bald,' runs one. And when President Lech Walesa proposed earlier this year that he also become prime minister, critics derided the idea as 'a two-in-one solution, just like Wash &amp; Go'. P&amp;G went into overdrive to limit the damage. It hastily commissioned a survey by CBOS, the Polish government's opinion research agency, of public attitudes towards its products and sent the results to shopkeepers and wholesalers late last month. A covering letter from Robert Fregolle Jr, P&amp;G's commercial director in Poland, urged them to continue stocking Wash &amp; Go, stating that it had undergone 150,000 hours of clinical tests and was used by 250m consumers worldwide. Fregolle acknowledged 'negative rumours' about the product and offered money back and a free medical examination to customers who complained that their hair had been damaged. For good measure, he added that P&amp;G's president, John Pepper, had recently visited Lech Walesa to discuss starting production in Poland. The company also ran newspaper advertisements proclaiming that Wash &amp; Go had been approved by Polish health authorities and launched a corporate campaign featuring it alongside other successful P&amp;G products such as Ariel detergent, Tampax sanitary tampons and Pampers nappies. P&amp;G admits that sales of Wash &amp; Go, which it imports from plants in western Europe, fell in the first quarter of this year but says they have now started to recover and expects them to regain last December's peak levels next month. However, several retailers in Warsaw say the shampoo is still moving off their shelves only slowly. Where did P&amp;G go wrong? The most common theory is that it promoted Wash &amp; Go too hard in a country which, for all its enthusiasm for western products, is still unused to brash Madison Avenue-style advertising. A recent poll by Pentor, a private market research company in Warsaw, found that almost three times more Poles disliked P&amp;G's commercials than liked them - one of the poorest ratings for any western company. Polish Wash &amp; Go commercials, based on an international campaign by the Leo Burnett agency of Chicago, have recently been revamped. P&amp;G is by far the biggest television advertiser in Poland and is committed to spending Dollars 10m there on advertising, marketing, distribution and training over three years. To promote Wash &amp; Go, the company also mass-mailed free samples to households and organised a whistle-stop tour of Poland by Vidal Sassoon, the British-born hairdresser. But many experts argue that the marketing barrage backfired because years of Communist Party propaganda have led Polish consumers to suspect that advertising is simply a way to shift products nobody wants to buy. Some also believe that Wash &amp; Go, developed for US consumers who shampoo daily, was too advanced for Polish consumers less obsessed with personal hygiene. P&amp;G has promised an 'education' campaign for customers. Though executives of many other western companies operating in Poland are privately amused by the incident, few are gloating. Says one: 'P&amp;G's problem was that it was the first into the market. All of us will make mistakes - that's the price of doing business here.'</p>

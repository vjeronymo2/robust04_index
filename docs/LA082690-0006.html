			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: 'HOUSE' WARMING  </P> <P> "Russia House" won't be released until the Christmas season, but already the  movie's promotional push is underway, through a campaign for the just-published  paperback edition of John le Carre's best-seller.  </P> <P> Promo and art -- of stars Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer -- can be found  inside the front cover of 2 million Bantam reprints.  </P> <P> The same plug appears in a dozen other newly reissued Le Carre titles from  Bantam. A recent 30-second national TV spot pushed both book and film; ditto  trailers in theaters. When Bantam issues the "movie edition" of "Russia House"  in November, the movie's art will grace the cover.  </P> <P>  When MGM/UA's promotion is in full swing, promises Greg Morrison, marketing  president for producing Pathe Entertainment, "it will be hard to miss us."

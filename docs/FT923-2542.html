			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Observer: Butted around Yorkshire-based Spring Ram Corporation likes to have a bit of a do to mark its results meetings. Last year, for instance, the bathrooms and kitchens group brought 15 carnation-sporting directors to London, to give them a view of City types. This time the mountain is going to Mohammed - or Bradford, at any rate. Bradford is the venue for the announcement of its interim figures, so a 'Spring Ram Train' has been chartered to ferry analysts, fund managers and journalists - animals that companies normally try to keep in separate cages on such occasions. They will be herded round two factories (the group is spending more than Pounds 100m on new plants) and fed in Tong, an upmarket village on the city's outskirts. Whether the junket will improve sentiment is another matter. Having grown rapidly to make Pounds 37.6m pre-tax profit last year, the company has recently sparked an outbreak of doubt among some analysts. In the summer came a downgrading of profit forecasts, from Pounds 45m to Pounds 40m for the full year, and the share price fell sharply. With questions being raised about accounting techniques, some companies might think it time to keep their head down, but thenRam was never noted for its cautious quiescence. Perhaps it is hoping it will be easier to work the old magic on its home turf.</p>

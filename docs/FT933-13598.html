			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Japan faces coalition rule: Liberal Democrats lose overall majority as reformist parties make gains JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party yesterday lost its overall parliamentary majority after almost 40 years in government, ushering in a period of political instability without precedent since the second world war. The LDP will seek to keep a hold on power in a coalition, probably with one of the new conservative parties which made impressive gains at the expense of the socialist opposition in yesterday's snap general election. Party leaders will start bargaining today over the shape of a coalition government, the core of which could be formed either by the LDP or an alliance of opposition parties. Tokyo's stock and foreign exchange markets reacted cautiously to the result. Early today the 225-share Nikkei average was down 205.62 in the first hour of trading at 20,125.91. The yen opened at Dollars 107.9, marginally up on its Friday close of Dollars 107.98. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was last night under pressure from within his own party to resign to take responsibility for the setback and clear the way for talks on a coalition. The uncertainty of coalition government will be a sharp contrast to the stability which has been the hallmark of the LDP's rule since it was formed by a merger of two conservative parties in 1955. The party, working closely with the Japanese business community and powerful bureaucracy, has taken Japan from hunger and homelessness after the war to become one of the world's richest economies. The LDP stayed in power by keeping pace with the social changes unleashed by Japan's economic growth, transforming itself into a modernising catch-all party of the right. The election suggests the mantle of modernisation has passed into new hands. Although the LDP emerged from the elections as overwhelmingly the largest party in the 511-member lower house of the Diet (parliament), the balance of power will be held by recently formed reformist conservative parties: the Japan New party, launched a year ago, its ally the New Harbinger party, and the Japan Renewal party, formed by the 36 lower house LDP members who broke away from the ruling party a month ago. The Japan Renewal party, led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, a former finance minister, did better than expected, winning 55 seats. The Japan New party won 35 seats in its first general election. The NHP, which is expected to merge with the Japan New party, won 13 seats. The LDP, in an impressive display of its electoral durability based on the strength of its local organisation, won 223 seats, broadly maintaining its strength after last month's split in spite of the prolonged recession and recurring political scandals. When the last parliament was dissolved, the LDP had 227 MPs. The main loser was the Social Democratic party, the former Socialists, which prompted the election by lodging a no-confidence motion on June 18. The SDP lost 64 of its 134 seats, mainly in urban areas where independent voters turned to the new parties. Mr Akira Yamagishi, president of Rengo, Japan's largest trade union organisation, confirmed that the SDP's demise may be terminal. 'The SDP will have little impact on Japanese politics in the future,' he said. Komeito, the Clean Government party, increased its standing by six seats to 51, while the other centrist parties maintained or marginally increased their representation. The turnout was a record low of 67.2 per cent, suggesting that many Japanese abstained, the traditional method of voicing dissatisfaction with the LDP, rather than turn to the new parties. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation, called for the formation of a stable LDP coalition, while other business leaders welcomed the rise of the new conservative groups to provide a political alternative. The LDP's main rival for the JNP's hand will be Mr Hata's Renewal Party. An agreement between the two reformist parties could provide the basis for a wider agreement among the opposition camp to oust the LDP and introduce sweeping reforms to the country's corruption riddled political system. Mr Hata urged the new parties to discuss a parliamentary pact on the basis of their underlying agreement on policies.

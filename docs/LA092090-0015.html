			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> PIANIST MICHEL CAMILO SMOKES AT CATALINA  </P> <P> Following Michel Camilo's hourlong opening set at Catalina Bar and Grill in  Hollywood Tuesday evening, it was difficult to tell whether the pianist or the  piano needed a rest more.  </P> <P> From his opening rendition of John Coltrane's "Impressions" to his closing "On  Fire," the Dominican Republic-born Camilo brought his firebrand style of jazz  to exuberant life. One could easily imagine smoke pouring from the piano in  response to the demands Camilo made of it.  </P> <P> Camilo, a pleasant young man with an ingratiating, gap-toothed smile, rarely  relaxed his formidable chops during the six-tune opening set. Even during solo  moments by bassist Michael Bowie and drummer Cliff Almond, the pianist could  not resist the urge to noodle -- his poking at inventive melody, his sudden  blasts of richly voiced chords lending additional urgency and fury to the  proceedings.  </P> <P> Though a certain spontaneity was lost due to the tightly arranged repertoire of  the band, there was no shortage of individual expression within the rigid  formatting of each tune. Bassist Bowie, whose support role was performed  meticulously, had particularly fine outings on Dizzy Gillespie's "Birk's  Works," a bluesy, easygoing tune that had Camilo at his most economical, and on  the leader's own "This Way Out."  </P> <P> Drummer Almond showed himself a masterful technician who managed effortlessly  to support the rhythmic rage of his leader. His solos came in the form of short  bursts of descending rhythm patterns that lent a welcome musicality.  </P> <P> Camilo's talents as a composer are considerable. "Uptown Manhattan," "This Way  Out" and "On Fire," each with a hint of his Latin roots, proved to be pieces  worthy of jazz exploration, their harmonic structures quite capable of  supporting melodic invention.  </P> <P> The only real disappointment of the evening came from Camilo's too few  inclusions of songs that made fewer demands on energy. Though "Uptown  Manhattan" was an easily paced swing tune -- but only after a blast-off intro  -- there were no ballads. Jaco Pastorius' "City of the Angels" came closest,  with its sense of tranquility, but not close enough. Camilo's technique and  musicality are significant and it would have been curious to have heard him  play something a bit more relaxed. A. JAMES LISKA  </P></p>

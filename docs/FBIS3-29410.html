			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime  minister and minister of foreign affairs and international  cooperation, held a working meeting on the morning of 16  February with Vietnamese Foreign Minister His Excellency [H.E.]  Nguyen Manh Cam and his entourage, who are officially visiting  Cambodia. The prince welcomed the Vietnamese foreign minister's  visit to Cambodia, considering it a new step toward reinforcing  the mutual understanding and the relations of friendship between  the two countries.    In his reply, H.E. Ngyuen Manh Cam recalled the traditional  relations between Vietnam and Cambodia as well as the  traditional struggle conducted by the two peoples for their own  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.    He also spoke about Vietnam's past economic, social, and  diplomatic achievements and the country's efforts to promote  fine relations with its neighbors and other countries with a  view to strengthening regional stability.    H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam said Vietnam can never forget  Cambodia's  support and assistance in the 1960's. He thanked His Majesty  King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman for his policy toward the  Vietnamese people's struggle. He was confident that under the  king's leadership, Cambodia would successfully achieve national  reconciliation and peace and have good relations with its  neighbors. He reaffirmed that Vietnam always respects Cambodia's  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and wants  to have harmonious relations and cooperation with the latter for  the sake of the two countries' interests.    Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut promised to present the  invitation for the king to visit Vietnam soon.    In the meeting, the two sides discussed the border issue and  the issue of Vietnamese immigrants and decided to set up two  processes. The first is to establish the border negotiation  framework in order to turn the Cambodian-Vietnamese border into  a border of lasting peace and friendship so as to ensure  security along the border. On this issue, the prince said  discussion over the matter should be based on the Kingdom of  Cambodia's border of the 1960's that was recognized by Vietnam  and certain other countries and in the spirit of the 23 October  1991 Paris accord, which has a clause stipulating that every  agreement concluded before 23 October 1991 and contrary to the  spirit of the Paris accord concerning Cambodia's sovereignty  should be considered null and void. Concerning the second  process for determining the status of Vietnamese immigrants, the  prince said the issue of the immigrants will be examined after  the Cambodian National Assembly has adopted an immigration law  and that it will be resolved according to international law and  practice.    The two sides jointly denounced past violence against the  Vietnamese immigrants. They also discussed the issue of a  Mekong committee and concurred that exploitation of the Mekong  River should be conducted based on unanimous agreement; this is  in the interests of all countries with access to the river.</p>

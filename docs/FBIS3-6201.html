Two Chinese nationals were caught last Dec. 21 trying to  enter Los Angeles with altered South Korean passports, followed  by one in New York and another in Chicago Dec. 29, Foreign  Ministry officials and travel agencies said yesterday.    Cambodians, Thais and Turks have been caught using South  Korean passports in Japan and the United States.    Cambodian nationals turned up with four South Korean  passports Jan. 8 that were stolen separately in Hong Kong, New  York and Seoul, with the latest incidents occurring in Thailand,  Belgium, the Philippines and the United States throughout  January until Feb. 4.    Officials said they believe the passports are being sold on  the black market for $1,500 to $2,000 in places like Bangkok and  Manila.    The concern in Seoul is that due to the rise in illegitimate  passports, foreign immigration officials may decide to step up  security checks and entry procedures for South Korean passport  holders, the officials said.</p>

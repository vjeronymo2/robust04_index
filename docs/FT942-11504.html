			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pleasing some of the people - The retail recovery presents its own problems The tills are ringing again for Britain's high street retailers. But the welcome additions to the companies' coffers, which will this year wipe out the debts of several of the leading groups, have also prompted a debate in retailing circles over how the cash should be spent. While the stores groups are eyeing fresh investment opportunities, a growing band of industry analysts and institutional investors are pressing for more funds to be returned to shareholders. Behind the concerns lie the memories of the free-spending 1980s when the retailers went on a buying spree, gearing up their balance sheets to pay for big investment programmes, some dubious acquisitions and questionable business strategies. 'The record of the stores sector last time around was not a good one, and now they have the opportunity to get the balance - of improved investment and increased dividends - right,' said Mr Charles Nichols, stores analyst at BZW, the investment bank. As the cash has begun to mount, talk of special dividend payments, dividend rises and share buy-backs has begun to circulate in the London stock market; so too has takeover gossip. Great Universal Stores has borne the brunt of the market speculation, mainly because of its Pounds 1.5bn cash pile which many observers believe could be used to mount a share buy-back operation. Some of the sector's other big names are poised to emulate GUS's cash position. BZW predicts that at signalled levels of investment Marks and Spencer's current Pounds 139.5m of debt will transform into Pounds 5.5m of cash this year and balloon to Pounds 482m by 1996. For Boots, BZW forecasts a cash surplus of Pounds 436m that year, compared with present debts of Pounds 209.5m. Other companies which could be included in the list are Sears, Kingfisher, Next and Argos. The reasons for the dramatic increase are several-fold. Many of the companies are in dominant positions in markets that are relatively mature. This has the double benefit of generating cash without the need for large capital investments. They have also emerged from the recession with a clearer retailing focus following the excesses of the 1980s, paring down costs, divesting non-core businesses and improving margins. Mr Nichols, who has recently published research on cash generation by GUS, M&amp;S and Boots, believes that the case for rewarding shareholders is irresistible. 'Given the maturity of the core businesses, the awful history of retail acquisitions and the inappropriateness of adding to balance sheet liquidity, these three businesses should now look to return more cash to shareholders.' Investors might feel they deserve increased income from the general retailing sector. Its dividend yield is currently 30 per cent lower than the yield on the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. This relative yield is near a five-year low, having fallen steadily from a modest premium to the market in 1989. In the meantime, some of the companies concerned are content to pursue their current investment policies. Mr David Keens, finance director at Next, said: 'Of course we will listen to our investors' opinions - but at the moment we see no need to change what has been a successful investment and dividend policy. 'Remember we are in a cyclical business and people have short memories. There will be good times and bad times - we should not worry too much on how to spend our resources.' At Sears, Mr David Defty, finance director, said the group would continue to use its funds for investment - including the Pounds 300m earmarked for the next three years. 'If a new opportunity to invest comes along we'll take it. We are determined to spend to achieve differentiation for all our products so that we become the first choice when the consumer goes shopping.' He added that the company's shareholders would benefit from a progressive dividend policy as profits increased. Both directors raised fears that any company contemplating a share buy back would be judged poorly by investors and competitors in the long run. 'Any thoughts of a special dividend payment or share buy back would be indicative of a moribund management team with no ideas,' said Mr Defty.</p>

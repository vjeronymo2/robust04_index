			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER broke out from its recent very narrow trading range on the LME, but did not attract a significant volume of follow-through interest. However, traders believe it is now likely to support a higher trading range, citing labour talks at two big North American producers, hopes for economic recovery in the US, and a relatively low level of stocks. Traders do not expect a price explosion, but they see a test of Dollars 2,260 a tonne for three-month metal and possibly a look at this year's high of around Dollars 2,275 before the market establishes a new range. Three-month TIN, encouraged by a strong Kuala Lumpur market, initially soared to a 21-month high of Dollars 6,495 a tonne before profit taking emerged. Traders believe the rise will continue on the back of a shrinking world tin surplus, possible support via the options market and constructive charts. The premium for cash ZINC over three-month metal widened further. Traders are concerned about today's June option declarations, with the possibility of further nearby short covering resulting if June Dollars 1,500 options are called. PLATINUM and SILVER moved ahead on the London bullion market on mixed US economic data. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Walkout at Ford after leak of plans to cut 3,000 jobs LEAKED internal documents from Ford Motor Company revealing plans to close most of its general services business yesterday led to a walkout at its Dagenham plant. According to the documents, leaked by unions at the company, Ford intends to contract out most of its general services business in a move affecting 3,000 jobs in its British and German plants by the end of the year, in spite of the risk of industrial conflict. Service workers at Dagenham staged an unofficial 24-hour strike in protest and union officials said they were shocked and horrified at the proposals. The workers involved are employed in the transport of supplies and parts between Ford plants in the UK and continental Europe as well as maintenance work, electrical engineering and office administration. The company employs 1,482 service workers in the UK and as many as 1,317 of them would be affected by the restructuring plan. The company says there will be no compulsory redundancies. Ford confirmed the leaked documents were genuine, and said it was studying how to implement the contracting-out plan, but the outcome could not be prejudged. It added that it was company policy to use outside specialist companies where appropriate. Last year, Ford said it was outsourcing its seat manufacture. Ford said it needed to cut its costs and could not afford to retain in-house services when these could be provided more competitively from outside. In the leaked documents, Ford assesses the strike risks of going ahead with restructuring general services. It believes 'the most serious risks' lie with the truck drivers who supply key components to its production plants. 'A British truck fleet dispute would probably result in the progressive closure of all Ford European manufacturing plants within three days,' the documents say. The company calculates that if it decided to reassign or re-source truck fleet business, it would 'result in a dispute of at least two weeks' duration' because it would mean a loss of earnings and jobs. The documents say Ford believes the unions would be 'unlikely to act swiftly to influence the drivers to end a truck fleet dispute'. Another danger area for disruption would be boiler operations, where a strike could halt production quickly, although Ford believes the personnel concerned 'would be willing to explore re-sourcing and reassignment terms before reacting'. Ford has calculated that it would not be possible to stockpile to protect continental manufacturing plants because of the limited time available. It also believes there would be 'major difficulties' for management in maintaining boiler operations. The documents also suggest the company fears a 'a high risk of significant disruption' across all general services. Union officials are due to meet Ford on March 11 to discuss the company's existing threat of compulsory redundancies in its UK plants. Mazda and Ford end joint venture talks, Page 26</p>

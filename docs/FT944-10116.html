			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Brussels launches 24-hour Eurofraud hotline The fight against European Union fraud is being taken to the masses next week with the launch of a 24-hour free telephone service for people wanting to shop their friends or business contacts over illicit use of Brussels subsidies. People dialling special hotline phone numbers will be answered by a computer in Belgium which asks them in soothing tones whether they want to 'help the (European) commission to fight fraud'. It then leaves space for messages, which the commission hopes will enable officials to follow up leads related to financial irregularities. These are thought to drain between 2 per cent and 10 per cent from the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) annual budget. Informers phoning from Britain dial 0800 963595, after which they are spoken to initially in French and then by a recorded voice talking in English with an Irish lilt. The computer at the headquarters of Uclaf, the EC's anti-fraud squad, has been programmed so it responds in one of eight languages depending on where the person is dialling from. The service will apply to the whole of the EU, except for Greece, which cannot be connected because its telephone lines are too poor. The hotline is being launched ahead of Tuesday's annual report of the Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's main financial watchdog. This is likely to list a range of projects in areas such as agriculture, training and road building where money has gone missing or has been spent inappropriately. Mr Per Brix Knudsen, Uclaf's director, said the phone service would help to expand his 60-strong unit's 'network of knowledge'. But officials have no idea to what degree the EU's 320m citizens will want to use it. As a rough estimate, they reckon 10 people from each country will dial up every day - but this takes no account of how strongly people in different countries feel about fraud, nor of whether garrulous Italians can be relied on to pick up the phone more readily than restrained UK citizens. Uclaf is also slightly worried that the service could become a focus for cranks. 'We are taking the project seriously; we don't want neighbours' gossip,' said an official. To preserve confidentiality, the answering machine will not ask for names or addresses; and if people want to leave them, officials will keep identities secret. The hotline numbers for the other countries are: Belgium, 0800 12426 Denmark, 800 18495 France, 0591 7295 Germany, 0130 820595 Ireland, 1800 553295 Italy, 1678 78495 Luxembourg, 0800 3595 Netherlands, 06022 4595 Portugal, 0505 329595 Spain, 900 99 3295</p>

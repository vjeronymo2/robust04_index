In his letter, al-Shirawi noted appreciation for the  Sultanate of Oman's concern over the current oil market and also  pointed out that he supported the sultanate's views on factors  that have led to the decline of oil prices.    Bahraini Development and Industry Minister Yusuf Bin-Ahmad  al- Shirawi also invited Sa'id Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari to visit  Bahrain to hold consultations on the declining oil prices and  the best ways to assess the course and trends of oil prices in  line with the contents of the final statement issued by the Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] summit held late last month. The GCC  member states had agreed to contribute to efforts to reduce oil  production if all the OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed to an  overall plan to reduce production in a balanced manner.</p>

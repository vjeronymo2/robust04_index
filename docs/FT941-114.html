			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Grand designs, unsure foundations: Thirty years after the military takeover, Brazil faces further problems as a democracy Mr Antonio Delfim Netto, one of the architects of Brazil's economic growth in the 1964-85 period of military rule, is convinced the country is at a turning point. 'If the (leftwing) Workers party wins October's presidential elections, we'll become a westerly offshoot of Africa. If anyone else wins, Brazil will have a solution to its crisis in three to four years,' he says. His belief that there is a chance for Brazil to surmount its economic and political difficulties would be encouraging, were it not for the fact that he made a similar prediction five years ago, ahead of the last presidential election. Much has happened since, including the resignation two years ago of the 1989 victor, Mr Fernando Collor, amid corruption allegations. But the country's main problems - such as an annual inflation rate of about 2,500 per cent, a growing gulf between rich and poor, and crumbling public education and health systems - are still undefeated. Today, the 30th anniversary of the military takeover, there is again optimism that Brazil can confront its crisis. A promising anti-inflation package - including plans for a new currency and public spending cuts - is almost in place. A review is under way of Brazil's cumbersome 1988 constitution, which entrenched many workers' rights and benefits. That could give the next president greater freedom to act when he takes office in January. But Brazil's complicated political make-up and its culture of compromise mean progress on both the economic and political fronts is likely to be slow. Already there are worries the inflation package will be undermined by calls for higher spending in an election year. Cynics maintain that Brazil's 'lost decade' of economic stagnation since 1980 - blamed on two oil shocks and the delay in returning to a democracy - is in danger of becoming a lost decade and a half. Some of the present problems stem from the military's seizure of power in 1964. . The takeover enjoyed widespread support at first from the middle classes and media, which feared Brazil was becoming ungovernable under a populist president, Mr Joao Goulart. But the military's increasing intolerance of political opposition destroyed that support. Moreover the economic 'miracle' of the 1970s, when the country enjoyed some of the fastest growth rates in the world, was undermined by a rise in foreign debt - from less than Dollars 5bn when the military took over to more than Dollars 100bn by 1985. The discrediting of the military regime means today's anniversary will not be marked officially. But while the date may pass peacefully, the period's legacy is turmoil. 'One problem with military rule is you can get left with many hangovers,' according to Mr Luis Eduardo Magalhaes of the right-of-centre Liberal Front party, the second largest in congress. The biggest headache is an underdeveloped party political system. The method of proportional representation for congressional elections has a strong constituency link, meaning that politicians tend to be concerned with local rather than national interests - and open to local corruption. The 20 political parties are constructed around powerful individuals rather than ideology. Building coalitions is therefore difficult, and no president has enjoyed a majority in congress since the return to civilian rule. 'You are forced to govern excessively through compromise, which means problems take too long to be tackled,' according to one minister. October's elections provide scope for change. As well as the presidential race, elections are due for state governors, mayors and congress. A corruption inquiry late last year, which recommended the expulsion of 18 politicians from congress, has raised hopes of improved morality among candidates and voters. In any case, the next president will be in a better position to form a strong government than Mr Itamar Franco, who became president after Mr Collor's resignation and does not have a popular mandate. The two main presidential candidates both promise change, although their programmes differ. Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, leader of the leftwing Workers party (PT) and a former metalworker, is well ahead in the polls, with 30 per cent support. The media depict his party, which campaigns for land reform, social rights and other populist measures, as packed with radicals. But Mr da Silva has moderated his policies, so that he would be able to forge a coalition in congress, and has toned down pledges to stop paying interest on foreign debts or block foreign investment. 'The apparently radical language simply expresses a feeling of protest at Brazil's big problems. But even radicals know you have to keep attracting foreign capital,' says Mr Francisco Weffort, political scientist and PT supporter. Nevertheless, business leaders worry that the PT's policies will involve increased government spending and will do nothing to curb inflation. The other leading presidential candidate - Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso - is a centrist politician who resigned as finance minister yesterday to prepare for the elections. His main achievement in 10 months in office has been the passage through congress of an anti-inflation plan, the centre-piece of which - the new currency, the real - is intended to stabilise prices by being linked to the country's foreign reserves. His plan, the sixth attempt to defeat inflation in eight years, is supported by several leading economists. But Mr Cardoso failed to persuade the International Monetary Fund this month to grant a 'standby' loan as part of a private bank debt restructuring agreement. The IMF thought inflation would fall and stay low only if the government kept its pledges of a balanced budget and tight monetary policy - difficult in an election year. Whoever wins the presidency will inherit an economy that appears to have weathered the inflationary crisis remarkably well. Gross domestic product grew 4.9 per cent last year and is forecast to rise a further 3-4 per cent in 1994. Partly as a result of economic reforms introduced by Mr Collor - such as a privatisation programme and lower trade tariffs - the private sector has increased productivity. Exports rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 38.8bn last year. But these improvements continue to be dwarfed by the effects of inflation and the uncertainty it creates. Investment as a percentage of GDP has stuck at 15-16 per cent since 1990, compared with 27 per cent last year in Chile, the highest rate in the continent. Inflation has exacerbated income differentials - among the worst in the world. In 1990, the poorest half of Brazil's population survived on just 11 per cent of national income. Tackling such problems would take many years for any government. But Brazil faces another obstacle: a constitution which, in effect, forces the country to live beyond its means. It includes generous provisions on social welfare, retirement and pensions. Within a few years, more people are expected to be receiving benefits and pensions than will be contributing to the social security system, unless it is changed. The constitutional review, under way in congress since October, has so far made little progress. Neither government nor congress appears willing to cut benefits before the elections, or push through controversial changes to reduce the role of the state in the economy. 'The review is fundamental for the country to be viable next year, under any government. Unfortunately people don't realise how important it is,' says Mr Magalhaes of the Liberal Front party. A possible explanation for the lack of progress, which threatens Brazil's hopes of rejoining Latin America's economic fast track and of finally controlling inflation, is the emphasis within the political system on compromise. For example, political leaders have worked hard to persuade opponents of the constitutional review to take part, even offering to drop some controversial proposals under consideration. In such a young democracy, this may be a reaction to years of imposed decisions by the military. Mr Fernando de Hollanda Barbosa, a Rio de Janeiro-based economist, says: 'There is something cultural about Brazil. You don't see abrupt changes, instead things go smoothly. That's bad because, if you need change, it doesn't come quickly. But it's good because the country remains stable. Even our military coups were not violent.'</p>

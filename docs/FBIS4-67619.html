			<p>BFN     [Text] Porto Alegre -- Luiz Clovis Belarmino, chairman of  the technical commission of the Fourth Biological Symposium, has  stated that biological plague control -- through the use of a  number of microorganisms, fungi, and bacteria -- in agriculture  as well as in animal and human health has already resulted in an  annual savings of $200 million in agriculture, in addition to  the benefits they bring to the environment.    According to Belarmino, Embrapa [Brazilian Agriculture and  Livestock Research Enterprise] is ready to launch a product  based on a combination of bacteria that attacks caterpillars  feeding on leguminous and citrus plants.    There are 10,000 species of insects that eat, destroy, or  attack in other ways plants and animals that are important for  the survival of mankind. Some species, such as locusts, may  completely destroy some crops.    Belarmino said that the new microorganism was obtained by  crossing two bacteria in the laboratory: the Bacilus  Turingenses- Kurstaki and the Bacilus Turingenses-Aizawa. He  noted that this is among 200 research papers to be submitted to  the Fourth Biological Symposium to be held in Gramado (Rio  Grande do Sul State) from 15 to 20 May, with the attendance of  350 scientists from 50 countries.    The First Symposium on Biological Control in the Southern  Cone and the Fifth Brazilian Meeting on Biological Control of  Plant Diseases will also be held at the same time.    Another new method that is already being applied in Mato  Grosso is the use of a bug feeding on manure to fight horn  flies, one of the main livestock health problems. These bugs  plow in manure and bury part of the horn fly larva underground,  thus gradually rendering them useless. In so doing, these bugs  are preventing the reproduction of horn flies already at the  larva stage.    Belarmino concedes that there are no laws in Brazil  regulating the creation of new living organisms, Embrapa's  research on microorganisms, the crossing of bacteria, and the  separation of genes. He guarantees, however, that every  precautionary measure and biological control procedures  established by the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, by  Ibama [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable  Natural Resources], and by Embrapa itself are followed.    The use of biological agents will make it possible to reduce  by half the use of pesticides in plague control. The main  success remains the use of Bacolovirus Anticarsi in fighting the  soybean plague already in 1.2 hectares [figure as published] in  Brazil -- the largest area in the world under biological  control. This area accounts for 10 percent of the country's  overall soybean plantation and for 40 percent of soybean  plantations in Rio Grande do Sul.</p>

According to a statement reportedly left by Wang Dan, Zhuo  Duo and Min Qi, they have left Beijing "voluntarily" and have  asked the U.S. Government to renew China's most-favored-nation  (MFN) trading status, the sources said.    It was widely rumored that Christopher, who will arrive in  Beijing on Friday evening, would meet Wang.    But Christopher said Thursday in Tokyo that he has no plans  "at the present time" to meet Chinese dissidents during his  visit to China.    Several other dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng, have  reportedly stated that they have left the capital "voluntarily."    No direct confirmation of these reports has been possible.    Police surrounded Wei's house last week and Wang's residence  Thursday.    The dissidents are reportedly under pressure from the  central  authorities to leave town during China's ongoing National  People's Congress (NPC) and the Christopher visit.    Christopher is expected to confront the Chinese leadership  on  human rights issues, including the detention and jailing of  dissidents for peacefully expressing their political views.    On Thursday, Wang issued an open letter calling on deputies  to the NPC to bring the MFN debate, which has been raging  between the U.S. and Chinese governments, on to the congress  agenda.    The U.S. has linked extending China's trade status with  "overall significant progress" in human rights and laid out an  agenda of hoped-for progress.</p>

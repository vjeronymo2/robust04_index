			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: NBA'S STERN TALKS OF WORLD TITLE EVENT  </P> <P> Part of Commissioner David Stern's plan "to make basketball the No. 1 sport in  the world by the year 2000" is to have the NBA's 1992-93 champion participate  in a world club championship before the 1993-94 season. But the rest of the  world may not be a pushover.  </P> <P> Stern spoke in Barcelona, where an Italian club came within a few seconds of  handing the NBA its first loss in international competition Thursday night. The  New York Knicks needed overtime and 34 points from Patrick Ewing to defeat  Italian champion Scavolini Pesaro, 119-115, in the McDonald's Open.  </P> <P> "If we had lost the game . . . it would have been one of our team's and the  NBA's most embarrassing moments," Knick Coach Stu Jackson said.  </P> <P> Although Stern and Boris Stankovic, head of FIBA, the ruling body of  international basketball, did not describe the future event as a true world  championship, the NBA title-holder would compete among as many as 16 of the  world's top national teams.  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Watts Blake Bearne advances to Pounds 3.74m PRE-TAX profits of Watts Blake Bearne, the world's largest supplier of ball clay, rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 3.74m during the first six months of this year. Almost all the improvement was due to higher contributions from new acquisitions, according to Mr John Pike, managing director. The group declared a maintained interim dividend of 2.7p on earnings increased from 11.6p to 12p per share. Turnover was 8.6 per cent higher at Pounds 34.1m. An 11.5 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 4.2m was offset by higher interest charges up from Pounds 264,000 to Pounds 457,000 following last year's purchase of the Didier clay operations in Germany. Almost two-thirds of the group's sales are used for the manufacture of sanitary ware and wall and floor tiles. Its performance therefore is very dependent upon the health of the construction industry. The group was particularly satisfied with a turnround in the US from a Pounds 100,000 loss to a Pounds 250,000 profit. This was due a first-time contribution from its new Texas business as well as more efficient use of management and marketing overheads. In Germany the group had a full six months' contribution from Didier compared with just two months in the corresponding period last year. German profits as a result rose by about Pounds 430,000. UK profits fell by about Pounds 350,000. The group said that it was a measure of the quality of its business that it had managed to maintain profits in such difficult trading conditions. Net debt of Pounds 10.08m was lower than the Pounds 10.27m recorded at the end of last year and represented gearing of just under 17 per cent. The shares closed 23p up at 325p.</p>

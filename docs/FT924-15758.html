			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The October revolution: The privatisation of Russian industry promises to create a society of capitalist shareholders The privatisation of the bulk of Russia's industry, which began officially yesterday, is revolutionary in design. By creating a class of responsible property owners capable of exercising rational economic choices, it seeks to resurrect a bourgeoisie which the now-discarded Soviet regime once sought to consign to the dustbin of history. 'Privatisation on this scale,' said Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, 'is unprecedented in the history of Russia . . . of the world'. Moreover, privatisation - the most visible and important part of the Russian reform programme - is now seen as unstoppable. The parliament, which has often shown itself to be an uncertain and febrile body, has endorsed it. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker and no friend of the government, called it 'effectively irreversible'. That is not to say it is universally popular. The Russian government is so deeply disliked that almost everything it does is greeted with suspicion. On the political level, the roughly one-third of the deputies who maintain communist or nationalist positions are bitterly opposed. One of them, Mr Gennady Savenko, last week threw a fistful of privatisation vouchers in the face of Mr Chubais, shouting 'all property of any worth will end up in the hands of the rich]' This is a widely held view. As Mr Konstantin Ovchinnikov, a government chauffeur, remarked: 'There used to be a communist slogan about the west: it was where 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. That's what privatisation will mean.' This overwhelmingly poor society, which was accustomed to officially promoted egalitarianism, has grown even poorer over the past two years. Now it is being asked to tolerate the rapid expansion of a conspicuously wealthy class. The young officials charged with the privatisation project acknowledge this, but counter it. 'There already was in the socialist times a privileged class  -huge and hidden,' says Mr Maxime Boiko, chief aide to Mr Chubais. 'In a market economy, of course, it becomes open and evident. But I think this country has a large tolerance for inequality.' The privatisation scheme, which officially opened yesterday, is complex. In its first stage, vouchers with a value of Rbs10,000 - giving the bearer the right to buy company shares - are to be distributed to every member of the public through 40,000 branches of savings banks across the country. In a country of 150m people, this means that about Rbs1,500bn in vouchers will be distributed. At the same time, between 5,000 and 7,000 enterprises representing about 70 per cent of Russia's vast productive capacity are completing 'privatisation plans' in close consultation with their workforces. These plans are essentially choices between three main options laid out by the State Committee for Property, headed by Mr Chubais. They are: The assignment of 25 per cent of the shares to the 'work collective' (managers and workers) for free; a further 10 per cent would be available to workers and 5 per cent to managers at 0.7 per cent of the shares' book value, which state auditors assigned to them. Workers would enjoy a further 30 per cent discount on these shares. The offer of 51 per cent of the shares to the collective at 1.7 per cent of their book value. The assignment of 20 per cent of the shares, for free, to those workers and managers who chose to form a group committed to restructuring the company; a further 20 per cent would be sold to all members of the collective at 0.7 per cent of book value. Under each option, the work collective can use both its vouchers and cash to buy the shares, though a limit of 35 per cent of the total has been set on the number of shares which can be bought through vouchers. In addition, at least 10 per cent of the shares must be available to the general public to buy with their vouchers. The general public can sell their vouchers for cash, or use them to buy shares in the privatised companies, which are to be auctioned after December 1. The vouchers must be spent before the end of next year or they will lose their value. They are to be redeemed by the government, while the cash spent on the purchase of shares by the public will go to local and regional authorities. No one is certain how many citizens will opt to sell their vouchers. Even before yesterday's distribution, a secondary market had begun in which people, especially the elderly, had pre-sold their vouchers, reportedly for around their face value or slightly above. Mr Chubais believes, on the basis of his own polls, that only some 30 to 40 per cent of the population will sell their vouchers. Other estimates made by opposition deputies claim that 80 per cent will do so. For those who hold on to their shares, and who are not members of companies to be privatised - such as state school teachers, municipal workers and others - the 200 or so mutual funds already set up are likely to be attractive. In theory foreigners are for the most part as free as Russians to take part in this 'sale of the century'. They are restricted from investing in some defence and energy enterprises, and they have been excluded - except by special permission - from the privatisation of shops and small businesses which is already under way. But in practice, it seems likely that most foreigners will stay out of the Russian market until ownership and control patterns have emerged over the next year or two - the estimated time it will take fully to privatise the large companies. The legal structure is still raw and incomplete; the enterprises are little known; and their managements are not yet familiar with the demands of a market economy. Mr Chubais pointed out that some foreign companies have concluded some 'very interesting' deals under which they would assist the work collectives in buying shares in exchange for a part of the share capital. Despite this, privatisation is unlikely to prove a quick bonanza for foreign capitalists, as the communists and nationalists claim. But will privatisation bring about the dynamics of a genuine market economy, as the government intends? Or will the exercise merely result in companies nominally owned by their workers and managers, but continuing to demand state protection and cheap credits, and threatening production strikes if they do not get them? Such tendencies are evident in many private enterprises which already exist. Indeed, the entire process clearly means different things to different people. To many, privatisation has already happened. On most calculations, more than 20 per cent of the Russian workforce is employed in the 'private' sector - in about 200,000 co-operatives created as private enterprises, in former state shops which already have been taken private, and in foreign companies and joint ventures. In addition, there are many larger companies which have recently been taken over by their workers and managers. Some have done so through a now-repealed Soviet law, while others have been taken over illegally, with management agreeing with their workers to create a company owned 100 per cent by themselves, and bribing local bureaucrats to register it. This process, known as 'wild' or nomenklatura privatisation, has given rise to a sector known as closed joint stock companies. In these, shares are not traded. Management usually exercises de facto control, and in many cases is now buying back shares issued to workers in exchange for roubles, hard currency or imported goods. This practice has largely gone unpunished and is likely to irritate those companies now being told to privatise according to the rules. Privatisation may mean quite another thing within the larger, state-controlled sector, in which managers and workers constitute a potentially conservative (and largely united) class. Despite the progressive collapse of effective state control over companies the government formally owns, they generally have not adopted market-oriented pricing, investment or marketing strategies. Instead, they have kept prices and wages as high as possible while demanding government support or cheap credit from commercial banks to keep them going - so far successfully. Meanwhile, the lack of bankruptcy legislation (which is expected to be enacted later this month) has meant that none of these enterprises could legally go out of business. This resistance is wholly natural. The intended consequence of privatisation is to separate the winners from the losers; that is, to produce industries which can eventually compete on an international level. This - coupled with the more restrictive monetary policy the government says it is determined to adopt - will certainly mean the end for many companies, and unemployment for their workers. There is a vast amount at stake. For this reason, the industrialists' lobby - represented most notably by Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president - is actually a much tougher opponent to the government than the noisier critics on the far left and right. In a recent interview in Rabochaya Tribuna, a daily newspaper, Mr Volsky said the privatisation programme was 'too strict', and called for the legal right of the collectives to buy all their own shares and form the kind of closed joint stock companies created by the so-called 'wild' privatisations. Ultimately, since Russia is at least partly democratic, the people should decide. But they appear confused. This is no surprise since they are being asked to grapple with strange concepts and unfamiliar choices, and the post-Soviet bureaucracy is not making the job any easier. For most Muscovites, the only official notice of yesterday's voucher scheme was a typewritten memo posted in the ill-lit halls of their apartment blocks. The government is planning an information drive including media advertising, packages explaining the options to companies and even a privatisation game show on TV. But it is grossly overstretched, despite resources for the programme supplied by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, with assistance from the World Bank and the EC. 'This is the start of capitalist education in this country,' said Mr Chubais on the eve of the campaign. It will be a long, hard lesson.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RUSSIAN PRIVATISATION: A POLICY FOR THE PEOPLE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Russian industrial                 Number of      Average number structure                          companies        of employees  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Electrical energy                    982                407 Fuel energy                          352              2,080 Ferrous metallurgy                   205              4,093 Non-ferrous metallurgy               174              2,971 Chem/Petrochemicals                  561              2,173 Engineering                        5,306              1,568 Wood processing                    3,885                465 Construction materials             2,161                480 Glass &amp; ceramics                     164                963 Light industries                   4,034                617 Food industries                    5,480                253 Other                              1,936                940 Total                             25,240                821  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Goskomstat, 1987  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Three options: 1.

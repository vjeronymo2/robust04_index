			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Travel: Palm Springs - a world-class rest-stop CALIFORNIA'S desert areas were pooh-poohed initially. In a report on the first serious reconnaissance of the desert, Lieutenant Joseph C Ives, of the US Topographical Engineers, wrote: 'The region . . . is, of course, altogether valueless. After entering it there is nothing to do but leave. Ours had been the first, and will doubtless be the last, party of whites to visit this profitless locality.' I do not know what happened to Lt Ives, but if he drove through the desert now and stopped at Palm Springs his eyes would pop out. Ask an American what Palm Springs stands for and he will reply: golf, tennis, palm trees, money, movie stars. Ask the town's tourism office what it stands for and it will flourish the happy phrase: 'Xanadu incarnate.' Ask me what Palm Springs stands for and I will tell you of floating in one of its swimming pools (it has 7,000) and ruminating pleasantly on the hundreds of activities available in and around Palm Springs that I was gently boycotting while idling and vegging out. Palm Springs is on the western edge of the Coachella valley - 107 miles (2 1/2 hours on the freeway) south-east of Los Angeles, within the area known as the Colorado desert. The San Jacinto mountains are to the west, the Santa Rosa mountains to the south. It is 487ft above sea-level. To the east lie the other manicured resort-cities of the Coachella valley: Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells, Bermuda Dunes, La Quinta, Thousand Palms and Indio. Palm Springs' year-round population is only 40,000 (surprisingly, property is not expensive). And its climate - its original claim to fame, along with its abundant water - is superb: an audited 354 days of sunshine per year and less than 5 1/2 in of rain, with winter daytime temperatures in the 70`F's (20`C) and summer-month levels (over 100`F) tempered by low humidity. The May-August high is regarded as 105`F, the low as 67`F. High season is January-April: 77`F-45`F. To indicate the numberless activities available in and around Palm Springs, I could do worse than quote what Carolyn Patten, of Palm Springs Tourism, suggests for a seven-day programme: Day 1: Stroll down Palm Canyon Drive, the city's main avenue, and note the shops, galleries, cafes and restaurants. Return to your hotel, pick up a good sunscreen, bask in the desert sun and try to find some pity for the friends you left back home. Day 2: A drive-past tour of the homes of famous residents, including the estates of Frank Sinatra, Gerald Ford, Walter Annenberg, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Lord Hanson and other golden oldies, as well as Palm Springs' celebrity country clubs. And visit The Living Desert, a 1,200-acre wildlife centre, for a close look at bighorn sheep, the desert kit fox and other birds and animals. Day 3: Take the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway for a 2 1/2 -mile, 15-minute cable car ride to the 8,500-ft peak of Mt San Jacinto, from where you can see for 50 miles. And visit the Desert Museum (Western art, natural history dioramas illustrating the history of the local Cahuilla tribe of Mission Indians, and two sculpture gardens). Members of the Agua Caliente band of Cahuilla Indians are among the largest of Palm Springs' present-day landowners. Day 4: Try the Oasis Water Resort, a 21-acre waterpark, and take a safari ride into the foothills of the Santa Rosa mountains. For a night on the town there are piano bars, 1940s-style nightclubs (nostalgia is big in Palm Springs), comedy, jazz, discos and 'authentic' country &amp; western. Day 5: Anything you like: golf, tennis, cycling, horseback riding, pool-lounging, desert hiking. Or take a covered wagon tour through the Coachella Valley Preserve (13,000 acres: springs, dunes, bluffs, mesas, the Thousand Palms Oasis and plenty of wildlife, some of it rare). Day 6: Visit Indian Canyons for fan palms, waterfalls and wildflowers. And ride a hot-air balloon over the date groves and lazy horse country of the eastern Coachella valley. This year, an extra-wet winter has produced one of the best wildflower seasons in the Palm Springs area in more than a decade. Day 7: More of whatever you like. Sounds ever so slightly tedious? Aggressively non-cultural? The bland leading the bland? If so, then it is worth emphasising three things about Palm Springs that justify describing it as one of the northern hemisphere's best winter-sun holiday spots: it is surprisingly quiet and peaceful; its climate is superb, and it serves as a first-rate hub or springboard for various trips. Thanks to considerable care and effort, Palm Springs retains the small-town charm and peaceableness of its early days, when movie stars (plus Albert Einstein) would head there from Los Angeles to holiday at the El Mirador hotel. Today, you might spot Sylvester Stallone or Kirk Douglas, Don Johnson or Kim Basinger. But the important thing to know is that in Palm Springs these movie stars do not molest you. They do not pester you for your autograph or mob you in the supermarket. They respect your right to privacy. Because of its desert climate, Palm Springs is a healthy place to be. In Our Araby, an account of Palm Springs' pioneer days, J Smeaton Chase tells of heading for Palm Springs one morning in April, circa 1915. He was with three friends. Two were driving a camp-wagon, the other two were on horseback. They had come from the coast. Crossing the mountains, at 2,000ft, they gazed at the valley floor. 'The effect was highly theatrical', wrote Chase. 'Below and far ahead, at the foot of the hollow scoop of the pass, lay a pale golden land, shimmering in sunlight under a sky of summery blue. It was like magic, or a dream . . .' As they descended, they were lashed by a hail-storm, alternately thrashed by chilly rain and pelted with hailstones. But suddenly they emerged into glorious warmth. By early afternoon they had reached Palm Springs. 'That night we stretched out luxuriantly under the flowering grevilleas of the Brooks House, bathed in moonbeams and odour of orange-blossom, lulled by the soft clatter of palm-fronds and an occasional somnambulistic outbreak from the night-herons roosting in the cottonwoods near the spring.' Using Palm Springs as a base, today's visitors can easily drive south to the Mexican border (not greatly recommended: you will see more poverty and desperation than you may have bargained for); west to the beaches (Malibu, Santa Monica, Huntington, Newport, Laguna) or Disneyland; north to Death Valley, or east to Joshua Tree National Monument, a national park of startling beauty that covers 870 square miles, more than 90 per cent of which is classified wilderness. The park almost evenly straddles California's two deserts - the Mojave, a high desert, and the Colorado, a low one - and is named for the shaggy-limbed, spiny-leaved Joshua tree, in reality a tree-sized yucca, that can live for hundreds of years. A group of Mormons, passing through the area, saw, in the plant's upreaching limbs, an image of the prophet Joshua praying and guiding them westward towards a promised land - hence 'praying plant' or Joshua tree. The largest Joshua tree in the park, at upper Covington Flat, is said to have forked more than 100 times in its 1,000-year lifetime. It is 36ft tall, 14ft in circumference and is said to resemble a giant head of broccoli. I did not, in fact, see it, largely because my own hire-car-safaris did not stretch as far as Covington Flat. I hate organised walks or hikes. Abhor group jollity. Am not a team-player. Prefer my own company. So I get into my hire car, drive a few miles, stop and get out, walk for 15 minutes in a circle, puff a cigarette, gaze soulfully at the horizon, check to see if it is raining or if there are mountain lions massing, or a posse of Mexican bears, or a column of desert tortoises, kill my cigarette carefully, glance at my map, re-start the car, drive a few miles, stop and get out . . . until I am bone-weary. It was because of the strenuousness of these safaris that I spent much of my time in Palm Springs idling and vegging out. Michael Thompson-Noel flew to Los Angeles with British Airways, which has two flights every day, Heathrow-LA, non-stop. Apex fares start at Pounds 324 return.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- A government advisory panel  is set to propose full-fledged tax reform, featuring a tacit  call for 6.2 trillion yen in permanent tax cuts and an  offsetting sales tax hike from the current 3 percent to above 6  percent.    Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a news  conference that panel members "were convinced" of the need for  tax reform in line with materials prepared at a meeting Friday  [3 June] for regional hearings next week.    They included notes from discussions so far, social welfare  measures prepared by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, fiscal  2000 revenue estimates and problems of the current income and  consumption tax systems by the Finance Ministry.    The materials call for tax reform that results in net tax  revenue increases after cuts and adjustments, and Finance  Ministry estimates that would satisfy this goal would require  hiking the consumption tax to between 7 percent and 10 percent.    The ministry estimates are based on a three-year time lag  between the 6.2 trillion yen tax cuts and the sales tax hike,  and also on a 10-20 year maturity of stopgap bonds for financing  the advance tax cuts.    As for cutting income and resident's taxes, the panel is  expected to call for lessening tax burdens in the 7-10 million  yen annual income bracket, according to the materials.    Uncertainty remains whether the advisory panel to the prime  minister will include concrete figures in its report to be  compiled soon after the regional hearings.    Indeed, forum sources said the panel is inclined to exclude  figures to avoid unnecessary political disputes, especially for  the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is sensitive about  raising the consumption tax.    The SDP split off from the ruling coalition amid disputes  over cabinet formation by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, thus  leaving the coalition with a minority rule.    Kato has said the report will include various alternatives  for the ruling parties to decide on tax reform led by permanent  tax cuts by the end of June, as Japan promised in the March  market-opening package.    But even if the panel leaves the report vague, its  implications will be quite obvious since the ministry's revenue  estimates are also submitted to the ruling parties.    Meanwhile, Kato indicated earlier that the panel may call  for  a phased consumption tax hike -- initially raising it only to 6  percent.    Considering administrative and fiscal overhauls, the panel  is  expected to call for government leadership to win public support  for the planned tax reform that will ask for heavier tax burdens.    The panel chairman said he trusts Hata, who indicated his  "strong determination" to promote administrative reforms when  Kato visited the prime minister on Wednesday.    On the regional consumption tax, the report is to call for  further discussions, the sources said.    Kato said the consensus is that local governments should  have  their own tax revenue sources but the panel is still undecided  on the method, with various "clerical and technical problems"  seen in adopting a regional consumption tax.    But he suggested in his earlier press remarks that the panel  may encourage the ruling parties to decide on a regional tax,  saying, "there are some political ways (to go about it)."</p>

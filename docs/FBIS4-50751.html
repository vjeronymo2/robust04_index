			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, a top Chinese  leader, this week suggested that surplus rural labor should be  organized to build roads and water conservancy facilities.    He made the suggestion while on tour of the north China port  city of Tianjin from May 15-18. Qiao, chairman of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress, visited a number of  factories, a duck farm and a TV transmission tower in Tianjin.    During his tour he said that the expansion of township-run  enterprises and the construction of small cities will change the  face of China's countryside and absorb surplus labor effectively  as well.    He told local officials that as long as Tianjin tries to  deepen reforms and open wider to the rest of the world, it will  certainly achieve greater development and promote opening up and  economic growth in the whole of north China.    Qiao, who is also a standing committee member of the  Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee, praised the Tianjin municipal leaders for paying  close attention to intensifying enterprise restructuring.    The invigoration of major state-owned enterprise makes it  imperative to guide them in orienting themselves with the market  and improve their economic returns, he noted.    These enterprises should be encouraged to import  sophisticated technology and managerial expertise so as to  improve their production processes, the quality of their  products and their management, he said.    Moreover, it is necessary to promote vocational training in  various forms among workers, and relieve enterprises' financial  burdens by introducing a social security system in order to  create a good environment for these enterprises to develop, he  added.</p>

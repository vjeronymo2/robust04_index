			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FREE DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE FOR ASIANS GOES INTO SERVICE  </P> <P> A free telephone directory assistance for Asians began full-scale operation  Tuesday in Southern California.  </P> <P> Sponsored by Asian-owned companies, the service -- called the 777-CLUB -- is  expected to attract 2,000 calls each month, said Marty Shih, president of the  club.  </P> <P> Callers seeking business, community group or government services numbers can  receive information in Chinese -- Cantonese and Mandarin, and, by the end of  the year, Korean and Japanese should be added, Shih said. Residential numbers  are not available.  </P> <P> Callers also can get more than just phone numbers. "If people with a language  barrier or translation problem have an emergency, they can call us and we'll do  the translating," said Shih, who gave the example of someone being robbed.  </P> <P> The service was developed by Los Angeles-based Asian Business Connection, a  long-distance carrier that also offers a credit card network, travel services  and a telephone network shopping service. Its partners in the 411-type service  include the Chinese Daily News, which is doing the marketing, and the Chinese  Yellow Pages, which will provide updated directory information for 10 years,  Shih said.  </P> <P> The service has been tested since April, and so far response has been strong,  attracting 400 calls a day, Shih said. The service, which is available  nationwide by calling 1-800-777-CLUB, is expected to draw about 2,000 calls per  day now that it is in full service, he said.  </P> <P> With the added calls, Shih estimated the cost of operating the directory line  at $42,000 each month. That will be paid by Asian Business Connection as an  advertising expense, he said. "It's a win-win situation," Shih said.  "Hopefully, people will use the . . . line, then think about us when they order  airline tickets."  </P> <P> While callers from anywhere can use the service, the data base lists numbers  from Los Angeles to San Francisco, as well as Houston, Dallas, Chicago, New  York and Boston.  </P> <P> "We can manually check numbers in other cities," Shih said. "But people will  have to be patient -- we don't have everything yet, so we don't guarantee."  </P></p>

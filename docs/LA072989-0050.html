			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INS WORKS ON SPRUCING UP PUBLIC IMAGE  </P> <P> Ofelia Morales had arrived early in the morning at the Immigration and  Naturalization Service office in Los Angeles to inquire about getting her  parents admitted into this country from Costa Rica.  </P> <P> "They make you wait and wait and wait," she complained later in the day when  she still had not been helped.  </P> <P> "Home of the brave and land of the free? Ha! . . . Land of the forever  patient," she scoffed.  </P> <P> Described by some critics as the most discourteous arm of the federal  government, INS officials have decided to try to spruce up their tarnished  image under the slogan "How are we doing?"  </P> <P> Beginning as early as next week, visitors to any INS office in Southern  California and the rest of the agency's Western region will be encouraged to  fill out forms evaluating immigration personnel and the information they  received, officials said.  </P> <P> And if the need arises, visitors are free to file complaints alleging rudeness,  unnecessary delays in getting assistance or other problems. These complaints  will be thoroughly investigated, officials promised.  </P> <P> At the same time, INS district offices in the region -- which includes  California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam -- will be assigned community  relations staffers to conduct outreach programs and work with local ethnic  groups.  </P> <P> At first glance, the initiatives ordered by Robert M. Moschorak, who was  recently named to temporarily replace Harold Ezell as INS Western regional  commissioner, seem simple enough. Most federal agencies have public evaluation  questionnaires and conduct outreach programs to publicize their efforts.  </P> <P> But for the INS, which enforces the nation's emotionally tinged immigration  laws, such efforts have been largely overlooked.  </P> <P> While INS officials for years pushed for more Border Patrol officers to fight  illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, few resources were sought for  the agency's front counters, where overworked staffers sought to deal with the  deluge of routine requests, ranging from replacing a lost "green card" to how  to bring a naturalized U.S. citizen's parents into the country.  </P> <P> In some INS offices, critics contend, visitors routinely waited two and three  days for information that could have been obtained in less than 10 minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 'Black Hole'  </P> <P> At the INS' large public-assistance office at the downtown Los Angeles Federal  Building -- dubbed the "black hole" by some critics -- so many complaints were  received that the INS in 1986 instituted an appointment system to handle the  hundreds of people who jammed Room 1001, the INS' public-assistance office,  each day. The program met with some success but resources were eventually  siphoned off when personnel were reallocated to handle amnesty applications.  </P> <P> Moschorak, aware of the bitter criticism, is determined to improve the agency's  standing with the general public.  </P> <P> "I think this program is absolutely necessary," said Moschorak, an INS veteran  of nearly 25 years. "That image of ours has to be cleaned up."  </P> <P> Moschorak said courteous personnel can help reverse the bad image INS has with  the general public, especially with Latinos. INS officials are fond of pointing  out that despite the reservations many immigrants have about the agency, nearly  60% of the 3 million aliens who came out of the shadows and applied for amnesty  were from the INS' Western region.  </P> <P> He added that the evaluations could help influence pay raises and career  advancements for INS office workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Efforts  </P> <P> The critiquing was one of four special areas of emphasis recently announced by  Moschorak. In addition to assigning community relations specialists, he also  ordered sustained efforts to apprehend and deport criminal aliens and to  complete Phase II of the amnesty program.  </P> <P> Success for these initiatives may also enhance Moschorak's chances of  permanently succeeding Ezell, his former boss. At a recent gathering, Moschorak  was surprised by 200 INS staffers who sported "Commissioner Bob Fan Club"  badges. "I won't soon forget the feeling in that room," he said.  </P> <P> Justice Department officials have called Ben Davidian, chairman of the  California Agricultural Labor Relations Board, the leading candidate to succeed  Ezell.  </P> <P> While Moschorak was optimistic about the public-critique program, visitors to  Room 1001 late Wednesday were roundly derisive about it.  </P> <P> "These people don't care about us," said Felipe Soto, a Mexican immigrant who  was there seeking to replace a stolen legal residency card. "I don't even want  to tell you what they told me . . . jerks."  </P></p>

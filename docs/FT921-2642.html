			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92 (Ballot Box): Rest in peace Transcendental meditation will not be compulsory should Britain's newest political grouping, the Natural Law party, secure election. Training, however, will be available to all seeking to unleash their true potential. The party, launched on Saturday, supports the Transcendental Meditation movement, founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, erstwhile adviser to the Beatles. All members are planning to register as candidates in the election, and the party hopes to field a total of 651 covering every constituency. So far the party has spent Pounds 500,000 on press advertising. The manifesto is due to appear in newspapers on Friday.</p>

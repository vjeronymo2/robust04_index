			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Rail strike is set for tomorrow as signalmen reject offer Britain's railway signalmen are set to strike for 24 hours from midnight tonight, in a move which threatens to paralyse the railway network. Talks between the RMT rail union and Railtrack, the company administering the network, broke up yesterday after half an hour when the union negotiators walked out. The 4,600 signalmen had been offered a pay rise of 2.5 per cent, plus a package of measures to be negotiated, involving job evaluation, a new salary structure and the introduction of flexible working arrangements. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's union's general secretary, said that Railtrack's behaviour had been 'absolutely reprehensible'. 'I have never known anything like it in my 30 years of experience in the rail industry,' he added. 'The Railtrack board has destroyed what integrity there was in the negotiating procedures, which are now in tatters. We have no faith in them.' Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack's chairman, said that he hoped that 'the union will recognise the only realistic way forward is to sit down and start talking'. 'Railtrack is a new company. Our most important commercial relationship is that with our customers. That is why it is vital that we make the changes necessary to deliver to them the level of service they require.' The signalmen are demanding an 11 per cent interim pay rise as the condition for entering talks on pay restructuring. They voted decisively earlier this month to support industrial action over their pay grievances, which have rumbled on for seven years. They say pay relativities had been severely eroded while they had co-operated with the introduction of new technology and a cut of nearly a third in their numbers since 1980. The strike is expected to shut down the entire rail network, but London Underground services will not be affected. There may also be delays on Thursday as many trains will be out of position. A further 24-hour stoppage has been set for June 22.</p>

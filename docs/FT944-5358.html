			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Travel: Bowls of yak stew on the lost horizon - Anything seemed possible when Mark Hodson decided to walk to the Chinese border from northern Pakistan When the radiator hose blew, we abandoned the car and started to walk to the Chinese border. Beside the road, sheer granite cliffs rose to a cloudless sky. On the other side of the gorge were vast scree slopes and, beyond those, jagged, snow-capped peaks. We took giant strides, sucking in the sharp mountain air. It felt good to stretch our legs after driving for two long days up the Karakoram Highway into the remote highlands of northern Pakistan. Below, the River Indus roared. On the facing bank, high above the water line, a rough track had been partly obliterated by rock falls: the original Silk Road. 'How far is it to China?' I asked my guide Mr Altaf. 'About 150 miles,' he replied. A brightly-painted transit van thundered past, a dozen men clinging to the roof and rear door. 'Think we'll make it?' I asked. 'No problem,' he smiled. We would not have been the first. Long before the Highway was laid in the 1960s and 1970s, opening the region to trucks and tour buses, Chinese pilgrims came this way to visit Buddhist sites in the Lower Indus Valley. The journey, by foot, would have taken months, even years. That morning at Chilas, we had seen rock carvings made by pilgrims 1,800 years earlier. Chilas is in wild country. The people there are strict Sunni Moslems who have been fighting bloody family feuds for more than 500 years. Some have forgotten the original cause of the disputes, yet still they live in houses without windows in case an enemy creeps up at night to shoot them in their sleep. The Chilasis kill at the slightest provocation, and government troops had to move in a few years back when local tribesmen bumped off some Chinese road workers merely for eating lunch during Ramadan. As we drove past, the men glared with cold, dark eyes and tucked their bushy beards into upturned collars. Their faces were not unlike the terrain: rugged, hard, unforgiving. Changing tack, I smiled and waved at the next group and each saluted me with a broad grin. In summer, when the snow melts on the peaks of the Karakorams, the water level of the Indus rises by as much as 40ft. In winter, it falls to reveal banks of fine, white sand that is scattered by the wind to form perfect rippled dunes beside the road and even up the sides of hills. The effect is startling, like a desert at 4,000ft. Fertile plateaus along the valley were embroidered with fields of wheat and corn. Shepherds kept goats and cattle and criss-crossed the river on shaky suspension bridges. We passed hot sulphur springs and a bleak village called Gunar Farm where men stood around in thick jackets and flat woollen caps as if waiting for something to happen. On the edge of town was a police garrison built like a fortress and, on the main street, a bright red pillar box. The skyline was dominated by Nanga Parbat. It is 26,660ft, the ninth highest peak in the world and is getting bigger. It is rising by a  1/4 in a year because of the confluence of the Earth's plates. Climbers call it Killer Mountain and at least 62 have died on its slopes. Four great mountain ranges  -the Himalayas, Karakoram, Hindu Kush and Pamir  - converge in Pakistan to form a formidable pile of statistics: the world's second highest mountain (K2), the longest glaciers outside the polar regions, the most peaks above 25,00ft and so on. I might venture one more: most spectacular scenery visible from the back seat of a Honda Civic. By midday, we reached the regional capital, Gilgit, a den of smugglers, gem dealers and shoe salesmen. The bazaar crackled with the sounds of Tajiks, Ismailis, Pathans and Kashmiris haggling over Afghan cigarettes, secondhand jackets and Chinese digital watches. Anything seemed possible there, including a Mk1 Ford Cortina with furry steering wheel and curtains in the back window. A crowd jostled around a medicine man from Peshawar who waved his arms and promised herbal remedies for every disease. Eyes glanced up as a Chinese woman, conspicuous without a veil, sauntered past in a black trouser suit and slippers. Local tensions between Sunni and Shia Moslems sometimes explode on to the streets of Gilgit and the town was crawling with police and soldiers. It was not a place to hang around unless you had a room at the Aga Khan's opulent Serena Hotel. After a stodgy lunch at the Tajikistan Inn, we followed the Karakoram Highway into the Hunza Valley, which was where the car broke down and we started to walk. After two or three miles we stopped at a break in a dry stone wall and beyond it saw a garden of Eden. Beneath apricot trees and mulberry bushes lay a terraced lawn so perfectly trimmed that you could have played croquet. There were willows and walnuts, a single apple tree and a young woman washing clothes under a waterfall. The village was called Rahimabad, just a dot on the map with a headcount in the hundreds, yet it was worth a thousand dusty cities. Marigolds and weeping willows had been planted along the main road where five or six shops sold apples, almonds and dried apricots. As I stood there, jotting superlatives in a notebook, the storekeepers appeared to eye me with sadness and suspicion, as if I were some government inspector come to abolish all this perfection. There was a food joint there, the 'Hassan Shan Hotal and Restourent', where we had tea and shook hands with everyone while we waited for the car to be fixed. 'You think this place is nice?' said Mr Altaf. 'Wait and see what comes next.' We were on our way to Shangri-la. The Hunza Valley got prettier at every turn: snowy peaks, fruit drying on the flat roofs of stone cottages, magpies swooping between the juniper trees and patchwork fields perched on top of sheer cliffs. Rock slides were a persistent nuisance and several times we had to swerve around huge boulders, as if the mountains were trying to reclaim the road. By the time we reached our stopover at Karimabad, it was dark and cold and the electricity was down. Sunrise revealed the town's heart-stopping location, notched into the side of a rock face and surrounded by four towering peaks, all over 24,500ft. The slopes were terraced with stone walls and planted with corn, vegetables and fruit trees. There were wild flowers and children laughing and the leaves of the poplars were starting to turn red. Even cynics could believe that this was the inspiration for the Shangri-la of James Hilton's novel Lost Horizon. Many in Karimabad originate in central Asia and have pale skin and blue eyes. They smiled easily, wished me good morning and offered directions. I was heading for the Ultar Glacier, a fierce climb that I eventually abandoned after three hours. It was an odd experience standing in a steep gorge with the sun beating down and snowflakes falling, not knowing whether to feel hot or cold, or whether to keep going or turn back. I was told later that the glacier leads up to two peaks, neither of which has been climbed. The route north became increasingly desolate and, in a sense, more beautiful. Wide glaciers reached down to the roadside like rivers of molten candle wax. All around, the mountains seemed to be closing in. The last real town was Sust at 9,750ft where we stopped at a truckers' diner and ate bowls of yak stew which tasted quite good, like beef but with more fat. As we stepped out, in the bright sunlight, we came face to face with a yak tethered to a rock. It was looking at us with sad, accusing eyes. 'You know, at the top of the mountains they eat all the beautiful flowers,' said Mr Altaf, which made me feel a lot better. After Sust, we were waved through half a dozen checkpoints, then crossed into the Khunjerab National Park where a game warden looked over the car for hunting rifles. On the roof of his windowless hut were the horned skulls of an ibex and the endangered Marco Polo sheep. From there on, the road narrowed again and threatened to disappear altogether in an assault course of potholes and deep craters. Army engineers were trying to keep it open using bulldozers and shovels, but winter was advancing and it was a battle they could never win. The final stretch sliced through a deep valley then up, past the snow line, around a series of hairpin bends and on to the Khunjerab Pass. The road there is said to be the world's highest at 16,000ft and a chill wind blew across from China making the air unspeakably cold. There was little to acknowledge our achievement, just a single barrier, a sentry box and a lone border guard, the last man in Pakistan, who stood in silence clapping his gloved hands and stamping his boots. Arrival should have warranted some sense of elation but my head throbbed, I felt giddy and breathless and my eyes blinked icy tears. After a couple of minutes I returned to the car and we turned around to head home. On the way down, Mr Altaf pointed to a herd of 50 or 60 yaks grazing beneath a marble-white glacier. 'You see, there are no beautiful flowers left,' he said, and I realised I was beginning to feel hungry again. Mark Hodson was a guest of Pakistan International Airlines (071-734 5544) and Cox &amp; Kings (071-873 5000). Its next 16-day tour of northern Pakistan goes out on April 13 1995. It includes overnight stops at Chilas, Gilgit and the Hunza Valley, and costs Pounds 1,745.</p>

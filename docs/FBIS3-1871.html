			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taipei, March 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan has done a good  job of cracking down on intellectual property rights violators,  Board of Foreign Trade Deputy Director General Lin Yi-fu claimed  Tuesday [1 March] during the second day of talks between the  Republic of China [ROC] and the United States on intellectual  property rights (IPR) protection.    Taiwan is currently negotiating with US officials to have  its  name removed from the special 301 priority watch list, which  targets countries breaching IPR laws. Those countries failing  to improve their IPR protection records may be hit with trade  sanctions by the United States.    Lin cited US customs statistics in defense of Taiwan's  efforts, saying that Taiwan has gone from having the most  exports of any country seized for IPR violations by US customs  agents in 1991, to improving to fourth position in 1993,  trailing Mainland China, an unidentified country, and Hong Kong.    Mainland Chinese goods worth US$19 million were confiscated  by US customs for IPR violations last year, accounting for 43  percent of the total value of goods seized by the United States.  Taiwan accounted for about 5 percent of the total value of  goods confiscated, or US$2.2 million.    In terms of the number of shipments of goods seized by the  US  customs for violating IPR laws, Taiwan ranked fifth.    During the day's negotiations, Lin asked the United States  to  provide Taiwan with information concerning Taiwan's IPR  violators so that the government can more effectively police the  (renegade) trade.    The US side, (?alternatively), expressed its dissatisfaction  over Taiwan's having reduced the maximum jail term for violators  of the trademark law to three years from five years.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Argyll changes stockbroker Argyll, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer, has replaced Warburg Securities with BZW as its stockbroker. BZW will be joint brokers with Panmure Gordon. No reason was given for the move. Argyll, however, has long been thought to be not entirely comfortable about Warburg also being broker to J Sainsbury.</p>

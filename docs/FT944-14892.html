			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: US defence groups lift operating results in spite of weaker sales Third-quarter figures from four leading US defence groups showed showed generally higher margins on static or falling sales. Two of the companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop Grumman, also reported higher military aircraft sales and a sharp decline in missiles. GM Hughes Electronics, the separately-quoted defence and electronics subsidiary of General Motors, said its defence profits at the operating level were up 31 per cent at Dollars 168m on sales down 8 per cent at Dollars 1.36bn. It attributed the fall in sales to reduced production on various programmes, including ground radar and Trident missile components, plus termination of the Advanced Cruise Missile programme and the Follow-On Early Warning System. Operating margins rose from 8.8 per cent to 12.4 per cent as a result of cost reductions, Hughes said. For the group as a whole, earnings were also helped by a 37 per cent rise in auto electronics profits and a 110 per cent profits rise in the telecommunications and space division, offset by a Dollars 52m loss caused mainly by technical problems with the Hughes-Avicom in-flight entertainment system. Net earnings were 61 cents a share against 56 cents. McDonnell Douglas said underlying earnings were up 39 per cent at a record Dollars 140m, on sales up only 1 per cent. Operating profit on military aircraft was also a record at Dollars 182m, up 27 per cent on sales up 8 per cent. Sales growth was due to the F/A-18 and C-17 military aircraft programmes, the company said. Profits on commercial aircraft, however, were down 27 per cent at Dollars 8m. Profits in the missiles, space and electronic systems division were down 51 per cent on a comparable basis at Dollars 56m, on sales down 34 per cent. Northrop Grumman said sales for the quarter were up 58 per cent to Dollars 1.93bn, or down 6 per cent excluding acquisitions. Operating profits from aircraft were up 44 per cent at Dollars 121m, while profits in electronics and systems integration were up 167 per cent at Dollars 40m. Losses in missiles deepened to Dollars 20m from Dollars 11m, largely due to increased development costs on the TSSAM missile. Net income for the group was up 50 per cent at Dollars 39m. General Dynamics, the nuclear submarine and armoured vehicle maker, reported a 4 per cent underlying rise in net earnings, to Dollars 54m. Sales were down 8 per cent to Dollars 714m, and operating margins rose from 8.2 per cent to 10.8 per cent.</p>

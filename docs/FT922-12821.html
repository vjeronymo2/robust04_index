			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Cautious Rao silences critics INDIA'S prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, appeared last night to have silenced critics of his economic policies in the ruling Congress party with a statement of party doctrine emphasising cautious change. A resolution put last night before the All India Congress Committee (AICC)  -the party's main policy-making body -reaffirmed the party's commitment to pursuing policies to improve competitiveness and productivity. But he also paid lip service to the legacy of the Nehru family by declaring his support for 'the Nehru vision of democracy, socialism and planning'. The resolution, expected to be approved today, denies that there has been any U-turn in economic policies and emphasises 'change with continuity'. It makes no mention of privatisation or of controversial proposed measures to allow industry more freedom to declare redundancies. The cautious language of the document underlines the resistance that pro-market economic policies still face within the party. But the endorsement of February's budget, including partial convertibility of the rupee, is believed to give the prime minister a free hand to continue liberalisation.</p>

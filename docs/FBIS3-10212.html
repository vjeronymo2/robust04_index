			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with National Consensus </F> Alliance presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo by Carmen  Elida Contreras; place and date not given]    [Text] "We cannot administer a canal if the isthmus is  surrounded by scarcity, violence, abject poverty, and tragedy,"  warned presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo, who  represents the Solidarity and National Unity Mission (MUN)  parties. Despite the fact that recent polls have not favored  Lewis Galindo, he believes in them and is aware that his  campaign work has to be more intense. Lewis Galindo, who is 66,  is accompanied by candidates David Guerra, MUN, and Marisin  Villalaz de Arias, Solidarity.    In an exclusive interview with LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, the  politician speaks of the country's main problems and how he will  fight them as part of a government plan.  <H5>  Why an Alliance With Mission? </H5>   Despite the fact that Solidarity initially talked to all  political parties seeking options to create a coalition,  Solidarity members decided to join MUN.    "In Mission we found points of agreement with our government  plans, in the need to make a great national concerted agreement  to frontally attack unemployment, crime, and raise our  population's morality level," Lewis Galindo, who is also an  entrepreneur, said.    He said that it was not an alliance based on "electoral  campaign conveniences," instead, a serious pact that seeks only  the good of the country, intentions that are outlined in the  Action Plan document.  <H5>  National Emergency Unemployment Plan </H5>   Lewis Galindo is of the opinion that the country's main  problems, which his administration will give priority to, are  unemployment, crime, drug addiction, and economic development --  a topic linked to each of the others.    "Unemployment is not a problem that will be resolved in days  or months, but it can be reduced." He mentioned the need to  create a national emergency plan to employ at least 40,000  Panamanians in community work in poor neighborhoods, which  translates to paying out $70 million a year. This would be  covered not by increasing taxes, but by improving their  collection by 15 percent.    Tourism is a source of jobs that can be taken advantage of  by  raising the Panama Tourism Institute to the rank of ministry and  structuring a coherent development plan that will offer  permanent jobs to more than 30,000 persons and attract the  attention of visitors.    The road network could be improved to lessen the  transportation crisis, mainly in the metropolitan area.  <H5>  Complete Modernization of the State </H5>   According to Lewis, the Panamanian state is currently ruled  by the same plan that dates back 20-30 years, thus state  bureaucracy needs the inducement of a civil service career that  offers the same benefits and security that private enterprise  workers receive.    "We must immediately give the Social Security Fund [CSS]  administrative and economic independence," the candidate noted  and suggested a total revision of the CSS situation to improve  its services, which are now deficient.    One must also study the possibility of basing retirement on  the activity each individual conducts, he said and added, "life  expectancy is not the same for all occupations. He recommended  paying greater attention to pensioners, who "often feel  neglected and are unable to obtain the income they need to  subsist, and here is where social security must act so that they  live their last years with dignity."    "We must seek the way so that the soldiers who studied a  career for which there is no room in Panama can adapt to a new  life," and to achieve it they must be granted study and work  opportunities.    He noted the National Police must receive the advisory  services of experts who at some time reorganized the police  corps in other countries that have social problems identical to  ours.    Lewis Galindo criticized the performance of Ruben Dario  Carles at the helm of the state finances for "not adequately  handling" the foreign debt, a situation that led to an increase  of the commercial debt that currently totals $1.2 billion with  interest.    He has left the country more indebted than before "because  he  followed the easy path of yielding to U.S. pressure" and did not  have an adequate economic plan. Lewis Galindo made these  remarks after Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria warned about  a fiscal deficit. In Lewis Galindo's opinion, the mistake was  to cancel the debt with the international financial institutions  and miss the opportunity of negotiating the commercial debt,  which at one point was worth 13 cents and is now almost 17 cents.    Lewis Galindo is a businessman and has been the chief  executive officer of several industries, such as Cerveceria  Chiricana [Chiriqui Brewery], Cerveceria Nacional [National  Brewery], Construcciones Nacionales [National Construction  Company], and the president of Banco del Istmo [Isthmus Bank],  as well as ambassador to the UN General Assembly.</p>

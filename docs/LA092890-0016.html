			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> JERRY GRAY EXPECTS TO BE 100%  </P> <P> Pro Bowl cornerback Jerry Gray, who will be activated off the injured reserve  list Monday, is fairly sure he won't be favoring the left knee he injured in  the Rams' last exhibition game.  </P> <P> Because he hurt the knee in such a freakish manner, colliding with cornerback  Alfred Jackson in the end zone after a pass, Gray said he isn't concerned about  reinjuring it in the normal flow of a game and he should be 100% for the Rams'  next game, Oct. 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Defensive linemen Bill Hawkins (knee injury) and Brian Smith (injured ribs) did  not practice Thursday, and Coach John Robinson said he will hold them out until  next week. . . . Robinson said his best estimate is that starting inside  linebacker Larry Kelm (knee injury) could be activated off injured reserve in  two weeks, cornerback Darryl Henley (hip injury) in three weeks.

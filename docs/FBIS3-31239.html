Vitaly Churkin said it was "absolutely unthinkable" that  Russian forces should be "somewhere on the ground where their  lives and safety can be endangered" as a result of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation decision.    He recalled that the NATO ultimatum giving Bosnian Serbs  until midnight Sunday to withdraw their heavy weapons from  around Sarajevo or face air strikes had been taken without  consulting Moscow.    President Boris Yeltsin's envoy travelled to Zagreb from the  Bosnian capital, where he met Bosnian government leaders, and  Bosnian Serb and United Nations Protection Force commanders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fighter planes and warships from five nations  started mock air and sea battles off Malaysia and Singapore  today to test the region's only multilateral defense pact  involving outside powers. The four-day joint air and sea  exercises under the Five Power Defense Arrangement -- FPDA --  end on Friday. FPDA link Britain, Australia, New Zealand,  Malaysia, and Singapore. All are members of the Commonwealth.  Code-named ADEX 94-2, the exercise is taking place over  Singapore and Malaysia and the South China Sea, an area of  overlapping territorial claims. The exercise was coordinated  from the Royal Malaysian Air Force base at Butterworth,  headquarters of the Integrated Air Defense System.</p>

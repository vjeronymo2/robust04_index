			<p>BFN     [Summary] "The Ninth National Assembly's fifth session  entered its 11th day today. In the morning, the National  Assembly held a plenary meeting at the conference hall under the  direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan to  continue debating the draft law on domestic investment promotion.    "The National Assembly heard Do Quoc Sam, minister and chief  of the State Planning Commission, speaking on behalf of the Law  Drafting Committee, present a report on ideas and viewpoints of  National Assembly deputies on the draft law."    Many deputies suggested that only overseas Vietnamese who  still hold Vietnamese citizenship are entitled to enjoying  privileges specified by the law. Other deputies proposed that  the government issue concrete regulations to prevent foreigners  from making their investments under the name of local Vietnamese.    All deputies expressed their unanimous views on granting  privileges and encouragement to investment projects in areas  with numerous difficulties, in mountain regions, and offshore  islands. They suggested that income tax exemption should be  granted to these projects for two to four years, and business  turnover tax for two years.    Many deputies expressed their concern over the granting of  loans to promote domestic investment projects. They questioned  whether the loans should be granted at the beginning of projects  or later when they begin to bear fruit.    "Some deputies suggested that if the National Assembly  passes  the law on domestic investment promotion this year, the  government should promptly issue regulations for its  implementation."    Several deputies also suggested that for key investment  projects proposed by overseas Vietnamese or by long-time foreign  residents in Vietnam, the government should submit them to the  National Assembly Standing Committee for consideration.</p>

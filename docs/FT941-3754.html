			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / People: Owners Abroad Jan Hall (below) has joined the board of travel group Owners Abroad, whose top management is being restructured under the leadership of Francis Baron, its new chief executive. Hall's experience of branding makes her a useful non-executive find for Owners Abroad. For the past 10 years, she has been chairman of Coley Porter Bell, a corporate and brand indentity consultancy which became part of the WPP group in 1989. Hall, 36, recently left the company. Baron, who took over late last year, has said he wants to trim the group's diverse and confusing holiday brands, which include Sovereign, Enterprise, Falcon and Sunmed. He is also pondering changing the name of the group. The Owners Abroad label dates back to the company's original business, which was selling flights to people who owned holiday homes abroad. One of Hall's final projects at Coley Porter Bell was to oversee a branding project for Airtours, Owners Abroad's rival. Her former company helped Airtours come up with Going Places, the new name for its Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson travel agency chains. Hall says she has assured Airtours that no confidential information will be passed on to Owners Abroad.</p>

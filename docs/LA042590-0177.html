			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'TOO TALL' NOT RETURNING TO DALLAS  </P> <P> Defensive end Ed (Too Tall) Jones says he won't return to the Dallas Cowboys  for a 16th season because he no longer fits the rebuilding Dallas system that  has placed an emphasis on youth.  </P> <P> Jones, 39, said he may consider offers from other National Football League  teams, but also hinted at possible retirement.  </P> <P> "Coach Jimmy Johnson has decided go with younger players," he said. "You don't  make those changes and keep an older player."  </P> <P> Johnson said he hadn't talked to Jones about his plans. But it became apparent  that the Cowboys had lost interest in Jones when they did not make him a  qualifying contract offer and left him unprotected during the Plan B free  agency signing period. He remains a free agent.  </P> <P> Jones would be the league's oldest player if he plays a 16th season.  </P> <P> "I might wake up tomorrow and retire," Jones said Tuesday. "So I'm not going to  say that I will sign with another team."  </P></p>

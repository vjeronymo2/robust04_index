			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Vienna May 18 TASS -- The CSCE nations are actively  seeking ways to enhance the effectiveness of their peace-making  efforts, to strengthen confidence and security on the European  continent. This conclusion is warranted by the CSCE report on  the results of its work in 1993, released in Vienna today.    The document points out that the developments of 1993 had  occurred against the background of futile efforts to promote  stability in the region. Bloody wars are still continuing in  the Balkans, in Transcaucasia and in Tajikistan. There is  persistent tension in inter-ethnic relations and the danger of  new conflicts is still imminent.    In these conditions the CSCE nations did their best to hold  various consultations and to promote a dialogue on problems of  current policy. Their new organ -- the Vienna group of the  committee of senior CSCE officials -- has held more than thirty  meetings during the reviewed period. CSCE peace-keeping  missions have worked in many regions, including former  Yugoslavia and the former republics of the Soviet Union. Their  purpose was to help find a lasting, all-embracing political  settlement for the conflicts, to find a mechanism to facilitate  negotiations between the conflicting sides.    The document specially notes the role of the CSCE high  commissioner for the affairs of national minorities, who visited  the Baltic states, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. He has  submitted several valuable recommendations to guarantee the  observance of human rights.    The report stresses that one of the CSCE most important  tasks  is to strengthen cooperation in the sphere of security, to  control armaments and promote disarmament.    "The past year has proved that the CSCE is a living  organism,  capable of making an important contribution to the prevention of  regional conflicts, to the promotion of peace-making measures  and security on the continent," ITAR-TASS was told by CSCE  Secretary-General Wilhelm Heink. He noted that in the coming  period the CSCE nations planned to pay more attention to  humanitarian aspects of cooperation, to expand their interaction  in the sphere of preventive diplomacy, to activate relations  with other international organisations and institutions,  primarily with the United Nations.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Avoidably detained: Edward Mortimer argues that the UK is treating asylum seekers as if they are the guilty ones On the outskirts of Oxford, close to Kidlington airport, an unobtrusive sign points down a suburban side road to 'Campsfield House'. The road leads to a group of red brick buildings surrounded by a 20-foot high perimeter fence. Beyond that fence, 200 people are living in a world that is part Franz Kafka and part George Orwell. In the custody of private security company Group 4, supervised by Home Office immigration officers, they are known as 'clients' but are in fact prisoners, tormented by a continuous stream of Tannoy announcements, starting with a demonstration of the fire alarm at 6am. They do not understand why they are there, and they do not know when they will get out. Most have not been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime. They are foreigners whose right to remain in the country is being investigated by the Home Office, or whose deportation orders are being reviewed by the courts. The great majority have applied for political asylum. Most have been there for two or three months, but some claim to have been in detention for more than a year. Last July there were 317 such asylum seekers in detention in the UK. Apart from short-term facilities at airports and police stations, the largest numbers were at Harmondsworth detention centre near Heathrow (which can hold 95) and at Haslar prison, Hampshire, which has 100 places for men. But many were also held in regular prisons. It was ostensibly to avoid sending the 'overspill' to ordinary prisons that the government opened Campsfield last November. The Immigration and Asylum Appeals Act, which came into force last July, was also intended to reduce the number of detainees by speeding up the procedure for deciding who stays and who is deported. But the effect seems to have been the opposite. The proportion of asylum applications refused jumped from 14 per cent in the first half of 1993 to 72 per cent in the second half, while the proportion granted 'exceptional leave to remain' fell from 76 per cent to 22 per cent. (The latter formula is used when applicants are considered to have a good case in equity, but do not clearly qualify as refugees under the UK's restrictive interpretation of the 1951 Geneva Convention - for instance, if they have fled from civil war, rather than from persecution directed at them as individuals.) Those who are refused leave to remain seem to be detained, pending deportation, as a matter of course. As a result, the 200 places in Campsfield were filled straight away, and the total number in detention is now more than 700. Eleven days ago, 105 detainees in Campsfield went on hunger strike - not against the conditions of their detention but against the fact that they are detained at all. The Home Office reacted by moving nine of them - whose behaviour is alleged to have been 'disruptive and intimidatory' - to prisons in Birmingham and near Bicester, Oxfordshire. Yesterday the number of Campsfield strikers had fallen to 80, according to the Home Office. Meanwhile, the strike has been joined by 18 detainees at Haslar, 16 at Harmondsworth and 46 at seven other prisons across the country. This clearly poses a serious challenge to the whole policy of detaining asylum seekers. Virtually all the Campsfield detainees claim to have been victims of repression in their own countries, or have plausible reasons for why they are afraid to return. Some of their stories are harrowing. A Cameroonian woman told me both her parents had died after being arrested and tortured for organising a boycott of French products. She herself had been a member of their association and had distributed leaflets, but had been able to get out of the country last September. She had left her two children aged 10 and three in the care of a friend, but had had no news of them. 'I don't know if they are alive or not,' she says. Needless to say, the truth of such stories is not easy to establish. No doubt some are invented and others exaggerated. It is the job of the Home Office and the courts to decide in each case. What seems bizarre, however, is that applicants are in effect treated as guilty until proved innocent. Mr Charles Wardle, immigration minister, has said that 'if they decide to leave the country, they are perfectly free to go'. That means, of course, that they are free to be deported to their countries of origin. But the asylum seekers contend that they would not be safe in those countries. Mr Wardle has also explained that 'if they don't comply with restrictions while they are here, a tiny proportion (of asylum applicants) are detained while their cases are being considered'. Those I spoke to said they were quite willing to comply with any restrictions, only no such option had been offered. Many of the detainees are genuine political activists: intelligent, articulate, middle-class people, who have had the courage to stand up for human rights and democracy against corrupt and dictatorial regimes. Just the kind of people, in fact, that Britain claims to support. 'Before we came here,' they said in the statement announcing their hunger strike, 'we knew that the UK is the leading country in the world in human rights.' Sadly, they now know better.</p>

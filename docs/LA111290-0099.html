			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE MAKES A CHANGE FOR BETTER;  </P> <P> AUTO RACING: FANGIO SCORES UPSET VICTORY IN SAN DIEGO GT RACE AFTER ENGINE IS  REPLACED.  </P> <P> Chip Robinson needed a miracle in the Camel Grand Prix of Greater San Diego to  win the GT Championship Series title. He didn't get it.  </P> <P> Jay Cochran needed to keep his Chevrolet Spice out of trouble long enough to  let Al Unser Jr. get in the cockpit. It didn't happen.  </P> <P> And Juan Manuel Fangio II needed to replace the engine on his Toyota Eagle  after a disappointing Saturday qualifying session.  </P> <P> Fangio, the namesake nephew of the five-time world champion, took his new  engine and drove it to victory on the 1.62-mile course on the Del Mar  Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> "The car was very good," the Argentine said after winning by 1 minute 1.29  seconds over Jaguar's Davy Jones in the 87-lap race. Nissan's John Paul Jr.  took third.  </P> <P> The victory was worth $50,000 to Fangio, who averaged 78.836 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Jones took second despite losing a turbo two hours before the race in practice.  The pace cars had already started the field on its way when Paul finally roared  out of the pits. He eventually took the lead on lap 39 and held it until lap  61.  </P> <P> Unser, the fastest qualifier with a track-record 94.828 m.p.h. Saturday, never  had a chance to get in the car. Cochran, the second-fastest driver to Unser in  Friday's practice sessions, started the race on the pole and was simply to put  in some laps; he and Unser would change positions under the first yellow flag  after 30 minutes, allowing Unser to drive the rest of the 1-hour 45-minute race  without stopping for fuel.  </P> <P> Instead, Cochran ran in first place for 18 laps before Ruggero Melgrati,  driving a slower Camel Lights car, ran him into the wall at Turn 5. In the  pits, Unser shrugged.  </P> <P> "I'm just awfully sorry for the Spice team and for Jay," Unser said. "From what  Jay said . . . there was nothing he could do. He was running conservatively and  consistently."  </P> <P> Said Cochran: "I feel sorry for Chris Pook (Del Mar Race Management president)  and Al," he said. "The car was brilliant."  </P> <P> Said Melgrati: "He probably tried to pass me on the left. It's neither one of  our faults."  </P> <P> To win the GT championship, Robinson needed to win the race and have leader  Geoff Brabham finish out of the top 10. Robinson reached second place but  finished fifth.  </P> <P> Brabham won $150,000 for winning the title, his third in a row.  </P> <P> James Weaver was disqualified by IMSA and fined $5,000 for improper driver  conduct. IMSA ruled he deliberately ran over sound-control equipment after  being told to correct a noise problem on his Porsche.  </P></p>

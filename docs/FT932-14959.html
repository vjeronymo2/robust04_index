			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: Heading off into uncertainty - As the corruption scandal deepens, Italians vote on Sunday to consider the first steps to fundamental political reform. But the shape of this is unclear AS Italians prepare to vote on Sunday in their country's latest referendums, what was designed by its sponsors as a protest against the political establishment has turned into a much more confused affair. Of the eight separate referendums, two in particular should have been barometers of the political mood in a country rocked by almost daily revelations of political corruption and, more recently, allegations of collusion between leading politicians and organised crime. But since the proposal to reform the system for electing members of the Senate, the upper house of parliament, was first mooted by Mr Mario Segni, the breakaway Christian Democrat who has led the referendum movement, most of the main political parties have jumped on the reform bandwagon. Similarly, every political group in parliament has endorsed the referendum calling for the abolition of state funding for parties. After the exposure of massive kickbacks to politicians on a stream of public-sector contracts in recent years, opposing the move would be little more than political suicide. The alternative to the current system has not yet been outlined but will have to offer greater transparency and be more rigidly enforceable. By contrast, some smaller political parties are calling on their supporters to oppose the call for electoral reform. Their arguments are based on principle, but with a strong element of self-preservation. Sunday's referendum only calls on voters to voice their opinion on replacing the electoral system in the Senate, the upper house of parliament. The present method, based on proportional representation, would make way for one whereby 238 of the 315 seats in the Senate would be elected by a majority vote. It is expected that backing for the change will oblige politicians to extend the reform to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house. Less certain is the type of majority voting system politicians will prefer when it comes to approving a replacement. According to the opponents of change, shifting to an electoral system based on a majority vote will strengthen the position of established parties, such as the Christian Democrats, which have traditionally blocked change in Italy and are now being revealed as deeply involved in the corruption scandals. Hence opponents of the referendum, such as La Rete, the small party headed by Mr Leoluca Orlando, the former mayor of Palermo, and a majority of the environmentalist Green lobby, say the call for electoral reform is counter-productive, as it will only enshrine the entrenched position of the bigger parties, while smaller groups militating for reform will be penalised in future polls. The opponents of referendum say new elections should be held now, rather than waiting for a new system to be introduced by a parliament they claim largely composed of parties shown to be corrupt. A sizeable Yes vote in favour of reforming the electoral system and party financing is no longer in doubt after polling booths shut on Monday afternoon. How politicians will react remains uncertain. Before the parties backed the two main issues, it was widely expected that the 'protest' registered by the referendum would trigger the formation of a new government. The latter, probably headed by an 'institutional' figure such as the leader of the upper or lower house of parliament, would have remained in office just long enough to steer through electoral reform. Once the changes were approved, it was assumed the caretaker government would call early elections, probably for September. That would allow voters to elect a parliament, based on the new rules, which would reflect popular opinion and be better placed to push through tough economic measures. However, the prospect of an 'institutional' post-referendum government has waned in recent weeks after growing signs of friction between the Christian Democrats, the biggest political party, and the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the former Communists. Earlier this month, the two parties, which would form the main elements of an 'institutional' post-referendum coalition, appeared unable to agree on sharing power. The likely price for support by the PDS - having the government led by Mr Giorgio Napolitano - appeared too high for the Christian Democrats. Mr Napolitano is the leader of the Chamber of Deputies and a PDS politician. Meanwhile, the PDS appeared unwilling to back a more broadly-based government unless strongly represented. Given the impasse, it now looks more likely that Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, will soldier on. It will be up to his tarnished coalition, which has seen the departure of five ministers on account of the corruption investigations, to see electoral reform through parliament and then prompt a formal government crisis which would trigger an early poll. The Amato government could be 'refreshed' after the referendums by a reshuffle, albeit one short of bringing in other parties to broaden its support. The present coalition is based on a flimsy 16-seat majority. Party leaders may also informally reconfirm their support for Mr Amato, who has regained some stature after stumbling earlier this year after backing an amnesty for politicians accused of taking bribes on behalf of their parties.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE VOTE ON ELECTORAL REFORM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- What the reformers want to scrap .....  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ITALY A several-faceted, shifting coalition  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The spring 1992 Amato cabinet, which has since been altered dramatically because of resignations due to the ongoing corruption scandal CHRISTAIN DEMOCRATS    11 SOCIALISTS              8 SOCIAL DEMOCRATS        2 LIBERALS                2 TECHNOCRATS             4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Changing partners  -Parliamentary elections must be held every five years. However, in a country now on its 51st government since the Second World War, legislatures have seldom lasted their full course. The elections of April 1992 marked one of the very few occasions that a parliament had served its full term.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Early elections can be triggered through a formal government 'crisis,' which occurs when a government no longer commands the support of parliament. The crisis can lead to the creation of a new government, without elections, or, failing that, new polls after the president of the republic (the head of state) dissolves parliament.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -There is no fixed duration for the election campaign.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Given that the electoral system is based on a very pure form of proportional representation, elections tend to return a large number of parties to parliament. Sixteen parties are represented in the current Chamber of Deputies.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -The president nominates a prime minister, who then seeks to put together a government. Given the consensual nature of Italian politics and the ubiquity of coalitions, the process of naming a prime minister and assembling a coalition is usually very lengthy, involving contacts with different party leaders. A new government has to be approved by parliament through a vote of confidence.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   .and the models they are looking at  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FRANCE A colaition of like-minded parties  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The current cabinet formed after last month's conservative landslide in National Assembly elections UDF (centre-right)    16 RPR (Gaullists)       13  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Parliamentary elections must be called every five years. The president is elected separately every seven years. Early parliamentary elections can be called by the government itself, triggered by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, or by the timing of the presidential elections.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -There are two rounds of voting in a parliamentary election. The official campaign lasts for three weeks before the first vote, during which time the parties broadcast their political messages. There are strict controls over political advertising for six months before the vote, and opinion polls are banned in the campaign's final week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -In the first round, candidates winning 50 per cent or more of the vote in their constituencies win outright. All other candidates winning more than 12.5 per cent go on to the second round a week later. Then, the candidate winning the most votes is elected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -The president chooses the prime minister, normally from the party which has won the most seats, although the constitution does not require this. The prime minister appoints the cabinet, but the president is empowered to object to individuals.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Every French government is influenced by its relationship with the president, whether or not the president's party is represented in the government. The constitution is vague on the division of power, but presidents tend to claim authority over foreign affairs and defence policy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK A single-party administration  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The cabinet formed after the April 1992 general election, except for the replacement of one minister CONSERVATIVES       22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Elections to the House of Commons must be held within five years of a government's coming to power, but governments can call early elections and often do. Or they can be forced to the polls by losing a parlimentary vote of confidence on an important issue, although it is possible for the Queen (the head of state) to ask someone in parliament to form a government without an election provided the new administration can command a parliamentary majority.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -The minimum period between an election being called and polling day is three weeks, although convention usually dictates a period of about four weeks.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -There is a single round of voting. The candidate winning the most votes in a constituency is elected (known as 'the first past the post' system), even though the candidate may have received considerably less than 50 per cent of the vote.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -The party winning the most seats in the House of Commons generally forms the government, with the party's leader as prime minister. The prime minister chooses the other ministers. Two seats in the cabinet go to the Leader of the Lords, who is a member of the governing party, and the Lord Chancellor, who is the chief law officer in the country.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -If the party with the most seats does not command an overall majority, which rarely happens, it will seek to form a coalition government or effect an electoral pact with a smaller party or parties to command an overall majority.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

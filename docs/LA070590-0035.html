			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHER TAXES  </P> <P> I was told by Ronald Reagan, in his bid for governor against Edmund Brown Sr.,  that if I voted for Brown my taxes would "go up." I got the same message from  George Bush when he was running against Michael Dukakis for president. They  were right! I voted for Brown and Dukakis and my taxes went up.  </P> <P> DONNA VENITZ  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoshchekov] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg, 12 Apr -- We have witnessed force  becoming the main argument in a political dispute many times.  But recent examples set by Russia in helping to bring about a  settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina have clearly  demonstrated to the whole world that it is possible to manage  without using or threatening force in political dialogue.    So it is extremely distressing that we have witnessed a  departure from civilized forms of political dialogue with the  air strikes by NATO aircraft in the Gorazde region and have  slipped back into methods of force. Vladimir Podoprigora,  chairman of the International Affairs Committee of the Russian  parliament's Federation Council, made these remarks in an  interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. He is in Strasbourg  as part of an Russian Federation Government delegation which is  taking part in the work of the latest session here of the  Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly which unites 32  European states.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / CBI survey points to recovery areas: Yorkshire and Humberside region, east Midlands and Wales are expected to lead growth in services and manufacturing WALES, the east Midlands, and the Yorkshire and Humberside region are likely to lead the economic recovery, according to the Business Strategies consultancy. Its conclusion is based on a regional breakdown released yesterday of prospects for manufacturers, conducted by the consultancy with the Confederation of British Industry. Ms Bridget Rosewell, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said the three regions all combined relative strength in manufacturing with reasonably good prospects for services - which account for about three quarters of gross domestic product. The study is based on the CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey, which questioned 1,328 manufacturing companies between March 27 and April 13. According to the study, manufacturers across the UK are generally more optimistic than four months ago. Expectations about a recovery were particularly marked in East Anglia, the south-east and the west Midlands. All three areas were hit hard in the early stages of the recession in 1990. However, the north of England and Scotland - two regions relatively little affected in the early part of the recession - appear to be suffering more now in terms of depressed orders and output. Out of the 11 UK regions, five have seen a decrease in the past year in the proportion of companies working below capacity. These are the south-east, East Anglia, Yorkshire and Humberside, east Midlands and Wales. Most regions have continued over the past four months to see a fall in output and orders, but at a lower rate than last year. Another relatively gloomy conclusion is that all regions except the north expect a decline in investment in plant and machinery over the next 12 months. The expected rate of reduction in capital spending appears to be slowing in the east and west Midlands and Wales.</p>

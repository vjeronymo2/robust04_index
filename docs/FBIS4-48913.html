			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary from the "Opinion" page: "Labour Day"] </F>   [Text] Tomorrow is Labour Day.    We want to extend holiday greetings to working people all  over the world.    In China, workers are building a socialist market economy  with Chinese characteristics.    And the growth of the national economy is the result of  their  hard work. Every step of the economic reforms has been boosted  by their selfless support.    They have proved their worth as the leading class of the  People's Republic and have earned the respect of the nation.    Although reform is now being targeted at central planning,  the government continues to strive for workers' welfare. For  instance, it is seeking effective ways of implementing the  constitutional principle of "to each according to one's work."    The government is making great efforts to strike a balance  between efficiency and fairness.    With the contract employment system, workers' rights and  interests are safeguarded and their freedom in choosing jobs  ensured.    While making a series of laws on labour safety and minimum  pay, the government is constructing a uniform welfare umbrella  for all workers regardless of the ownership of the enterprises  which employ them. With rapid economic growth, the nation is  also experiencing higher inflation and rising unemployment.    Current difficulties in the State-owned sector are affecting  the living standards of the employees.    Infringements upon labour rights are on the rise in foreign-  funded and private firms. And their labour safety standards are  often found to be substandard.    As a result, trade union federations and relevant  departments  are raising their voice for speedy and substantial improvement  on these issues.    While encouraging the private sector to create more jobs,  the  government is also helping to re-train surplus workers for  reemployment.    The recent government decision to reduce State employees'  working hours from 48 to 44 per week allowed working people to  share the benefits of economic prosperity.    The authorities are also laying down labour rights in the  new  market economy.    The long-waited Labour Law will soon be adopted. And  drafting laws on labour protection has been given priority.    With the deepening of reforms, Chinese workers will enjoy  better protection and fuller rights.</p>

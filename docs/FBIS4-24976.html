			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>   [Text] Mainland brokerages may have to play their part in  Beijing's plan to enforce two compulsory six-month guidance  periods for mainland candidates seeking a listing -- one before  and one after their listings. China's top securities watchdog,  the China Securities Regulatory Commission, has called on listed  companies to standardise their operations and suggested a  six-month "coaching period" to guide companies both before and  after they list.    A senior official of a Shanghai brokerage said the six-month  coaching periods before and after listing would probably be  included in the supplementary provisions to the Securities Law.  Although details of the guidance procedure had yet to be  officially announced, he said Beijing's securities authorities  were aiming to improve the quality of companies through the  proposed system.    The brokerage official speculated that mainland stockbroking  houses would be designated as "coaches" because they were more  familiar with the companies, compared to securities authorities.  In addition he said companies would be more willing to accept  guidance from brokerages rather than securities authorities  because the former were comparatively more independent and the  latter more official. "It is highly possible that some  stockbroking houses will become coaches for listing candidates,"  he said, pointing to the big brokerages with good performance  records.    The official expected there would be requirements on what  was  a qualified coach and on the procedures and goals for coaching.  He speculated that the chances for foreign brokerages to be  given the opportunity to coach would be low because they were  not as familiar with the situation on the mainland. The aim was  that company management should be instructed in relevant legal  knowledge and the appropriate manner to disclose information as  well as the importance of adhering to listing plans in  prospectuses.    Under the existing securities regulations, it is clear that  big changes in a company's business is not allowed in the first  year of listing. But the brokerage official said most companies  did not follow what they pledged in prospectuses. "Most  companies follow what we tell them before their listings, but  once they get the money, our words fall on deaf ears. What they  care about is nothing more than how to spend the money," he said.    The official said the proposed plan would help raise the  discipline of issuers and their legal knowledge, which would  effectively raise the overall quality of listed companies on  China's stock exchanges. This was because the responsibility  would fall on the coach, not just the companies, if the  companies did not follow their listing plans.    However, Bankers Trust Asia Research Vice-president Lily Wu  said that the coaching period was redundant. She said the  companies knew that, according to the rules in the Standard  Opinion on share issues and trading, they could not make big  changes in businesses in their first months after listing. "We  know companies do not follow the rules and waste their money.  They just pump their money into property...," she said.  However, Ms Wu said the coaching period would contribute to the  chance of the government exerting too much interference in the  stock markets.</p>

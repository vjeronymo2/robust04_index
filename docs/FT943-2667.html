			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: Much ado about opera in Cardiff - 'Beatrice and Benedict' From some of the media reports this week one would think that every opera company in Britain is looking for a new building. What has happened is rather that the opera companies have shown themselves to be the best prepared at putting their case for money from the national lottery. The position at the beginning of the week was that two - the Royal Opera House and English National Opera - had drawn up plans for improving the sites they already have. To these we can now add the major development outlined by Welsh National Opera on Thursday. Alone of the opera companies, it is proposing a wholly new building. An international competition was set in motion late in 1993 to find a suitable design and this week the Cardiff Bay Opera House Trust announced its choice. From eight finalists the assessors selected Zaha Hadid, born in Iraq, but based in London. Her glass necklace building enclosing a central auditorium looks an ambitious and striking choice. The cost is estimated at Pounds 43m, which compares well with the Royal Opera's far larger sum. Whether those dispensing the largesse from the National Lottery will see fit to hand out money to each of these rival operatic schemes must be a delicately balanced political question. In a way it will be a shame to say goodbye to the New Theatre, Cardiff, which is currently WNO's home. The theatre may be cramped, but it has intimacy on its side. Perhaps the company is aware of what it will be losing and has decided to schedule some favourite small-scale operas in the interim: Berlioz's Beatrice and Benedict, which opened in a new production on Thursday, might almost have been written for the theatre. Given the popular success of Kenneth Branagh's film version of Much Ado about Nothing, it is surprising that Berlioz's adaptation of Shakespeare has not been the talk of the opera companies' newly-powerful marketing departments. What we get at WNO comes close to being the opera of the film. Elijah Moshinsky's thoroughly enjoyable new production manages to conjure just as poetic a vision of Italy on stage as the film's camera crew did actually on location. A warm evening light plays on the golden stone colonnades of a Sicilian villa. In the distance are blue skies over the rooftops of a small village; nearer to hand family and guests are preparing the evening meal, tonight's menu being generous helpings of pasta. The scene is wonderfully airy and convivial, like the opera itself. Moshinsky has devised a beautiful, naturalistic production with help from his designers, Michael Yeargan (sets), Dona Granata (costumes) and Howard Harrison (lighting). It is a mark of his care that the performers move so easily from Shakespeare to Berlioz and back again without dropping a stitch as they knit together their characterisations. Sara Fulgoni makes a spirited Beatrice with curly red hair and reading glasses, clearly a girl with a will of her own. It helps that she has an individual voice, a shade bigger, more biting and more boldly coloured than usual. Nor does Donald Kaasch's laid-back, shabby soldier of a Benedict have any less personal magnetism. Rebecca Evans as Hero and Patricia Bardon as Ursula join Fulgoni for Berlioz's delectable duets and trios, carefully disguising the very different qualities of their voices. It is not their fault that Donald Maxwell's comic Somarone with a disparaging dislike for tenors and viola-players came close to stealing the show, though Moshinsky might tone him down a notch or two. Indeed, the same might be said of the orchestra under John Nelson, an experienced Berlioz interpreter who sometimes overestimated the volume necessary in this small theatre. Berlioz described the opera as 'a caprice written with the point of a needle', which really is possible here. With seats for 800 more people the new opera-house will demand a bigger repertoire to match, but then that is the project's very aim. Welsh National Opera is not a company that has ever been short of ambitions. Beatrice and Benedict sponsored by Swalec</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Arts: BBC documentary wins Prix Italia The BBC has added once again to a unique record of success at the Prix Italia, oldest and most respected of all the world's broadcasting festivals, by winning this year's prize for television documentaries with War, Lives and Videotape. The programme, made by Nick Danziger, was one of the 'Video Diaries' series in which non-professionals have been lent video cameras, given rudimentary training, and encouraged to produce personal documents. Danziger's tells of his efforts to provide a home in Kabul for orphans growing up in the mental hospital. The prize of L15m (about Pounds 7,500) was won against competition from 32 other entries submitted by 22 countries. The special, or second prize, was won by a Belgian programme called Les Amants D'Assises which tells the extraordinarily dramatic story of a court case concerning a crime of passion.</p>

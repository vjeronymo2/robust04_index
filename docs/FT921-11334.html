			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Cavallo demands 40% cut in bank debt: Argentina ARGENTINA demanded a 40 per cent reduction in its bank debt, in New York on Thursday, in its first formal encounter in New York with commercial creditors on restructuring of its Dollars 39bn (Pounds 21.5bn) foreign debt through the Brady debt reduction mechanism. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, offered the banks a range of options to reshape the debt. He came to the talks strengthened by firm backing for his policies from the International Monetary Fund and the US government. Argentina owes banks Dollars 31bn in debt principal, plus a further Dollars 8bn in interest arrears. At present, it pays banks Dollars 60m in token interest payments. Mr Cavallo offered the banks the following options: Reduce principal by 40 per cent by replacing debt with 30-year discount bonds. The principal would be guaranteed by US Treasury zero-coupon bonds. These bonds would pay interest linked to Libor plus 0.8 per cent, rising by up to half a percentage point every six months, until reaching a ceiling of 9 per cent a year. Cut interest in half by swapping debt for 30-year par bonds that pay half-Libor plus 0.8 per cent. Interest would be adjusted in the same way as the discount bonds and principal backed by US bonds. Refinance the Dollars 8bn in interest arrears with 15-year bonds with a six years' grace period, bearing 4.5 per cent annual interest. This would allow immediate redemption of one-tenth of arrears. The bonds would be partially backed by US Treasury bonds. Offer banks Dollars 5bn-worth of 16-year par bonds convertible into equity in privatised state companies. Interest will be equivalent to Libor. Principal to be paid after six years' grace. Some banks could take 25-year bonds that pay 2.5 per cent per year in fixed interest, rising with time to 5.5 per cent. Banks can restructure existing contracts rather than offering new bonds for old debt. Mr Cavallo said his proposal would add an extra Dollars 380mn a year to the Dollars 720m interest Argentina already pays, but would be a decisive step towards normalising Argentina's economy.</p>

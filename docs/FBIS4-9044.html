			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 19 (CTK) -- Dusan Kleiman was  quoted by Slovak Television as saying that today's government  decision to fire him as director general of the News Agency of  the Slovak Republic (TA SR) was politically motivated.    Kleiman said that the decision was undemocratic as it came  three days before he was scheduled to appear before the  parliament's Education, Science and Culture Committee.    This only proves that the government did not need for its  decision facts or a matter-of-fact investigation into the  circumstances of the publication of the daily REPUBLIKA, Kleiman  said.    He added that the present government had embarked upon the  road of confrontation with anyone who was politically  inconvenient for it.    Kleiman, 49, was asked by the then government of Vladimir  Meciar in August 1992 to establish Slovakia's first press  agency. TA SR now has a staff of about 500 and an annual budget  of about 90 million Slovak crowns (over two million USD).    Under Kleiman it started to publish REPUBLIKA, the sole  "pro-  Meciar" national daily, which has run into a debt of about 18.5  million Slovak crowns.    Deputy Premier Roman Kovac said the government had found  out "that legal regulations were breached in the agency on  several occasions."    He cited the law on budgetary rules, the law on public fund  collecting and lotteries, and the Finance Ministry's ordinance  saying that business activities of organisations partially  funded from the state budget must not end at a loss.    Kleiman is mainly reproached for the publication of the  daily  REPUBLIKA, the only national paper supporting the former  premier, Vladimir Meciar, which had a loss of 18 million crowns  (about 545,454 USD) last year.    TA SR's overall deficit was 25 million crowns in spite of a  contribution of 35 million crowns from the state budget.  Moreover, Kleiman agreed in March with the free transfer of  REPUBLIKA to its editor-in-chief even though the paper is worth  10 million crowns according to experts. For the eight days  during which the paper was owned by a private person, its  operation continued to be defrayed by the agency.    Kovac said today the future of REPUBLIKA depended on the new  TA SR secretary general. "The government believes that equal  conditions must be created for all papers in Slovakia. We think  that privatisation is the quickest and best solution."    The Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)  today issued a statement saying that today's decision to dismiss  26 district mayors was "political normalisation reminiscent of  the occupation following (the Soviet-led invasion of  Czechoslovakia in) 1968" and the beginning of political purges.    The HZDS justified its statement by Interior Minister  Ladislav Pittner's words that insufficient guarantees of the  mayors' loyalty to the new government were the main reason for  their dismissal.</p>

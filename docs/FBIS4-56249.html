			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Free Bolivia Movement [MBL] has voiced  support for President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and asked for  solutions to the social problems. The MBL belongs to the  governing coalition. It was represented at Government House  today by Deputies Max Fernandez and Juan del Granado.    Del Granado explained why the MBL had come to Government  House to speak to the president of the Republic. First he  mentioned the MBL's support for the executive branch.    [Begin Del Granado recording] We came to say three things  which, I believe, were welcomed by the constitutional president.  First, we expressed the MBL's support for the president and the  government in view of this very difficult moment; second, we  voiced our deep concern over this obvious difficulty in solving  a conflict that affects and concerns everyone of us; and third,  we expressed the MBL's belief that the government must adopt a  more flexible stance so that, stemming from the president's  social awareness, we may find a solution for Bolivia. [end  recording]    The Solidarity Civic Union, headed by Max Fernandez, which  is  another Nationalist Revolutionary Movement government partner,  voiced its concern through Deputy Jaime Ponce over the social  crisis the country is enduring.    [Begin Ponce recording] I have repeatedly said it is  regrettable that this problem cannot be solved due to the lack  of clear dialogue between the two parties. I believe dialogue  is feasible when the two parties -- the government and the  social sectors -- are willing to negotiate. Violence leads  nowhere. I am very worried about the way in which the Bolivian  democratic stabilization process is developing. Every Bolivian  citizen will be affected if democracy is destabilized because we  would return to the dictatorships or tyrannies that ruled in the  past. I do not want to return to the past. This is why we are  upholding an open dialogue and want the government to explore  the possibilities, within the framework of the national budget,  of solving the workers salary problem.

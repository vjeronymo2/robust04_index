			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: France to open state sell-off with BNP BANQUE Nationale de Paris, one of France's largest banks, will kick off the government's ambitious privatisation programme. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday described the bank as a 'symbol' of the French economy. He said the privatisation would take place within weeks, providing stock market conditions were favourable. The choice of BNP, valued at between FFr35bn and FFr40bn (Dollars 6.9bn), reflects the government's desire to demonstrate confidence in the privatisation programme, which aims to sell 21 publicly-controlled companies to the private sector. 'They wanted to start with a bang,' said Mr David Harrington, head of research at James Capel in Paris. 'It is a signal that they mean business on privatisations.' The government is expected to sell the whole of its 73 per cent stake in the bank as part of its plan to raise at least FFr40bn from privatisations this year. The privatisation of BNP will be followed by the sale of the government's 43.4 per cent stake in Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group. Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and Banque Hervet, a small retail bank, are next on the list. BNP has been preparing itself for privatisation since the appointment in March of Mr Michel Pebereau as chairman. It has increased its provisions for general risks and bad loans, particularly for small and medium-sized companies. These provisions have caused a sharp fall in profits. Results for the first half of this year showed a fall of 60 per cent to FFr522m. However banking analysts in Paris said they represented an attempt to eliminate problems ahead of privatisation. Between now and privatisation, say analysts, BNP will try to secure a hard core of long-term investors. These could include UAP, the insurance group, which already holds about 10 per cent of BNP's shares.</p>

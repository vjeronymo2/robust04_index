			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Rail union to vote over sell-off DELEGATES at the RMT rail union's annual conference yesterday voted unanimously to ballot the union's membership on industrial action over rail privatisation. Talks between the union and British Rail, focusing on pay and conditions, will be held next month. The industrial action ballot is likely to be conducted later in the year if the talks do not satisfy the union, RMT warned.</p>

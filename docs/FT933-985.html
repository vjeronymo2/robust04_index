			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Fashion: Soft, classic bridle wear IF YOUR work-a-day wardrobe is up-to-date and what you need is a little sprucing up on the casual front, then it is worth knowing that Gieves &amp; Hawkes, has produced a good collection of soft and subtle casual wear. Gieves &amp; Hawkes has taken 'The Glory of the Turf' as its theme which has allowed it to indulge fully in a rich panoply of equine imagery of the sort that seems so to appeal to the English - classic riding and hacking jackets, once made in heavyweight 22 oz cloths to keep out the bone-chilling winds, are now reworked in soft lambswool. Overchecks are used in ways that co-ordinate with knitwear and shirts. Suits come in traditional birdseye fabrics or, for a bit of turn-of-the-century panache, Prince of Wales' checks. Colours are rich and autumnal. If, like me, you feel that horses are all very well in their place but you can live without their image on ties and socks and sweaters, then fear not, there are checks and Argyles, Fair Isles and plains. If posh (or would-be posh) countryhouse visiting is on your agenda then these are the sort of clothes you need - just duff them up a bit so they do not look too new or too good. Photographed here is a camel cashmere sports jacket (it also comes in navy) for Pounds 895, worn over a lavender roll-neck sweater in merino wool for Pounds 95 and pure wool dark brown trousers at Pounds 125. The lambswool / angora tartan scarf is Pounds 25. All from Gieves &amp; Hawkes, No. 1 Savile Row, London W1.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UNO MAY RESIGN AFTER PARTY DEFEAT;  </P> <P> JAPAN'S LEADER REPORTED READY TO ASSUME BLAME FOR 1ST NATIONAL LOSS  </P> <P> Japanese Prime Minister Sosuke Uno was reported preparing to announce his  resignation today after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a  humiliating defeat Sunday in an election for the upper house of Parliament.  </P> <P> Women, farmers and shopkeepers defected to the Socialist Party in record  numbers in a tax and scandal revolt, handing the ruling party its first defeat  in a national election since it was formed in 1955.  </P> <P> NHK, the semi-governmental radio and TV network, reported that Uno was planning  to give an unscheduled press conference to announce his intention to resign to  accept responsibility for the defeat.  </P> <P> Uno reportedly informed both his chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro Shiokawa,  and ruling party officials of his intention to step down.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 13 Seats Shy of Majority  </P> <P> From a 17-seat majority in the last election three years ago, the conservatives  plummeted to at least 13 seats shy of a majority in the 252-member House of  Councillors, or upper house, of Parliament.  </P> <P> Socialists, meanwhile, increased their holdings by at least 18 seats in the  upper house, where all bills except the budget and treaties must be approved.  Half the seats were at stake.  </P> <P> With 21 of the 126 races yet to be determined, Socialists had outstripped the  Liberal Democrats 40 to 31.  </P> <P> The results were so overwhelming that only three hours after 65% of Japan's  90.3 million voters finished casting ballots, NHK declared the conservatives  defeated.  </P> <P> In losing its stranglehold on legislation, the ruling party will be forced to  seek a coalition with middle-of-the-road opposition parties or to negotiate  every bill with the opposition parties.  </P> <P> Three ruling party leaders immediately called for Uno's resignation -- also  without waiting for the final vote tally.  </P> <P> Declaring that the outcome had created "the greatest party crisis since its  founding," former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki demanded that responsibility for  the debacle be "made clear." Toshio Komoto, a former deputy prime minister,  also called for an accounting of "responsibility."  </P> <P> Party elder Raizo Matsuno was more direct. "It will be impossible for a prime  minister defeated in an election to continue to carry out politics," he said.  </P> <P> Major factional leaders, however, refused to comment or offered vague support  for Uno to stay in office until the term he inherited from Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita ends Oct. 30.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders immediately called for Uno's resignation and an early  dissolution of the lower house.  </P> <P> Including incumbents not up for reelection, the Liberal Democrats had nailed  down 104 seats, compared to 60 for the Socialists. All opposition forces,  however, had already secured 127 seats -- exactly equal to a simple majority.  </P> <P> No more than 10 additional Liberal Democrats still held hopes of winning seats.  </P> <P> A new pan-opposition alliance organized by the labor federation Rengo (Japan  Private Sector Trade Union Confederation) elected 11 of its 12 candidates. The  new group, analysts said, could form the core of an opposition-led coalition  should the Liberal Democrats lose their majority in a future election for the  lower house, which elects the prime minister.  </P> <P> The result ensured that the ruling party will remain in disarray, with no  effective leadership for an unpredictable period.  </P> <P> Pointing to a 5% real growth expected in this year's gross national product,  however, business leaders expressed confidence that the economy would suffer no  immediate setback.  </P> <P> The Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market, however, opened today with the yen declining  to 143.25 yen to the dollar, 1.10 points below Friday's close.  </P> <P> Some analysts predicted that voters would adopt a more conservative attitude in  any lower house election, where leadership of the government will be at stake.  </P> <P> One TV survey of voters leaving the polls Sunday found that two-thirds of those  who cast ballots for opposition candidates were voting against the Liberal  Democrats, rather than in favor of the opposition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Distrust Among Voters Cited  </P> <P> "We were done in," Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general,  conceded. Hashimoto refused to single out any one issue as the cause of the  landslide defeat. But underlying the debacle, he said, was "the voters'  distrust in politics."  </P> <P> The distrust, pollsters said, stemmed from broken promises to both consumers  and farmers as well as the voters' repulsion to a widespread influence-buying  scandal that tainted all of the ruling party's major factional leaders. That  scandal forced the resignation of Takeshita, but his handpicked successor, Uno,  become embroiled in a new scandal over money-for-sex charges two days after he  took office June 2.  </P> <P> In the 1986 election, the Liberal Democrats promised to keep Japan's  agricultural markets closed to imports and told consumers and shopkeepers that  they would not implement any large-scale indirect tax. But the party last year  bowed to American demands and agreed to lift quotas on beef and citrus fruit  imports by April 1, 1991, and then unilaterally rammed a 3% consumption tax  through Parliament last December. It was implemented April 1.  </P> <P> The farm revolt helped the opposition, as it won all five of the rice-rich  prefectures (states) in Tohoku (northeast Japan) and all four prefectures on  the island of Shikoku, a major mandarin orange-growing region. Three  prefectures on the island of Kyushu, where cattle farmers are prominent, went  to the Socialists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Farmers Wouldn't Listen'  </P> <P> "Although we explained our agricultural policies, the farmers wouldn't listen  to us because of their distrust in politics," the ruling party's Hashimoto  said.  </P> <P> "Voters realized that if Liberal Democrat politics continued (without protest),  their lives would be affected," said Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Socialist  Party, who made her opposition to the consumption tax the centerpiece of her  campaign.  </P> <P> Doi said the party would submit a bill to abolish the tax and said her party  would fight farm imports, as it promised during the 18-day campaign.  </P> <P> Liberal Democratic candidates lost their seats in the only two districts in  which Uno campaigned, including Shiga, Uno's home prefecture and a traditional  conservative stronghold.  </P> <P> The upset winner in Shiga was one of the Rengo labor federation-backed  candidates. Another Rengo winner broke a 33-year Liberal Democrat stranglehold  on a seat in Nara.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Split This Time  </P> <P> Victories by Rengo candidates, who were backed by four opposition parties, in  all 10 of the one-seat districts in which they ran marked a major departure  from past elections. Previously, Liberal Democrats in such constituencies could  count upon the opposition splitting up its vote to ride to victory even with  only a plurality of the ballots. Three years ago, the conservatives won 23 of  the 26 one-seat districts but this time secured only three of them.  </P> <P> For the first time, the unionists put up candidates who were not professional  union leaders but rather lawyers, professors, journalists and women with no  previous experience in politics.  </P> <P> A repetition of that tactic in a lower house election could spell major trouble  for the Liberal Democrats.  </P> <P> Like the established opposition parties, however, Rengo has failed to reach  agreement on major policies that would be necessary to form an opposition-led  coalition should the Liberal Democrats lose their majority in a lower house  election.  </P></p>

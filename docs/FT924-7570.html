			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / People: Fanshawe for Sedgwick; Jackson for Royal Lord Fanshawe (right), formerly Sir Anthony Royle, is to take over as chairman of Sedgwick, the insurance broker, following the departure of David Rowland who is expected to be elected chairman of Lloyd's of London later this month. Lord Fanshawe, now 65, is currently working with Sedgwick's development group and has served on the main board since 1984. He joined Sedgwick Collins in 1948 and worked with the group both on an underwriting box at Lloyd's and as a senior marine broker in the 1950s. Lord Fanshawe was elected MP for Richmond in 1959 and served as a minister in the foreign and commonwealth office from 1970 to 1974 as deputy to Sir Alec Douglas-Home. His other directorships include the Westland Group, TI Group and Rank Xerox. Royal Insurance has appointed Peter Jackson, former managing director of Adidas UK, as its new group general manager for marketing. In supervising marketing operations, he will be part of a team of senior executives, the first time Royal has appointed a marketing manager at head office level. The move follows the appointment of a number of other senior executives at Royal who do not have a background in either the general insurance or life insurance industries. Richard Gamble, the chief executive, joined Royal from British Airways, while finance director Mike Dowdy also comes from outside the insurance industry. Now in his early 50s, Jackson has experience with Mars and Procter &amp; Gamble, as well as Adidas. He says he is keen to gain maximum advantage from Royal's well-known brand name, explaining that the emphasis on marketing at Royal reflects 'the way the business is trending'. One of Jackson's first tasks could be a re-evaluation of how Royal markets its direct motor insurance operation (sales by telephone and mass media advertising), The Insurance Service. Set up in the late 1980s, TIS now underwrites three out of every 10 motor policies sold by Royal, and is making underwriting profits.</p>

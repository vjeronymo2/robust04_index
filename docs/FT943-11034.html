			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Prudential urges law shake-up in pensions Prudential Corporation has launched a campaign to lobby the government for pension law to be simplified. It is urging standardisation, perhaps on a statutory basis, of how to calculate the value of a lump sum which might be transferred from a former employer's pension scheme to a personal plan. It argues also that personal pensions should be simplified to make them more genuinely portable. At the moment, for example, people with personal pensions who then move to jobs where they can join a company scheme are unable to maintain their personal pensions. They are, however, allowed to top up the occupational scheme with free-standing additional voluntary contributions. Although Prudential has considerable influence as the largest pension provider, its image was tarnished recently by the leak of a paper from the life industry's regulator indicating that it was the subject of an informal investigation. Its stance on pension transfers has also been criticised. While there are cases it does not take because they do not make financial sense for the customer, in other circumstances it behaves unlike other life insurers in saying that it can give the customer only information and not advice on whether to take a pension transfer, because the benefits of doing so are not guaranteed. On transfer values, Prudential said the difficulties arose from the scope in existing arrangements for wide variations in the calculations. These differences could prove decisive in the consideration of a pension transfer. At present, actuaries have broad guidelines on how to take account of inflation prospects, discretionary increases in benefits and expected investment returns. Prudential is organising a delegation of industry representatives and MPs to discuss these issues with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in the autumn.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A MOOD of confidence on the outlook for the UK economy took hold yesterday in the derivatives market and led to a squeeze in the futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The first deal in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was struck at 2,934, before a sell order saw it retreat to 2,928 in the first hour of business. That cleared, the contract moved back into positive territory on sporadic buying during the rest of the morning. Increased confidence over the economy and talk of a further cut in UK base rates next week led to strong buying in the afternoon. Such was the demand that a squeeze developed in March and a large buying order from a leading US house was said to have remained unfulfilled. Dealers also reported a sizeable amount of basket trading. March finished at the day's high of 2,973. This was a strong premium to the underlying cash market and around 13 ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 2. Turnover, at 8,919, was reasonable. In traded options, a large trade in computer and electronics group Amstrad, said to have been carried out by Sheppards, made a significant contribution to the day's total volume of 34,282 lots. The total in Amstrad was 12,890, which was followed among the stock options by Barclays, at 1,638 contracts. Some 7,669 lots were transacted in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

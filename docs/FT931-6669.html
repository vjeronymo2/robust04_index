			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Bleasdale clings to the ledge ALAN BLEASDALE'S new play opens spectacularly at the Nottingham Playhouse with a man suspended upside down while he attempts to paint the word 'Anarchy' high up on the outside wall of a block of apartments in Liverpool. In fact, it comes out as 'ANACHRY' and the distortion must be deliberate. Nothing in On the Ledge conforms to a pattern. The start could be black comedy drawn from Orton and Ayckbourn. The end, where Liverpool appears to go up in flames, approaches despair, but still shies away from tragedy. Even the title is cryptic. 'On the Edge' would suggest that people might fall over, jump or be pushed. On the Ledge shows that they just about manage to cling on. According to a long programme note, an earlier draft of the play was called On The Twilight Side of the Mountain. That touch of the inchoate has never quite left it. In moving to a shorter, simpler form, Bleasdale must still have wondered how far to go between desperation and survival. Thus what we get is an odd mix: half throwaway lines that could belong to a stand-up comic, half social commentary. The set, on which the play depends, is dominant. Here is the outside of three floors of what looks like a fairly modern municipal housing development. There are no balconies, but ledges, where most of the action takes place. Sometimes characters appear on the roof. There is also a mechanical hoist which rises from the pit ready to rescue anyone in trouble. If you wanted to go in for symbolism, the hoist represents the Liverpool council finally arriving to prevent the worst. The one character who jumps from the ledge, and the only one who genuinely wants to jack it all in, is saved in this way. Bleasdale, again according to the programme note, had considerable difficulty in writing the piece. He sent one revised text after another to Richard Eyre, the artistic director of the Royal National Theatre, who repeatedly replied, with helpful comments, that it was still not right for production. Meantime, Bleasdale was much acclaimed for the TV serial GBH: changes were made to On the Ledge and Eyre agreed to a joint production between the RNT and the Nottingham Playhouse. Perhaps Eyre was too kind. One can still see why he had his reservations. The play is all over the place. 'Look,' says one character on the roof, 'there are fires everywhere.' 'That's because it's Guy Fawkes night', says another, which apparently it is. Is this a reflection on the Toxteth riots in 1981? Bleasdale seems uncertain of whether he is writing a serious play. The uncertainty extends to the characterisation. Some of the characters have names, like Mal, the social worker with two children by different fathers, and Moey, the man who operates the hoist. Others are simply designated as Upside Down - the one who daubs the dyslexic version of anarchy on the wall  -and Man-on-Ledge, the man who makes the jump. Two others are simply called First and Second Brute. True, they are brutish, but there is no explanation why. Then there is Shaun, who may or may not be a former prominent figure in the Liverpool Council. His character is never developed. There is rather a touching schoolmaster called Martin played by Christopher Ryan, who has coupled with the social worker (Dearbhla Molloy), but again he might just as well be a one-off turn. Man-on-Ledge, played by David Ross, is obsessed by newspaper headlines like the one about a man who stole a British Rail egg sandwich and was therefore thought to be insane. In short, there is no order, no form, only what Upside Down writes as 'ANACHRY'. Possibly this is Bleasdale's message about Liverpool today. The set, which is the best thing about the play, is designed by William Dudley. On the Ledge is directed by Robin Lefevre and moves to Norwich, Glasgow, Bradford and Newcastle before arriving at the National on April 27.</p>

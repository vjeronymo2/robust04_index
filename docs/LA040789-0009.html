			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOARD OKS ESCONDIDO-AREA HALL FOR JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES; APPEAL VOWED  </P> <P> An emotional audience of proponents and opponents packed the small hearing room  Thursday as the county Planning and Environmental Review Board voted 2 to 1 to  approve construction of a 500-seat sanctuary for Jehovah's Witnesses at the  southern edge of Escondido.  </P> <P> Residents of the rural area have fought the project for two years and announced  after the decision that they will appeal the approval of a major-use permit for  the assembly hall, despite concessions made by church officials on use of the  property.  </P> <P> Under conditions of the permit, the 10-acre site is to be used only for  religious purposes, and only on Sundays and two weeknights from 6:30 to 9:15  p.m.  </P> <P> Four Escondido-area Jehovah's Witnesses congregations, which have outgrown  their meeting hall on South Orange Avenue, have been trying to build a new  Kingdom Hall at Bear Valley Parkway and Encino Drive.  </P> <P> The existing building holds people on a site with 35 parking spaces. The  proposed new building will contain two sanctuaries, each able to accommodate  250 people, and will have a 189-space parking lot.  </P> <P> Ken Chernish, spokesman for the Jehovah Witness congregations, said the search  for a new site began five years ago and the religious group had been trying to  obtain county approval for its building since 1987. The Board of Supervisors  denied the church group a permit last year because of the effect the new church  would have on a neighborhood already burdened by traffic and congestion from  another church nearby.  </P> <P> Residents opposing the Witnesses' application maintained that the increased  traffic would make a dangerous intersection at Encino and Bear Valley even  worse.  </P> <P> Videotapes of the traffic passing the site were presented by both sides, each  showing varying amounts of traffic from sparse to congested.  </P> <P> Chernish pledged to coordinate services at the new Jehovah's Witnesses church  with those of the Emmanuel Faith Community Church so that traffic from the two  congregations does not peak at the same time.  </P> <P> However, Chernish protested when review board members set specific hours of use  on the Kingdom Hall site.  </P> <P> "It has come down to the place that we will have a million-dollar building that  we can use for only two hours, one day a week," Chernish said.  </P> <P> Richard Empy, review board member and county plan implementation chief, said  the restrictions are necessary because of the "profound impact to the  residents' quality of life" that the new congregation would have.  </P> <P> The intersection at Bear Valley Parkway and Encino Drive will be widened and  improved by the Jehovah's Witnesses as a condition for receiving approval of  the major-use permit.  </P> <P> Residents said they will appeal the ruling to the county Planning Commission.  The panel's decision may be appealed to the Board of Supervisors.  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Mansfield Brewery advances 12% Mansfield Brewery yesterday fought off the effects of a wet summer and recession to report a 12 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.65m to Pounds 7.47m. Sir David White, chairman, said the group had benefited from tight cost controls and a widening distribution base for its quality brands. Sales for the six months to September 25 fell from Pounds 60.8m to Pounds 60m, with the sharpest fall in volumes of lower margin packaged beers. These declined by 10.7 per cent. While the regional draught beer market was estimated to have fallen by 5.4 per cent in the first half, Mansfield saw comparable sales decline by just 1.8 per cent, Sir David said. There was strong growth in the sales of its own brands, such as Riding Bitter which increased volumes by 7 per cent, and Old Bailey Strong Bitter, up 22 per cent. Mansfield Bitter fell by 2.9 per cent. Operating profits, which rose from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 9.9m, had been held back by discounting. This had been necessary to maintain sales to the free trade, which increased by 2.3 per cent, Sir David said. Mansfield spent Pounds 6.2m to purchase four new outlets and four sites. This had been financed out of cash flow. In spite of this expenditure, Mansfield still managed to reduce its net debt of Pounds 63.2m to Pounds 57.9m, for gearing of 39 per cent. The interim dividend is increased 14 per cent to 1.25p (1p). Earnings were 12 per cent higher at 8.04p against 7.2p.</p>

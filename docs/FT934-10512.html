			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Credit crunch arrives for Spain's munificent seven: Free-spending cities have run out of cash LAST WEEK a third of the Malaga city council's telephone lines were cut off for 24 hours. An extremely irritated Telefonica, the national telecommunications company, had become fed up with city hall's unpaid bills. Now creditor banks of the Costa del Sol resort are becoming fidgety about Malaga's ability to service a total estimated debt of Pta35bn (Pounds 177m). Mr Hilario Lopez Luna, Malaga's deputy mayor and its chief financial officer, yesterday obtained an emergency credit from the central government to meet financial charges totalling Pta700m which the city was unable to pay to a group of domestic and foreign banks, led by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, at the end of last month. He also began negotiations with another team of creditor banks, led by Bex, a unit of the state-controlled Argentaria banking group, to defer payment of Pta725m in debt servicing which is due next month. Malaga, the fifth largest city in Spain with a population of more than 500,000, was forced to default last month in order to meet its October municipal employee wage bill. However, Malaga is by no means the only debt-burdened Spanish city. In all, the country's 8,000 municipalities owe Pta2.400bn, half of it by Spain's seven largest cities. At a three-day convention of the national federation of municipal and provincial councils which opens tomorrow, the mayors of the seven largest cities will lead an attempt to obtain more cash from the central administration, as well as specific help on debt renegotiations. There are at least three components to the financial mess that has engulfed local administration in Spain: the central administration has been erratic over its cash transfers to the municipalities; the cities and towns have been extremely spendthrift; and the financial community has encouraged the cities freely to tap the capital markets. The total deficit of the municipalities is just 7.3 per cent of Spain's overall public debt - 'a mere drop in the ocean' says Mr Henrick Humbolt, the senior bond analyst at Madrid brokers FG - and it has so far had no effect on the domestic debt market. Malaga's difficulties have none the less jolted debtors and creditors alike into concern over city finances. 'The banks are treating the cities as if they were a sovereign risk, but there is legally no guarantee that the central administration will bail them,' says Mr Jaime Mariategui, a senior partner of Madrid financial analysts Research Associates. A recent report issued by Research Associates on the creditworthiness of Spanish cities warned that financial transparency at local government was limited and that the indebtedness of the cities 'is undoubtedly higher than the figures, indicators and ratios would suggest.' The central government, which has seen its own deficit double in the course of this year, is in neither the mood nor the position to mount a rescue operation and it is already cutting transfers to municipalities. The draft 1994 budget, which is before the Madrid parliament, sets aside Pta597bn for the municipal compensation fund, the main source of central government funding to the cities, against the Pta700bn the municipalities had expected. The problem at the city hall level is exacerbated by delays in making the transfers. Malaga's Mr Lopez Luna claims that the central authorities owe the city Pta2.5bn, a sum which would have allowed Malaga to meet the debt servicing charges and also pay off at least part of what is owed to Telefonica and other suppliers. The Madrid government has however every reason to keep the cities on a tight rein. Spending by the municipalities was up 15.4 per cent last year on 1991 with personnel costs increasing by 14.6 per cent and debt servicing charges rising by 22.5 per cent. The cities complain that they are pressed to provide ever improving infrastructures and amenities by increasingly demanding urban dwellers - and mayors who keep balanced books do not get re-elected. The party is now over and the main actors in the local government crisis will have to compromise in order to overcome the financial disarray. The central government will be forced to dig into its pockets, the municipalities will have to restrain spending and the banks will have to arm themselves with patience. Malaga's Mr Lopez Luna insists he has made a start: municipal taxes are going up by 10 per cent.</p>

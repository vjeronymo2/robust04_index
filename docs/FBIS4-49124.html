			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- Shih Ming-the, the newly  elected chairman of the major opposition Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP), said Monday [2 May] that if he is elected president  of the Republic of China [ROC], he will not abruptly announce  Taiwan's independence.    Shih pledged that he would not make Taiwan independent by  means of revolution or violence. "Whatever the DPP does will be  in compliance with the will of Taiwanese people," he said.    The new DPP chairman said he was confident that he would win  a popular vote for ROC president.    Previously, the president was selected by the National  Assembly. But a special session of the assembly that opened  Monday to consider constitutional reforms is expected to mandate  the popular election of president.    Shih, 53, was elected the DPP's sixth chairman during the  party congress Sunday. Shih beat Ms. Yu Chen Yueh-ying by a  vote of 206 to 145. His tenure will be two and a half years.    Shih had served 25 years in Taiwan prisons. He was jailed  for 10 years for participating in an anti-government riot in the  southern city of Kaohsiung in 1979, and was also jailed from  1962 through 1977 for his attempts at organizing the overthrow  of the government.    He has been a devoted advocate of Taiwan independence, a  goal  in direct opposition to the ruling Kuomintang's policy, which  seeks Taiwan's eventual reunification with Mainland China.    The DPP was founded in 1986 in defiance of a decades-old ban  on the establishment of new political parties. The ban was  lifted in 1987 as part of ongoing democratic reforms.</p>

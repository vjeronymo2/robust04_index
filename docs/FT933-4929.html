			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Clinton targets housing: President's Dollars 600m plan will help disaster-hit regions PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled a Dollars 600m (Pounds 397m) scheme to tackle the shortfall in 'affordable' housing, particularly targeting regions hit hard by natural disasters. In a Labour Day address in Miami, the US president said federal agencies would guarantee the financing, which will be provided by a labour pension investment fund. Areas such as Florida, struck by Hurricane Andrew last year, and the flood-swept Midwest will receive a significant proportion of the funding. Mr Clinton stressed private sector-government co-operation and cited, as an example, the housing investment trust fund proposed by the AFL-CIO, the umbrella organisation of most US unions. 'This is the kind of thing we should be doing,' he said. 'The government can guarantee the security of the pension funds, the unions can put up those pension funds to invest in houses, the Labour Department can help provide funds to train people.' The government guarantee agencies - the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation - have been moving into areas abandoned by the budget-squeezed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD, however, has been working with the agencies and labour to employ pension funds for job-creating projects. Announcement of the initiative came shortly after the president vowed to do 'anything I can' to stimulate a US economy plagued by current and future job losses in both private and public sectors. Mr Clinton was responding to a report in the New York Times that his administration was considering short-term stimulative measures similar to those taken by President George Bush in 1992. A Dollars 17bn job-creating package introduced by Mr Clinton early this year was killed by a Republican filibuster in the Senate. According to the Times, administration officials are now considering measures which do not require congressional approval, including delays in tax collection, a speed-up of government spending, and an easing of rules governing the airline industry and bank lending. Mr Clinton's autumn agenda is typically ambitious - healthcare reform, passage of the North America Free Trade Agreement, an anti-crime measure, and Vice-President Al Gore's government restructuring plan, due to be unveiled today. However, the administration's focus on the economy is a recognition that nothing will boost its fortunes so much as a strengthened recovery. The president must reckon with Congress's continuing appetite for budget reduction measures, going beyond the cuts in the Dollars 500bn budget plan narrowly approved last month. Some officials would like to direct stimulative spending towards California, the New York Times said. Unemployment in the state is now 9 per cent, thanks largely to job cuts in defence-related industries. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, has already begun to approve assistance to California, where the president's popularity has been sinking. Late last month he announced Dollars 10.7m in grants for California, the first in a number of planned moves to speed defence re-conversion and revitalise the state's economy.

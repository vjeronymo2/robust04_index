			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe lifted to Pounds 22m BOWTHORPE, the international electronic and electrical components group, yesterday reported a 5 per cent gain in interim profits, buoyed by UK acquisitions and improved sales penetration in the US. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 22.4m in the six months to June 30, on turnover of Pounds 125.6m (Pounds 112.5m). Earnings per share rose by 10 per cent from 7.17p to 7.88p and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.79p (1.7p). The relative weakness of sterling compared to the first half of 1991 contributed a Pounds 200,000 gain on the translation of pre-tax profits and a Pounds 1m increase in reported sales. Group operating profits rose to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 20.2m), offsetting reduced net interest income of Pounds 548,000 (Pounds 1.14m). UK operating profits increased to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 3.9m) with just over half the growth coming from the Edgcumbe Instruments and Penny &amp; Giles International acquisitions. Mr John Westhead, chief executive, said profits from Penny &amp; Giles, the aircraft 'black box' manufacturer acquired for Pounds 30m in May were below expectations in the first half, but the management was 'positive about the long-term prospects.' Operating profits from continental Europe rose to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 8.7m). Improved sales penetration in the US more than offset weaker demand in the defence and medical markets and helped boost operating profits to Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.4m). The contribution from subsidiaries and associated companies in the rest of the world fell to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.2m), mainly because of weak trading conditions in Japan. Although Bowthorpe's results were not audited, the company, like several others, has decided to include more detailed half-year information and a statement from its auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, that the figures have been 'reviewed.' COMMENT Bowthorpe's management is adept at acquiring small niche electronics businesses, integrating them, improving margins and finding synergies in international product and marketing development. One example is the growing market for the various data acquisition equipment produced by Optim Electronics and the recently acquired Odessa Engineering businesses in the US and Penny &amp; Giles in the UK. The strategy has served Bowthorpe well and, given the group's strong cash flow and minimal borrowings, more selective acquisitions are likely. Forecast profits of Pounds 45.3m this year put the shares on a prospective p/e of just over 16 times earnings. This is a steady stock in a recession, but not a bargain at current levels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese State Councillor  Chen Junsheng urged localities this Tuesday [31 May] to make  effective use of their land resources in light of dwindling  arable land and steady population growth.    In a national conference on comprehensive agricultural  development, Chen stressed the importance of agriculture in  coastal provinces.    He warned officials from the coastal areas, "the  consequences  would be dangerous if the secondary and service industries are  developed at the sacrifice of agriculture."    A task of key importance for China is to adopt measures to  make optimal use of land resources so as to ensure the steady  and sustainable supply of farm products, he said.    To do so, he said, local governments should intensify their  efforts in improving the country's 57 million hectares of  low-yield farmland which is a potential food basket.    According to Chen, China has already improved nearly 10  million hectares of low-yield land and reclaimed another 1.1  million hectares of waste land in the five years from 1988 to  1993.    The key to further efforts in this respect lies in the  construction of irrigation projects, extension of fine seeds and  development of new cultivating techniques, he said.    Chen also urged local governments to fortify sandy land to  make it productive. He told the officials present that China  has about 67 million hectares of sandy wasteland. "It would  produce considerable social and ecological benefits if we could  develop just ten percent of this land in ten years," he said.    Meanwhile, he called on local governments to develop tidal  zones and reclaim land by enclosing sea beaches. Chen said  China's coastal provinces have a total of 1.3 million hectares  of tidal flats which can be reclaimed. "Economic results would  be enormous if we could turn half of this area into arable  land," the state councillor added.    In the conference, Chen lauded the efforts by Liaoning, a  major industrial province in China's northeast, to provide ample  food for its people.    According to the state councillor, Liaoning used to rely on  other provinces for supplies of grain and major foodstuffs.  However, the province doesn't have to transport grain from  other provinces anymore as it has boosted its grain output to 15  billion kg since 1990.    The province now boasts of surplus supplies in domestic  poultry, eggs, milk, meat and vegetables. "Liaoning Province has  set us an example to attain coordinated development in the  first, second and third industries for other coastal areas," he  said.</p>

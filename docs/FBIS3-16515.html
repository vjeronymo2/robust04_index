			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 16, BNS -- Chairman of the NATO  Military Committee Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent expects  much from NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, which also  Estonia has joined.    "I'm convinced that Estonia's and other East European  countries' joining the program helps develop international  political and economic relations and safeguards peace and  security in Europe as a whole," Vincent said at a press  conference in Tallinn today.    Commenting on Russia's bid to join the Partnership for Peace  program, Vincent said it "can be regarded in a serious light."    "Some people are worried about NATO's possible cooperation  with Russia and ask if this means a new Yalta agreement. I  don't see it this way. Any nation that observes democratic  principles and abides by the resolutions of international  organizations is eligible for membership in the Partnership for  Peace program," Vincent said. "I'm certain that this cooperation  helps to make Europe a safer place."    Vincent didn't consider it likely that Russia would become a  full member of NATO any time soon. "Joining NATO is not the same  as joining the local tennis club," he said. "A new member will  have to commit itself to certain very definite principles and  rules that all NATO members recognize."    Vincent met yesterday and today with Maj. Gen. Aleksander  Einseln, commander of the Estonian Defense Forces, Defense  Minister Indrek Kannik, members of the parliamentary National  Defense Commission, Foreign Ministry Chancellor Indrek Tarand,  and Norwegian Ambassador to Estonia Brit Lovseth.    The NATO Military Committee chairman told BNS at the press  conference the meetings brought to his attention Estonia's  expectations with regard to the Partnership for Peace program  and gave him a survey of the country's defense forces, of the  plans for the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and the course of  Russian troop withdrawal. Other topics touched upon in the  meetings included the relations between military and civilian  authorities in a democratic society and relevant legislation, as  well as the attitude toward NATO of the Estonian public at large.    Einseln told the press "the field marshal brought good news  to Estonia."    "Our cooperation with NATO has proceeded beyond talks," he  said. "Soon we shall appoint an officer as Estonia's permanent  representative at NATO."    Vincent is the first officer of so high a rank to visit  Estonia.    "My first visit to your country gave me a better  understanding of the changes taking place here," he said. "I  kept myself informed of your struggles even before, also during  World War II. I was five when the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was  concluded and able to understand some things."    Vincent is accompanied by his wife, Jean, and five officers.</p>

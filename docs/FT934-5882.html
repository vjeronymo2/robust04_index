			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: OMI International stages recovery with Pounds 237,000 OMI International, the electro-hydraulics, logistics and electro-optics company, returned to pre-tax profits with Pounds 237,000 in the six months to September 30, against losses of Pounds 2.69m in the comparable period. Turnover fell to Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 20.3m). Forward Industries, acquired five months ago, contributed sales of Pounds 3m but the figures lacked last time's Pounds 3.75m contribution from some design businesses which had been sold. 'I do not anticipate any real change in trading conditions over the second half of this financial year,' said Mr Gil Williams, chairman. The board declared a maintained interim dividend of 0.75p, uncovered by earnings per share of 0.5p (6.1p losses), on the back of results slightly ahead of expectations and as a measure of 'quiet optimism' about prospects. Sales in the logistics services businesses fell due to lower spares support activity, in spite of a 30 per cent increase in newer technology products. Trading profits improved 17 per cent to Pounds 385,000 on sales down at Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 6.45m). The company said the design business was unlikely to make a loss in the second half, but reported operating losses of Pounds 252,000 (Pounds 177,000) this time, on sales down at Pounds 4.58m (Pounds 6.27m). Forward had performed well and the other manufacturing businesses were healthy with profits for the division climbing to Pounds 652,000 (Pounds 504,000) on sales up at Pounds 4.12m (Pounds 3.81m). Interest payable climbed to Pounds 242,000 (Pounds 96,000), including an extra Pounds 100,000 for the loan taken out to cover the Forward acquisition. Net borrowings and finance leases rose to Pounds 6.64m (Pounds 2.59m) giving gearing of 49.6 per cent, with the increase mainly attributable to Forward.</p>

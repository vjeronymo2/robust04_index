			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: New face for Toronto ON January 24 the Art Gallery of Ontario unveiled its new face to the world. A controversial and long drawn-out project of renovation and expansion has finally been completed - minus some trimmings. Costed originally at Dollars 38m, the eventual cost was Dollars 58m. The AGO triumphantly reemerges as one of the ten largest public art museums in North America. To one side, the AGO abuts a thoroughly English early 19th-century brick mansion, The Grange. In the early 1900s, a wealthy widow, Henrietta Goldwin Smith, was prevailed upon to make it over to a group of philanthropists looking for a home for the city's embryo art-collection. The view from the other side of the AGO tells a different story. The main facade on Dundas Street surveys the bustling life of Toronto's Chinatown. Its art gallery straddles two worlds, the city's anglophone, conservative past and its new, fast-changing, polyglot vitality. Behind the glamour of a gala reopening party lie two urgent and related problems: first, making the AGO relevant to a wider public and, second, balancing the books. In July, the AGO closed for seven months and sacked more than half its staff in response to a Dollars 4.3m deficit. The AGO wanted a Dollars 6m increase in its operating grant but the response was only a Dollars 1m increase. An independent task-force set up by Ontario's Minister of Culture recognised the gallery was under-funded, but charged it to raise more money from the private sector. It also criticised the AGO for failing to attract visitors from different cultural backgrounds and for neglecting its obligations towards contemporary Canadian art. Elitist and conservative; it is this perception which Glenn Lowry, AGO's director for the past two years, is acutely aware that must be changed. The old AGO did not beckon invitingly. 'Essentially, it was a big white cement box across a moat, without enough windows', he recalls. But one remarkable coup had put the Toronto museum on the cultural tourist's map: in 1974, it succeeded in 'scooping' London's Tate Gallery when Henry Moore made a huge gift of 101 sculptures, 57 drawings and 105 prints to the city. With curaAlan Wilkinson, Moore worked on the design of an extremely striking gallery, awash with cool natural light. The Henry Moore Sculpture Centre remains the most important and comprehensive collection of Moore's work in any public collection. Now the AGO's exhibition space has more than doubled, with 30 new galleries. The moat is gone. A canopy and cladding for the landmark tower must wait until the AGO has spare cash. Inside, however, there is no impression of scrimping. An austere white and slate-grey entrance hall is flooded with natural light from slits in its dramatic pyramid roof. At once attention is focussed on the heart of the matter; in an alcove at high level, Moore's 'Draped Reclining Figure' surveys all who enter. Upstairs, there stretches a beautifully rhythmic succession of seven double-height galleries with vaulted ceilings. Here Canadian contemporary art has its permanent space. The beaux-arts galleries of European painting and sculpture have been painted in deep colours, red, green, blue and yellow. Sometimes this now-familiar trick works, sometimes not. I was also disconcerted by the low hang of the pictures. This is child-friendly orthodoxy and anyone over 5ft 4ins begins to feel like a giraffe. Perhaps there is a whiff of over-eager historicising? A Kunstkammer, intended to evoke the origins of the idea of museums, is too sparse and far too rational to do anything of the sort. And how strange to wedge Tintoretto's large and wonderfully animated 'Christ Washing the Feet of his Disciples' into this same restricted gallery. Toronto has a well-known collection of Florentine Baroque bronzes, so it would be good to see still more of them in this intimate space. There are many discoveries to make among the historic and modern Canadian collection. The large oils and the vibrant little oil sketches by the Group of Seven, the nationalist movement in landscape painting at the beginning of this century, hang close together. Here, surely, is a source of deep delight and for foreigners, the opportunity to see Canada's most beloved artists, such as Lismer, Varley, Emily Carr, Lawren S. Harris. One thing which strikes the European visitor is the omnipresent acknowledgement of the benefactor. Every room is named for someone. Benefactors were even invited to 'sponsor' the rehang of a picture in return for having their name on a plaque underneath for six months. Fund-raisers, take note. The Joey and Toby Tanenbaum Sculpture Atrium, a spectacular glass lean-to structure, is one of many testimonies to an art-loving Toronto dynasty. After starting in the demolition business, the Tanenbaums have become major art-collectors. They have been advised by the AGO, to which they have been major benefactors - a typically north American relationship which is unfamiliar the Britain. At the AGO's opening, the announcement was made of a further Dollars 4m gift from the family. It is impossible here to give an account of the strengths and high points of the AGO's collection, except to say that they are numerous and include fine paintings by Bernard Van Orley, Le Sueur, Frans Hals, Poussin, Delacroix, Augustus John, Matisse, and Picasso. It took a long time and cost a lot of money, but the result is that Toronto now has an art-gallery which does the city credit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Robert Leicht: "Difficult Visit"] </F>   [Text] The world is commemorating the victims of the war  against Nazism and fascism, while Italy's first neofascist  postwar government appears on the diplomatic stage. The U.S.  President was the first foreign visitor, and Bonn will be the  first destination -- Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has  entered the foreign-political scene.    Bill Clinton praised Berlusconi's cabinet last week for its  "diligence," as a French newspaper wrote. He said he was deeply  impressed by the new government's democratic commitment;  however, the people had to be judged by their deeds. What  attitude will or should Chancellor Helmut Kohl show when  Berlusconi comes to Bonn next week -- shortly after the member  states of the European Union [EU], which was founded against the  furies of the past, have elected their new parliament? Should  he drown any reservations by giving him confidence in advance,  or should he show a certain critical distance?    Bonn does not seem to be happy about the privilege of the  first visit from Rome. The Germans with their dual past are  certainly in a doubly difficult situation regarding their former  partner of the Axis in accursed times. They should not come  under suspicion of fraternizing with the fascists, nor should  they try to play a patronizing role, for which they are not  qualified anyway. Other Europeans have already raised their  voices. President Francois Mitterrand said warningly:  "Careful, danger!" EU Commission President Jacques Delors  called for "concerned vigilance." The European Parliament  reminded the Italian president of the basic values, which "after  the atrocities of fascism and Nazism marked the founding of the  European Community."    We have indeed every reason to be vigilant if a neofascist  European candidate in Italy talks about "concentration camps" to  be set up for homosexuals; if the chairman of the parliamentary  foreign affairs committee says that border treaties with  neighbors should be revised; if Gianfranco Fini, the chairman of  the extreme right-wing Alleanza Nazionale, one of the three  coalition parties, calls the dictator Mussolini the greatest  statesman of all times, at least of this century.    Should we look away, or should we interfere? The EU is more  than a loose club of sovereign states -- it sees itself as a  community sharing equal values and has bound itself to respect  certain human and basic rights. Whenever this human peace code  is undermined, interference is necessary. The new democracies  in East Europe come from dictatorships, are seeking to join the  European Community, and -- with or without postcommunists -- may  not have reached the goal in every respect, but the tendency is  right. Italy is one of the founding members of the European  Community, but if postfascists and ultrarightists assume power,  the tendency is not right anymore; there are five [fascist]  ministers in Rome and watchdogs in all the other ministries.    Bonn should also take Rome at its word now -- regarding its  democratic oath and its dangerous talk. The contradiction  between both worlds must be cleared once and for all. Trying to  win voters by means of extremist slogans at home, and making  solemn democratic statements during visits to European capitals  -- the Italian Government cannot expect its European partners to  accept such a double game.    However, in this policy of delimitation, the Europeans must  do a real precision job. After all, they do not dissociate  themselves from the Italians, but from the neofascists and their  political activities. Only 1 percent of the Italians have  publicly adopted the heritage of Mussolini; however, 13.5  percent of them voted for the extreme right-wing camp. But  compared with these figures, neither the French nor the Germans  have any reason to look down their noses.    If history were an efficient teacher, there should be no  ultrarightists anywhere in Europe. But meanwhile, all Europeans  must clearly define the necessary democratic lines, above all,  at their own front door. Berlusconi assumed great  responsibility when he blurred these lines in the interests of  power. Helmut Kohl must remind him of his responsibility.</p>

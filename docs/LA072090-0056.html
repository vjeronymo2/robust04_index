			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE IS SUED OVER DEATH  </P> <P> The mother of a psychiatric patient whom police killed near his home has filed  a wrongful-death complaint against the city of Hawthorne.  </P> <P> The complaint alleges that police used "unreasonable, unnecessary and deadly  force" against Terence Williams, 20, who was shot five times and died in a July  1 confrontation in which two officers suffered facial injuries.  </P> <P> Williams was unarmed.  </P> <P> The shooting is being investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department, which handles homicide cases for the Hawthorne police. The names of  the officers involved have not been released.  </P> <P> Williams, who suffered from schizophrenia, had escaped from Harbor-UCLA Medical  Center a few hours before his death, allegedly after he assaulted a guard  there. Williams had entered the hospital earlier in the day for a 72-hour  evaluation.  </P> <P> The complaint, which seeks no specific amount in damages, was filed on behalf  of Williams' mother, Loretta Brown, 44.  </P> <P> It alleges that the city of Hawthorne as the officers' employer, "knew or  should have known" that the officers involved in the confrontation "had  propensities for violence and for abusing their authority."  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A fashionable way with fish - Cookery Sizzling roast joints of beef, lamb or pork used to be synonymous with Sunday lunch. No longer. The word 'roast' has been hijacked. Trendy menu-writers have discovered its power. Nothing, it seems, can start salivation faster this summer. Pan-fried and char-grilled are passe. Roasts are in. The hottest menus are peppered liberally with roast and roasted foods, the terms sometimes being applied to just about anything cooked in the oven. Baked tomatoes have become roasted tomatoes, although the cooking method has not changed one jot. Aubergines, red peppers, fennel, garlic and courgettes are other likely candidates for this treatment in fashionable restaurants, where you may be offered roasted red pepper soup, slow roast tomatoes, and roast figs with honey and almonds. But the choicest dish of the lot, the dish of summer 1994, must be roast fish. Basically, roasting achieves the same searing effect on fish as grilling or frying, but with fewer anti-social side effects. There is less danger of the fish catching and burning as it cooks, so you do not have to watch it closely. And most of the cooking smells are trapped within the walls of the oven instead of the cook's clothes and hair. Whole fish - such as sea bass, sea bream, snapper or grey mullet weighing 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 lb - are a popular choice while a middle cut of cod of around the same weight is acceptable, too. For those who like everything to come ready-portioned, fillets and steaks of turbot, brill, halibut and cod are all suitable. Whatever you choose, one crucial clue to success is using high heat. If the temperature is low, the fish will not be sealed and seared without and cooked juicily within, as it should be. Instead, juices will ooze out and the fish will stew in them, quite possibly leaving the flesh dull and tasteless. So make sure you heat the oven thoroughly in advance - the hotter, the better. How long will fish take to cook? Thickness is as important as weight. As a general rule, allow 15 minutes an inch at the thickest part - but check by testing. Cut down on to the backbone at the thickest part: the fish is ready when the flesh has turned white right through. If the fish is ready before you are, let it rest in the plate-warmer. Whole fish are protected against drying out during cooking by their mackintosh skins, and the skin can be a choice titbit if roasted crisply. Placing the fish on a rack or a bed of vegetables raises it in the roasting pan and allows the heat to circulate more freely - which is all the better to crisp up the skin. A fan-assisted oven might also be of some help. Be sure the skin is dried thoroughly after rinsing and before cooking. Then, brush it with a thin film of oil or melted butter and sprinkle it with sea salt and a good sanding of freshly-ground black pepper. If, in spite of all this attention to detail, the skin does not roast as crisply as you would wish, baste the fish again just before serving (with butter or oil, or paint it with lemon juice or a light sugar syrup and a splash of soy sauce) and flash it briefly under a very hot grill for a sizzling finish. Some cooks like to slash whole fish with two or three oblique cuts down each side before cooking. This speeds the process but encourages some loss of moisture, although the wounds can be staunched (partially, at least) by stuffing them with slices of lemon or slivers of herb or spice-flavoured butter. On balance, however, I think it better to leave the skin unscathed and to save such extra flavourings for stuffing into the belly or to use for saucing when serving. Fish fillets and steaks, lacking the all-enveloping protection of skin, need more careful treatment. Dust them with a modicum of flour to check they are thoroughly dry, and lay them in a shallow roasting pan or baking tin that is robust enough not to buckle when subjected to high heat. The tin should be brushed lightly with butter or oil and the pieces of fish placed well apart. If jam-packed, the heat will be unable to circulate properly and the fish risks stewing. The simplest - and, in a way, the most sophisticated - recipes call for topping the fish with just a dusting of flour and a drizzle of oil or melted butter, and for turning it at half-time (but with great care, to avoid breaking the crust). Such plainly-roasted fish steaks or fillets can be served just as they are, pure and simple, or partnered with a splendidly showy sauce. More often (and this is easier to get right), the pieces of fish are cloaked with buttery or olive oil-soaked bread crumbs flavoured with a few herbs or spices. By the time the fish is just cooked and still moist in the centre, the crumbs should have dried out to an appetising golden crust. If necessary, a quick flash under a very hot grill will ensure a crisp finish.</p>

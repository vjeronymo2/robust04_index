"Protection of the environment will be the driving force for  the growth of the European Union [EU]," he said in a lecture  delivered at the Catalan Employers for Europe organization,  where he was introduced by its chairman, Carles Gasoliba, before  a very large audience comprising representatives of the  administration and industrialists.    During his address, Paleokrassas, a conservative Greek  politician who was twice a minister in his country, outlined the  main aspects of the EU's new environmental policy. He said that  it seeks to banish the idea of industrial production based on  the depletion of natural resources and to replace it with a  principle aimed at protecting and safeguarding this natural  heritage for future generations. He also stressed that  protection of the environment should not be just a policy in  itself but should be a precondition for industrial expansion.    "The new course in environmental policy (the European  Commission's white paper) is that economic and fiscal means  should be used, instead of the old methods of legislation and  controls," because, among other reasons, "it has been seen that  this is not effective," Paleokrassas told this newspaper. To  this effect, the commissioner believes that the cost of products  should include the environmental cost stemming from the natural  resources which they deplete, the pollution which they produce,  or the waste which they create.    Within this same strategy, he supports the European  Commission's decision to impose ecological taxes in order to  increase the cost of using energy sources which cause carbon  dioxide emissions, as a way to alleviate the greenhouse effect.  He said that unless this method is used, the volume of carbon  dioxide emissions would not be stabilized at the 1990 levels,  which the EU had set itself as an overall target. "If the  carbon dioxide tax is not adopted, studies show us that it would  exceed the 1990 levels by 3 percent in the year 2000," he warned.    He also supports Jacques Delors' proposal for "waging a  crusade" to extend this ecological tax to the whole world. "The  greatest danger is of these emissions increasing in the rest of  the world, where there is no control," he added.    He refuted the idea that the economic crisis subordinates  environmental concerns: "In Europe, measures in the  environmental field will create at least 2.5 million jobs over  the next five years, and other studies show that this figure  could rise to 5 million," he stated.    Paleokrassas deemed generally "insufficient" the programs  drawn up by the various countries in order to fulfill the  commitments which they undertook at the Earth Summit (1992) in  signing the climate change treaty, and claimed that only Europe  has drawn up plans to combat the effects of a possible climatic  change.    On the implementation of EU directives, he said that Spain  in  general carries out those concerning the protection of birds,  "but the degree of fulfillment is not as satisfactory in the  case of public works and conducting environmental impact  studies. Spain is in an intermediate position; it is not among  the worst," he concluded.</p>

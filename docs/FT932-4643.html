			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Shephard gets warm welcome from her new flock - Britain's first female agriculture minister brings a fund of goodwill to a difficult job INVITED TO comment on the appointment of Mrs Gillian Shephard as Britain's minister of agriculture in the recent cabinet reshuffle the chairman of the Norfolk branch of the National Farmers' Union replied: 'It's the second good thing that's happened - the first was the rain and the second was Mrs Shephard's appointment.' Well, the soil had become very dry towards the end of May and Mr Charles Wharton, who made that comment, is a hard-headed commercial farmer as well as holding the NFU office. He knew the rain would be good for his income and he clearly hoped Mrs Shephard would be too - but with her he could only hope. A native of Norfolk as well as representing a constituency in the south-west of the county, Mrs Shephard told that story against herself at the weekend during the first policy speech of her administration - once again in Norfolk. Her audience of farmers shared her amusement at the practical response of one of their neighbours. But they also seemed happy to give the new minister the benefit of the doubt, for the time being at least. For Gillian Shephard has a good record among farmers in Norfolk. Before she became an MP in 1987 she had been an active and effective county councillor. During her meteoric rise to cabinet level, culminating in her last job as secretary of state for employment, she also found time to pursue farming issues in her constituency. Notable were her successes in persuading plant health authorities, in what is now her own ministry, to modify punitive regulations relating to the sugar beet disease rhizomania and her advocacy of the case for fairer treatment of irrigating farmers during the drought and water shortage two years ago. Farmers from her constituency say that she has listened to and, perhaps more to the point, understood their problems. Her family background as the daughter of a Norfolk smallholder and cattle dealer will continue to stand her in good stead as she battles with the complexities of the European Community's common agricultural policy and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over the years to come. Indeed she says she relishes the task and now has the political post she always wanted. In her speech last Friday evening she dropped a few hints about her approach to the job. She would, for instance, review the case for the winding up of the Potato Marketing Board. Previously, following rulings from Brussels, this was thought to be a certainty with only the timing in question. But Mrs Shephard apparently remains to be convinced that the functions of the Board should be sacrificed on the altar of the EC Commission and says she will look at it before making her decision. Moreover one of the main planks of her approach to the EC, she said, would be to ensure UK agriculture benefits from European policies and does not suffer discrimination in comparison with other member states. British farmers will be pleased with that assurance. They have heard many stories of farmers in other EC countries gaining unfair advantage. Whether these are all true or not, they believe UK farmers' and traders' relatively unblemished reputation for straight dealing has been tarnished by allegations of fraud against the Common Agricultural Policy. Recent stories concerning the illegal sale of intervention store wheat, said to have been taking place in Italy, are just the latest in a long line of such misdemeanours in other countries. That said, UK farmers would resent the imposition of yet more red tape and regulations to avoid such problems. Indeed there is a good case for reducing those already affecting the industry. More than a year ago Mrs Shephard's predecessor, Mr John Gummer, admitted as much to an audience of farmers and said he would try to eliminate some of them. Perhaps significantly, that was just before the last general election. In the meantime little appears to have been done to honour that pledge except that a few weeks ago Mr Nicholas Soames, one of Mr Gummer's and now Mrs Shephard's ministerial colleagues at the ministry of agriculture, repeated that 'regulation must not inhibit enterprise'. Mrs Shephard, the first woman in the post, also thinks there are too many regulations and will be looking at the list to see what can be done. But, she adds, we must be careful to ensure that food health standards are maintained. There should, she says, be less secrecy and more openness regarding any food problems. That way minor difficulties should not become major crises. All of which ties in with the new minister's concern for the image of agriculture. She believes, she says, that success in her new job is vital, not only to farmers but to the rural ethos and the economy as a whole. The food trade gap, she concedes, has been increasing in recent years as retailers have sourced more of their produce abroad. This is a trend that must be halted and reversed. Moreover, the future of the Food From Britain promotional agency, which has been under review for several months, is one of many matters in her pending tray. Rumour has it that the recommendation will be that FFB should concentrate its limited resources on exporting food and leave the home market to look after itself. I for one do not believe that that would be appropriate. Import substitution must be of as much importance to British agriculture and the British economy as exports. What is needed is a brave new initiative to promote home-grown food to British consumers. But what British farmers seek more than anything else is a long-term approach. They feel that for too long government and EC agricultural policies have been lurching from crisis to crisis. They yearn for vision and leadership of the kind not seen since Labour's Tom Williams was agriculture minister in the post-war government. They know the priorities are different now but they would support any minister who could provide positive signposts to the future. So, is Gillian Shephard that minister? There are those in her Norfolk South West constituency who believe that she is. Perhaps they are forgetting the fact that the whole system of farming politics, controlled as much of it is by Brussels, is more complicated now than in the days of food shortages. Perhaps they are unaware of the limitations imposed on even a skilled and prominent member of the cabinet. Eight days into her new job she was saying all the right things and, like many other Norfolk farmers, I wish her well. But, as she doubtless understands, her honeymoon period will only last as long as her policies are approved of by a farming community that has generations of collective experience in complaining.</p>

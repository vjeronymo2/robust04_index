			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Conceptual posturings in Venice - William Packer finds the best pavilions avoiding the Biennale's guidelines THE THEME of Achille Bonito Oliva's first Venice Biennale as director is, The Cardinal Points of Art - with critical judgment and enthusiasm cast alike to the four winds. An open and generous eclecticism, of course, would be unexceptionable in these post-modernist times, were it only matched by any sense of critical discrimination and responsibility. As it is, anything goes, just so long as it conforms to the interests of the current academic avant-garde. Installation, sound and video, conceptual posturings, the striking of social and political attitudes, are in: anything founded in the direct perceptual experience of the real and visible world is on the margin. So much for openness and pluralism. Oliva glosses his title as reflecting the 'cultural nomadism . . . the internationalism and interdisciplinarity'. But El Greco and Tiepolo in Madrid, Holbein and Rubens in London, Poussin in Rome, Picasso in Paris, Turner everywhere - this nomadism is hardly new. Art has always been international and trans-cultural. Nationalism may now be the bogey-word, but yet the national pavilions of the Biennale itself have long been by their very nationalism important agents in that exchange. 'Given the present historical moment of fragmentation and division, bordering on tribal warfare, they (the Biennale's guidelines) represent the only political response that culture can offer . . . ' Ah: politics, not Art, are to be justification and excuse. As usual many of the countries with permanent pavilions evade the issue, and in spite of all the nonsense, there are good things, even good installations to be found. Along with the Korean, Nam June Paik and his video-circus, Germany are showing their own Hans Haacke. He has taken a pneumatic drill to the pavilion's marble floor, heaving and cracking the slabs into a tumbled, treacherous surface, the pieces clattering and echoing as the visitor gingerly makes his way across. Outside, the imposing fascist facade is untouched but for a large image of Hitler and Mussolini at the Biennale of 1934 in the entrance, and a huge 1990 Deutschmark above the door. Political thoughts apart - and Haacke has the grace to allow us to think our own - it is a most arresting mise en scene. Even more theatrical, with a beginning, a middle and an end, is the installation by the Russian, Ilja Kabakov, in the Russian Pavilion. In we go behind a high paling fence and up into the pavilion itself into what might be a long-abandoned work-shop, strewn with rubbish. Out through the back door and we find in the garden below us a red kiosk-Kremlin with its windows blank and the martial music of old Communism blaring from hidden speakers. More direct than the Haacke, it is even so an ambiguous and oddly touching piece. Elsewhere I liked the simple, architectonic sculpture of Christina Iglesias in the Spanish Pavilion - shared with an unusually flatulent piece by Tapies  -Damian's rocket-like Column on its raising-trestle in the Romanian Pavilion; the meticulously-carved surrealism of the French-born Louise Bourgeois in the American Pavilion; and the no less meticulous linear abstraction of Jorn Larsen in the Danish Pavilion. The Swiss sculptor, Christoph Rutimann, has taken over the church of San Stae on the Grand Canal beyond the Rialto, tilting the floor up and at an angle to mask the chancel and the altar, an effective dislocation of the interior space though irritating to anyone who wants to see the paintings. In the group from the African States, Quattara, an artist from the Ivory Coast now based in New York, is outstanding, with three mixed-media panels of rich texture and ambiguous reference. And as remarkable as anything is Artival Geva's huge working greenhouse and artificial farm that the Israelis have installed at the very heart of the gardens, dripping with water beneath the trees. Aperto, the selective international survey of younger artists in the old rope-shop of the Arsenale, is subtitled 'Emergency', though the emergency can only be its own. To walk through this farrago of self-indulgence masquerading a creativity is a deeply dispiriting experience. Here is a whole generation that has been led to believe that simply to have an idea, any idea, is enough, and if it has a fashionable correctness so much the better - anti-war, anti-capitalist, anti-male - you name it. But even received and conventional ideas can produce great art, of which truth the richness of Christian art is but one example, though wonderfully appropriate in Venice. The problem lies not with the ideas themselves so much as with the heresy that their mere statement or indication is enough, and any further realisation a tedious irrelevance. There is no art without form, and the particular form matters very much. Technology is not technique. A cow pickled in a tank of formaldehyde is, well, a pickled cow. Painting and sculpture are testing disciplines, but so are dancing and performing, writing music and making use of language. Composer and audience are not grateful to inept musicians, the reader no friend to the illiterate author. Which brings us back to the British Pavilion, in which Richard Hamilton, that guru of mind over matter and the technological sidestep when painting and drawing get difficult, as for him they so often do, is our current champion. Beautifully installed by the British Council, his work parades to the world the complexities of Northern Ireland, of Tory Britain and even of the Gulf War, with numb-minded simplicity. Quite whose, here, is the trahison des clercs is for you to judge. Needless to say, Hamilton, with Tapies, has been awarded the Biennale's Leone d'Oro. The Venice Biennale: in the Giardini di Castello, the Corderie dell'Arsenale and at other sites across the City, until October 10: sponsored by Swatch SMH Italia, Longines, and Il Mattino.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Russia's debt accords lapse: Western governments and banks must await events Russia's debt rescheduling arrangements with western governments lapse today amid confusion over Russian reform intentions. In April, the Paris Club of creditor governments rescheduled over 10 years more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn) of the Dollars 20bn in capital and interest due in 1993. But no arrangements have been made to reschedule some Dollars 16bn due in 1994 as well as additional arrears on payments which should have been made last year after the rescheduling. The April agreement was also conditional on Russia concluding a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund by October - another condition which has not been met, and is unlikely to be met in the near future. Both the debt and the standby issue are likely to remain in limbo at least until a new Russian government and central bank chairman are confirmed next month following the reformists' defeat in the parliamentary elections. Western governments, anxious to support reforms but keen for clues on how President Boris Yeltsin intends to proceed, have little choice but to wait upon Russia's next move. Separate talks on rescheduling Dollars 25bn owed to western commercial banks have failed to produce any long-term rescheduling, leading instead to a series of 90-day rollovers. The latest of those postponements also expired today, but was in recent days replaced by a new rollover expiring on March 31, 1994. 'We received a communication from Russia asking us to roll over (the debt) which we did because having no agreement in place would allow individual banks to proceed to attach assets,' said one western banker. Some trading firms have taken action to freeze Russian assets but this has not been emulated by banks, which hope a united front will help recover loans in future. They have all but stopped lending to Russia since 1991, when Moscow began defaulting on debts incurred by the former Soviet Union. A tentative deal, whereby Russia would start repaying commercial banks in the final quarter of 1993, fell through after Moscow rejected a crucial condition set by western bankers for a long-term rescheduling of the Dollars 26bn owed to them. This condition required the state, rather than government, to guarantee the agreement - thereby enabling banks to claim state assets if the rescheduling was not respected. Some reformers have suggested a partial debt write-off such as that won by Poland when it began radical market reforms. But this has been rejected by Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, who has sole charge of debt negotiations, and by western governments and bankers who say Russia is rich enough to pay its debts. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist victor of recent parliamentary elections has advocated stopping all debt payments - like Hitler, who unilaterally cancelled German debt repayments in 1934, and Lenin, who disavowed all Tsarist debts after the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia. Laurie Morse adds from Chicago: The US State Department said yesterday it had received a final payment of Dollars 147.4m from Russia to cover defaults on US-backed grain loans and that payments were now up to date. However, Russia, which had been in default since November 1992, must continue to maintain payments due for 1994 and it is not clear if the country will soon become eligible for new US credits.</p>

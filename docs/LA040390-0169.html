			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NAZI SUSPECT TO BE SENT TO BONN  </P> <P> Suspected Nazi war criminal Joseph Schwammberger, wanted for killing and  deporting thousands of Jews during World War II, will be extradited from  Argentina next month, the Justice Ministry said today.  </P> <P> The agreement between Bonn and Buenos Aires to bring back the 78-year-old  Schwammberger to face trial climaxes 17 years of delicate diplomatic  negotiations since the two countries do not have an extradition agreement.  </P> <P> "The Schwammberger case shows that no one under suspicion of Nazi crimes can be  certain of escaping justice . . . wherever in the world he may hide," said West  German Justice Minister Hans Engelhard in a statement.  </P> <P> Schwammberger, arrested by Argentine police in 1987, will be handed over to  West German officials May 2. He is accused of killing up to 1,000 people --  some of them personally.  </P></p>

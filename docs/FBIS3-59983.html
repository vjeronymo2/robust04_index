Thus, he ordered 1st Lieutenant Anan Pananon, the  deputy director-general for narcotics suppression, to formulate  a plan and arrest the traffickers. At 0200 hours, officials from  the Narcotics Control Division, Customs Department, led by Mr.  Chawalit Setthamethikun, the division director, searched and  arrested Mr. Onomo Simaregina, age 35, an Ethiopian, who was  carrying a Cameroon passport, No 154685; Mr. Mamud, age 33, an  Ethiopian, who was carrying a Niger passport, No 112207/92; and  Mr. Bar Alfa, age 33, an Ethiopian, who was carrying a Sierra  Leone passport, No O-159778.    When the officials searched the three suspects, they found  one marine-colored suitcase containing 10 bricks of heroin that  had been wrapped in clear plastic bound with wrapping tape. This  heroin weighed approximately 3.6 kg. They also found a black  suitcase containing approximately seven kg of heroin.  Altogether, officials seized approximately 17.2 kg [as  published] of heroin. This heroin had a domestic value of 3.4  million baht. Abroad, it would have been worth 340 million baht.  The suspects were arrested in the outbound passenger lounge at  Don Muang Airport.    During the interrogation, the three suspects said that they  were planning to travel from Bangkok to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,  with their final destination being Lagos, Nigeria. They were  booked on Ethiopian Airlines flight No ET-661. In Ethiopia, they  sold clothes and writing materials. They couldn't earn enough  from that and so they agreed to work as heroin couriers, because  they could earn much more money much faster. The officials  turned the suspects and evidence over to investigators at the  Police Narcotics Control Bureau.</p>

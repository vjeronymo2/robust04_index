			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Homes Assured directors jailed TWO FORMER directors of Homes Assured, the mortgage broker which collapsed in 1989 owing creditors Pounds 10.7m, were imprisoned yesterday following their convictions at Southwark Crown Court in August for fraudulent trading. Mr Anthony Dobson, the founder of the company set up to provide mortgages for council tenants buying their homes under the right-to-buy legislation, was jailed for a total of 5 1/2 years, and Mr Keith Woodward, its former finance director, for 4 1/2 years. Mr Dobson was sentenced to four years on the fraudulent trading charge and an additional 18 months on two charges of procuring the execution of a security by deception. Mr Woodward received three years for fraudulent trading and 18 months for furnishing false information. Both men were also disqualified from acting as company directors for 10 years. However, the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecutions, decided against a re-trial of Mr Michael Robinson, the former Homes Assured managing director also charged with fraudulent trading. The jury was unable to agree a verdict against him and he was formally acquitted. Judge John Rogers QC said Homes Assured had started out as an honest business, but both men had ignored warnings that it was losing money, and had continued trading.</p>

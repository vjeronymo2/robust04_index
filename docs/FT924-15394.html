			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / European Parliament moves to regulate lobbyists THE European Parliament has taken its first step towards regulating the growing legion of lobbyists which pursues it. The Parliament's procedural committee adopted a report on Friday which should provide the basis of a new system to control Brussels-based consultants. The result - after a parliamentary procedure which could take months or even years - will be a register of lobbyists, formally accredited and governed by a code of conduct. A penalty system could be introduced to deter breaches of the code. MEPs will not escape: under the proposals agreed last week, the current rolling system of declaring interests would be replaced by a formal register for MEPs and their assistants, renewed annually. The Parliament has still not decided whether it loves or hates lobbyists. Friday's meeting nearly descended into chaos when deputies voted first one way and then the other on whether to expel lobbyists from the committee room. On the one hand, the existence of an active network of Washington-style lobbyists lends credibility to the deliberations of the parliament and helps inform the legislative process. On the other, consultants stand accused of stealing documents, 'buying' client-inspired amendments, or simply harassing MEPs. An established Brussels consultancy described Parliament's handling of the issue as 'shambolic', but many believe the report is a step in the right direction, in that it should clarify their position. But many questions remain, most notably whether a narrow definition of lobbyists will discriminate against in-house advisers working for companies or charities. They would not have to register, but neither would they receive official accreditation. With the Maastricht treaty in the balance, there is also one darker question being muttered in lobbyist circles. By the time the code of conduct is a reality, will the European Parliament - which of all EC institutions would lose most if the treaty were abandoned - still be worth lobbying?

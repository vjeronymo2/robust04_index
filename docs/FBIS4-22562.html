			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Letter sent by staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG </F> to Ukrainian Foreign Minister A.M. Zlenko: "We Are Not To Be  Frightened by a Paternalistic Attitude"]    [Text] From the editors: A copy of the letter which  staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG sent to the  Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been sent to MOLOD  UKRAYINY. We are printing it here below with some minor  abridgements.    Dear Anatoliy Maksymovych!    As staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG, we turn to  you in connection with the situation which has  evolved--unfortunately--at this embassy. Each of us has worked  in the embassy for various periods of time, but all of us have  reached one and the same conclusion: Work at this embassy does  not measure up to the demands of our times; genuine  opportunities for organizing assistance to Ukraine are not being  taken advantage of and--in many instances--are being blocked.  Our state is thereby caused political, economic, and moral  damage or harm.    All this is taking place through the lack of knowledge or  desire on the part of Ambassador I.M. Piskovyy to organize the  embassy's work in the proper way. It is also caused by his  consciously creating an unhealthy moral and psychological  climate within the collective, as well as by his ignoring  presidential edicts and orders issued by the Ukrainian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs.    To this very day the collective has been working under  absolutely abnormal conditions, remaining under constant  surveillance by the special services involved. At the same time  repairs on the building acquired by the embassy are being  unjustifiably delayed and are being done in an inappropriate  manner.    With regard to the ambassador himself, there is a lack of  the  proper political ideas or any desire to protect and defend  Ukraine's interests at the higher levels of the German  government and state. He also lacks an aggressive quality and  initiative in political work. This was attested to, for example,  by his reaction to the resolution by the RF [Russian Federation]  Supreme Soviet on Sevastopol. The tragic subject of the famine  in Ukraine during the years 1932-1933 was not utilized in any  way for attracting the attention of political and civic circles  in the FRG to Ukraine, even though there were all sorts of  opportunities to do this. The ambassador also openly shuns  contacts with the Ukrainian community in the FRG. And the  representatives of that community have already begun manifesting  a dissatisfaction with such an attitude on his part.    The "tempestuous" economic activity under the ambassador's  direct guidance boils down to mending connections with small  firms or creating very favorable conditions for those German  firms in which he has a personal interest. A blatant example of  this is the "Stalmann" Concern. The ambassador himself actively  intervened in this matter and insistently demanded that K.  Stalmann be appointed an honorary Ukrainian consul.    At this same time the embassy failed to provide any  initiative for preparing or carrying out any large-scale  economic project, either in the field of finance or that of  production.    Moreover, we have in our possession here genuine documents  attesting that the ambassador intentionally undermined or  unjustifiably delayed the examination of matters which were--and  are--of extreme economic as well as political importance for  Ukraine. What we are talking about in particular here is the  delivery to Ukraine under very favorable conditions of a  considerable quantity of oil with a deferment of payment for  several years. Also involved is a matter of utilizing  progressive technologies in machine building, etc.--a matter  which could be used as a weighty argument in our relations with  Russia.    Nor can we neglect to mention such items as the following.  By  the ambassador's efforts to have the staffers of the Ukrainian  Embassy insured by the German "Gothauer" Insurance Company, they  were introduced to Mr. Yu. Kvitsinskiy (a citizen of Russia).  During the Soviet period these people openly regarded Ukraine  with scorn and a lack of respect. For four months the  Kvitsinskiy family received medical benefits amounting to almost  50,000 German marks. The insurance company has accused the  Ukrainian Embassy of forgery and is demanding that we pay back  the above-mentioned sum, warning that--otherwise--the insurance  policy will be cancelled.    We persistently endeavored (and on more than one occasion)  to  call upon the ambassador to organize the work in the proper  manner, sincerely believing in his decency and honor. Several  meetings of the collective took place. But in response to all of  us (each one in a separate interview) the ambassador began to  threaten to send us home to Ukraine officially.    We are not to be frightened by a paternalistic  attitude!    In response to Ambassador I.M. Piskovyy, we are citizens of  Ukraine, and it was to protect and defend its interests that we  were sent to work in the FRG by the Ukrainian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. And no matter what the circumstances, we will  not--like certain "Ukrainian" diplomats in Berlin--appeal to the  German authorities. Here too, unfortunately, the ambassador  played a disgraceful role, forcing one of the embassy staffers  to sign an illegal document--contrary to instructions from the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Our collective wants to work and is capable of doing so. For  this purpose each of us has professional knowledge and skills,  competence, a certain amount of experience, and a wide circle of  ties in the country where we are stationed. But the main thing  is that we have the desire to honestly and honorable perform our  civic and service duties.    The restricted scope of the present letter does not accord  us  the possibility of elucidating the entire picture. However, we  can no longer put up with scorn and abuse of our state nor moral  torments and maltreatment. We are not serfs, and we do not work  for Mr. Piskovyy, but rather for our own state. Piskovyy is not  yet the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and certainly not Ukraine.    If--in response to our criticism here--the ambassador  attempts to deprive us of the right to perform our duties, as he  threatened to do at our recent meetings, and to organize  groundles charges against us one at a time, we will return all  together. And this will be done not only by those persons who  have signed the present letter.    Germany is too important a factor for Ukraine's foreign  policy to leave our diplomacy with it in such a state of  disarray.    We would request that you, dear and esteemed Anatoliy  Maksymovych, thoroughly examine the situation which has evolved  and take the proper measures.    We sincerely trust you.    Respectfully yours,    [Signed] V. Ohryzko, counsellor of the Ukrainian Embassy in  the FRG    [Signed] B. Sokolovskyy, first secretary of the embassy    [Signed] O. Shevchenko, chief of the consulate, second  secretary of the embassy    [Signed] O. Dolgykh, second secretary of the embassy    [Signed] O. Boyko, rapporteur of the embassy</p>

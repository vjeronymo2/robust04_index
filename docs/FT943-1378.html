			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Small companies confident on growth Small companies remain confident about their growth prospects, in spite of inflationary pressures and impending tax increases. A survey of 405 senior executives around the country showed 57 per cent were more optimistic than just three months ago. The survey, 'A View from the Boardroom', was sent to more than 1000 executives at companies with market values of less than Pounds 320m. It was the second six-monthly survey by the investment bank, SG Warburg, and carried out in August and September. Although confidence levels were slightly lower than before, Warburgs says the outlook is still bullish. Small companies were expecting strong growth in exports and 46 per cent reported order books bet-ween 1 and 10 per cent ahead of just three months ago. While demand was still a significant constraint, companies were beginning to experience a squeeze on capacity. Almost half expected to increase capital spending in the next year. Price rises were still difficult, with just 22 per cent planning increases in the next three months. Pressures from higher raw material costs would have to be absorbed through greater productivity. Warburgs remains optimistic about earnings potential for small companies. Mr Richard Hickinbotham, small companies analyst, said companies were looking for healthy increases in operating margins, in spite of the pressures. He forecast earnings growth of 16 per cent this year, excluding companies expected to move from loss into profit.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Orders To Aid Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission has accepted separate agreements to proposed consent orders from the American Society of Interpreters (ASI) and The American Association of Language Specialists (TAALS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent orders have been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreements and comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreements or make final the agreements' proposed orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASI and TAALS are professional associations of conference interpreters. The accompanying complaints allege that both TAALS and ASI have been and are acting as combinations or conspiracies of their members to restrain price and other forms of competition in the sale of interpretation services. In particular, the complaint against ASI charges that from as early as 1967, that association annually created and distributed a list of minimum daily fees that members were required to charge. The complaint against TAALS alleges that since 1973, TAALS required its members to refrain from accepting private sector fees below those adopted by vote of the association and then specified in the Fee Reports sent to members. In addition, the complaints allege that both ASI and TAALS have maintained a set of work rules binding on all of their members requiring, among other things, that all interpreters on a team be paid the same rate; that fees be paid in day-long increments; and that members charge for travel, rest, and study days. The complaints further allege that the binding work rules required, among other things, that interpreters work no more than six hours per day and that teams be staffed with a specified number of interpreters. The TAALS complaint also alleges that TAALS established rules limiting its members' use of portable electronic simultaneous interpretation equipment and prohibited its members from engaging in all forms of personal publicity and advertising. The TAALS complaint further alleges that TAALS required members to declare a single professional domicile and charge for travel expenses from that location even if no travel was actually involved. The complaints allege that TAALS' and ASI's lists of fees and work rules restrained competition in violation of section 5 of the FTC Act, and that absent the proposed consent orders, injury to the public will continue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent orders prohibit ASI and TAALS, including their chapters, committees, and any other subdivision, from creating, distributing, or endorsing any list of fees for interpretation, translation, or other language services. They also forbid each of the associations from entering into or maintaining any agreement, plan, or program, to fix or otherwise interfere with fees. In addition, TAALS and ASI are barred from recommending or encouraging, in any way, interpreters, translators, or other language specialists to charge, adhere to, or refrain from charging any existing or proposed fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the orders, for a period of ten years ASI and TAALS are required to declare out-of-order any person who makes a statement at a meeting concerning fees to be charged. If any person makes two such statements, the association must eject him or her from the meeting. If two people make statements concerning fees, TAALS or ASI must end the meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the orders, ASI and TAALS are further barred from prohibiting, regulating, or advising against any form of price competition, including undercutting a competitor's actual fee, advertising discounted fees, or accepting any particular lodging or travel arrangements. The orders also bar TAALS and ASI from advising against or prohibiting hourly fees, weekly fees, or fees calculated on other than a full-day basis. Furthermore, under the orders, the associations cannot prohibit interpreters, translators, or other language specialists from performing services free of charge or from paying their own travel, lodging, meals, or other expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

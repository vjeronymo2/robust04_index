			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Observer: Poor show One sign that outside interest in the TUC has reached a pretty low ebb is that staff from the European Commission didn't show up to open their exhibition stand in Blackpool till half way through the conference. TUC officials stress that the EC's late arrival is the result of staff shortages and has nothing to do with EC indifference. But the Eurocrats might have been persuaded to put in an earlier appearance if the TUC itself had shown more interest in Brussels. After all, the CBI has had an office there since 1971 and the TUC is only now getting round to opening its own little room. Tipped to head the TUC's new outpost is Belinda Pyke, now working for EC Commissioner Bruce Millan - who will be out of work if Neil Kinnock gets his job.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Romania's steel workers join strike TENS of thousands of Romanian steel workers entered the second day of a strike yesterday, demanding pay increases to match price rises, Reuter reports from Bucharest. 'Around 30,000 workers are now on strike and all our union members are ready to stop work this week if we fail to reach an agreement with our employers,' said Mr Ioan Homos, leader of the Metarom trade union. Metarom claims to have 90,000 members, or some 70 per cent of the workforce in the steel industry. Workers in the non-ferrous sector, including the country's big aluminium smelters, were affiliated to a separate trade union and had not joined the stoppage so far, Mr Homos said. Metarom wanted a minimum monthly wage of 50,000 lei (Pounds 52.50) for skilled workers compared with the current average of 34,000 lei. Yesterday workers in the big steel plants of Hunedoara, Calan, Otelul Rosu and Easteel also joined the strike. The prime minister, Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, has appointed a team of negotiators to discuss Metarom's claims. Earlier this month Romania's big trade unions, comprising more than 6m workers, won pay concessions from the government after threatening a strike. The government agreed to raise public sector minimum monthly wages to 30,000 lei from 17,600 lei. Prices for heating, bread, milk, butter, water, energy and public transport are expected to rise by up to 800 per cent now that price controls have been lifted since May 1. Bread prices have already risen by 450 per cent.</p>

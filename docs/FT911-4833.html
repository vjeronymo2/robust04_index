			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK insurer to sell reinsurance arm THE PROSPECTIVE sale by Royal Insurance of its 80 per cent stake in its Royal Re reinsurance subsidiary is expected to earn around Pounds 100m for the company, according to insurance analysts. The deal, which has been agreed in principle by Royal and General Re, the biggest reinsurer based in the US, was announced in London late on Monday. A price of Pounds 100m would be equivalent to roughly 1.5 times Royal Re's net asset value. The disposal would mark a further stage in the withdrawal of UK insurers from their involvement in reinsurance. Following the sale by Legal &amp; General of Victory Re last July, Royal Re, with net written premiums of Pounds 153m, was the second biggest UK reinsurer outside the Lloyd's market. Mercantile and General Re is the biggest reinsurer, but its owners, the Prudential Corporation, are also believed to be seeking a buyer. The disposal is one of the first results of a strategic review by Royal Insurance of its worldwide operations begun in early 1991. Although Royal Re is a specialist in engineering and industrial risk reinsurance, it has decided that it is too small to compete with the giants of European reinsurance in a sector where size is increasingly important. Royal had examined a number of options including geographical diversification and acquisition but decided the potential return on capital did not warrant the investment required. In addition, Royal believes that by offering reinsurance cover it may be helping to subsidise companies who are competing with it for direct business. Royal also said insurance prices were depressed in both the primary and reinsurance markets. Royal is expected to announce today the appointment of Mr Richard Gamble, the finance director who was appointed in 1989, to lead the management group which is conducting the strategic review.

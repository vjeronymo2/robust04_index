			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> BOARD FAILS TO OK STADIUM LIGHT DEAL  </P> <P> Hillside homeowners in Ventura expressed surprise and anger Tuesday when the  Ventura Unified Board of Education failed to approve a compromise regarding the  height of new lights at Ventura High School's Larabee Stadium.  </P> <P> Although the compromise was on the board's agenda, the board, without  explanation, decided not to take action.  </P> <P> The homeowners, who last fall sued the district, contending that the lights  reduced property values and blocked their view of the ocean, said they are  again considering legal action. "I guess we'll just have to go to court,"  homeowner Paul Lortie said.  </P> <P> Because of the possible legal action against the district, trustees and  district staff members refused to comment.  </P> <P> The compromise involved lowering the four light poles to 70 feet from their  current heights of 80 feet on the stadium's south side and from 110 feet on the  north side.  </P> <P> In a report to the board, Gary Mortimer, district maintenance director, said  lowering the lights would increase glare for players on the field.  </P> <P> He said a lower height also would shine more light onto residences directly  behind the stadium.  </P> <P> Ironically, the hillside homeowners had their attorney officially revoke the  lawsuit just hours before the board meeting because they believed an acceptable  compromise had been reached, homeowner Art Tidey said.  </P> <P> In return, the homeowners agreed to help raise money to pay off the $125,000  the district borrowed from the city of Ventura to pay for the lights.  </P> <P> The homeowners also offered to help raise money to pay for the refurbishing or  replacement of aging locker rooms, upgrade landscaping and install an  all-weather track.  </P> <P> The district decided last year to replace the lights because storm damage made  the old ones unsafe.

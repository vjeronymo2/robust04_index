			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Mexican kidnap of stores chief The vice-chairman of Mexico's second largest supermarket chain was kidnapped yesterday, the second prominent Mexican seized in this way during the last six weeks. Mr Angel Losada Moreno, vice-chairman of Grupo Gigante and son of Mr Angel Losada Gomez, company chairman, was kidnapped yesterday morning in Mexico City, said company spokesmen. They added that the kidnapping was witnessed but would give no more details. Mr Losada Moreno's kidnapping interrupted a strong recovery in the Mexican peso and stock market. The peso 48-hour rate closed at 3.33 to the dollar yesterday, having at one stage strengthened to 3.30. Even so, the currency is stronger than it was last week, well inside the central bank band, and analysts expect interest rates to fall in tomorrow's money market auction from the 18 per cent level reached last Wednesday. The stock market, which had increased a combined 12.5 per cent last Thursday and Friday, yesterday closed down 0.8 per cent on the day, having been up 3.6 per cent at mid-day. Shares in Grupo Gigante fell nearly 11 per cent on the news of the kidnapping. The Losada family owns 88 per cent of Gigante, whose market value is the equivalent of about Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 872m). The family also has shareholdings in Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest bank. On March 14, Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, Banamex-Accival president, was kidnapped from his car in Mexico City. The kidnappers have threatened to kill him unless his family pays a ransom reported to be Dollars 50m.</p>

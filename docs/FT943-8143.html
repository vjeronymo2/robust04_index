			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph hint A whiff of speculation in the market suggested that Mr Conrad Black, the newspaper entrepreneur and proprietor of the Telegraph, may have embarked on his threatened move to buy in shares of the company. Mr Black retains a 57 per cent stake in the Telegraph, via his Hollinger company. Telegraph shares retreated from a record 620p in May this year to a low of 332p after Mr Black's Hollinger group sold a block of 12.5m shares at 587p and the Telegraph chopped its cover price from 48p to 30p in an effort to maintain its pre- eminent position in the quality end of the newspaper market. In the resulting controversy over the share sale and the price cut, Cazenove resigned as broker to the Telegraph. The shares plunged 35 per cent the day after the price cut news hit the market. The stock edged up 5 to 361p yesterday on turnover of 303,000 shares, having topped 500,000 shares earlier this week. Heavy turnover was again being recorded in GEC as the two-way bid speculation refused to die down. Volume reached 15m shares by the close and the stock advanced a sprightly 8 to 300p. Market chatter was full of the same stories which have been swirling around the stock for several sessions now. Potential British predators BTR and Hanson were being joined by Alcatel, Siemens and General Electric from abroad. BTR shares climbed 8 to 384p and Hanson slipped 3 to 261p. There was also speculation that the cash-rich defence and electronics group was considering spending its estimated Pounds 2.8bn cash pile - either with a big acquisition or by buying back its shares. A decline in crude oil prices impacted on the oil majors, excluding them from the general market upsurge. The worst performer in oils was again Enterprise Oil, which lost 5 more at 398p in heavier than usual turnover of 3.1m. The recent sell story from NatWest Securities was again seen as driving the stock lower, but dealers reported a general feeling that the shares remain 'unloved' by most of the big domestic institutions. Some large lines of stock, reflecting the sale of a block of 1m shares, were said to be still overhanging the market. Lasmo added 3 at 157p after the drilling success in Algeria, while news of a 4,300 barrels a day oil strike in the North Sea boosted British Borneo, 2 firmer at 221p, and Seafield Resources, which raced forward 9 to 63p. The regional electricity stocks (recs) scored some strong gains as the lull in the post-Offer buying spree appeared to be over. NatWest Securities underlined the positive mood by raising its 1994-95 dividend growth forecast for the recs from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. South West Electricity forged ahead 21 to 727p and Northern 20 to 742p. A squeeze among the generators sent National Power running up 18 1/2 to 501 1/2 p and PowerGen 24 to 581p. There was talk that one US securities house was bringing out a positive note on the stocks in the next few days. Banking shares were in favour following the US increase in interest rates. Those that stood out included National Westminster, which advanced 18 to 479p, and Barclays, 15 better at 560p on good volume of 4m. A clutch of brokers' recommendations together with general bargain hunting helped HSBC Holdings rise out of the doldrums that followed the release of Monday's half-year figures. The shares rallied 17 to 734p in strong trade of 7.1m. James Capel, Nikko Securities and Lehman Brothers favour the stock. There was more interest in the brewers, with dealers reporting some heavy trades amid continuing investor buying interest. Vaux, the Sunderland-based brewer, climbed 9 to 250p on a hefty 2m traded. Boddington, due to report results early next month, advanced 11 to 281p, while Greenalls added 10 at 450p and Greene King gained 3 at 499p. A big buyer of Whitbread helped the shares jump 18 to 575p on 2.5m dealt. There was also big turnover in Guinness as the shares moved up 8 to 469p. Volume reached 13m, with dealers reporting, as last week, Salomon Brothers unwinding what appeared to be a large order. Media conglomerate Pearson strengthened 21 to 645p, which dealers put down to a technical bounce, rather than reports of BSkyB's success in obtaining some rights to screen English cricket matches. Pearson has a 17.5 per cent stake in BSkyB. United Newspapers rose 11 to 518p. The company said its Express Newspapers subsidiary had bought a picture library operator for Pounds 27m.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Peps: hijack or robbery? Are managed personal equity plans a good deal? Statistics suggest Pep providers get more from running schemes than investors are receiving in tax breaks. Whitehall estimates the exchequer will lose only Pounds 150m in revenue from Peps this financial year - cash which, largely, represents the savings to investors from receiving company dividends tax-free. The savings are made up of basic-rate tax credits which City institutions reclaim on behalf of their Pep customers, plus the freedom from any further income tax enjoyed by those who are 40 per cent taxpayers. The amount seems small when set against the Pounds 14bn now estimated to be invested in all Pep schemes, but it reflects two simple phenomena. The dividend yield on ordinary shares is very low at present: those in the FT-SE 100 are yielding only 3.8 per cent gross. And the tax credit reclaimable on company pay-outs is now only 20 per cent. Shares worth Pounds 14bn now generate around Pounds 532m in gross dividends, on which reclaimable tax credits amount to Pounds 133m. Take into account the extra tax savings to higher-rate taxpayers and the Pounds 150m estimate looks reasonable. Around Pounds 7bn, half of the Pounds 14bn, is held by Pep investors directly in company shares although the cash has to be channelled via a Pep provider in a so-called 'managed Pep' rather than through unit and investment trust Pep schemes. So, it is reasonable to assume that Pounds 75m, or 50 per cent of the Pounds 150m tax saving, flows to direct Pep investors. These select shares for themselves or allow the provider to do it for them. Either way, providers levy an annual management charge - typically, 1 or 1.25 per cent of portfolio value (which makes many such Peps worthless for basic-rate taxpayers now the tax credit has been cut). It is not hard to see that, on the Pounds 7bn held by these investors, providers reap a handsome harvest - revenues of Pounds 70m to Pounds 87.5m in annual fees alone. The bounty hardly stops there. The Pep industry sometimes charges fees for opening Peps, closing them, making cash withdrawals . . . just about anything it can think of. According to some estimates, providers of direct Peps get Pounds 100m in annual revenues while the investors who pay these fees collect Pounds 75m in tax savings. Hijack or daylight robbery? As for the other Pounds 7bn held via unit and investment trusts, many managers make great play of charging no extra to Pep investors. Those in a unit trust pay the same, via annual management charges and the bid-offer spread, as a non-Pep investor. But if, as the providers always argue, Peps are costly to administer, then are their non-Pep customers subsidising their Pep clients?</p>

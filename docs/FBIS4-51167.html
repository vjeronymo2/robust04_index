			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948) and Yin Xuecheng </F> (3009 1331 2052)]    [Text] Nanjing, 24 May (XINHUA) -- In the conference room  of Jiangsu's Yangzhou Bus Main Manufacturing Plant, State  Council Premier Li Peng asked the plant's director Ju Baocai:  "What is the key to efficient operation of state-owned large-  and medium-sized enterprises?"    On the morning of 20 May, Premier Li Peng inspected the  plant, which produces 5,000 buses annually. Despite a fall in  the bus market last year, the plant still produced and sold  4,350 buses with a sales income of 560 million yuan, paid 50.08  million yuan in profit tax, and made 41.62 million yuan profit,  a growth of 105 percent over 1992. Because of the success in  various technological transformation projects, the plant's  principal economic indices have been ahead of its counterparts  nationwide for five consecutive years. After viewing the  production assembly and workshop, Li Peng held a discussion  meeting with the plant's staff in the conference room.    After a brief thought, Ju Baocai answered the premier's  question: "The primary requirement is to have a good policy.  The city committee and government have given us preferential  treatment..."    After noting down the main points of Ju Baocai's remarks, Li  Peng asked again: "What you have said is correct, but what is  the key issue?"    Comrades attending the discussion meeting became very  interested in the premier's quiz of the plant director.  Yangzhou City Mayor Shi Guoxing added: "I think the main issue  is whether the operating mechanism is flexible or not."    Li Peng said: "This is also an important reason."    Communications Minister Huang Zhendong, who accompanied the  premier on his inspection, said: "The key lies with the market."    Li Peng said: "That is correct! I think the key to  efficient operation of state-owned large- and medium-sized  enterprises lies with the market. Enterprises must gear  themselves toward the market and satisfy market demand. In a  market economy, state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises  must exploit their edge by producing salable products with the  batch processing method. Only then can enterprises be  competitive and have their economic efficiency upgraded."    Citing the development of Yangzhou Bus Main Manufacturing  Plant as an example, Li Peng further explained: "In the past,  your plant repaired automobiles and later produced small-sized  trucks. But now you are the nation's largest bus producing  plant. Had you chosen trucks, not buses, as your principal  products in the first place, could you have won the competition  against the First Automobile Works and Second Automobile Works?  State-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises not only  possess the edge in technological setup and higher quality of  their personnel, but also in fine traditions. If they gear  themselves toward market demand based on their actual  conditions, select correct development strategies, and actively  open up the market, they can definitely move onto the path of  vitalization."    The premier's remarks won Ju Baocai's agreement. It is  exactly the market that has brought about profound changes to  Yangzhou Bus Main Manufacturing Plant. The 3,000-worker bus  plant produces its "Ya Xing" buses in six series of large,  medium, and light sizes as well as high, medium, and general  grades with 45 various models. The products are sold in 30  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities nationwide,  with part of the products exported. In 1991, Premier Li Peng  presented 40 large-sized buses from the plant to the Philippine  Government as a gift.    Li Peng offered an analysis: "Of course, we should realize  that in the process of deepened reform and transfer to the  market economic system, some enterprises have met with some  difficulties to varying degrees, and their economic efficiency  is low. This is caused by various factors. We should have full  confidence in efficiently operating state-owned large- and  medium-sized enterprises as well as attach importance to their  present difficulties."    Li Peng said: "To efficiently run state-owned large- and  medium-sized enterprises, it is necessary to tackle three areas:  First, enterprises must be geared toward the market so that  their products continue to correspond with domestic and foreign  market demands; second, enterprises must establish a good  mechanism suited to the socialist market economy; and third,  enterprises must attach importance to technological progress as  well as enhance their staying power in development and  competitiveness."    Ju Baocai told the premier: "During the `Eighth Five-Year  Plan,' our plant invested 150 million yuan in technological  transformation in stamping [chong ya 0394 1090], chassis, seat,  body works, and assembly line, and we will soon enter the market  with a new posture."    Li Peng affirmed: "Good! I have many reasons to believe  that through the efforts of everyone, we can definitely run  state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises efficiently. It  is groundless for some people to correlate state-owned large-  and medium-sized enterprises with poor economic efficiency."    Li Peng left the conference room to view buses of various  categories which the plant produces. He entered a double-decker  bus with reclining seats, and asked about its performance and  price. He also tried the reclining seat and said: "It is very  comfortable and suitable for long-distance travel. How is the  market for this type of vehicle?" Li Bingcai, secretary of the  Yangzhou city party committee, replied: "Supply cannot meet  demand." The plant happens to be a contact point for Li  Bingcai, who is very familiar with its operations.    Boarding a medium-sized station wagon, Li Peng tried the  clutch and brake before starting the vehicle. Under the  premier's control, the "Ya Xing" station wagon moved forward  slowly, and hearty laughs and applause filled the plant.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Hewson to attend inquiry Dr John Hewson, Australia's the opposition leader, and Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media proprietor, are expected to appear before a Senate inquiry into ownership of the John Fairfax newspaper group, Bruce Jacques reports from Sydney. Dr Hewson's decision to appear removed a threat to the setting-up of the inquiry which requires co-operation between the Opposition and the Democrats who can together control the Senate. The prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, has so far refused to appear before the inquiry which will examine allegations of commercial and political trade-offs between himself and Mr Black before the Australian elections in March this year. Mr Black claims that Mr Keating demanded 'more balanced' political coverage from Fairfax newspapers as a precondition to consideration of any increase in Mr Black's interest in the group.</p>

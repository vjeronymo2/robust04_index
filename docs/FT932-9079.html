			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Compact discs: consider other cases of over-pricing  -and a market at work (2) Sir, As the present controversy over transatlantic CD prices illustrates markets can play strange tricks. The canny shopper in New York can pick up video equipment for little more than half the UK price. Visitors to Tokyo though will be shocked to find the very same equipment - in its country of manufacture - selling at virtually double the UK price. Few of the goods which we buy and sell have an intrinsic unit value which approaches the retail price in any market. That being the case, it is unsurprising that goods (CDs included) will sell at whatever price the local market will bear. This may be good news for the British record industry, but it is only an example of the consumer voting with his cheque book. That, surely, is what is meant by a market economy.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The South Korean puppets perpetrated a grave  military provocation by illegally infiltrating a group of  battleships deep into the territorial waters off our side's west  coast on 25 May.    At around 1633 [0733 GMT] on 25 May, three battleships of  the  puppet army based in Taechong Island went into battle formation  and deeply infiltrated into our side of the territorial waters  south of Ochajin-ri, Yongyon county, South Hwanghae Province, to  openly kidnap our peaceful fishing ships in broad daylight.    The Korean People's Army Naval patrol boat which was  vigilantly defending the sea posts of the socialist fatherland  went into emergency mobilization on the spot and the rascals  rapidly fled towards the South.    The South Korean puppets' reckless act of infiltrating into  the sea is stimulating North-South confrontation. This is also  an intentional and planned provocative maneuver to drive the  Korean peninsula toward an intense and aggravated situation.    This act of military provocation was committed at a time  when  the South Korean puppets are finding fault with our nonexistent  nuclear issue, conspiring with outside forces to drag in  up-to-date murderous equipment on a large scale into South  Korea, and leading the situation to a dangerous stage by  accelerating the increase of forces in the Military Demarcation  Line area of the DMZ. Therefore, we cannot but all the more  regard this as a severe situation.    If the South Korean puppets ignore the consistent desire of  the Korean people and the world's peace-loving people who want  peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula and continue to  move toward the road of war and confrontation, the provokers  will not be able to escape from receiving a resolute punishment.</p>

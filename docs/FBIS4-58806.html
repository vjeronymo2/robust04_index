			<p>BFN     [Text] Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that  speaking at a lecture in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  said Israel is not committed to allow the return of Palestinian  refugees from the Six-Day War. Mr. Rabin pointed that according  to the Oslo Declaration of Principles, a quadripartite committee  consisting of Israel, the PLO, Egypt, and Jordan will be set up  to discuss the question of these refugees. The prime minister  affirmed that Israel is in no way committed to the figures cited  in this context or to return the refugees. He went on to say  that the issue of the War of Independence refugees will be  discussed in the negotiations on the permanent solution, while  Israel, for its part, will raise the question of the Jewish  refugees from the Arab countries.    Referring to the Knesset members [MK] holed up in a  synagogue  in Jericho, Mr. Rabin described their actions a political  manifestation under false religious pretenses. He pointed out  that the MK's presence at the site necessitates the deployment  of soldiers to watch over them. He said it is shameful that  MK's should count on the fact that no order will be issued to  forcibly evacuate them because of their parliamentary immunity.  Nevertheless, Mr. Rabin noted, such wanton behavior may make it  necessary to take the appropriate steps. In the meantime, until  a decision is made, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will guard  them.    Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that the commander of  the Central Command decided to allow MK's Hanan Porat and Dov  Shilansky, along with a group of worshipers, to stay in the  synagogue in Jericho until the end of the Sabbath, tomorrow  evening. On Sunday and Monday, they will only be allowed to  stay on the site during the daytime. The MK's promised that  their supporters will leave the premises in the evening. The  MK's said that in view of the prime minister's denunciation,  they regard this decision as a kind of achievement that speaks  for itself.</p>

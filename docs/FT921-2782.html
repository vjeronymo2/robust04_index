			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television If, like me, you find the incidence of kissing, expectoration, and feigned injury in soccer too much to take, you are going to have to hunt around for something to watch tonight since BBC1 devotes two hours to Liverpool In Europe (7.00, they play Genoa) and ITV spends equal time on The European Match (Spurs v. Feyenoord 8.00). And if, like most of us, you have also had enough of party political bickering to last you a lifetime, matters will be even more problematical. Perhaps you enjoy programmes about racism; judging from their frequency the broadcasters think we do. Trouble Behind (8.05 BBC2) visits Corbin in America's Deep South 'to expose and confront the racism that exists even today'. Vying with racism as the broadcasters' pet topic is New Age airy-fairyism. QED also takes a trip to the US to report on 'a miracle cure-all wonder drug', a herbal elixir promoted by a Swiss gentleman from a caravan in the Arizona desert. Thank goodness the BBC has the funds for these vital investigations. If you want to laugh even harder, tonight's funniest programme will be a repeat of Drop The Dead Donkey (11.00), C4's excellent comedy about a television newsroom.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Whitehall cool on EC 'green' plans GOVERNMENT departments have expressed doubts about whether energy-saving measures being proposed by Brussels will be sufficient to meet the European Commission's objectives of reducing fuel consumption and lowering harmful emissions. Whitehall believes that the European Community would be wrong to go ahead with its carbon-tax proposal unless other countries take similar action. Instead, it calls for energy-conservation at a national level. The UK's sceptical position is outlined in a joint report by the energy and environment departments and the Treasury to the European Communities committee of the House of Lords, which is holding hearings on energy today. The report contains the first detailed assessment by the leading relevant UK departments of EC energy and environmental measures. Although it stresses that many of the EC proposals are still too vague to permit firm judgments to be made, it underlines Whitehall's cautious approach to Brussels initiatives. The UK accepts that climate change poses a threat to the world, and will require co-ordinated international action. But it argues that isolated action by individual nations or regional groupings would not be effective in combating harmful emissions. Whitehall wants a framework convention that would commit all countries to realistic and achievable strategies for limiting greenhouse gases. The report also criticises the EC proposal to exempt energy-intensive industries from the carbon tax in order to protect their international competitiveness. It says that these exemptions would only create distortions and throw the cost of adjustment on to energy consumers and other industries. The report also doubts whether the carbon tax could be 'neutralised', as Brussels proposes, by redistributing the proceeds in the form of tax cuts or benefits. Britain's support for the carbon tax would be 'conditional on similar action by other countries', the report says. It believes individual countries should draw up their own programmes.</p>

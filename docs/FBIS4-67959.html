			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that the visit to North Korea by  an inspection team will be realized around this weekend at the  earliest as North Korea and the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] have narrowed their opinions as to the issues of  additional inspections and the witnessing of the change of  nuclear fuel rods.    Today, one diplomatic source in Seoul said: As letters have  been exchanged between North Korea and the IAEA, the differences  of opinion between the two sides have now nearly been settled.  The IAEA says it will begin inspections of whatever is settled  first, either the additional inspections or the witnessing of  the change of nuclear fuel rods. It is believed that the IAEA  will conduct other inspections when it visits North Korea.</p>

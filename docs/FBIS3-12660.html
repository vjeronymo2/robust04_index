How do you assess the U.S. and South  Korean Governments' stance on this?    [Choe Yong-no] In order to assess this issue, we should seek  the roots of the matter and basically see on what basis the  nuclearization of the Korean peninsula is discussed.    The issue of the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula  should be assessed from two positions. The first is that the  United States has deployed its most advanced arms in South Korea  and since these arms threaten our country, it is necessary for  us to arm ourselves.    The second is that this is an American plot. By fabricating  various documents the United States has sparked a commotion on  the manufacturing of nuclear arms in North Korea. We have  repeatedly stated that we do not have any wish to manufacture  such weapons, that we have no potential in this field, and that  we do not wish to manufacture these items.    We still do not have a nuclear power plant in our country.  There is only one research center and a few small reactors that  we are using for tests. This center has some needs that had to  be met before a nuclear power plant could become operational,  for which these reactors were used.    Related to this, the IAEA has inspected our country many  times and has stressed that our nuclear policy is completely  peaceful and there is no doubt in this. A few years after these  inspections they inspected our military bases and said that we  manufactured nuclear arms there. This is a blatant U.S. plot;  this superpower is constantly looking for a pretext.    Unfortunately, the IAEA has become a U.S. puppet, is  pursuing  a policy of double standards toward our country, and is accusing  us of being in the process of nuclearization. This is at a time  when some U.S. minions such as Israel and South Africa are  equipped with the most advanced nuclear weapons and the  West--the United States--is not acting against them in any way.    We cannot tolerate their policy of double standards and  hostility, and have thus told them that they should rectify  their unjust stance. For this reason, last March we stated that  we would be leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    We have repeatedly stated that the nuclear issue in the  Korean peninsula should be solved through direct talks. Until  now we have had two official talks and several talks at the  level of Korean and U.S. experts.    Recently the United States has trampled on all the  agreements  and issues to which we had reached a conclusion. Thus, the  talks on the nuclear issue have been overtly placed at an  impasse.    In our opinion, the United States has no intention to solve  the nuclear issue through peaceful means but is mostly  interested in solving the issue through force and pressure. For  this reason, our country has issued a statement underlining our  decisive stances.    Among the reasons that led to the above statement was the  fact that the United States trampled on all the agreements that  we had reached in New York. American acts and approaches are  considered blatant crimes and a flagrant violation of  international resolutions.    We once again stress that we do not wish to hold further  talks with the United States. Also, we hope that the government  and people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is our good  ally, will stand next to us.    If today we submit to America's incorrect acts, tomorrow it  will be the turn of Iran, and then another country, to be placed  under America's yoke.    [Correspondent] As you know, the government of Pyongyang  recently expressed its concern over the launching of Japan's H-2  satellite and has said that this act shows that Japan's military  strength has reached a sensitive point. How do you assess this  issue?    [Choe] This issue is connected more with Japan's  militarism. The Japanese are more active than anyone else in  the manufacture of nuclear arms. A few days ago we received  news that the Japanese will begin operation of a nuclear  accelerator reactor. This reactor is the third such reactor in  the world. The Japanese have stored a large quantity of  plutonium and these reactors can manufacture several thousand  nuclear bombs.    This is considered a dangerous act in eastern Asia because  the launching of a space satellite is mostly connected with the  collection of information on regional countries. Therefore,  regional countries are worried about such aggressive acts.    The Japanese are the first and only country to have been  harmed by the nuclear bomb. Therefore, they should not seek to  develop such arms, in view of their bitter experience, and  should be more interested in nuclear disarmament and the end of  mass destruction.    [Correspondent] As you know, Mr. Ambassador, in Europe,  which  the Westerners consider the cradle of civilization, a war of  attrition and dangerous genocide is taking place in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is your country's stance on the Serbs'  crimes and savageries and on the silence of international forums?    [Choe] International forums have focused their attention on  the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. We want a solution to the war  and the conflicts in the region through peaceful means without  any massacres.    Unfortunately it is very regrettable that international  forums are silent and have failed to solve the problem.    [Correspondent] In view of the fact that you were considered  a Soviet ally, what are relations like with regional countries,  especially Russia, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union?    [Choe] Trade with Russia continues and relations are the  same. We also have political-commercial relations with the CIS  members.    We had one embassy in Moscow in the past. Now we have  several embassies in the region. Since peace, friendship, and  the preservation of the independence of all countries is part of  our foreign policy, we have no problems in establishing  relations with any country that respects the principle of mutual  rights.    As for Russia, there is no place for worry. Relations are  good. But there is one thing that should be noted and that is  that Mr. Yeltsin should not follow America around too much and  make some effort to stand on his own two feet.    [Correspondent] In view of your country's economic growth,  in  which direction is your country moving: toward  industrialization, agriculture, or...? [ellipsis as published]    [Choe] On the basis of President Kim Il-song's policies, our  basic policy grants priority to heavy industries, while light  industries and agriculture are second in priority.    On the basis of this theory, we have sought to develop the  country for two to three decades. Last year we witnessed the  end of the Third Seven-Year Plan. However, we have set the  period beginning this year and the next three years as a period  during which we will prepare the next plan.    During these three years, we will grant more priority to  agriculture, light industries, and trade.    [Correspondent] How much of your technology depends on  foreign countries and how much operates independently?    [Choe] We supply our needs mostly from domestic resources.  However, we import some of the raw materials that we lack in our  country.    Our country definitely lacks some industrial installations  such as petrochemical refineries. Therefore, we have to import  these installations and complexes from other countries.    [Correspondent] Which country does your country primarily  depend on?    [Choe] Our economic relations cannot be described as being  dependent on one country. We have trade relations with Asian  countries and especially with neighboring countries. Before the  end of the 1980's we had extensive trade and industrial  relations with the Eastern Bloc. After the disintegration of  Eastern Europe, our current relations were automatically  created. But it is not as though our major trade and economic  relations were dependent on Eastern Europe.    It should be noted that we have no relations with the  United States and Japan because both these countries have a  colonialist attitude and have imposed economic sanctions on our  country for decades. Thus, our nation does not have any good  feelings about these two countries.    Since the 1950's, the United States has been implementing  its  imperialistic policy toward us. It has always been seeking to  destroy our socialist system, and in many cases we have been  threatened by them.    The Americans have stationed themselves to the south of our  country and are striving to occupy and destroy the Korean  peninsula and are always plotting their objectives.    [Correspondent] How are relations with your neighbors and  what is your country's foreign policy concerning your neighbors?    [Choe] We have good relations with countries like China,  with  which we share common borders. We have traditionally had good  relations with our neighbors. However, there is strong dislike  between us and the Japanese because of the great crimes they  perpetrated against our country and people during World War II,  which can never be forgotten.    [Correspondent] What is the per capita income, the gross  national product in your country?    [Choe] Because our country's general policy focuses on the  people's welfare, emphasis is placed on increased production and  the government's policy is to ensure good living conditions for  the people.    We have adopted various methods to increase our GNP, but I  am  not aware of its precise figure. I should say that our country  is basically different from other countries because our  government does not tax the people; as far as I know, there is  no other country that does not tax its people.    Education is compulsory and free in our country. University  education is also free and everyone can attend.    We call this method that has been put forth by our leaders  as  a "policy of affection," which is aimed at friendship with the  people. Needless to say, our surplus GNP is used to meet the  people's needs.    [Correspondent] What measures have you considered taking to  replace tax revenues?    [Choe] The surplus GNP and any other government income is  set  aside for the next year and some percent of the general GNP is  used instead of tax revenues to meet the people's needs and to  run the government.    Another point that should be explained is that JAHAN-E ESLAM  is known to our people. The majority of our people are  acquainted with it and always consider your newspaper to be  among the frontline newspapers.    On 19 March your newspaper published a commentary on our  country's nuclear issue, which coincided with our decision to  leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Many countries  placed pressures on us to return to this pact. In your  commentary you said that U.S. pressure was the reason we decided  to leave the pact and that other countries are wrong to insist  that we return.    Your newspaper's commentary was cited in our country. This  shows that your newspaper was sufficiently aware of the crisis  and recent incidents. We hope that your newspaper will  carefully reflect the official stance of our government, nation,  and country.</p>

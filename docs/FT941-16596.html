			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Books: Red deer lock horns with green politics - Not only is the stag at bay, but most of Highland society as well THE STAG AT BAY: THE SCOTTISH RED DEER CRISIS by Michael Wigan Swan Hill Press Pounds 12.95 150 pages That wildlife's best friends are hunters is the politically-awkward paradox that forms the basis of Michael Wigan's study of red deer and green politics. There are some 300,000 red deer in Scotland, most of them living on some 200 deer forests - large tracts of hill inhabited mainly by deer and sheep, stalkers and shepherds. To be viable in different stalking conditions, including an unscheduled visit by hill-walkers, these deer forests tend to be big: the author's own, Borrobol, covers some 23,000 acres. Elsewhere such estates would be exceptional but Scottish hill ground is unproductive and has always been tied up in great holdings. Before the private lairds there were the clan chiefs. Now there are new landowners, such as the RSPB and Scottish Natural Heritage, with new ideas. The heather hills, once the sportsman's lonely preserve, are now cherished as part of Europe's last wilderness. Conservationists, ramblers and mountaineers all want their share of these private estates devoted to deer. The red stag, long a heraldic symbol of power, has become the unwitting icon of a conservation and social clash. The new conservationists stress that the glens once supported far higher human populations, who were removed in the Clearances between 1780-1830 and replaced by sheep; the Victorians then discovered deer-stalking and some 3.6m acres were given over to this. The owners were abetted by the sheep and deer in this transformation, whose busy molars ensured that all trees were shorn to destruction and that a deer forest remained anything but wooded. This is no longer acceptable in conservationist circles, where bio-diversity is all. The aim now is to reproduce the ancient Caledonian forest, to restore the land to its prehistoric state. Wigan describes how the Cairngorms Working Party Report outlined a strategy for the creation of two vast new forests at Strathspey and Mar. All foreign trees, such as larch, lodgepole and spruce, would be removed and replaced with home species. The plan could not possibly work, however, without the wholesale shooting of the red deer, which would otherwise destroy the new saplings. The exact number needed to be culled is not given, but Wigan cites the figures of the East Grampian Deer Management Group, which estimates that deer over 500,000 hectares would have to be reduced to a token population if a deer-free area of 50,000 hectares were to be created. A similar operation to restore tree growth was undertaken on the 4,000-hectare Creag Meagaidh estate, owned by Scottish Natural Heritage. In 17 years the deer population was reduced from 1,200 to 56. Over 500,000 hectares the cull would involve killing on a massive scale. The deer-forest owners are anxious that this should not happen. Venison brings in Pounds 3.5m annually, according to Wigan, with a further Pounds 3.7m in stalking fees. Such sums are vital in an impoverished area. Sadly, the locals, both human and cervine, appear to have a minor role in the new thinking on ancient forest. It is not only the stag at bay in Wigan's account, but also much of rural Highland society.</p>

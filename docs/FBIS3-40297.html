			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F> Silajdzic at the extraordiary session of the Government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Sarajevo -- live]    [Text] I will now propose conclusions, taking into account  the reports by the two ministers. I propose the following  conclusion on the first item on the agenda: After the perfidious  murder of the British citizen, a representative of the UNHCR [UN  High Commission on Refugees], and the wounding of the two  workers of this organization in Zenica on 27 January 1994, the  Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina conveys  expressions of its deepest condolences to the family of the  murdered man, the Government of Great Britain, and the UNHCR.  Condemning this terrorist act, the Government of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will do everything with a view to discovering  and punishing the culprits of this horrific crime. This murder  has taken place at the moment when we need humanitarian aid the  most, but we are convinced that this act will not lead to the  suspension of the delivery of humanitarian aid in central Bosnia  and we think that it would be catastrophic if the innocent  population paid the price for this terrorist act.    As for the second item on the agenda, the military  intervention of the armed forces of the Republic of Croatia in  the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I propose the following  conclusion: The Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  asserts, according to the reliable reports from the field, that  an open military intervention was launched on the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina by the armed forces of the Republic of  Croatia. The Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  asks for an urgent session of the UN Security Concil and demands  that the UN Security Council condemns this aggression and takes  measures in conformity with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and all  relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General  Assembly adopted so far.    These were the two conclusions on the two items of the  agenda. Do we agree with these conclusions? [word indistinct]  Thank you. The extraordinary session of the Government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been concluded.</p>

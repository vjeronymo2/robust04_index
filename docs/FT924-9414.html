			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: DnB shares hit by deeper losses DEN NORSKE BANK, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday disclosed nine-month net losses of NKr2.46bn (Dollars 385m) - up from NKr2.33bn a year earlier - and announced plans to seek further state cash following last year's NKr5.9bn government rescue. Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing director, would not reveal the amount of support the bank needed, but did not rule out the possibility of DnB not meeting its capital adequacy requirements by the end of the year. At the end of September, the bank's capital adequacy was 8.3 per cent of risk-weight assets of NKr162.3bn. Norway's banks are required to meet a minimum of 8 per cent by the end of 1992. Mr Trond Reinertsen, head of the Norwegian Banks Association, has suggested that banks should aim to obtain a capital adequacy of 10 per cent. If DnB aims for 10 per cent, it may need an estimated NKr2bn to NKr3bn in fresh capital, according to analysts. Yesterday, DnB A shares again fell heavily, sliding by 23 per cent to a new all-time low of NKr0.50. Analysts fear DnB may be forced to write down the value of its shares to zero. Mr Hvistendahl said this decision would have to be made at the annual meeting next year. DnB said it was forced into heavier losses because of turbulence in the money and securities markets. It was also hit by losses incurred by Investa, a non-listed domestic investment company, which was declared technically insolvent in September, and by losses at Realkreditt, a subsidiary it acquired last year. DnB made a NKr200m provision for losses incurred from Investa's holding company. It also made a provision of NKr470m for losses incurred by Realkreditt. For the nine-months, DnB's total credit losses were NKr497m lower at NKr3.29bn although it is still incurring heavy property losses in the UK. Non-performing loans stabilised at around NKr10.3bn. Net interest income in the nine-month period fell by NKr100m to NKr3.39bn as other operating income declined by NKr547m to NKr1.34bn. DnB said interest expenses in August and September rose steeply when domestic interest rates were driven higher by the surge in Sweden's marginal lending rate to 500 per cent. DnB was also forced to write down the value of its share portfolio by NKr365m and 'substantial losses' were incurred in the bond portfolio.</p>

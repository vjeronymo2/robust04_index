			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THE NEW BLACKLIST IN RED SQUARE  </P> <P> "The Moscow Committee on Un-Soviet Affairs will come to order. I call Misha  Obolensky as a witness."  </P> <P> "I am ready when you are, Mr. Chairman."  </P> <P> "Misha, are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party?"  </P> <P> "No. I just went to a few of its dances."  </P> <P> "Misha Obolensky, I have in my hand the names of 50 million members of the  Communist Party. Would you please tell us if you know any of them?"  </P> <P> "I don't recognize the names, but then again I live in the suburbs."  </P> <P> "A likely story, Misha. Our records show that on May 1, 1985, you marched in a  May Day parade with the Lenin Daughters of the Revolution. Do you deny this?"  </P> <P> "It was an accident. I was looking for the GUM department store and I wound up  at the head of the march. It was a terrible thing to do, but how was I supposed  to know that all the people in the parade were not fellow travelers?"  </P> <P> "You should have known. Moscow was full of Communists at that time."  </P> <P> "Mr. Chairman, it was my wife who made me go to Communist Party meetings. She  told me that if I did, we would get a larger apartment and be allowed to shop  at the Party store."  </P> <P> "Are you denouncing your wife for being a Communist?"  </P> <P> "I would like to very much. Her first name is Lara."  </P> <P> "Misha Obolensky, you don't get off just because you denounced your wife. We  want names of other people in your cell. You owe it to us to provide a list of  Reds."  </P> <P> "You will have to torture me before I reveal the names of the traitors I  associated with."  </P> <P> "Misha, we can hold you for contempt of the Presidium."  </P> <P> "Why didn't you say so? Here is a list in alphabetical order. All of them said  nice things about Joseph Stalin at one time or another."  </P> <P> "This committee is trying to ferret out every Marxist-Leninist in the Soviet  Union. We cannot do it until mealy-mouthed pinkos like you tell us what took  place at your meetings."  </P> <P> "What happened at a Communist Party meeting? We laughed, we sang, we partied  and we played Spin the Proletariat."  </P> <P> "You made no speeches about the world order of socialism and burying the West?"  </P> <P> "It was just cocktail conversation. You know how Reds are when they get  together and have nothing to talk about."  </P> <P> "Would you care to give us details of what else your cell discussed?"  </P> <P> "What cell? It was a club -- we went to soccer games and Lenin's Tomb. Believe  me, Mr. Chairman, we had nothing to do with the revolution whatsoever."  </P> <P> "If you didn't, who did?"  </P> <P> "The Trotskyites. They're the ones who imposed a one-party system on the  Motherland. My members were for the Democratic Party. I swear it on my wife's  head -- would you like her address?"  </P> <P> "Misha, did you ever put microfilm in a pumpkin in your garden?"  </P> <P> "I think I may have once. They were naked photographs of Comrade Brezhnev, whom  we all hated and feared. Having pictures of him doesn't make me a Communist."  </P> <P> "It doesn't make you a Lithuanian, either."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko under the "Neighbors" rubric: </F> "`Little Hare's' Merger With the Ruble Sparks Turbulent  Reaction. Group of Belarus Deputies Demands Criminal Proceedings  Against Participants in the Signing of Treaty With Russia"]    [Text] The agreement on merging the monetary systems of  Belorussia [Belarus] and Russia signed in Moscow has provoked a  mixed reaction among the country's political forces. A group of  Supreme Soviet deputies representing the Social Democratic Party  turned to parliament's presidium with a demand for "carrying out  without delay an investigation and, if necessary, instituting  criminal proceedings against the participants in preparing and  signing this treaty," which contravenes the constitution  currently in force. A number of opposition parliamentarians  also demanded that the agenda of an extraordinary session should  include the question of resignation of Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Kebich and members of his government "for unconstitutional  activities."    The extraordinary session of parliament will take place on  27  April. At its closed session, which ended in the evening of 13  April, the Supreme Soviet presidium, however, declined to  include in its agenda a revision of the Constitution articles  with which the signed Belarus-Russia treaty is at variance. The  session will be devoted to electing the country's constitutional  court.    The parliament head is refraining from comment on the  agreement Prime Minister Kebich signed in Moscow on the plea  that the question needs to be studied additionally: Pressing  for an urgent conclusion of a financial alliance at any price,  Mr. Kebich clearly went beyond the bounds he had set himself and  that were agreed on by parliament leaders. The upcoming  presidential elections introduce an added nuance. It is still  unknown whether Speaker Mechislaw Hryb is going to run. He was  restrained about the signed agreement and instructed  parliamentary commissions to see to which extent it corresponds  with the Constitution.    The deputies will inevitably raise the problem of merging  the  two countries' monetary systems at the 27 April extraordinary  parliament session. The majority in the Supreme Soviet will  clearly back the agreement and will be ready to amend the  Constitution then and there. The examination of this question  will be postponed, however, (most probably on the prime  minister's insistence) to see what the people think about it.  The voting is planned to coincide with the 23 June presidential  elections. Vyacheslav Kebich hopes that the elections will  demonstrate sweeping popular support for his course of  convergence with Russia, and therefore, whatever their upshot,  he would remain at the helm of the Executive Branch for at least  as long as this parliament's powers last. The election campaign  for potential presidential candidates will officially start in  Belorussia on 15 April. Already under way is the registration  of initiative groups that are gathering signatures, and the  formation of electoral commissions.</p>

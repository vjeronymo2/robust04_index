			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FAA, PRIVATE PILOT BLAMED IN CERRITOS CRASH FATAL TO 82;  </P> <P> AEROMEXICO ABSOLVED OF ANY FAULT  </P> <P> A federal court jury today found the Federal Aviation Administration and the  pilot of a small plane equally responsible for the 1986 collision of an  Aeromexico airliner and the small plane that killed 82 people.  </P> <P> The jury absolved Aeromexico from any blame for the collision over Cerritos.  The panel found negligence by the FAA and private pilot William Kramer and said  they were responsible for the crash in equal measure.  </P> <P> The jury's task was to determine responsibility. The verdict is binding on  Kramer's estate, but its findings on Aeromexico and the FAA are advisory to  U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who was to make his decision on their  portion of responsibility later in the day.  </P> <P> Damages will be decided at later trials or by settlement.  </P> <P> Attorney Franklin Silane, representing Aeromexico, said he felt that the case  was not an indictment of air traffic safety in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "'Overall, the traffic is safe in Los Angeles and the traffic controllers are  good at the job. A mistake was made on that day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Both Planes Plunged  </P> <P> The collision occurred in clear skies Aug. 31, 1986, as the Aeromexico DC-9,  with 64 people aboard, was approaching Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> Kramer, with his wife and a daughter as passengers, was flying a single-engine  Piper that hit the jet's tail and sent both aircraft plunging into the ground.  </P> <P> All aboard both planes and 15 people on the ground in suburban Cerritos were  killed.  </P> <P> FAA air traffic controller Walter White, who was guiding the DC-9 to the  airport, maintained that the Piper did not appear on his radar screen. However,  data tapes from the radar system did record the Piper's flight.  </P> <P> During the trial expert witnesses testified that Kramer's plane was visible on  the radar screen during 62 of 64 radar sweeps in the final minutes before the  11:52 a.m. collision in controlled airspace.  </P> <P> Medical evidence was presented that suggested Kramer was disabled by a heart  attack before the collision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Controllers 'Too Casual'  </P> <P> Some of the jurors, interviewed later, said they believed that Kramer violated  the airport's restricted airspace, which is called the Terminal Control Area,  when he wandered into it and that air traffic controllers failed to halt  traffic when they realized what had happened.  </P> <P> One of the jurors, Valorie Mitzel of Anaheim, said she felt that air traffic  controllers were "too casual" about their responsibilities and also faulted  supervisors for failing to investigate properly after the accident.  </P> <P> She said she felt the radar scope on which the controller said he never saw the  small plane should have been deactivated immediately and checked, which she  said was not done.  </P> <P> "I was very disturbed by what happened after," she said. "If a man says  something wasn't on the scope, why isn't it checked? Generally they were too  casual."  </P> <P> The jurors said they rejected the claim that Kramer may have suffered a heart  attack. They said there was insufficient evidence to prove this to them.  </P> <P> Mitzel said she believed the Aeromexico pilot and co-pilot were acting properly  and probably did not see the small plane.  </P></p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Five die in blast at tallest tower in New York FIVE people were killed and up to 500 injured yesterday when an underground explosion rocked the World Trade Center in New York, sending smoke up through the twin 110-storey office towers. The blast, which ripped through a car park and train station below the Trade Center complex, was being blamed increasingly last night on a bomb. A few hours after the explosion, police evacuated the Empire State Building because of a bomb threat and security was reported to have been tightened at New York airports. A helicopter airlifted a pregnant woman to safety from the roof of one of the towers, the second tallest buildings in the world. With electricity shut off, hundreds of people were stranded in the towers for hours, many stuck in lifts and others climbing down dark, smoke-filled stairs. Some walked down from as high as the 105th floor. Financial markets in New York were thrown in disarray because the many brokers and financial service firms housed in the World Trade Center had to shut down their operations. The explosion left a gaping hole in the underground car park and brought down the ceiling of the Port Authority-Trans Hudson train station below it. Most of the injured suffered from inhaling smoke that billowed up through lift shafts, stairways and ventilator systems. The blast was being investigated by the New York City Police bomb squad and the FBI. As accidental causes such as a gas leak or electrical fire were ruled out, the authorities said unofficially it looked increasingly like a bombing. One newsagency said it had learnt that a group claiming to represent Croatian militants made a phone call 15 minutes before the explosion to claim responsibility. Another unconfirmed report said a local police station got a phone call from a group calling itself the 'Serbian Liberation Front' claiming to have caused the blast. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, speaking to reporters at the scene, would not confirm or deny that a bomb was involved. He said police had received seven calls, none claiming responsibility, though one caller said: 'It was not an accident.' About 100,000 people work at the buildings in the World Trade Centre complex, including the twin towers, which rank second in height to the Sears Tower office block in Chicago. One office worker, teaching an accounting class on the 94th floors, said: 'I'm just glad to be alive. We felt the tremor. It was like being in an earthquake.' Office workers put moistened towels and clothing over their faces as they made their way through the smoke to the exits. One stock broker told how he was on the 31st floor when the explosion hit. He got down to the 13th floor, but a locked exit door left him stranded with 70 other people in an office where they smashed some windows to get air. They were freed by firefighters after about 45 minutes. The fire caused limited damage to some over-the-counter market computers at brokerage firms and led to the early closing of the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange at the complex.</p>

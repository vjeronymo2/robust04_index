			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pasqua's Secret Law"] </F>   [Text] Pasqua is getting ready to throw a big stone in the  majority's waters. At the Ministry of Interior he is discreetly  preparing a bill aimed at organizing primaries for the  presidential election. In light of the difficulties the Union  for French Democracy (UDF) and the Rally for the Republic (RPR)  are experiencing to reach an agreement for a single list for the  European Parliament election, he is more than ever convinced of  the primaries' usefulness. More than five years after launching  the idea of deciding between the different presidential  candidates in his camp, this time Pasqua decided to resort to  extraordinary measures to achieve it. Since he heads the  Ministry of Interior and commands its resources, Pasqua is  henceforth sure of attaining his objective. "When I have an  idea, I don't give up, and this one above all," he notes. Pasqua  wants to be the man that allowed the Right to win the 1995  presidential elections. The only key to success is sending a  sole candidate to the first round. He remembers the 1988 failure  only too well. He also knows that in one year, the majority  candidates may be even more numerous than in 1988. Moreover, it  is the best way to pronounce himself officially neither for  Jacques Chirac nor for Edouard Balladur, but for the winner.  Supported by the prime minister, Pasqua has entrusted many  Ministry directors with the task of preparing the bill for the  primaries. The directorate of political affairs, the electoral  bureau and his adviser, William Abitbol, have almost refused to  have anything to do with it, but the project will stay on the  back burner until the cantonal elections so as not to sow  discord within the majority at election time, given that the UDF  and Giscard now reject this procedure, for which they  nonetheless opted in 1990. The former president of the Republic  believes it no longer conforms to the spirit of the  constitution. As for Chirac, after having insistently demanded  it for many years, he has been strangely silent on the issue  since Balladur has been prime minister and enjoys a high poll  rating. For his part, Raymond Barre remains firm in his  position. He still terms this project a "veritable  cretin-deceiver." The minister of interior and his advisers  believe in the success of their plan and ironically note that  "of course, the UDF may not take it too well." Pasqua is taking  every possible precaution. He has asked numerous legal experts  to use their knowledge to avoid constitutional problems. The  charter that the UDF and the RPR jointly prepared in 1991  envisioned that only militants would vote in the primaries.  Next, a grand electorate college was envisioned in case of early  presidential elections similar to those in which de Gaulle was  elected in 1958. However, in the Pasqua project, all voters,  either from the Right or from the Left, would be invited to cast  a ballot, even if Balladur still favors a grand electoral  college. Question: wouldn't leftist voters choose the worse  rightist candidate? "This is an argument for intellectuals," the  Ministry of Interior explains. So that the constitutional  council is not affected, the 1991 charter on the primaries was  not adhered to on another point. It would make this pre-first  round "compulsory" for their two political parties. In the bill  concocted at the Ministry of Interior, the system of primaries  could be applied to all parties wishing to use it. This is an  fundamental difference, because compulsion would need a  constitutional reform. The project thus envisions that, on one  or many Sundays, all mayoralties, including socialist and  communist ones, open their doors to voters to choose their  candidate for the presidential election. As in any other  election, municipalies would be responsible for organizing the  election. The Ministry's competent services have calculated that  the project would cost 70 million francs. Who will pay? Two  hypotheses were quickly discarded: the first would have the  state, and hence taxpayers, bear the burden; the second would  levy a tax on the municipalities. So, political parties would  pay. The more there would be, the lower the bill for everyone!  However, municipalities would still advance the sums needed for  organizing. They would then be reimbursed by the state, which  would reimburse itself by not contributing to political parties  the monies owed within the context of the law on financing  political parties. The project has its limitations: it cannot  prohibit unlucky candidates from running in the presidential  elections. The project would immediately be rejected by the  Constitutional Council. It would thus be a matter of a  "gentleman's agreement," explains an Interior Ministry  official. Only a leading candidate would present himself in the  first round. One issue is still pending: should the leading  candidate have an absolute or a relative majority? Electoral  experts and jurists have not yet decided. However, they should  do so soon, to allow the project to be submitted to Parliament  as early as the spring session, making it possible to organize  the primaries in January 1995. Before that, the project "aimed  at organizing the primaries" should be submitted to the State  Council, then to the Council of Ministers. At the Ministry,  everyone is expecting a general outcry. According to Abitbol,  "we certainly shall have no legal difficulties, but we ought to  expect political reservations." First of all, from the PS  [Socialist Part], which is "tired of voting for texts that suit  the affairs of the UDF and the RPR," and knows that if the  project came to fruition, the party would surely lose the  presidential elections. Guy Carcassonne, a constitutional expert  and a Rocard adviser, admits that while the project is not  anticonstitutional, it is revolting and "crazy." Secondly, from  the UDF: while constitutional expert Didier Maus sees no legal  problems in the project as conceived, he does not favor it. UDF  officials prefer to think that this law will never see the light  of day. Giscard followers note they would not vote for such a  project.    However, numerous Republican Party and Social Democratic  Center party officials believe that this is the only way to  avoid a new Giscard-Chirac confrontation and relinquish the  place to Balladur. While Pasqua's entourage is working on the  text to make it impeccable, it states its readiness to discuss  it with the UDF, on condition that it be only on a problem of  commas!</p>

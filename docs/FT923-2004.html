			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): The Week Ahead THE BIG results event of next week is on Wednesday when British Aerospace reports. It is the one chance for John Cahill, the distressed group's new chairman, to clear the decks and produce - as he has promised - a solution to the company's regional aircraft problem. At the interim stage a year ago BAe unveiled a sharp fall to pre-tax profits of Pounds 86m (Pounds 146m) and a Pounds 432m rights issue. Whatever profits it eked out in the first half of this year will be swamped by restructuring costs which could approach Pounds 750m. Next week will bring more results from the battered construction sector. The reported profit or loss at Tarmac on Tuesday and Costain on Wednesday will be less interesting than the news on the restructuring efforts essential to their recoveries. Tarmac will probably report an interim loss of about Pounds 14m (pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.2m, itself a sharp decline from the previous year) and a dividend of 2p (3p). Provisions are likely on the value of its land bank and for restructuring costs. Investors are also anxious for news of a buyer for Econowaste, the UK waste management business. Costain might make a minimal profit of around Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 5.7m) but it too needs to take some hefty provisions. Partial flotation of its Australian coal business has yet to be finalised but should generate a much-needed Pounds 45m or so. But the markets will want to hear of further restructuring plans. Barratt Developments, the house builder, took its pain in 1991 with a loss of Pounds 106m. For the year to June it should report a profit of up to Pounds 7m and perhaps a modest dividend. It is back under the management of Sir Lawrie Barratt, its founder, but is suffering from the margin and volume reductions of the housing market. Given the prospect for lower interest rates, Sir Lawrie will probably be even more optimistic than usual. Laura Ashley, the fabrics and frocks group is likely to report a small interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 528,000) on Wednesday as its energetic chief executive Jim Maxmin continues to press ahead with his corporate changes.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TITAN FORTUNES TURN INTO 9-6 DEFEAT  </P> <P> It was only a week ago that Cal State Fullerton was cruising along with a  seven-game winning streak. Saturday, however, the Titans lost their third  consecutive game, a 9-6 defeat to Cal State Long Beach in Big West Conference  action that proved Fullerton's fortunes had indeed turned.  </P> <P> "A triple play didn't start the day well," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell said.  </P> <P> Despite their 15 hits and six runs, the triple play exemplified the Titans'  day. Fullerton consistently had runners on base and consistently failed to  advance them.  </P> <P> The triple play came in the top of the second with Fullerton trailing, 3-0.  Frank Charles led off the inning with a double and Steve Sisco followed with an  infield single to bring up Matt Hattabaugh. Hattabaugh lined to first baseman  Don Barbara, who stepped on the bag to force Sisco and threw to second base to  force Charles.  </P> <P> It didn't seem to matter much thereafter, though, as Fullerton scored three  runs in the third inning to tie the score.  </P> <P> But from that point on, it was a day for Long Beach as the Titans wasted even  more opportunities.  </P> <P> "We had the bases loaded three times and we didn't even hit the ball," Cochell  said. "We had plenty of opportunities."  </P> <P> Long Beach, meanwhile, was creating opportunities. The 49ers got three hits  with the count at two strikes and no balls.  </P> <P> "We practice that in the batting cages so I guess its paying off," Long Beach  Coach Dave Snow said. "We're the top-hitting team in the conference, so we're  very confident up there (despite the count)."  </P> <P> Long Beach (29-18-1, 6-6 in conference) scored four runs in the bottom of the  third inning, two more in the fourth and was never seriously threatened after  that.  </P> <P> The 49ers had 11 hits, seven of which were doubles, and had runners in scoring  position every inning.  </P> <P> James Popoff (7-4) gave up seven runs in three innings for the loss. Fullerton  used three relievers who faired only slightly better.  </P> <P> Rich Gonzales singled in each of his four at bats for one bright spot for  Fullerton.  </P> <P> In another Big West Conference game:  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara 6, UC Irvine 4 -- Mike Czarnetzki hit a three-run homer in the  ninth inning for host UC Santa Barbara (34-14, 9-5). Steve May (4-3) pitched an  inning in relief to take the loss for Irvine (28-22, 5-9).  </P> <P> Chris Gallego had three hits and three RBIs and Ozmar DeChavez had three hits  and scored a run for Irvine. The teams conclude the series today at 1 p.m. at  UC Santa Barbara.  </P></p>

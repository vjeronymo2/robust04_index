			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, 14 April (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The  Sichuan Provincial Government recently decided to sell some  state-owned enterprises suffering serious deficits to legal  persons in China and overseas in a planned way.    The Sichuan Provincial State-Owned Assets Administration and  Finance Office is encouraging enterprises to dispose of assets  in various categories that are no longer applicable for use or  indispensable, while giving permission to sell some workshops or  factory branches with an unreasonable product mix and poor  economic results, as well as some state-owned enterprises  suffering serious deficits.    It is stipulated that before state-owned assets are sold,  they must be assessed by an asset-appraisal organization, which  will set a base price for the sale to a legal person;  alternatively, their sale must be reported to state-owned asset  departments at the same level and gain their consent.</p>

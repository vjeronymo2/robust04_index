			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Fuji Xerox </F> Company, Ltd.: "Proposal on New Joint Government-Private Sector  Japan-U.S. Summit"]    [Text] The Only Ways To Reduce Surplus: Numerical  Targets or Price Adjustment    There have been bewildering changes in Japan-U.S. relations  since the recent breakdown of the bilateral summit -- rapid  appreciation of the yen right after the summit, the USTR [U.S.  Trade Representative] mention of sanctions over the mobile phone  issue, a quick political solution to this issue, and revival of  the Super 301 provision. And then, on 8 April, Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was  designated his successor. Later, the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] left the coalition, a minority cabinet was formed,  and there have been strong signs of an approaching political  realignment. The effect of this on Japan-U.S. relations can be  considerable.    For the U.S. Government, since it was expecting continuity  in  foreign policy and the trade negotiations, and was anticipating  the installation of a pragmatic cabinet even before Hata was  elected prime minister, it was somewhat reassured. However, the  SDPJ's withdrawal from the coalition came as a great surprise,  even though it had been believed all along that such an event  would come sooner or later. Undoubtedly, this has greatly  enhanced the U.S. feeling of anxiety about Japan.    How do we find a way out of this situation? More than  anything else, the Japanese people should realize that "the  framework talks' purpose is to see a tangible reduction in  Japan's surplus. There are only two ways to do this: reduce the  surplus numerically or through price adjustment. If we refuse  to do it numerically, appreciation of the yen will be the  inevitable consequence." Toward this end, while numerical  targets would be out of the question at the microeconomic level,  in macroeconomics, it would be advisable for the government to  indicate its political will through numerical targets for the  ratio of current account surplus to gross domestic product, or  for efforts to narrow the price gap between Japan and foreign  countries. Furthermore, in macroeconomic policy, measures that  will have obvious and "impressive" effects in stimulating the  economy, such as adding another 100 trillion yen to the 430  trillion yen public investment program, or implementing income  tax reductions for at least three years in advance [before  implementing the consumption tax hike]--which the Keizai Doyukai  [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] has suggested--will  be necessary. With regard to deregulation, a concrete and  effective list should be compiled as soon as possible, and a  powerful third- party watchdog organ should also be established.  <H5>  Applying the Objective Criteria Is Japan's Job </H5>   A certain measure of progress will also be needed on the  issue of numerical targets or objective criteria, which was the  immediate cause for the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. summit and  the framework talks. Specifically, Japan has to make the United  States pledge not to demand numerical targets for each  individual sector. President Bill Clinton and responsible U.S.  negotiators repeatedly made statements to this effect at the  news conference after the summit meeting and on other occasions.  It would be possible to make this an official commitment.    On the other hand, with regard to objective criteria, it  should be possible to quantify and measure the relationship  between the degree of "acceptance" of products and services--for  instance, degree of customer satisfaction--and the degree of  "penetration" in each other's market in the past and at present.  It would also be possible to compare and evaluate the tempo of  the penetration and expansion of U.S. products and services in  Japan in terms of similar applicable indices in other markets.    It would just be rational to reach prior agreement that:  Through a comparison of the degree of "acceptance" at a future  point in time with that of the present, or through a comparison  of U.S. products with similar products from Japan and other  countries, if a positive change can be confirmed, this will be  taken to mean a corresponding progress in the penetration and  expansion of such products in the Japanese market. It would  certainly be possible to evaluate the relationship between  actual degree of "acceptance" and "penetration" when that  "future point in time" is reached, or even in the course of  reaching such a point.    While the United States is responsible for giving up its  demand on sector-specific numerical targets, it is Japan's job  to take the initiative in the matter of applying objective  criteria. If objective criteria are used in the above-described  manner, this cannot be termed managed trade. The important  thing is, such an evaluation process should be conducted as an  independent activity of the private sector in all areas, except  for the "government-reach" sectors (sectors under government  jurisdiction).    The World Is Looking At Japan and the United States    It must not be forgotten that, in building a new world order  after the Cold War, Asia and the world look to Japan and the  United States to exercise responsible, mature leadership. One  issue here is domestic reforms in Japan. Another is Japan-U.S.  relations, specifically, the solution of economic issues between  the two countries not only from a bilateral perspective, but  also dealing with them with a shared common perception between  the two countries from a multilateral perspective.    In this regard, Japan and the United States can experiment  on  the new approach of holding a joint "new Japan-U.S. summit" for  both the governments and the private sectors of both countries  to reach a responsible conclusion in economic negotiations, and  to discuss major mid- and long-term bilateral issues.    Japan and the United States hold summits twice a year. One  of these can be held as a joint government-private sector summit  alternately in Japan and the United States. If the boundary  between government and private-sector meetings is demolished,  leaders of the governments and private sectors in both  countries, headed by the prime minister and the president, can  sit down at the same conference table and build a consensus on  bilateral issues of common concern. Such a venue may be able to  come up with more coherent and more consistent solutions to  various problems.    In any case, time is running out. We certainly hope that  Prime Minister Hata will exercise strong leadership to resolve  the pending issues between Japan and the United States by taking  the initiative in the issue of objective criteria, as discussed  above, and by adopting the new approach to bilateral summits.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sims Food runs up deficit of Pounds 586,000 AS HAD been prefigured almost a month ago Sims Food Group, the meat processor and supplier, fell into the red in the year to March 31 after a non-recurring exceptional provision of Pounds 6.59m. From pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.84m restated for FRS 3, the group fell to losses of Pounds 586,000. Turnover rose to Pounds 312.7m (Pounds 251.4m), an advance of 24 per cent, though Sims said, stripping out the effect of acquisitions, that there had been an underlying organic growth of 9 per cent. Mr David Brady, finance director, said this was 'encouraging', given overall static meat prices over the year. Interest payable grew to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 1.66m). Mr Brady said that behind the exceptional charge - to cover the writing-off of under-utilised equipment for storing meat under pressure, the clearing of the non-core Country Feast and J Redmond, and the restructuring and reduction of the catering and retail divisions to more accurately reflect lower demand - lay badly eroded margins. Part of the problem was that Sims had outlaid EC-driven capital expenditure more quickly than turned out to be necessary because a three-year period of grace had been granted. Further, the devaluation of sterling and the alignment of 'green rates of currency' more directly with market rates led eventually to shortage-driven price rises, only part of which the supermarkets helped absorb. Mr Brady said that all the bad news was in these figures, though prices were unlikely to fall much within the next two years. Sims commands some 40 per cent of the fast-food hamburger market and is the second biggest supplier of fresh meat to the catering trade. Earnings per share last time of 15.9p were turned into losses of 5p. However, again as forewarned in June, the final dividend is reduced to 4.5p (8.25p), resulting in a total of 7.5p (11.25p) for the year.</p>

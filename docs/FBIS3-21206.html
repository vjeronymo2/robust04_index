Microminiaturization and the increased scale of  integration necessary to deal with this are gradually increasing  the importance of wiring technology. This is because the wiring  process has become the process determining the yield and  reliability of devices. The recent trend is that the wiring  structure itself is complex, in addition to microminiaturization  and the attendant increase in the number of layers of wiring.  This is apparent specifically with plugging technology for  filling fine contact holes and the stacking with high melting  point materials to assure the reliability of Al wiring.    Sputtering has played an important role in the fabrication  of  Al wiring. Although CVD is gradually penetrating the domain of  metal film fabrication, sputtering technology may remain  necessary as long as Al wiring is used because Al is a very  active material and sputtering is beneficial for obtaining good  film quality from such a material. Since sputtering equipment  supplanted deposition equipment in metal film fabrication, it  has experienced various technical innovations including  wafer-level processing and the use of multiple chambers. After  composite processing with CVD or annealing has almost reached a  practical level, almost all of the present sputtering equipment  is being made with cluster tools.    This report describes the configuration and functions of the  sputtering equipment required for manufacturing 256M DRAM-class  devices, but in this changing environment it is difficult to  present the total picture. The report first describes the  dissatisfaction of users concerning existing sputtering  equipment, then considers some of the functions required for  future sputtering equipment.  <H5>  Problems in Equipment Configuration </H5>   First, let us consider the equipment configuration. To  assure  uniformity in film thickness, sputtering needs a target with 1.5  to 2 times the diameter of the wafer. For example, as shown in  Figure 1, a target with a diameter of 300 to 360mm is used with  an 8-inch diameter wafer. This necessitates a larger process  chamber than CVD equipment. Following the use of multiple  chambers and wafer size increase, the equipment now has a very  large footprint, making it almost impossible to install adjacent  to other process equipment. Apparently, equipment manufacturers  are unaware of this problem. Users need equipment with a body  depth of less than two meters. It is also desirable to reduce  the size of auxiliary equipment such as the power supply unit,  or to stack it to reduce its footprint.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-24A>           Figure 1. Positioning of Sputtering Target for 8-Inch </FIG>       Since layered wiring started to be fabricated using  multi-chamber equipment, throughput has halved compared to  conventional film fabrication using Al alone. What is worse, the  complexity of multi-layer wiring and layered wiring has  increased the number of sputtering processes. This drives the  urgent need for multi-chamber sputtering equipment with high  throughput. To increase throughput, it may also be necessary to  review the semi-independent chamber system using plate transfer,  without continuing the use of arm transport systems.  <H5>  Problems in Basic Functions </H5>   Next, consider some of the basic functions of the equipment.  Up to the present, the performance of process equipment has  often been evaluated under simplified conditions that differ  from actual operating conditions. The simplified conditions do  not emulate controlling the actual device manufacturing process.  This evaluation method for controlling or monitoring the status  of actual film fabrication itself needs evaluation.    Particle reduction is the most important topic in sputtering  equipment for the 256M DRAM generation. While clean-room  technology is advancing, the reduction of other factors causing  particles in manufacturing equipment is not sufficient.  Especially, following the microminiaturization and multiple  layers of Al wiring, particles from the sputtering equipment  have become the main factor degrading yield. In general,  particles attached to wafers have been evaluated by simply  examining the transport operation. However, since it was found  that particles are also produced during film fabrication,  evaluation covering the film fabrication process has become  essential. Measuring particles had been difficult because metal  films have high reflectivity and large surface coarseness but,  as shown in Figure 2, measurement is possible even when metal  films are used. Of course, equipment which can guarantee a low  particle count even with film is desirable.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-25A>           Figure 2. Examples of Measurements of Particles With Metal </FIG>       Major sources of particles in sputtering equipment are the  wafer transportation system and the targets and anti-deposition  plate in the process chamber. With regard to the wafer  transportation system, it has been proposed to apply vertical or  face-down transportation, but the correct method to reduce  particles may be to simplify the wafer transportation system  rather than to rely on wafer orientation. With regard to  particles from the target, they can be reduced greatly by using  full-face eroded cathodes.[.sup]1[/] Dust from the  anti-deposition plate or clamping mechanism is also a source of  worry. In-situ cleaning is used in practice with CVD equipment  but practical use of in-situ cleaning with sputtering is deemed  difficult. Problems include attaching of the film over a wide  area of the anti-deposition plate and the adverse influence of  reactive gas on the fabricated film quality. Improving the  bonding force by plasma conditioning or reducing thermal stress  by maintaining the anti-deposition plate heating temperature  have been proposed, but a more essential improvement is  desirable. Figure 3 shows the results of composition analysis of  particles detected after film fabrication with Ti and TiON. SUS  and SiO[.sup]2[/] particles are derived from the transport  system and Al and TiON particles are believed to be produced in  the process chambers, though the specific positions cannot be  identified.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-25B>           Figure 3. Example of Result of Particle Analysis of </FIG>       With wafer heating, much sputtering equipment is now capable  of heating the stage up to 600C, and temperature  distribution is also being improved. The technology can be  considered to have reached the practical level when application  in high-temperature sputtering, which plugs contact holes by  flowing Al, is taken into account.[.sup]2[/] However, while  the temperature during film fabrication and its distribution are  most important, they are not controlled completely for the  present because of the difficulty in temperature measurement  during film fabrication. It is desirable to monitor the  temperature during film fabrication, control it within 10C  from the target temperature, and control the temperature  distribution over the wafer within 10C. Gas heating by  flowing gas between the wafer back-side and stage is  advantageous for preventing an excessive temperature rise during  film fabrication. To improve temperature uniformity it may be  necessary to divide the stage into several areas and apply  independent temperature control to each.    With the degree of vacuum, a base pressure of the order of  10[.sup]-9[/] Torr is now available in mass-production  machines thanks to their ultrahigh vacuum capability. An  ultrahigh vacuum is necessary for fabricating high-reliability  Al wiring with a large grain diameter and good orientation, and  to stabilize the process of high-temperature sputtering.  Nevertheless, with substrate heating of around 500C  required for high-temperature sputtering, for example, a vacuum  of the order of 10[.sup]-9[/] Torr has not been achieved due  to increased degassing from the chamber. It is desirable that  equipment achieve a base pressure of the order of  10[.sup]-9[/] Torr, even used for heated film fabrication at  600C. However low the base pressure, it is still  meaningless if there is any degassing from the target and its  surroundings. Figure 4 shows that the peak of H[.sup]2[/]  rises when Al film fabrication is started. This is because  moisture is emitted from the target surroundings; this reacts  with Al and H[.sup]2[/] is left as a result. Such degassing  should also be reduced.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-26A>           Figure 4. Analysis of Gases in Al Film Fabrication (with </FIG>       Additionally, film fabrication rate monitoring, which has  been possible with batch-type systems, is not possible when a  wafer-level method is used. Considering the increasing necessity  of fabricating thin films such as reflection prevention film  with high controllability, the revival of this function is  desirable.  <H5>  Desirable New Functions </H5>   The following describes the new functions desirable for  sputtering equipment.    The first desirable function is the improvement of coverage.  In the age of 256M DRAMs, contact holes will have diameters of  0.3 m and the aspect ratio will be around 3. In such a case,  ordinary sputtering may be able to achieve only a small  percentage of coverage, which is insufficient even for bonded  layers of blanket tungsten. Coverage can be improved by  increasing the vertically incident component. A solution for  this is collimated sputtering, but this method is difficult to  use due to collimator blocking and particle production problems.  Another possible method is to reduce the scattering of sputtered  particles by decreasing sputtering gas pressure. As ECR  sputtering[.sup]3[/] has been proposed as a specific method,  the announcement of a practical machine is awaited. It is also  effective to decrease oblique incident components from the  target surroundings by decreasing the target diameter or by  increasing the distance between the target and wafer. But, this  is a trade-off with the film thickness distribution in the wafer.    Another attractive new function is combining with CVD or  annealing. It is estimated that microminiaturization of the  contact holes would lead to the necessity of continuous  processing to avoid oxidation due to atmospheric exposure in  order to secure the ohmic contact. Specific merits of this  method have already been reported[.sup]4[/] but further study  may be required on the inevitability of using it on a  manufacturing line.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   In the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, sputtering is  increasing in importance as a process determining yield and  reliability. However, existing sputtering equipment in which the  use of cluster tools is advanced poses problems in terms of  footprint and throughput. Since particles will be a more  important problem following a microminiaturization, reducing  them will be the most important topic in the device  manufacturing of 256M generation DRAMs. The advantages of  composite processes which are attracting attention require  further study.

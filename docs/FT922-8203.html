			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Toyoda Auto Loom tumbles 20% pre-tax TOYODA Automatic Loom Works, a leading Japanese machinery-maker and the original company of the Toyota Motor group, yesterday reported its first fall in annual pre-tax profits in five years. The figure fell 20.3 per cent in the year to March, to Y24.1bn (Dollars 181.20m), as margins were squeezed by rising costs. Sales growth, meanwhile, was hit by the slowdown in industrial investment. Sales were flat at Y583.4bn. Sales fell 10.6 per cent in textile machinery; 12 per cent in forklift trucks; and 17.4 per cent in parts for car air-conditioners. Car-related business, including assembly work carried out under contract for Toyota, increased 9.8 per cent. The company said it saved Y4bn through rationalisation, but suffered a Y2bn foreign exchange loss, a Y4bn increase in labour costs, and a Y3.4bn rise in other costs. It also saw a Y1.6bn drop in non-operating profit. Toyoda Machine Works, a leading machine tool maker and also a Toyota group company, reported a 75.3 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits, to Y2.6bn, on a sales decline of 2.4 per cent to Y174.6bn.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / A taxman assesses years of change: Tax changes alter working patterns THE postwar tower blocks of Southend in Essex may not seem the most obvious place from which to watch the changing face of Whitehall. But the local tax office has experienced many pressures from the Inland Revenue during the 1980s. Many associate Thatcherism with rolling back the frontiers of the state and winding down the number of civil servants employed by central government. But that is certainly not the view of Mr Simon Lidster, former director of taxes in Southend. 'Staffing has remained pretty much the same,' Mr Lidster says. 'But there has been a big shift in emphasis in the type of work we do. The changes balanced out.' Total employment in the office is virtually unaltered from 1979. That is not to say that numbers have not fluctuated. He recalls a modest wave of new recruitment in 1990, for instance, after the introduction of independent taxation for married women. At other times, staffing was wound down, such as after the abolition of the regular revaluations for the rates and the introduction of automatic deductions of tax on bank and building society interest. In the long term, most change has been in the jobs that people undertake. 'When I started, we didn't have computers,' he says. 'It was all paperwork. That shifted about 10 years ago, and people moved on to compliance work.' As with offices around the country, Southend introduced 'ghostbusters' - who hunt for people who have never registered for tax - and others who chased the other constituents of the black economy such as moonlighters. Another employee in the Southend office during the 1980s says: 'It was a time of great change and challenge. It wasn't an easy period to go through. But I think everyone can see the benefits.'</p>

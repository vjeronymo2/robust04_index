			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (8): Have faith, customers told  -Retail Prices ELECTRICITY prices in Britain will come down as a result of privatisation. That is what Mr John Wakeham, former energy secretary, has said and what industry leaders such as Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, believe. The message to consumers is - wait and see. Give the new electricity market a chance to work, and prices will begin to fall. Not everyone is so sanguine. 'The competitive market which was promised has not yet materialised,' was the damning verdict delivered by the Commons energy select committee in February. Offer, the electricity industry watchdog - itself the focus of much criticism from large consumers who say it is not tough enough - echoed this in its annual report. 'The lack of effective choice in the market this year is a most unsatisfactory feature of the present situation,' it said. These two reports came two years after Mr Wakeham launched the privatisation of electricity with the words: 'From now on, there will be unprecedented levels of competition in electricity supply. The price of electricity will begin to be driven by market forces.' He added: 'I believe that electricity privatisation is going to be good news for all the industry's customers, and good news for its employees.' Employees, especially those who have bought shares, may well agree. Customers are a different matter. Over the last few months the complaints of large electricity consumers about how privatisation has pushed up their electricity bills have filled the press. 'Angry and frustrated electricity users' assembled on April 7 to complain against 'unacceptable and unreasonable price increases,' said the Major Energy Users Council (MEUC). New contracts had been forced on users faced with little evidence of the promised 'competition' or opportunities to shop around, it added. The MEUC has long argued that its larger members - steel, paper and chemical companies - face increases in the basic cost of their electricity of up to 30 per cent this year. Privatisation, it says, has failed large electricity users, and made them uncompetitive in Europe. Mr Neil Tribick, vice chairman of the electricity group of the MEUC and group energy buyer for Rank Hovis MacDougall, says the company will have to pay around Pounds 18m more for its electricity this year. The National Health service, with 130 sites around the country, is expected to face increases of between 14 and 28 per cent, according to the MEUC. One paper company has written to Mr Wakeham saying it faces increases of 20-25 per cent. But the government and generators argue that these companies are not typical. Very large electricity users face especially high increases, because they formerly received government subsidies removed at privatisation. Moreover, the government adds, the place for large consumers to complain about their bills is Brussels. Prices are lower in Europe because governments subsidise their electricity bills by charging domestic consumers more, while the UK government has ruled out cross subsidies of this kind. But what electricity costs the average industrial consumer is hard to measure. Mr John Topliss, chairman of the MEUC electricity group, says most companies are paying around 10 per cent more than before privatisation, while National Power says they are paying just marginally more. Surveys from consumer groups such as the MEUC and the Energy Intensive Users Association suggest that prices to average industrial users fell by between 10 and 20 per cent after privatisation - in the year from April 1990. They then rose by 5 to 6 per cent in the year from April 1991. This year (from April 1992) increases are expected of 10 to 20 per cent. The Department of Energy's publication Energy Trends shows large electricity consumers paying 3.55p per unit at the end of 1991, compared with 3.51p at the end of 1989. But although some customers are paying more than before privatisation, some are clearly paying around the same, or even less. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, says customers must just be patient, because prices are starting to fall and will fall further. 'There are prospects for real long-term reductions, partly from the working through of lower fuel prices - provided our plans for cheaper fuel aren't frustrated - and partly from the impact of competitive pressures on our costs.' 'Before privatisation it was said the old area boards used to treat large customers like chattels. If they do that now, the customers can walk elsewhere.' So far, the generators' profits do not suggest they are overcharging. It is equally hard to counter their argument that last year's lower prices were an unsustainable phenomenon due to lower oil prices, high coal stocks and post-flotation jostling for market share. Domestic consumers, meanwhile, are not doing so badly. Their bills will go up by around 2.5 per cent this April, compared with increases of an average 11.3 per cent last April, and around 4.6 per cent in April 1990. But Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, argues that this year's modest increase is no proof of privatisation's virtue. 'In the run up to privatisation, prices were artificially high, as part of the fattening up process.' Domestic prices, he calculates, have increased by around 40 per cent since 1986, the year privatisation was announced. There has, however, been other good news for all consumers. Not only have the regional electricity companies improved their service, but the government no longer subsidises heavy industry at the expense of householders. Consumers also know far more about the costs of nuclear power, previously hidden in the CEGB. And investment in new environmentally-friendly technologies has moved ahead.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (1): Search for a new identity - A poverty-stricken state has clawed its way up to become one of the more successful in the 'New South' The people of Tennessee spend much of the time comparing their state with other states or cities of the South. 'Not as bad as Mississippi or Louisiana,' you hear of the educational system. 'Behind Atlanta, but ahead of Charlotte,' someone says of Nashville. Perhaps it isn't surprising. A land-locked state which shares its borders with eight others, Tennessee sits squarely in the middle of the South. It looks like a fiction created by map makers; a thin wedge cut out of the underbelly of the US which extends between two distant natural borders - the Mississippi river to the west, the Appalachian mountains to the east. What can there be that unites this disparate place? But there is another reason for the comparisons, the constant assessment and reassessment of how well Tennessee is doing. The new middle classes in Tennessee's cities are searching for an identity. Once, the state took its identity from the land: the cotton fields of the the Mississippi delta, for example, or the wooded hills of the east. The importance of cotton - and the textile businesses which it supported - has receded. Tennessee has suffered the same rural depopulation as much of the US. Many of the new jobs are in manufacturing plants, such as carmaking, or service industries such as healthcare or distribution. Many of the managers who run these new industries have moved to the state from the north-east of the country, from the nation's rust belt, or from some far-away country. Tennessee has been spectacularly successful in attracting overseas companies in recent years, particularly from Japan and the UK. Mr Bob Margo of Vanderbilt University in Nashville calls it 'the end of regional economic identities' in the US. The transformation has been striking. A poverty-stricken, largely rural state has clawed its way up from the bottom of the pile to become, in economic terms, one of the more successful in the 'New South.' A decade ago, Tennessee ranked 45th out of 50 US states in terms of per capita income. Now, it is 35th. A recent target set by a new coalition between business and government agencies, known as Tennessee Tomorrow, is to reach parity with the national average within 10 years. It has already come a long way from Roosevelt's 'New Deal' era, when the Tennessee Valley Authority was created to bring cheap power and, with it, jobs to an impoverished region. The Corporation for Enterprise Development, a not-for-profit entity based in Washington DC which compares the economic performance and prospects of US states, puts Tennessee in the top fifth of the country in terms of economic vitality - thanks to a diverse economy, strong inward investment in manufacturing and the competitiveness of its existing businesses. Analyses such as these usually put Tennessee ahead of immediate neighbours Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Arkansas, as well as more distant Southern rivals such as Florida. But the state's economic growth struggles to be compared with Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. While these comparisons are encouraging, others are less flattering. In particular, Tennessee suffers from a long-standing underinvestment in its education system, which ranks at least as bad as its Southern neighbours. The state comes 41st among US states in its high school graduation rate, and a lowly 47th in terms of the number of heads of households who have had at least 12 years of education. Also, Tennesseans have done little to spread their increasing wealth across the population as a whole. 'Where it (the state) really scores poorly is equity - there is a great income disparity between urban and rural, and between the rich and poor,' says Mr Brian Dabson, head of the Corporation for Enterprise Development. By the Corporation's measure of income distribution - comparing the incomes of the most wealthy fifth of the state's population with those of the poorest - Tennessee ranks 45th in the country. Also, it retains a regressive taxation system, with a hefty sales tax and no tax on earned income. Efforts to introduce a state lottery - a move in line with other states, and one which would raise an estimated Dollars 100m a year - have fallen foul of Tennessee voters' disapproval of all gambling. This is, after all, the heart of the Bible Belt. Much of the poverty that remains is to be found in the countryside. The growth that has come to the state's biggest cities - Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga and Knoxville - has largely failed to spread into other areas. 'We did very well in the 1980s but it was concentrated in urban areas. Rural areas have suffered,' says Mr John Gnuschke, head of Memphis State University's centre for business and economic research. The state administration of Governor Ned McWherter, who this years completes two terms in office, has made efforts to right the balance. Mr McWherter, a Democrat who likes to relate how he was born on the kitchen table of a farm in the north-west of the state, has put rural development high on his agenda. An infrastructure programme has added 1,000 miles of new roads since Mr McWherter took office, linking rural areas with the state's highway system. Under a new healthcare scheme, Tennessee has this year extended a degree of medical cover to 400,000 low-income people who did not previously qualify. And spending on education has been lifted, with a redirection of resources towards poorer areas. 'Within one or two years, funding will be equalised within one or two per cent for every girl and boy across Tennessee,' Mr McWherter says. The question is not whether the administration has targeted the right areas for development, but rather whether it has done enough. Tennessee continues to promote itself as an accommodating home for business, with lower wages than the national average, a more conducive tax regime and fewer trades union members. It is a message which has brought companies to the state but the greater prosperity that has resulted has failed to trickle down sufficiently to alleviate some deep-seated social problems. 'Think of it as another country,' says Mr Margo. 'It has come a long way from a very, very poor base, and it is continuing to converge. But the last few yards will be the hardest: they involve the convergence of attitudes.' Meanwhile, cities such as Nashville and, to a lesser extent, Memphis, are discovering a new sense of confidence as important centres in their own right. Memphis, on the far south-eastern tip of the state, is frequently referred to as 'the biggest city in Mississippi.' It has more in common with the broad flat region that spans the Mississippi delta than the hilly central or eastern regions of Tennessee. Music has brought national recognition to both Nashville, centre of the country music industry, and Memphis, home of the blues. But members of their growing middle-class populations, many of them from outside the state, crave other symbols of their success. The search for a local identity has found its most obvious outlet in the pursuit of a big league sports team. For these emerging cities, a big sports franchise would bring status and exposure nationally, allowing them to stand their ground against the capitals of neighbouring North Carolina and Georgia. 'We want to be like Atlanta - we want a team,' says Mr Gnuschke. 'We're desperate for recognition and acceptance in a national network of successful cities. We're struggling to keep pace.' Everywhere you go, the talk is of bringing a big league sports team to Tennessee. Memphis failed in its attempt to win a football franchise last year, while Nashville is currently in pursuit of both ice hockey and basketball teams. According to Mr Dick Evans, chief operating officer of Gaylord, the entertainment group: 'This community is starving for professional sports. It is the largest market in the nation without a franchise.' Mr Evans, a former head of New York city's Madison Square Garden, is bidding to bring teams to play in a new 20,000-seat arena under construction in downtown Nashville. It may not sound much but for Tennesseans, success would help reinforce the claim that they have finally arrived on the national stage.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farming has low profile on Clinton agenda - The US presidential nominee's rural record is comparatively sparse A VICTORY for Governor Bill Clinton in November's US presidential election could either mean a more confrontational approach with the European Community over farm trade or far-reaching changes in the US farm programme to defuse the current stalemate in the Uruguay Round. The Democratic party platform gives little hint of the direction a Clinton Administration would move on farm policy. It took a bloody, behind-the-scenes battle to produce a two-paragraph mention of 'agriculture and the rural community' and it offers only one clue - a reference to 'family farmers' who must get 'fair prices' for their products is a bow to the liberal wing that backed the unsuccessful campaign of Senator Tom Harkin. Senator Harkin has long pushed for higher price support loans to cover the cost of production, large acreage set-asides, lower government subsidies and a system of supply-management like the one which the EC has been developing. The platform takes a swipe at the 'inattention and hostility' that has characterised Republican farm and rural policy, its 'staggering' costs, and 'its total failure as demonstrated by the record number of rural bankruptcies'. Just as opaque as the platform is the Clinton campaign position paper on trade and agriculture. It misses few of the cliches of the past decade, promising to open new markets for US farm goods, bring down unfair trade barriers, and 'stick up for farmers at the negotiating table'. It vows aggressive use of the Export Enhancement Program - an export subsidy scheme developed to challenge the EC's subsidies. 'When foreign competitors use export trade to gain unfair advantage, Bill Clinton won't just stand by and watch - he'll guarantee a level playing field,' it says. The position paper is more specific on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the governor has supported - provided it is 'the right kind of Nafta,' protecting environmental, food safety and labour interests. The paper promises to ensure that Mexican citrus and vegetable farmers do not undersell US farmers 'through cheap but environmentally hazardous methods'. In its recent 'Putting People First' economic strategy, the Clinton campaign struck out unequivocally about one cut to be made in the US farm budget - subsidies for honey producers - at a savings of Dollars 20m a year. As is usual in the case of presidential campaigns, the candidate is being bombarded with position papers and advice. The governor has praised a transition document, prepared by some of the party's well-known liberals and moderates. The Citizen Transition Project includes Mr Mark Green, consumer advocate; Ms Madeleine Kunin, former governor of Vermont; and Mr Harvey Gantt, unsuccessful senatorial candidate for North Carolina. The idea of the paper is patterned after the conservative blueprint produced in 1980 by the then-obscure Heritage Foundation and embraced by the Reagan Administration. One of the co-authors of the paper's farm section is Mr Mark Richie, a farm activist and a significant force in the opposition to the US farm proposal in the Uruguay Round and the North American Free Trade Agreement. A strong indictment of the Reagan-Bush farm policies and their effect on small and medium-size producers, the transition paper lays the philosophical groundwork for a supply-management programme and the 'de-intensification of production' to preserve the environment and produce safer foods. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it says, should be encouraged to enforce rules already on the books and to define others more precisely in order to curb subsidies and dumping. Failure to do this has driven prices down and thrown farmers off their lands the world over. The Gatt would also be encouraged to use its Article XI to require countries using import controls to link them with internal production controls. 'This linkage, which depends upon supply management to generate a balance between production and consumption, is intended to ensure non-discriminatory treatment for all producers and fair trade. Yet almost all major countries ignore this rule,' the paper says. Although he comes from a rural state, Governor Clinton's record on agriculture is comparatively sparse. By inclination, he is almost obsessively centrist. He has had close ties with a giant poultry producer in his state, but he has also taken a number of steps to save farmers from bankruptcy. Mr Harvey Jo Sanner, an Arkansas farmer and a long-time supporter of Governor Clinton, said the governor understands the need for higher grain prices and 'wouldn't mismanage the farm programme to drop down the prices' as have the Reagan and Bush Administrations. His 'partner' in the campaign - Senator Al Gore, his vice presidential choice - supports programmes to expand the number of commercially viable, family-sized farms and land set-aside programmes for both conservation purposes and to provide a better balance between production and demand. Neither candidate is known to have advocated the import controls thought necessary to keep prices higher. Whatever policy would be pursued if Governor Clinton is elected depends largely upon the recommendations of his cabinet. Speculation is rife about who could be chosen. Retiring Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota is being pushed for agriculture secretary, and Mr Robert Strauss, the US ambassador to Russia, is talked of hopefully to once again serve as US trade representative. It is felt that if anyone can wrap up the Uruguay Round, he can.</p>

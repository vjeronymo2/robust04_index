			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 31 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela on  Tuesday [31 May] said South Africa was looking forward to making  a positive contribution to the Commonwealth, on hearing of the  country's readmission on June 1. "The assumption of Commonwealth  membership on the part of a democratic South Africa is both a  tribute to the momentous changes that have taken place in our  country as well as a challenge for South Africa to play its part  in the worldwide quest for a peaceful, harmonious and caring  world."    The people of South Africa were indebted to the Commonwealth  contribution made to bring about a democratic South Africa, he  added.</p>

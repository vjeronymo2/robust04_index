			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Warnings suppressed by the Politically Correct Sir, In Bronwen Maddox's article, 'Greens' bogus science' (September 6), she correctly remarks that the distortion of the scientific method by certain green organisations 'destroys any notion of proof' and can therefore 'cause legal mayhem'. This is merely a special case of a deeper and wider malaise. Six years ago, also in connection with the perennial public mistrust of science, a colleague and I published an article entitled 'Where Science Has Gone Wrong' in Nature (Vol. 329, pp. 595-8, October 15 1987), in which we explained that the currently taught philosophies of science are epistemologically flawed and socially dangerous. These philosophies reject completely the concepts of scientific objectivity, proof, truth and certainty. These philosophies have therefore been embraced with enthusiasm by all Politically Correct movements which think that objectivity, etc, is the invention of first world science so that its multinational companies can exploit and oppress the Third World, the minorities and the environment. Regrettably, our 1987 warnings were suppressed by the Politically Correct, and overlooked by the Politically InCorrect, to the further detriment of both science and society. I hope that now they will be heeded. Theo Theocharis, 200 Merton Road, London SW18 5SW</p>

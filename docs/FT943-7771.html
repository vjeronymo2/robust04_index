			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Strictly Ballroom meets Midsummer Night's Dream - Voluptuous paintings, sensuous music and sex on the Fringe as the Edinburgh Festival enters its second week / Martin Hoyle talks to Baz Luhrmann, who is directing Britten's work for Australian Opera A fairy-story happy ending, make-believe glamour, rebellion against authority: I try to tick off the elements of A Midsummer Night's Dream that might have attracted the director of the film Strictly Ballroom. Though Baz Luhrmann is best known for the runaway success of his affectionate look at the world of dance steps and sequins, Australian Opera's production, with the same director and design team, of Britten's Shakespearian comedy has already sold out for its three performances at Edinburgh next week. Will the gently satiric flavour of the film be repeated in the opera? For those coming to opera from outside, the spangled glitziness must seem as artificial, sometimes as tatty, as ballroom dance. In fact this is not Baz Luhrmann's first opera production. He has a resoundingly successful Boheme to his credit; and his interest in music theatre goes back to a community musical devised and written with a local composer for Rockhampton, a Queensland cattle town. 'It was a cathartic experience. I had done theatre, not directed film though I'd acted in some, but I'd always loved music as a story-telling language.' The road to Damascus continued through Australian Opera who were dealing with the problem of their audiences 'literally dying off'. Luhrmann admits to the usual early preconceptions about opera, preferring concerts or listening to CDs 'watching the sunset rather than watching shaky sets and those disconnected people.' Aware of opera's popularity in Europe where students queue for tickets, he took in the famous ENO production of Masked Ball which provoked fisticuffs in the foyer, and the 'fantastically clear and delicious' Love of Three Oranges, Prokofiev directed by Richard Jones for Opera North and ENO. Even so he regarded Australian Opera's approach as a challenge. 'I wasn't sure I wanted to do this. Then I began to explore the origins of Italian opera, an incredibly popular form with street-sweepers and kings, the film and television of its day, yet told through music.' One reservation remained, summed up in what Luhrmann describes as his 'biggest passion': 'I don't want the work to become a club culture, expensive or elitist'. He sees opera's socialite aura reflected in an elitist aesthetic. 'We come from a school all about abstraction, psychological gesture, even working against the narrative.' He must mean Mister (or Ms) Whatsit's production of - but you can fill in the blanks yourselves. 'Concept is not my favourite word,' he says coolly. Zeffirelli came to film from opera, Visconti always worked in both, and now more directors are moving to opera from film. Luhrmann shares the growing conviction that the flexibility of film on the one hand and the high theatricality of opera on the other leave so-called straight theatre increasingly stranded as an art form. 'Theatre gets lost in the gap. Theatre's got to be theatrical. If it's people sitting round a table you might as well stick a camera there.' Surprisingly this carries over into acting where 'opera and film share more things than opera and theatre. For a start they both synthesize music, drama, the plastic arts. Film sound-tracks are like operas, they're created to tell stories. Young directors are turning to opera. Robert Altman tells me he's going to do another opera. It's to do with intensity.' For some directors, notably Ken Russell, opera's artificial form is heavensent for high camp or low farce. A Midsummer Night's Dream dangerously contains the seeds of both with its fairies and base mechanicals. One can feel an apprehensive twitch among British music-lovers as the Luhrmann direction (plus the visual lushness of designers Catherine Martin and Bill Marron) homes in. 'People say they can see a consistent style: we set out to reveal the story. I have a real interest in myth. The land of ballroom dancing is a land far, far away; we exploit it with a simple story. There are parallels with the Dream. Neither is psychologically realistic story-telling. We know the audience knows how it will end. We want the audience to enjoy the journey.' Luhrmann approached the work with an open mind. 'We've never made a decision about 'concept' or 'traditional'. Each piece has its language - rhythm, punctuation, different texture - which should grow out of it. Everyone's looking for the hip, the right, the now thing: a bit dangerous.' Director and designers stayed in Aldeburgh 'in the middle of winter, incredibly cold. After five minutes you get a sense of the music.' Does background knowledge of the composer help? 'Britten specifically left the 'club' opera of London. There's a feeling of community inherent in his work. We asked ourselves why, put on in any opera house, the Dream seems to be at the heart of a community - especially between orchestra and stage. I once naively turned to the pit and was told 'You don't have to talk to them, Baz,' as if they were terrible people in prison. I was shocked to find some orchestral members don't know the story of what they're playing. In our production the orchestra becomes characters on stage. I hope it's a humanist, not a design-led, production' The acting is important. Luhrmann condemns those who put theatrical illusion low on the list of operatic priorities. 'Britten (like Mozart and Puccini) talked about his revulsion at a kind of pretentiousness: how some opera-goers like bad acting.' This may have evolved, of course, through opera-singers' once notorious unsuitability for depicting the young and beautiful; and the physical demands of singing that leave little energy for characterisation. The director will have none of it. 'I try to cast singers who can act, helped by Australian Opera's commitment to ensemble. In Boheme I had two sensational artists.' He praises the inventiveness of singing actors. 'You want to marry them. You love them because you can then do your job: to be the audience, guide, not invent for them.' There are traps in The Dream. 'The piece is flawed in construction. There are actual great holes in it. Some scoring is fantastic, some is not. I try to make the players play the truth of the moment. It's absolute death to say 'Here comes the funny bit'.' He broods on the variety of acting one experiences in opera. 'With others you virtually show them how to clean their teeth.' Since Strictly Ballroom Luhrmann - the boy whose father for a time owned a cinema in a small country town - has a had a production deal with Twentieth Century Fox to make films anywhere as writer, producer, director. As for opera, 'It's no secret that most houses in England and Europe have approached me. I want to continue in opera. My real intention is to continue the journey inventing an operatic language. We set out to open the door to what's musically obscure to lots of people.' The man who discovered opera by chance in his twenties is determined to show the way. 'The tune, the tune itself, should be able to transcend time and place and geography and creed and colour.'</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / S Africa may end media control South Africa's democracy negotiators approved a draft bill yesterday to end state control of radio and television, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. The bill, setting up an independent broadcasting authority (IBA), is one of a package of measures intended to ensure that South Africa's first all-race election in April next year is free and fair. It is planned that the IBA remain in place after the elections. The IBA bill and others passed by the 23 groups negotiating the transition from apartheid to majority rule are due to be passed in parliament later this month. Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte said the IBA bill would establish a broadcast industry free from political control and influence. NEWS IN BRIEF</p>

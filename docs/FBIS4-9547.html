			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 28 (AFP) -- UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] chief General Michael Rose was only "theorising" when  he appeared to accuse Bosnian defences in Gorazde of collapsing  too early and wanting to drag the United Nations into a war, a  spokesman said Thursday. Rose was talking "soldier to soldier"  in a private conversation, held during a visit to the town  Wednesday, that "should never have been released," UNPROFOR  spokesman Eric Chaperon said. The UN commander had been  discussing theories for the Bosnian collapse, and the view  expressed was only one of several possibilities raised, the  spokesman said. He stressed that the remarks did not represent  the UNPROFOR position on the issue. Rose intended to explain  his position at greater length later Thursday, Chaperon said.    A video tape presenting the conversation was broadcast on  BBC  television late Wednesday. Chaperon said he did not know how  the tape came to be passed to the BBC and broadcast. In the  tape, Rose said that Bosnian Government forces "think we should  be fighting the war for them... they basically turned and ran  and left us to try and pick up the bits."    UNPROFOR Sarajevo sector commander General Andre Soubirou  meanwhile told reporters Wednesday that he had found the  collapse of Bosnian defence lines "difficult to explain," and  said that they "could have done better."    Serbs, who attacked Gorazde at the end of March, had  withdrawn their heavy weapons outside a 20-kilometre (12-mile)  exclusion zone around the town by late Wednesday, the UN  peacekeeping force said. NATO has given the Serbs an ultimatum  to lift their siege of the town or face aerial bombardment of  their positions.</p>

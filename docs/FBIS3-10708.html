This was announced today in Belo Horizonte by Central Bank  President Pedro Malan.    Malan said the decision on when to launch the real will  depend on how widely the URV [Real Value Unit] is being used.  Malan clearly stated that the change of currency will not take  place before April.    [Begin Malan recording] We promise to give a few days notice  before the launch of the real in order to give people time to  settle matters regarding commercial papers with preestablished  rates, post-dated checks, etc. [end recording]    Regarding an agreement with the IMF, Malan said it may be  signed next week. He added that to safeguard the agreement,  confirmation on the issuance of bonds to convert the Brazilian  foreign debt has been postponed.

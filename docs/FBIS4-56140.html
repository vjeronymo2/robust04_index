			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- Chairman of the  Parliamentary Defense and Security Committee Vladimir Suman  today told CTK that given that the expected visit of Augusto  Pinochet to the Czech Republic was a private one he saw no  reason why it should be a subject of his interest.    Regarding the information that Pinochet wants to study Czech  products, equipment and technology which could be of interest to  the Chilean Armed Forces Suman said that a very tough law  concerning the sale, exports, imports and transit of arms was  passed in the Czech Republic at the beginning of the year and  this law contains clear regulations on granting permission for  arms trade.

Commercial director of the Omnipol joint stock company  Frantisek Kurka today told CTK that Omnipol intended to make use  of Pinochet's visit for discussing the possibility of selling  Czech military equipment to Chile.    Pointing to the law on foreign trade with military material  Payne said that if Omnipol obtained a permit for trade with the  Chilean side then everything would be all right. "We can be only  interested in whether and how the law is observed," he said,  noting that the Chilean delegation headed by Pinochet would come  to the Czech Republic at the invitation of a private firm.    Kurka today told CTK that Omnipol had invited a trade  delegation from the Chilean ground forces commercial department  to come to the Czech Republic.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Congratulatory message" from Kim Il-song, general </F> secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, WPK, Central Committee  and DPRK president, to delegates attending the national meeting  of party cell secretaries at Pyongyang Stadium in Pyongyang on  31 March; read by Kye Ung-tae, member of the Political Bureau  and secretary of the WPK Central Committee -- recorded]    [Text] Congratulatory message to the delegates attending  the national meeting of party cell secretaries:    It is very significant that the national meeting of party  cell secretaries is held at a time when our party is moving to a  new, higher plane under the banner of modeling the entire party  on the chuche idea and when the entire party membership and all  the people are waging a vigorous great onward march of the  1990's in wholehearted unity.    The national meeting of party cell secretaries, which is  being held for the first time in our party's history, will  become an important milestone to strengthen and develop our  party to become an invincible party by enhancing the function  and role of party cells and to further strengthen our socialist  position. [applause]    I warmly congratulate the delegates to the meeting, as well  as all the party cell secretaries of the entire party, who are  waging a devoted struggle and are upholding our party's  leadership with loyalty, for the strengthening and development  of the party and for the victorious advance of the cause of  socialism. [applause]    Our party is a glorious party which has been brought up with  deep historical roots, and it is a chuche revolutionary party  that struggles for the cause of independence of the popular  masses with the chuche idea as its guiding policy.    Our party's founding and strengthening and development is  unthinkable without the party cells -- its basic organizations.  Because the position and role of the party cells are very  important in party building and activities, we have consistently  given deep heed to strengthening the basic party organizations,  such as the party cells, since the preparations for party  founding was made.    According to the policy put forth in the historic Karun  meeting in 1930, we began the party founding work by forming the  basic party organizations first and then expanding and  strengthening them. Since its founding, our party has expanded  the party ranks with advanced elements of the working popular  masses, including workers, farmers, and intellectuals; and  formed party cells in all places where there were party members  and the masses, such as plants, enterprises, and rural areas.  At the same time, we have strengthened the party cells'  militant function in conformity with the prevailing demand at  every stage of the development of the revolution.    Because the party cells were brought up strong and their  function and role was enhanced, our party could realize the  unity and cohesion of the party ranks based on the chuche idea  and be strengthened and develop to be an invincible party in  firm unity with the popular masses. [applause]    At a time when the historic task of realizing the modeling  of  the entire society on the chuche idea was put forth as a task of  primary importance, our party made a major effort to strengthen  the party cells in conformity with the new higher demand of the  development of the revolution. After the national training  course for party cells was held in 1991 by the initiative of the  party Central Committee, a vigorous movement was conducted to  create loyal party cells for the entire party membership under  the slogan "Let us make all party cells into cells of loyalty,"  thus enhancing the party cells' militant function and role in an  unprecedented manner.    Today, the party cells are excellently carrying out their  noble mission and task in further strengthening our party to be  the chuche revolutionary party and inheriting and developing the  chuche revolutionary cause. [applause]    The party cell secretaries contributed to the shining  successes of our party building and in the development of our  revolution with their unheralded efforts and great achievements.  The party cell secretaries have waged a devoted struggle for the  sake of the party and the revolution with high pride and  revolutionary self-awareness as the primary political  functionaries of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea [WPK],  without seeking honor or reward.    The party cell secretaries have revolutionary faith and high  loyalty, uphold the party wholeheartedly, look after the  political life of the party members and working people with a  warm, maternal feeling, and vigorously organize and mobilize the  party members and working people to creation and exploits at the  head of the struggle for socialist construction. I highly  appraise the party cell secretaries for their great contribution  to strengthening the party and realizing the party's leadership  of the revolution and construction, and give my warm gratitude  to the delegates to the meeting and all the party cell  secretaries. [applause]    The most important revolutionary task for our party and  people today is to defend and adhere and add luster to the  popular mass-centered socialism of our own style against the  challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries. The socialism  of our country, which is built by embodying the chuche idea  under our party's leadership, is a genuine socialism that  conforms to the popular masses' independent aspirations and  demands.    Whether we can crush the enemy's maneuvers and defend and  adhere to the chuche socialist cause and complete this cause to  the end depends on how we strengthen the party, the general  staff of the revolution, and how we can enhance the party's  leadership role. The party cells are the cornerstone upholding  our party and a revolutionary guardpost defending our socialism.    The party cells are the base for imbuing the party members  with the revolution and modeling them into the working class, a  base for connecting the party members with the party Central  Committee and realizing the relations of kinship between the  party and the masses, and a base for organizing and mobilizing  the party members and working people to the implementation of  the party's line and policy.    All the party cells should be strong in order for the party  to be strong and in order for the main force of our revolution  to have an invincible might. All the party cells should  smoothly carry out their function and role in order to give full  play to the superiority and vitality of the socialism of our  country. In strengthening the party cells is an important  guarantee for strengthening the main force of our party and our  revolution and firmly adhering and adding luster to our  socialism.    Our party entrusts the party cell secretaries with the  revolution's important guardpost of this magnitude. Our party's  trust in and expectations of the party cell secretaries is very  great, and the party cell secretaries' mission for the party and  the revolution is very heavy. All the party cell secretaries  should, with a high sense of responsibility and honor, make  their party cells loyal cells that are boundlessly loyal to the  party and militant cells that vigorously organize and mobilize  the masses into the struggle to defend and adhere and add luster  to the socialist cause. [applause]    The party cells should, above all, loyally uphold the  unitary  leadership [yuilchok yongdo] of the party Central Committee.  [applause] Ensuring the unitary [yuilsong] leadership within  the party is the fundamental principle of the party activity,  and loyally upholding the unitary leadership of the party  Central Committee is the foremost important duty of the party  cells. When all the party cells become loyal cells boundlessly  loyal to the leadership of the party Central Committee, they can  become invincible ranks in which the entire party membership  functions with one mind and will.    Today, our party's cause, the chuche revolutionary cause, is  being brilliantly inherited and developed under the leadership  of Comrade Kim Chong-il who excellently has the traits and  natural disposition of a people-oriented leader. [applause] To  solve the problem of inheriting our party's leadership smoothly  in conformity with the demand of the revolution's development  and the aspirations of the popular masses is the most proud  success achieved in our party building. This firmly ensures the  bright future and brilliant victory of our party and our  revolution. [applause]    All party cell secretaries should continuously keep up the  work of establishing the party's unitary leadership system.  Party cells should unconditionally accept and thoroughly  implement the party's line, policies, decisions, and directions,  and should indoctrinate leader party members and working people  to be endlessly loyal to the party's leadership.    Party cells should resolutely protect and defend the party  Central Committee and struggle against all phenomena that hinder  the party's unitary leadership. Party cells should well  organize and guide party members' party life [tang saenghwal].  [applause]    The party life is an excellent school that raises party  members as revolutionaries who are loyal to the party and the  revolution. It is the party cells' primary duty to correctly  organize and guide the party life of party members.    Party cells should strengthen party members' organizational  and ideological life to make all party members endlessly loyal  to the party and the revolution and to raise them as resolute  revolutionaries who can unyieldingly struggle for the victory of  the socialist cause under all stormy circumstances.    Party cells should enhance party members' organizational  concept [chojik kwallyom], establish a self-conscious and  revolutionary trait in their party life and make all party  members participate in the party life with a sincere attitude in  accordance with the standard of party life.    Party cells should normally organize and carry on the  organizational and ideological party life, such as summing up of  the party life and party training [tang haksup], should operate  party meetings in orderly fashion at a high political and  ideological level, should properly give party assignments to  party members, and should actively help them fulfill the  assignments.    Party cells should correctly organize and guide party  members' party life in close connection with the implementation  of their revolutionary tasks so party members can always play a  leading and exemplary role in implementing revolutionary tasks.  Party cells should strengthen work with the masses and firmly  unite the broad range of masses around the party. [applause]    The work with the masses is the work of remolding and  inciting [paltong] people's ideology and is important work to  consolidate the party's mass-oriented basis and to strengthen  the main forces of the revolution.    Party cells should properly work with the masses,  indoctrinate the broad range of masses in a revolutionary way,  firmly unite them around the party Central Committee, and  actively contribute to strengthening the single-hearted unity of  the entire society.    For the work with the masses, they should give priority to  work with the basic masses so they can strengthen the party's  class basis and the core forces of the revolution and can make  the basic masses resolutely struggle for the party and the  revolution, remembering their class status.    Party cells should more actively carry out work with the  masses in various classes and strata and unite more masses  around the party. They should also make all people indubitably  trust our party and share their destinies with the party without  vacillation in any trial.    Party cells should help organizations of the working people,  including ones under the League of Socialist Working Youth of  Korea, and actively agitate them to vigorously carry out work  with the masses in accordance with each unit's characteristic.    Party cells should vigorously carry out the three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--to effect  constant innovations and upsurges in socialist construction.  [applause]    The loyalty of the party members and workers to the party  and revolution must be demonstrated in the practical struggle  for revolution and construction. Workers and farmers who make  innovations in production and construction; intellectuals who  make valuable contributions to socialist construction with  scientific and technological knowledge; People's Army soldiers  who stand guard at guardposts to defend the fatherland like  fortresses by even risking their young lives: They are people  loyal to the party and revolution.    Party cells must regard the ideological revolution as their  first and foremost revolutionary task and intensify education in  the chuche idea among the party members and workers. We must  make all party members and workers cherish the chuche idea as  their firm faith and think and act as demanded by the chuche  idea. We must prevent any alien idea or unsound life-style  [isaekchogin sasangina pulgonjonhan saenghwal pungjodo] from  infiltrating into ourselves.    We must bring all party members and workers to cherish an  unfailing loyalty to the party, a staunch revolutionary spirit,  an unshakable faith in socialism, ardent patriotism, and noble  moral traits. We must also bring into fuller bloom in our  society the beautiful communist morality of helping and leading  each other forward and sharing weal and woe based on the  principle of one for all and all for one. [applause]    Party cells must make a great effort to carry out the  cultural revolution so that all party members and workers learn  hard and strive to steadily improve their cultural and technical  standards and enjoy to their hearts' content the socialist  cultural life with rich emotional feelings and a high cultural  attainment.    Party cells must strengthen organizational and political  work  to ensure that party members and workers accelerate the  technical revolution and make innovations in building the  socialist economy.    Party cells in the industrial sector must positively help  our  working class, which is in charge of the major sector of the  people's economy, fulfill the people's economic plan by the day,  by the month, and by the quarter and strengthen the might of the  chuche-oriented economy without fail by highly displaying the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle.    Party cells in agriculture must lead our farmers to do  farming in a scientific and technological manner as demanded by  the chuche- oriented farming method with an attitude befitting  masters who are responsible for the nation's granaries and,  thus, fulfill the high goal of agricultural production set by  the party without fail.    For the present the party cells in all sectors of the  people's economy must effect a fresh, revolutionary advance in  building the socialist economy by effectively organizing the  party members and workers for the implementation of the party's  revolutionary economic strategy. [applause]    Party cells in the fields of science, education, literature,  arts, public health, publications, and the press must well carry  out work with intellectuals to ensure that they, with the honor  of and pride in being intellectuals of a chuche Korea,  positively contribute to building socialist culture with all of  their creative wisdom and talent.    Party cells must always pay deep attention to defending the  fatherland.    Our struggle for socialist construction is waged in the  acute confrontation with the enemies. Today, the imperialists  and their stooges are intensifying the military threat and  provocation maneuvers against our Republic, the fortress of  socialism, with each passing day. The party cells should see to  it that the party members and working people heighten their  revolutionary vigilance to cope with the enemy's aggressive  provocation maneuvers, earnestly learn military affairs, and  prepare themselves thoroughly in order to firmly defend the  country's security and the gains of socialism.    The party cells should ensure that the party members and  working people give full play to the traditional virtues of  Army-people harmony and that the Army and the people are firmly  united to firmly defend the socialist fatherland. [applause]    First, the party cells should loyally uphold the party  Central Committee's unitary leadership. Second, they should  bring up all party members to be chuche-type revolutionaries by  effective party life organization and guidance. Third, they  should carry out the work with the masses well in order to  strengthen the relations of kinship between the party and the  masses. Fourth, they should vigorously carry out the three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in order  to accelerate socialist construction. Fifth, they should firmly  defend the security of the country and the gains of socialism.  These are the five-point tasks the party cells should carry out  at present. [applause]    All the party cell secretaries should firmly keep up the  party cells five-point tasks and implement them thoroughly.  Whether the party cells can carry out their function and role  satisfactorily or not depends on the degree of preparedness and  role of the cell secretaries. The party cell secretaries should  be boundlessly loyal to the party so that the party cells may  become the cells of loyalty. The party cell secretaries should  skillfully organize work and push it ahead energetically so that  the party cells may become cells with militant strength.    The party cell secretaries should become true loyalists  boundlessly loyal to the party. [applause] The party cell  secretaries should make their loyalty to the party their faith  and part of their constitution.    The party cell secretaries should bear deep in their hearts  the greatness of our party and the justness of the party's  cause. They should have firm resolve to share their destiny  with the party forever. They should wage an invariable devoted  struggle throughout their life, unshaken in the face of any  wind, for the sake of the party and for the victory of the  party's cause.    The party cell secretaries should protect and defend the  party politically, ideologically, and with their life with a  firm faith that they are happy living or dead as long as they  are loyal to our party.    Party cell secretaries must become the flag bearers in the  revolution and struggle who resolutely defend the party's lines  and policies and mobilize the popular masses into implementing  these lines and policies.    Party cell secretaries must possess high revolutionary  spirits and unwavering fidelity to the party's principles and  class-oriented principles, carry out all work in ways beneficial  to the party and revolution, and vigorously mobilize the popular  masses into the struggle to implement the party's policies.    Party cell secretaries must take the lead in waging the  struggle, overcome difficulties and achieve breakthroughs, and  exert influence on popular masses and lead them by exhibiting a  good personal example. Party cell secretaries must never  compromise with [tahyop] phenomena that are at variance with the  party's lines and policies and harm the interests of the party  and revolution, but wage a resolute struggle against them.    Party cell secretaries must become the people's genuine  servants who sincerely serve the people. [applause] Party cell  secretaries must become the people's genuine servants who  sincerely serve the people. [speaker repeats]    Party cell secretaries must have the correct view of the  masses that the masters of our country and the masters of  revolution and construction are the popular masses, boundlessly  love and respect the people, and devotedly wage struggles for  the people's benefits and happiness.    Party cell secretaries must always listen to the opinions of  the people, share joy and sorrow with them, and resolve their  difficulties and requests in a timely manner.    Party cell secretaries must not misuse their authority, hope  for privileges, and entertain worldly desires. Rather, they  must always lead frugal and sound lives and be cleanhanded  [chongnyom kyonlbaek].    Party cell secretaries must persistently make efforts to  improve their political-administrative qualifications.    Without endlessly improving their qualifications to comply  with the demand of the developing era, party cell secretaries  cannot correctly organize and give guidance to the party  members' party activities and efficiently organize and mobilize  the party members and masses for implementing the party's  policies.    Party cell secretaries must strongly arm themselves with our  party's revolutionary idea, the chuche idea, entirely acquaint  themselves with the party's lines and policies and plans, and  have a full understanding of the party's work methods.    Party cell secretaries must study hard and make persistent  efforts to strongly prepare themselves as proficient officials  who have high political and theoretical qualifications and  administrative experiences.    Party organizations of all levels must strongly build the  ranks of party cell secretaries and positively help and lead  them to ensure that they play their roles satisfactorily.    I firmly believe the delegates to the national meeting of  party cell secretaries and all the other party cell secretaries  of the entire party will uphold the party's leadership,  excellently fulfill their duties, and, thus, repay the party's  great trust and expectations without fail. [applause]    Kim Il-song [long applause]    31 March 1994 [applause]</p>

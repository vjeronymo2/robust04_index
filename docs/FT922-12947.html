			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / School opt-out warning THE LEADER of one of the largest teaching unions conceded yesterday that 'opt-out' schools were 'here to stay' and had to be accepted by the education establishment. A rapid increase in the number of schools opting out of local authority control lay at the heart of the Tories' election manifesto and will be a high priority for Mr John Patten, the new education secretary. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of AMMA, the second-largest teachers' union, warned teachers not to 'Siberianise' themselves after the election. Teachers had to recognise that grant-maintained schools were likely to become the norm, he said. 'They're here to stay, let's make them work,' he said at AMMA's annual conference in Birmingham. As yet only 213 of the 25,000 state schools in England and Wales have opted out, with 80 seeking permission to do so. Most of those are secondary schools. The government's short-term objective is to encourage most of the 5,000 secondary schools to join them. Grant-maintained schools are funded from Whitehall and have discretion over their budgets and recruitment subject to statutory and national curriculum requirements. The Tory manifesto proposed that grant-maintained schools be allowed to introduce formal selection of pupils 'if it fits in with the wider needs of the local area'. The conference rejected moves to link pay to performance and urged that the plan to shift 80 per cent of teacher training to schools be delayed.</p>

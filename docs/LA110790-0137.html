			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 13 OFFICIALS TO STUDY TRANSIT SYSTEMS IN EUROPE;  </P> <P> TRAVEL: A FORMER ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND A YORBA LINDA COUNCILMAN ARE  AMONG THOSE GOING ON THE TRIP.  </P> <P> Two Orange County men will be among 13 of the state's most influential  transportation and environmental officials who will leave today on an  all-expenses-paid, 12-day trip to Europe to study high-speed railroads,  high-tech automobiles and highways and exotic alternative fuel systems.  </P> <P> Former Orange County Supervisor Bruce Nestande, a vice president of Costa  Mesa-based Arnel Development Co. and a member of the California Transportation  Commission, is among the globe-trotters, as well as Yorba Linda Councilman  Henry W. Wedaa, a member of the South Coast Air Quality Management District  board.  </P> <P> The trip to Paris, Berlin, Stockholm and other cities is being sponsored by two  California business organizations that say they try to preserve a cautious  "environmental balance" while combatting environmental extremists.  </P> <P> The California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, an offshoot of  the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance, will pay all  expenses on the $4,000-a-person trip that are not picked up by European  industrial hosts, according to foundation director Pat Mason.  </P> <P> Serving as staff for the trip will be two officials of the California Institute  for Technology Exchange, Don Camph and Yvonne Ryzak. Mason and Camph said in  separate interviews that far from being a junket, this and other annual trips  the foundation has sponsored in recent years have been hard-working looks, in  Mason's words, "at how other countries have dealt with  technological-environmental issues."  </P> <P> "I wonder when I'm going to get a nap," said Mason of the forthcoming trip.  </P> <P> Said Camph: "Our premise is that one of the ways public policy is formed and  facilitated is direct exposure of policy makers to what is going on in various  societies. . . . I'm not going to tell you we're not going to have some fun.  But it's basically work."  </P> <P> He noted that the group will fly economy class and stay in moderately priced  hotels.  </P> <P> Among those scheduled to go are three state transportation commissioners who  have been skeptical of expenditures for rail right-of-way acquisitions and  commuter rail projects, commission Chairman W. E. (Bill) Leonard and members  Nestande and Joe Duffel.  </P> <P> Nestande said, "We have a very jammed schedule. . . . We are in Berlin for less  than a day."  </P> <P> The four legislators are Republican state Sen. Becky Morgan, vice chairman of  the Senate Transportation Committee; Republican state Sen. Bill Leonard,  chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus; Assemblyman Jim Costa, a Democrat,  and Democratic Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin. Costa recently sponsored  legislation authorizing Caltrans to help privately funded rail and road  projects with gifts of public rights of way. Easton is a member of both the  Assembly Transportation and Toxic Materials committees.  </P> <P> Others going include retired Senate President Pro Tem James Mills, now chairman  of the San Diego Metro Transit Development Board; Norton Younglove, a Riverside  County supervisor who is chairman of the managing board of the South Coast Air  Quality Management District; Chris Reed, a Santa Monica city councilwoman who  is chairman of the Southern California Assn. of Governments; Wedaa, who is vice  chairman of AQMD; Rod Dierdon, a Santa Clara County supervisor who is chairman  of the San Jose area's Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Nello  Bianco, chairman of BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit system.  </P> <P> Also going are two businessmen, Jack Coffey, manager of state affairs for  Chevron, and Steve Baum, senior vice president and general counsel for San  Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.  </P></p>

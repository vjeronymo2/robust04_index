			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Germans boost aerospace research The German government yesterday announced a new DM1.2bn (Pounds 492m) programme to subsidise research in its recession-hit aerospace industry, a move intended to help the sector fight competition from the US and Japan. The plan announced by Mr Reinhard Gohner, parliamentary state secretary in the Economics Ministry, is supposed to provide indirect research subsidies, and therefore not to contravene Gatt rules banning direct subsidies. 'With this new programme, we are seeking to follow in the footsteps of both the US and Japan by using indirect support, in order not to unleash new competitive subsidies,' he said. 'The aim is essentially to create the conditions for the German and European aerospace industry to maintain its international position, won not least thanks to state assistance.' The government will finance half the cost of the programme, to run from next year, with industry providing the other DM600m. It will focus on energy saving, and the reduction of noise and pollution, for four sectors: large aircraft, engines, helicopters, and aircraft equipment. The programme was greeted in the German industry, which has axed thousands of jobs in the past year, as 'a first step'. 'At least the decision shows that the political establishment has finally recognised how important the highest technology is for Germany,' Mr Detmar Grosse-Leege, the spokesman for Deutsche Aerospace, Daimler-Benz's aerospace subsidiary, said. He warned against any attempt to finance the civil aviation sector of the industry with cash from space research, however. 'Given the brutal competition and the huge state support which the US aerospace industry has received for years, the support of German aerospace research is more urgent than ever,' he said. The German industry has claimed repeatedly that the US unfairly subsidises its industry through the research and development budgets earmarked for defence and space exploration. Mr Gohner said that as far as large aircraft were concerned, the key area of technological development concerned the use of new materials, such as carbon fibres. As far as motors are concerned, the emphasis will be on developing technologies to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution to around 15 per cent of its current levels.</p>

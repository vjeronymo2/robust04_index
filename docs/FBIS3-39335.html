			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F> by Edoardo Gardumi in Brussels; date not given: "Europe Is  Adrift"]    [Text] It is not only the process of European integration  that has reached a crossroads: The continent's longest-standing  and stablest democracies have reached one too, maintains  Commission President Jacques Delors, who talks of a "weariness"  among the great nations that have played a major role in world  history. Unless they manage to broaden participation, making  democracy work better, the "bad shepherds," the prophets of hate  and discord, will arrive on the scene. A fundamental test, says  Delors, is the fight against mass unemployment, which is not a  temporary issue but a structural phenomenon.    In all probability, Jacques Delors will retire before the  end  of the year. He has been presiding over the European Commission  in Brussels since 1985, witnessing the parabola of these last  few years from the front line: The mighty thrust toward  political integration has gradually lost momentum, leaving  behind it the depressing stagnation of recent times. Delors  remains a passionate advocate of the unification of Europe, but  he now seems to be conducting a lone crusade. A militant  socialist with a solid Catholic background, he now has a serried  rank of conservative heads of government to deal with, although  this does not seem to have done much to dampen his proverbial  fighting spirit.    [Gardumi] Mr. President, the proposals you made in your  white  paper on employment and investment in Europe have been received  with great interest in Italy, particularly on the left.  However, the governments of the Twelve have not shown the same  amount of enthusiasm. Do you not think that European policies  for lowering unemployment are still way below needs and  expectations?    [Delors] We must draw a distinction between the white paper  and the decisions of the European Council in Brussels. The  white paper is intended as an analysis of what I would call the  "European sickness," by which I mean the inability of our  countries to maintain the competitiveness required to create the  millions of jobs we need. I had already warned the heads of  government that we were facing structural problems some time  ago, although I also added a note of optimism: Europe has the  capacity to solve these problems. The white paper takes up this  analysis, this diagnosis, and puts forward recommendations as to  what can be done at both the Community and the national levels.  The European Council has approved it in general terms, but as  the problems are of a structural nature, we cannot solve them  overnight. I realize that public opinion is anxious about the  future in view of the rising tide of unemployment and all the  social problems that it brings with it, such as deprivation and  instability, and wants us to move faster. The situation can be  changed, but it will take time and a lot of thought. The white  paper has opened a window on the medium-term future and has  shown that we are not condemned to a decline. It is a plan of  action and a framework for thought and discussion.    [Gardumi] You propose high investment in major  continent-wide  infrastructure networks, but the resources are not easy to find.    [Delors] It must first be said that these projects do not  set  out to achieve immediate economic recovery, but to strengthen  the economy, thus making it more competitive and capable of  creating employment. The plans cover the transportation, power,  and information networks serving us all. Some critics accuse  them of being an incitement to borrowing, but the venerable  theory of public finance states that if a government decides on  projects that will benefit three generations, those three  generations must all contribute to financing them. In any case,  it must also be realized that investment often makes for extra  savings. These criticisms are unfounded. Moreover, there are  various ways in which private capital can be brought in to  supplement public funding. Suffice it to mention what was  achieved in the capitalist country par excellence, the United  States, under President Roosevelt. It is only the right-wing  ideologists who oppose this idea. Do we intend to sit with our  feet up while threatened by this tide of unemployment?    [Gardumi] The Maastricht Treaty refers to a single currency  and joint foreign and security policies. However, never before  have there been such great divergences between currencies and  national interests. Do you think the goals of the treaty can  still be achieved?    [Delors] Here again, we must distinguish between the two  aspects of the treaty. As far as economic and monetary union is  concerned, we got off to a good start. Until September 1992,  the convergence between the various economies was increasing,  and the currencies were stable within the EMS [European Monetary  System]. However, these appearances concealed divergences in the  development of some of the economic systems, hence the events of  the September in question. To all intents and purposes, we now  have to start again from scratch. The fact remains that it is  in every country's interest to have a stable currency, low  inflation, and a public borrowing requirement kept within  reasonable limits. I therefore think that the road to economic  convergence can be found, and if it is the deadlines adopted can  be met. It must also be borne in mind that the advocates of  European integration and those pushing in the opposite direction  are engaged in a dramatic race against time. We must be  constantly on the alert.    [Gardumi] What about the common initiative at the  international level?    [Delors] I shall be more cautious, more circumspect here,  firstly because the decisionmaking processes in this sphere are  highly complicated, and then because, notwithstanding two  decades of informal cooperation on foreign policy, our countries  still tend very much to go it alone. We must put a great amount  of joint thought into understanding the proper function of the  European Union and its responsibilities, into grasping the real  hazards that threaten not only our security but that of our  neighbors, and into recognizing threats to peace and freedom.  To some extent, this is what the European Commission does,  within its sphere of jurisdiction, not so much by its own virtue  but because its job is to identify and grasp the common  interest. This is what is lacking in the foreign policy field.    [Gardumi] Are you not alarmed by this urge, which seems to  be  spreading more and more, to seek individual national and  regional identities? How can a concept of supranational  integration be defended in these conditions?    [Delors] The problem is that Europe is on the move, but  without a precise idea of where it wants to go. In a few years,  it could be like a ship adrift at sea, with its rising  generations completely alienated. This is why we must never  cease strengthening political will, seizing on common interests,  explaining everything to the public, acknowledging our  responsibility before the European Parliament, and involving the  national parliaments. The question facing us is: where do you  really want to go? We have to answer it. If this question had  eluded us, I should be very worried as to the fate of the Europe  that we are building. Making our intentions clear is a risk,  but it is one that we have to run. Our democracies are "weary  of life," and our contemporaries are seeking a feeling of  belonging to something. If the answer does not come from us,  the "bad shepherd" will arrive on the scene.    [Gardumi] And what might the bad shepherd promise?    [Delors] He advocates refusal and rejection of the other,  the  exaltation of a race or a religion. There is only one means of  warding off this danger: an active society and a transparent,  more effective democracy. Whatever form of words may have been  used, the ultimate goal of all men of progress has always been  to deepen the roots of democracy. They have been convinced that  society and mankind can be improved a little. If we no longer  believe in this, we can hardly be surprised if the boat is  adrift.    [Gardumi] The war in Bosnia is perhaps the most painful  wound  in Europe. Do you think that the time has now come to risk  greater military involvement in the area?    [Delors] I said 18 months ago that without a credible  military threat it would be impossible to halt the progress of  this ideology of death that goes by the name of ethnic  cleansing. I was right, unfortunately. I would have preferred  to be wrong. The situation has changed now. We must ask  ourselves whether even a highly unsatisfactory peace would not  be preferable to the continuation of a war involving weapons of  mass destruction. The Serbs and Croats in particular have not  yet fielded all their military resources. I would like to say  to all those in a position to make decisions: Don't just talk --  do something.    [Gardumi] You are regarded as the architect of the  Maastricht  Treaty. With hindsight, would your approach be the same, or is  there anything you would change?    [Delors] Excuse me, but I must correct a historical fact. I  have been identified as the architect of European recovery, and  this flatters me, on the strength of the single act, the 1992  objective, and the financial agreements embodied in what are  referred to as packages one and two, but I am not the architect  of Maastricht. An examination of the Commission's proposals for  the treaty will show that there are great differences between  them and the final text. It would therefore be better to put the  question to those who had a real say in the final drafting of  the agreement, which, quite frankly, is not mine. However, the  treaty has been adopted and ratified by the national  parliaments, and in some cases directly by the people, so let us  implement it as best we can. Nothing would be more dangerous  than to throw it open to discussion again now. If it were not  implemented, there would be a vacuum. In 1996, the next date  for considering the European institutions, its imperfections and  the lessons that we have learned from them will have to be taken  into account.    [Gardumi] Widening the Community, first to 18 and then to 20  or more members, will change its nature. How do you picture the  Community of the 21st century?    [Delors] There is a contradiction that we have to overcome,  or that I at any rate believe we have to overcome. On the one  hand, in the face of the collapse of totalitarian communism, we  West Europeans have a historical duty to extend our values of  peace, pluralism, respect, and mutual cooperation to all the  European countries and to enable them all to achieve material  prosperity. On the other hand, I consider that the heritage of  the Treaty of Rome is still a living force. What is the main  message of this heritage? The conviction that no West European  country is still strong enough to keep on playing the historical  role to which it aspires in view of Europe's contribution to  world history, hence the urge to constitute a stronger political  unity among those who desire this role. How can these two  projects be reconciled? This is the issue that the Commission  has been laying before the governments of the Twelve for two or  three years. If no answer is forthcoming, the construction of  Europe will go haywire. Finding an answer is difficult, I know,  but then politics is difficult.    [Gardumi] What is your opinion of the process of political  renewal under way in Italy?    [Delors] It used to be said of Italy that the state did not  work but the economy was prosperous. This notion, which was  shared by many, has not been reflecting reality for five or six  years. The need to adjust the system had thus become imperative.  I consider what is happening doubly encouraging. On the  economic front, Amato and Ciampi have taken measures that go in  the right direction, and business has shown great adaptability,  particularly after the devaluation of the lira, so my conclusion  is that there is a sound economic base. On the political front,  a new republic is awaited that will have great opportunities for  redefining the role of the state and the exercise of  decentralized powers, and for practicing politics in a way that  will rekindle the interest of the public and encourage it to  take an active part in public life. Like many observers outside  Italy, I believe that the worst moment for your country's image  is over. Of course, there is still a lot to be done, and I  repeat: Like all of us, Italy has to face what I call a  weakening of our democracies. If we do not fight this danger, I  say again that we leave the field wide open to the bad shepherds.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (6): A thousand projects won in the last decade - Inward Investment / A Record year in 1991 SOME of the statistics that have been coming out of Wales of recent years will surprise those more used to expecting a tale of economic woe. Since the mid-1980s, the economy has, according to the Welsh Development Agency, been growing faster than that of the UK as a whole and is expected to continue to do so. During this summer, Welsh unemployment actually fell below the UK average for the first time since the 1920s. ln the past ten years nearly 1,000 inward investment projects have been attracted, creating or safeguarding around 100,000 jobs and bringing capital investment totalling Pounds 4.7bn. Last year was a record year for inward investment, with 208 projects creating or securing 17,000 jobs and capital expenditure of just over Pounds 1bn. Wales, with just five per cent of the UK's population has been getting more than one fifth of the jobs and projects coming coming from abroad. It now has nearly 30 per cent of all people employed in Japanese manufacturing in the UK, with no fewer than 44 Japanese companies. Even allowing that future figures may look less positive when the impact of the continuing recession is fully reflected, Wales has had an outstanding few years in the marketplace for internationally mobile investment, with some very big corporations choosing it. Bosch, the German group, has spent Pounds 100m. on a 500,000 sq. ft. factory, its biggest outside Germany, at Miskin near Cardiff, to produce a new generation of compact alternators. Toyota is to produce 200,000 800cc engines a year from a Pounds 140m new plant on Deeside for the cars it is to make at Burnaston in Derbyshire. Ford is putting Pounds 450m into its existing south Wales plants and will be producing 530,000 a year of its new Zeta engines at Bridgend. Altogether more than Pounds 1.3bn has been spent by automotive component makers in Wales since 1983. Dow Corning at Barry, and Sony at Bridgend are both spending around Pounds 150m to upgrade existing facilities, and other companies have moved in to acquire large-scale assets which other companies have decided to release. Against this background, it is perhaps understandable that the formula whereby Wales - along with Scotland and Northern Ireland - receives a proportionately higher share of UK public expenditure per head than England is apparently to be looked at again in this autumn's Treasury spending review. Within Wales, however, opponents of such a move are likely to point out that the task of restructuring the Welsh economy remains only partially complete. While the big new projects have brought in hundreds of jobs, the losses elsewhere have continued and, indeed, risen again in recent months. Apart from those that will go when British Coal closes a further two collieries in south Wales shortly, some 400 jobs have gone in the last few years at television contractors HTV, in the previously fast-expanding Welsh media sector. Other jobs have gone, or are going, not just in Barry Docks with the move by Geest from its long-established Welsh base to Southampton, but also in the health service at Cardiff Royal Infirmary, at British Aerospace in Hawarden and at Hotpoint in Llandudno. A threat hangs over part of the BP Baglan Bay complex and there have been cutbacks even in expanding areas, such as electronics, where one of the leading Welsh-owned companies, AB Electronics, has been forced to trim back operations. Employment opportunities vary markedly, too, in different parts of Wales, with the south Wales coastal belt, particularly the Newport-Cardiff-Bridgend nexus, and the north east corner of Wales, around Wrexham, benefitting from good communications and the services and labour available in nearby big population centres. In the south Wales valleys and rural Wales new investment has proved much harder to obtain, and some pockets of high unemployment and acute deprivation remain. THE challenges are going to become even greater, too, over the rest of this decade, and not just in areas outside the favoured M4 corridor. One of Wales's attractions has undoubtedly been the availability of relatively low cost male and female labour, but, as John Hockey of surveyors, Henry Butcher, in Cardiff points out, former Eastern block countries, such as Poland, are now stepping up their efforts to attract mobile manufacturing projects, adding to the competition Wales already faces from other parts of Britain and of Western Europe, such as Spain, Portugal, and the south of France. And although one of the reasons for Wales's success in attracting new companies from around the world has been low overheads, much is also going to depend on where sterling settles in relation to other European currencies and the dollar. Yet, although conditions are going to remain difficult there are good reasons for the WDA, and its sister body in rural areas, Mid-Wales Development, to feel optimistic that the groundwork they have laid will ensure continuing competitiveness in the battle for investment. The objective over recent years has, of necessity, been to bring in large-scale manufacturing projects capable of providing the jobs - and in particular the male jobs - needed to replace those being lost. The approach has, however, been much more than simply grant-based. The WDA since its creation has been behind a big programme of removing industrial dereliction in Wales to create a greatly improved environment for incoming industry, and has recently turned its attention to assisting in the improvement of the townscape in a number of Welsh towns. There has also been a big improvement in Welsh road communications. The rebuilt A55 along the north Wales coast gives the rural north a fast link with the English motorway system, and by 1996 south Wales will be linked to England by a second Severn crossing. The possible benefits this will bring have already been foreshadowed by the recent announcement from Tesco that it would be building a very large distribution depot near the Welsh landfall. The strategy for attracting investment has been a selective one, too, with the intention of building on core competencies already in Wales. In this way it is hoped, as Mr Ian Rooks, WDA executive director, marketing, points out, that a nucleus can be created around which other similar businesses will cluster. This approach has clearly worked not just in automotive components and electronics, but in aerospace itself, where a number of important developments have taken place. General Electric of the US has acquired British Airways engine overhaul facilities at Nantgarw, near Pontypridd, while British Airways itself has chosen Cardiff Airport as the location for a Pounds 100m aircraft maintenance facility to handle its Boeing 747 fleet. It is also building a Pounds 23m. new avionics servicing centre at nearby Llantrisant. As a result, Wales now has more than 5 per cent of UK employment in this sector, having previously been under-represented. The approach adopted by Welsh Development International, the WDA's inward investment arm, is according to Mr Rooks, not simply to trawl for whatever is available but to research developments taking place, even in industrial sectors which might be passing through a temporary downturn. A package is then put to leading manufacturers showing how they could benefit from picking Wales for expanding in growing product areas. CONSIDERABLE effort has also been put into analysing the industries which might be suitable for different parts of Wates. The decision by US company, Euro DPC, to move from Oxfordshire to Gwynedd will be used as a lever to encourage other similar high value, low bulk medical equipment producers to move into the clean environment of north Wales. West Wales, it is hoped, can develop further its involvement in the food industry. South east Wales has already attracted a number of financial services companies' back-office operations, and Cardiff has seen strong growth in legal and accountancy services. As yet the city has attracted relatively little foreign banking interest but this may come with the expansion of overseas manufacturing within Wales. Another area that has yet to develop to the extent that the WDA would like is research and development, though there are signs that some of the more long-standing inward investors are beginning to locate parts of their research activities to Wales. Sony will be including research facilities in its new investment project in Bridgend. To help improve the Welsh research profile, the WDA has persuaded Imperial College, London, to join it and Newport borough council in creating a science park outside Newport which will bring the research resources of the college within easy reach of Welsh firms. It is undoubtedly a reflection of British industry's own problems that few of the very big moves into Wales of recent years have been by UK-owned concerns. The companies that have come from overseas have come, however, with the intention of serving not just the British market but the single European market as well. ln the process Wales has managed to secure for itself not just a more diversified industrial base but one which, perhaps just as significantly, has a wide spread of markets, too.</p>

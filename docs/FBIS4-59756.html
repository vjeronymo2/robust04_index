			<p>BFN     [Text] An official military spokesman at the Defense  Ministry has issued the following statement:    Pursuant to our statement released yesterday [17 May]  morning  about units of the valiant Armed Forces in the  al-'Anad-al-Hawtah sector completing their combat duties by  completely destroying the military base at al-'Anad, as well as  the fortifications, formations, and weapons stored there, and  the seizure and transfer to Constitutional legitimacy of the  balance of a variety of military hardware stacked there, and the  mounting morale of the heroic knights in our Armed Forces, other  duties and goals were completed in all the axes and sectors:    The forces championing unity and Constitutional legitimacy  in  that sector advanced to confront the secessionist, rebellious  forces. They reached the al-Halilayn Subdistrict in Radfan  District and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of apostasy  and secession in equipment and field weapons. They seized four  tanks and two BM-21 and two 130-mm howitzers, one  double-barreled gun and eight trucks.    The air defense forces shot down two helicopters, capturing  one pilot.    On the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of unity, democracy, and  Constitutional legitimacy continued their advance with firmness  and capability. They absorbed the fire of various weapons of  the forces of rebellion and secession who joined the rest of the  retreating brigades facing their inevitable fate. The forces of  unity and Constitutional legitimacy are boldly confronting the  fire and bombardment of the naval units of the forces of  apostasy and secession and aborting their aggressive goals.    The valiant eagles of the Air Forces today continued the  execution of their combat and offensive duties in a number of  the arenas of battle, scoring direct hits against their set  targets, with all the planes returning safely to base.    As the deserved end of the elements of apostasy and  rebellion  and secession in the great battles of the triumph of right over  wrong and the defeat of all the delusions of the separatists and  their rancor for the blessed Yemeni land approaches, we  reiterate the call to all officers, non-commissioned officers,  and soldiers of the military units that are still under the  domination of the sinful secessionist forces in Aden Governorate  to hasten to seize the valuable national opportunity open to  them today by disobeying the aggressive instructions of the  forces of rebellion and secession and disengaging themselves  from the trap of the heinous crime plotted by the rebellious  separatists against the homeland, the people, unity, and  democracy. We call on them to return to their senses and their  generous and noble posts within the ranks of the proud Armed  Forces -- the forces of the people and the homeland, and they  will find complete understanding of their coerced conditions and  circumstances. They will even receive the kind of estimation  and respect worthy of the noble act of stemming the flow of the  blood and protecting achievements.</p>

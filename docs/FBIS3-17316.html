			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy from the </F> "Presidential Bulletin"]    [Text] During their talks in Minsk, the Prime Minister  Vyacheslav Kebich and the Chairman of the Committee of the  Russian Parliament's Upper House on Budget and Finances Nikolay  Gonchar agreed to integrate their countries monetary systems on  the principles laid down in a statement jointly issued by the  Prime Ministers of Belarusia [Belarus] and Russia.    Belarusian Premier's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin told this  to Interfax and said that the sides had decided to fix single  fuel prices, exchange their currencies on a one to one basis,  and recognize the National Bank of Belarusia as the chief bank  of this sovereign state.    Each of the two countries will have a budget of its own;  however, some joint programs, including those on military  matters and efforts to eliminate the effects of the Chernobyl  disaster, will be funded "from a joint treasury", Zametalin  stressed.    He also noted that "unjustified delay regarding monetary  integration accords has elevated this problem to a  parliamentarian level."    Meanwhile speakers at the hearings on the problems and  prospects of relations with Russia held in the parliament's  lower house by the committees for CIS affairs, contacts with  compatriots, and economic policy noted that Moscow and Minsk  still differed on monetary integration.    For one thing, they have not agreed on what rate the  Belarusian ruble be exchanged to the Russian ruble. Nor is  there unanimity on levelling up the prices of Belarusian and  Russian commodities and on combining budgets.    The basic difference, as was pointed out at the hearings, is  that on the status of the Belarusian National Bank. The Russian  side suggests that by 31 December 1994 the Belarusian National  Bank be transformed into a branch of Russia's bank with the  transfer of all assets and liabilities to it. It also proposes  that Russian laws be applied to banking and currency exchange on  the territory of Belarusia. However, Belarusian experts deem it  necessary to retain the national bank's right to control a  combined monetary system in Belarusia and disapprove efforts to  subordinate the Belarusian bank to the bank of Russia.    The Vice-Chairman of Russia's Central Bank Dmitriy Tulin  believes that "the monetary system now being created will lack  vitality and stability, if Belarusia's bank does not become a  branch of Russia's bank." He stressed that although in theory  any degree of responsibility could be agreed, such agreement  would hardly prove workable.    Tulin doubted that the number of participants in a new  monetary union should be extended before Russia and Belarusia  combine their monetary systems.    The Deputy Economics Minister Sergey Ignatiyev, for his  part,  emphasized that "a treaty cannot be equal in principle," and "a  single currency must have one master." The document, in his  view, should stipulate that the Belarusian side sacrifices part  of its sovereignty on fiscal matters and has to give in to  Russia's demands.    The Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister of Russia  Georgiy Gabonya declared that his department favoured monetary  integration; however, without political unity there is no  sufficient guarantee that the accords will be implemented. A  monetary integration accord, in his opinion, will lead to "the  creation of a common fence to the rest of the world", which will  necessitate single import-export duties and quotas, and single  rules for trade with third countries.</p>

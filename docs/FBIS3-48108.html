Last year, An Kwang-nam, a worker of the Kangso District  coal  mining complex, Chong Myong-il, a worker of the Uiju County  urban management office in North Pyongan Province, and many  other people adopted orphaned children and brought home lonely  old men and women and took utmost care of them.    The great leader President Kim Il-song, long ago, put  forward  the slogan "One for all and all for one!" and has made sure that  a beautiful communist morality of helping and leading each other  forward pervades the whole country.    At the national meeting of mothers held in November 1961 he  highly estimated Yi Yong-suk, a woman in Sunchon City, South  Pyongan Province, who adopted and brought up nine war orphans  during the fatherland liberation war, saying her example should  be generalized throughout the country, and saw to it that the  title of labour heroine was awarded to her.    Kim Hui-chong, a labour heroine living in Taetan County,  South Hwanghae Province, brought up 15 children of fallen  fighters to be reliable officials of the country.    Kim Yun-yong, principal of the Pyongyang Sangdang Primary  School, Yi Hwa-yong, secretary of the primary party committee of  the welfare cooperative in Waudo District, Nampo municipality,  Wi Hwak-sil, a resident in Kumchon County, North Hwanghae  Province, Hwang Pi-pong, a worker of the Nahung washing machine  factory in Iwon County, South Hamgyong Province, and many others  also became parents of orphaned children and brought home and  look after old men and women with no one to support them.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il highly estimated their  deeds and sent benevolent gifts to them. Last year, he praised  as a very good party worker and extended thanks to Chang  Sa-hong, secretary of the primary party committee of an organ  under the General Bureau of Western Railways, who had taken warm  care of the son and daughter of a worker who died, giving more  thought to them than to his own children.    Indeed, there is not a single orphan, not a single lonely  old  person in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea where the  leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind and the  entire people form one big family.</p>

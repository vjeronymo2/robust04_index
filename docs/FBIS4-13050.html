			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 18 (AFP)--The PLO has rejected an  Israeli compromise proposal on the scope of Palestinian  jurisdiction in parts of the occupied territories slated for  Palestinian self-rule, the chief PLO negotiator said early  Monday [18 April].    Nabil Sha'th was speaking at the opening session Sunday [as  received] of the latest round of Israeli-PLO negotiations aimed  at implementing Palestinian autonomy on the Gaza Strip and in  the West Bank town of Jericho.    He said Israel had proposed that Palestinian jurisdiction  extend to all foreigners -- non-Israelis and non-Palestinians --  in Gaza and Jericho, apart from those who travel there to visit  Jewish settlements.    In another offer, according to Sha'th, Israel suggested that  a Palestinian charged with a crime against an Israeli be tried  before a Palestinian court if he is arrested in the autonomous  areas and before an Israeli court if he escapes and is captured  in Israel.    Israel had initially wanted to maintain jurisdiction over  all  foreigners as well as over any Palestinian charged with a crime  against an Israeli.    "They tempered their first proposal, which I have called a  horror," Sha'th said. "It is now a horror on a minature scale  but still it is a horror."    He charged that Israel's position on jurisdiction was "a  clear violation of the Declaration of Principles," referring to  an autonomy agreement signed last September by Israel and the  Palestine Liberation Organization.    "From our point of view, the only (areas) out of our  jurisdiction are Israelis and settlements."    He disclosed that an electronic surveillance system will  likely be used to resolve the issue of Palestinian movement  between Gaza and Jericho.    The proposed route linking the two sites would extend from  Eretz, bordering the Gaza Strip, and then pass through Ashqelon  in southern Israel and Hebron on the West Bank, entering Jericho  south of Jerusalem.    Sha'th also said that Israeli and PLO negotiators had begun  discussions Sunday on water sharing but declined to release  details.    But he added: "It's not really that much of a problem. It  can be solved."    Sha'th stressed that that PLO was still pressing for a  general amnesty for all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel,  estimated to number 10,000.    Israel announced last Tuesday that it would agree to free  5,000 prisoners following the approval of a final autonomy  accord, excluding Islamic militants in the Hamas movement.    Hamas has claimed responsibility for two recent bomb blasts  that killed 12 Israelis.    "What we are discussing is a general amnesty," Sha'th said.  "We cannot accept that Israelis tell us that people who are  imprisoned because of their resistance in the past to an illegal  occupation should remain in jail indefinitely, even after an  agreement is signed."</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLOMBIAN JET CRASH  </P> <P> The crash of the Avianca Boeing 707 flight on Jan. 25 killing 73 people appears  to have been the result of semantic miscommunication. The pilot of the aircraft  asked for "priority" landing in speaking with ground controllers.  </P> <P> He said he "was low on fuel"; that "we think we may need priority."  </P> <P> According to the Federal Aviation Administration in Washington, D.C., "the  world 'priority' has no particular meaning in air traffic control" (Part A,  Jan. 30). The spokesman added that "if there is an emergency, you use the word  'emergency.' " Any messages such as "fuel emergency" or "minimum fuel" by the  Avianca pilot would have triggered an emergency response by the controllers.  </P> <P> Similar accidents could be avoided in the future if all airlines and the  National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. included a short course in general  semantics (the meaning of words, signs and symbols and their effect on human  behavior) when training pilots and controllers in air traffic communication  procedures.  </P> <P> With the ever-increasing amount of world air travel and the concomitant  cockpit/tower chatter, it is vital that the brief time allowed for  communication be precise for both parties.  </P> <P> JOSEPH STAMLER  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: LIT ahead but gives warning A CUT in central charges led to LIT Holdings achieving an increase from Pounds 1.92m to Pounds 2.26m in first half pre-tax profit. Normally, the opening six months is seasonally biased and produces materially higher operating profits. This time they fell from Pounds 4.05m to Pounds 3.47m, and the directors 'must anticipate' that the second half results may be worse than those of 1991 when operating profit was Pounds 742,000 and the pre-tax loss Pounds 636,000. Central charges of this marketing services, investment and fund management group were down to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 2.12m). Earnings per share for the half year were 1.8p (1.7p). A dividend has been paid on the preference shares.</p>

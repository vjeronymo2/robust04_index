			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Ngoc Tien] </F>   [Text] Opium poppies grow well in mountainous areas having  two seasons, a rainy hot season and a dry cold season. These  special characteristics of opium poppies match those of the  northwestern region in general and Lai Chau in particular.  Because of this, poppies are grown here in rather large  quantities. Based on a survey conducted in 1990, in Lai Chau  Province there were 2,378 hectares planted in opium poppies. The  Hmong have a tradition of planting opium poppies in the  northwestern region.    The poppy growing areas in Lai Chau include Tua Chua and Sin  Ho districts and the highlands areas of Phong Tho, Dien Bien,  and Muong Te districts. As one of the places were opium is  produced, this area has become a land of addicts. A 1990 survey  conducted by the Lai Chau Labor, War Invalids, and Social  Welfare Service showed that there were 13,000 addicts in the  province, which is 2.85 percent of the province's total  population. Nguyen Duc Thien, the director of the provincial  Drug Prevention and Control Center, said that the number of  addicts in 1993 was higher than in 1990. Most of the opium  addicts in Lai Chau are Hmongs and Thais, but recently, more and  more youths in the towns and cities have started using opium. He  added that some border defense troops who go on patrols through  the poppy fields make cigarettes using raw opium, and from long  use they have become addicted to opium. In many highland Hmong  villages, such tasks as tending the fields, obtaining firewood  and water, and so on are done by women. The men stay at home  smoking opium all day. In Lai Chau City, there are 13 homeless  Hmong families who must live in rock caves. Because of their  opium habit, they had to sell their homes. Each day, they go and  cut firewood and then bring it back to the city to sell it to  obtain money to buy rice and opium. At the provincial Drug  Prevention and Control Center, which is located in Dien Bien Phu  City, we met many people who had voluntarily come here for drug  rehabilitation. Mr. N.V.K. had sold all his possessions, and  Giang A Tong, who is from Pu Nhi Village in Dien Bien District,  has been an addict for 38 years. He no longer looks like a man.  Although he does not speak the Vietnamese language very well, Lo  A Po, who is 64 years old and who has been using opium since  1962, said that "at first, I used opium when I was ill, but now  it uses me." However, among the addicts in Lai Chau, we did not  see anyone who injects opium. There are 13,000 addicts, but the  province has just one drug prevention and control and drug  rehabilitation center with 10 beds. It treats only those who  come here voluntarily. At present, the center has very few  materials and very little equipment. Although it was just  established on 29 June 1993 and actually went into operation in  September 1993, the center has already helped 40 people kick  their drug habit.    In 1990, the province prohibited the cultivation, storage,  and sale of opium, but by the beginning of 1993, only 571  hectares of opium poppies had been destroyed. The strange thing  about opium is that while it does not require much labor to grow  poppies, they bring high economic results. In a good season, one  hectare of poppies can produce about 4 kg of opium. In March  1994, a kg of opium was selling for 800,000 dong. At the same  time, to earn 3.2 million dong, you would have to grow two  hectares of corn with yields of two tons per hectare. In Lai  Chau, there are villages in Dien Bien District where 90 percent  of the households have Min motorcycles, and on their own they  have built roads connecting the villages. They have been able to  do this thanks to opium. Realizing the dangers of opium, many  villages have voluntarily destroyed the poppies, but finding a  suitable replacement crop is a problem for the various echelon  and various sector cadres in Lai Chau. Tuan Giao District has  replaced poppies with cardamom. But it takes seven years before  the cardamom plants can be harvested, which means seven years of  living in poverty. Sin Ho District has planted and harvested  wheat, but it does not have any processing installations. And  even if the wheat can be processed, it is difficult to find  markets, because it is difficult for domestic flour to compete  with flour from Germany, France, and China. Sung Chiu Thenh, the  vice chairman of Dien Bien District, said that his district is  planning to bring in and raise deer. He believes that it is  possible to raise deer, but from where will the capital be  obtained in view of the fact that a deer costs 20 million dong.    Giang A Tong said that in recent years, opium harvests have  been bad because of the unfavorable weather. In 1994, from Tet  until the middle of the 2d lunar month, it rained only twice.  But poppies require heavy rains.    Regardless of where the opium came from, public security  officials in Son La Province seized more than 200 kg of opium  concealed in a vehicle in which the director of the Lai Chau  Education Service was riding.    A provincial cadre responded by saying that that opium had  been brought in from Laos.    Dien Bien District alone shares a 170-km border with Laos.  Relations between the peoples of our two countries have always  been very close, and people frequently cross the border to visit  each other. Opium traffickers have made use of this to smuggle  opium into Lai Chau. They usually hire local people to carry the  opium using jungle routes that few people know about. The opium  is then stored in one place until customers from the lowlands  come to get it.    Can't something be done to stop this?    Interdiction is only at the level of....    In 1993, the government allotted Lai Chau 2.1 billion dong  to  eradicate the poppy plants and curtail the use of opium. It is  hoped that Lai Chau will overcome the difficulties in order to  completely eradicate opium poppies. If Lai Chau and the  northwest can eradicate opium poppies and stop the smuggling of  opium, this will certainly reduce the number of addicts in the  lowland provinces.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Tokyo thoughts turn to political weddings: Japanese parties may make their trial marriages more permanent In the eighth week of their cohabitation, the unlikely political bedfellows of the Japanese government are getting along well enough to push general election prospects a year away or more. There is even stray talk of a more permanent arrangement. The government is headed by Mr Tomiichi Murayama of the Social Democratic party, the country's first socialist prime minister since 1947, but the main ministerial posts are occupied by conservatives from the Liberal Democratic party which had run Japan for more than four decades until last summer. The two parties are traditional adversaries. But Mr Koichi Kato, the LDP policy chief, has been quoted as saying that his party should hold talks with the SDP's trade union backers to achieve a merger. Strictly, the current arrangement is a menage a trois, with the New Harbinger party, run by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, now stuck awkwardly in the middle of the two much older parties. In the absence of an early break-up, the next election will be fought in new constituency boundaries, and latest political arithmetic suggests that a formal LDP-SDP combine would be best placed to fight it. Such a move would also be intended to counter the creation of an opposition super-party which has been proposed among recent LDP defectors and members of the minority coalition which was ousted at the end of June. Both merger ideas reflect the introduction, under a system of state political funding to replace the previous discredited quest for corporate and other donations, of rules which entitle large parties to more campaign funds from central coffers than would be obtained by a loose grouping of smaller political units. Neither political wedding will necessarily be rushed, if held at all. A consultative council linking nine opposition groupings is due to be formed early next month. But many opposition MPs are wary of any closer involvement with Mr Ichiro Ozawa, chief strategist of the Japan Renewal party, whose perceived high-handedness in dealings with coalition partners contributed to the fall in June of the government led by Mr Tsutomu Hata. Mr Ozawa will remain co-leader of the JRP along with Mr Hata after the party last week rejected his offer to step down. The Rengo trade union confederation is less than happy with the direction taken by the SDP, and a number of union activists are calling for Rengo to establish its own party. As a whole, however, the Japanese public is coming round to the apparently unususal idea of a left-right combination. Approval ratings for the Murayama cabinet have risen from a low base since it won office to around 35 per cent now. The policy issues of the day have so far given rise to no publicly expressed discord. The LDP and SDP have common interests to protect: Agricultural subsidies, as each relies significantly on the rural vote. The gradual opening of the country's rice market will not mean that those who farm the staple will receive any less government money this year, keeping consumer costs high. Public sector jobs, where the LDP has an influential constituency among bureaucrats, and the SDP is backed by many lower-ranking staff. Deregulation, the catchcry of the past two governments, has suddenly slipped out of daily use. Lifetime employment in the private sector, so that jobless figures do not rise as the recession draws to a close. The LDP's Mr Shizuka Kamei, the transport minister, this month slapped down a plan by the big three airlines to hire new staff on short-term contracts, and dissent came from the business community alone. The only issue which has caused difficulties is one dating back 49 years. As Mr Murayama sets off for Manila today at the start of an eight-day South-East Asian tour, no consensus has emerged on how to atone for Japan's wartime misdeeds. On his visit to the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore he may come bearing little except expressions of remorse. LDP officials are still having difficulty coming to terms with the past. Mr Shin Sakurai resigned as environment minister a week ago after suggesting that Asian countries had benefited from Japanese occupation. Following talks last night with coalition leaders, it was still uncertain whether Mr Murayama would be in a position to tell Philippine President Fidel Ramos of a plan to set up a Y100bn (Pounds 656m) private foundation. This would provide, among others, for the so-called comfort women who were forced to provide sex for imperial army troops during the second world war. Tensions persist within the parliamentary LDP, defections from which brought about its downfall last summer. An LDP committee is debating whether to abolish the intra-party factions, which have traditionally served as powerful lines of patronage. Many party elders will dislike the proposal. Mr Murayama has, meanwhile, still to complete the post-Cold War conversion of his own party. An SDP congress next month is likely to highlight grassroots concerns. But the leap over the ideological threshold to share house with the LDP is supported, according to one poll, by a comfortable majority of regional SDP leaders.</p>

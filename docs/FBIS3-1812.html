Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 2 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan  and the United States are working together on a patent and  trademark reciprocal protection agreement on the third day of  intellectual property rights (IPR) protection talks here in  Taipei.    Chen Tzuo-chen, deputy director-general of the National  Bureau of Standards (NBS) under the Ministry of Economic  Affairs, said that a reciprocity pact will ensure better  protection for inventions by peoples of the two countries.    The US delegation to the talks, now in their third and final  day, was originally concerned that revisions to Taiwan's patent  law did not stipulate jail sentences for violations, Chen said.    But American delegates said they were satisfied after  learning that the revised law increases fines to the equivalent  of twice the damage incurred by violation, he noted.    The three-day IPR consultations between Taiwan and the  United  States are expected to conclude late Wednesday [2 March].</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> SUSPECTED CON MAN CAPTURED BY POLICE  </P> <P> Police Monday arrested a man suspected of being a scam artist who tells his  victims a heart-wrenching story before swindling them.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Robert Oakley said Bruce Ralph Lepthien is a suspect in  several scams in Southern California. The person sought would tell his victim  that he needed a ride to an emergency room, where his wife had supposedly been  taken.  </P> <P> Once the person reached the hospital, he asked the victim for money to buy  flowers for his wife and a taxi ride home, Oakley said.  </P> <P> A Newport Beach housewife called police Monday afternoon after Lepthien  allegedly knocked on her door and told her a similar tale, Oakley said. The  woman, who lives on the 300 block of Evening Canyon Drive, told him that she  could not help and alerted police.  </P> <P> After the woman informed the police, she saw the suspect soliciting her  next-door neighbor, who was willing to drive him to the hospital. The housewife  told the suspect that police officers were coming and to get out of the car,  Oakley said. Lepthien then fled the scene.  </P> <P> Officers found the suspect walking several blocks away. He was arrested on  suspicion of burglary, Oakley said, because he allegedly entered a residence  with an intent to commit a felony. Lepthien is being held at Newport Beach City  Jail in lieu of a $25,000 bond.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Muhammad Sharaf: "The Peace Process Between </F> the Palestinians and Israel Overcomes a Big Hurdle"]    [Text] If the weeks that have passed since the heinous  al-Ibrahimi Mosque crime have proved anything, they prove that  the peace process is facing real dangers that no one will be  able to control in the absence of certain essential conditions.  The first condition is that the parties concerned, especially  Israel, prove with practical deeds that this process is not  being used for maneuvers or compromises over firm principles.  One of these principles is that there must be security for both  the Arab Palestinian and Israeli sides. This means that Israel  should not place the issue of its own security above all other  considerations, especially the security of the Palestinians and  their legitimate human and political rights.    The second condition is that all parties should scrupulously  adhere to all the agreements they reach, especially on the  timetables of these agreements. As events and developments have  proved, it is indisputable that Israel's non-adherence to the  timetables of the Declaration of Principles and the Gaza-Jericho  Agreement has given the enemies and opponents of peace a chance  to try to scuttle the peace process.    The third condition is that all international regional and  international circumstances dictate the need to speed up the  peace process.    We say this in the light of the announcement early today  that  the Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached an agreement on  the security arrangements in Hebron. The details of this  agreement will be announced later. The negotiations will then  directly move to the current bas in the way he talks. Sources  close to the talks have stated that Egyptian diplomacy has  played a key role in helping the two sides to reach an agreement  on the security arrangements in Hebron. These sources have  stated that the focal point of these arrangements is the two  sides' agreement on a strong international presence after a  prolonged Israel hesitation in accepting it.    A major issue in during the phase of Palestinian self-rule,  lasting until agreement is reached on the final status of the  occupied territories, should now be addressed -- that is, mutual  security in these territories. Events since the al-Ibrahim  Mosque crime prove, as they have since 1967, that it is  impossible for Israel to remain solely responsible for security  in these occupied territories. The legacy of enmity and hatred  between the Palestinians and Israelis, especially the extremist  Israelis, is heavy. Events and developments indicate in no  uncertain terms that the Jewish settlements in the occupied  territories are illegal and a grave mistake from the practical  point of view. Those who have agreed to settle among the  Palestinians in areas of high population density are mostly  ultra-extremists and adventurists. The repressive practices of  the occupation forces prove that these forces cannot get rid of  their hatred and fanaticism toward the Palestinians.    Therefore, the strong international presence in Hebron must  extend to the remaining occupied territories, including  Jerusalem, so that the final peace agreement can provide for the  disengagement of the two sides. In any case, it is somewhat  reassuring that the peace process has so far been proceeding on  a correct course despite the substantial obstacles and  difficulties facing it.</p>

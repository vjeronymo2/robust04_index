			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHANCE TO RESHAPE SCHOOL BOARD;  </P> <P> SCOTT HARVEY AND SUE BRAUN ARE CLEAR CHOICES FOR IMPORTANT DISTRICT POSTS  </P> <P> School board elections often force voters to choose from among unknown  candidates with few distinguishing stands on key issues. Not this year.  </P> <P> It's tough to confuse the candidates in the District C race for San Diego  school trustee. The differences between them make Scott Harvey the clear choice  for this important post.  </P> <P> While the distinctions between District B candidates Sue Braun and Lynette  Williams aren't as dramatic, Braun's more progressive bent and superior  experience make her far more qualified for the job.  </P> <P> In District C, Harvey favors the much needed school-based health clinics (but  supports each community's right to choose whether they dispense  contraceptives). His opponent, teacher John de Beck, does not. Harvey supports  school integration programs; De Beck does not.  </P> <P> Harvey has helped site child-care facilities on a school campus and wants to  continue working for more of them. He proposes to broaden the curriculum to  make it more relevant to the city's increasing population of ethnic minorities.  A lobbyist by profession, he wants the school board to be more active in  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Some of De Beck's iconoclasm and blunt talk about rethinking educational  priorities is refreshing. But he suffers from the perception that, as a former  teachers union leader, he would be too closely allied with the school system's  main labor force to bring a balanced perspective to his role as trustee. All  five current board members have endorsed Harvey.  </P> <P> Sue Braun, who is making her second run for the school board, offers a platform  a bit heavy on generalities. She has trouble explaining how she'll achieve her  laudable goal of retaining more teachers.  </P> <P> But Braun believes that to curb the dropout rate, school resources must be  focused on building students' self-esteem as early as kindergarten. And she  proposes to put more aides in classrooms to help handle escalating class sizes.  </P> <P> Braun has broader and more sophisticated knowledge about the district's needs  than neophyte Williams. A former teacher, Williams lists improving literacy  rates, increasing the relevancy of the high school curriculum and character  building as her top goals. She opposes school-based health clinics.  </P> <P> With no incumbents running in this year's elections, voters have the  opportunity to reshape 40% of the school board. These four candidates offer  them a wide range of views and, we believe, clear choices for the future of the  city's education system.  </P></p>

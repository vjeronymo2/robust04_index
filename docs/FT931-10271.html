			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Elderflower champagne makers toast a victory A MANUFACTURER of Elderflower champagne successfully resisted a challenge by the French champagne industry in the High Court yesterday. Thorncroft, a Surrey-based vineyard, will be allowed to go on marketing its sparkling non-alcoholic drink as Elderflower champagne even though the court ruled that the drink, sold in champagne-style bottles with wired corks, was 'misrepresentation calculated to deceive'. But it concluded that the damage to the reputation of genuine champagne would be nil or minimal. Mr Guy Woodall (above left), Thorncroft's owner, and partner Mr Ray Bevan toasted their triumph explosively - with Elderflower champagne. Report, Page 8</p>

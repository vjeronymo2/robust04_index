			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER HINTS PATIENCE WITH DENT IS WEARING THIN  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner's patience appears to be wearing thin as the New York  Yankees continue to stumble, and Manager Bucky Dent could be one of the  casualties.  </P> <P> "Nobody is more disappointed than I am," the team's owner told the New York  Times after the Yankees returned from a 2-6 road trip.  </P> <P> "I've been very patient with Bucky. I haven't said a harsh word; in fact, I've  been very encouraging. But I can see what everybody else sees."  </P> <P> The Times reported today that sources say Steinbrenner already is mulling major  changes within the Yankees organization after a 17-27 start, their worst since  1925.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, outfielder Mel Hall ripped his teammates for their lack of desire.  </P> <P> "The intensity here stinks," Hall told the New York Daily News. "It's almost as  if we don't have guts. We just have to have more heart. I don't see it here."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSMETIC SURGEON STRIPPED OF LICENSE  </P> <P> The Medical Board of California, levying its harshest punishment, has stripped  the license of a nationally known cosmetic surgeon in Newport Beach for his  fraudulent treatment of a disgruntled former Mrs. California and another  patient, officials said.  </P> <P> Administrative Law Judge Rosalynn M. Chapman found that Dr. Michael Elam, 42,  who gained national prominence in helping redo the face of comedian Phyllis  Diller, had doctored medical records to obtain fraudulent insurance claims for  the two patients.  </P> <P> In a decision adopted by the full board, Chapman wrote: "Elam is dishonest and  has no compunction about lying under oath. . . . (He) has shown no sorrow,  remorse or contrition for his conduct, and it is, thus, unlikely that he will  voluntarily change that conduct."  </P> <P> An attorney for Elam, who was out of the country, promised to appeal.  </P></p>

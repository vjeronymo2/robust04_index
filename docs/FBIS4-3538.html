			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Qisi (3769 4874 1835): "Clinton's Diplomatic Gains </F> and Losses"]    [Text] In order to appraise Clinton's diplomatic  achievements in his first year of government, let us first look  at his group of diplomats. To begin with, as the president of  the world's "sole superpower," Clinton did not have enough  international knowledge and had limited diplomatic knowledge  when he took charge of the White House. Then let us look at his  supreme policymaking circle. It does not have seasoned  statesmen like former Secretaries of State Baker and Schultz,  nor veteran advisers like former National Security Advisers  Kissinger and Brzezinski. However, precisely because this group  of diplomats is lacking strong men, many notable readjustments  have been made in diplomatic strategy over the past year. When  Clinton put his group of diplomats in place, some U.S. papers  and magazines commented that Clinton used competent personnel  rather than strong men in order to hold the decisionmaking power  for foreign policy firmly in his own hands.  <H5>  "Home and Foreign Policies Are Inseparably Close" </H5>   Clinton holds the foreign policy decisionmaking power in his  own hands to prevent the policy from deviating from the fixed  principle touted during his election campaign, namely, the main  course of "putting domestic affairs first." Prior to his  inauguration, he said clearly at one time that he would  "concentrate on economic issues like a laser beam." He  unequivocally said: "In today's world, foreign policy and  domestic policy are inseparably close." He criticized former  President Bush for putting too much energy into foreign affairs,  while neglecting the serious economic and social problems at  home. Clinton's idea is this: In order to reverse the trend of  a weakening United States so that it can play a role in the  diplomatic arena, it is necessary to begin by reviving the  economy and upgrading scientific and technological  competitiveness and education. Not long after he assumed power,  he put forward a basket of economic revitalization plans with  the stimulation of economic growth as the short-term objective  and the reduction of the deficit as the long-term objective.    Economists are still disputing what achievements Clinton's  economic plans have made over the past year. However, the U.S.  economy enjoyed growth exceeding 2.7 percent in 1993, higher  than the average level of developed Western countries, improving  the Clinton administration's image. U.S. economic growth is  expected to continue to exceed that of Japan and Germany this  year. The United States has always been a world leader in  aeronautic, astronautical, and computer technology. In  traditional industrial sectors such as the auto industry, it is  also enhancing its competitiveness. At the end of last year,  Vice President Gore announced that the nationwide information  network called the "information highway" will be completed in 10  to 15 years, which is a sign that the United States will lead  the world in the information revolution.    As for domestic policy, the Democratic president is enjoying  a Democratic-majority Congress, so he is getting along much  better than the previous administration. The proposal Clinton  put forward to Congress last year received 88 percent approval.  Compared with the first-year administration records of  preceding U.S. presidents before and after the World War II,  this percentage was just lower than Eisenhower's. Although  Clinton does not have a high popularity rating, he is better off  with his domestic situation than the leaders of other major  Western countries.    All this, of course, does not affect Clinton's diplomatic  achievements. However, his modest successes in the economic,  science and technology, and domestic areas have added to the  United States' bargaining chips in dealing with other Western  countries.  <H5>  The Three Big Moves in the Economic Field </H5>   Although some people at home have repeatedly criticized  Clinton, saying that he has not had a clear foreign policy and  that he always wavers in handling foreign affairs, this  "inexperienced" president from Arkansas has made the biggest  readjustment in U.S. foreign policy since World War II --  putting economic security as the center of foreign policy for  the first time. The United States' major diplomatic activities  last year were generally centered on economic relations and  trade. Whether at the Group of Seven Summit in Tokyo, the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Seattle, or at the  U.S.-EC trade talks on agricultural products or the GATT Uruguay  Round talks, Clinton and his high-ranking officials have strived  to better the U.S. economy. After the arduous multilateral  talks, agreements were ultimately reached in these diplomatic  rounds which can be viewed as the limited success of the Clinton  administration.    The process of global economic integration is, in the final  analysis, a drive for the U.S. economy, although the United  States will have to pay a considerable price. Explaining the  significance of the Uruguay Round, Clinton said: "The  successful signing of the GATT agreements will create 1.4  million employment opportunities (for the United States) and  increase the U.S. average annual household income by $1,700,  thus ending the two-decade long stagnation of the middle class."    As the U.S. Congress debated the North American Free Trade  Agreement, which was proposed during the Bush era, Clinton also  used similar, moving words. He even mobilized almost all living  former presidents to boost the approval of the agreement. He  also charged Vice President Gore to hold a televised debate with  H. Ross Perot (who ran in the presidential election as an  independent candidate against Bush and Clinton). In a hot  debate with the trade protectionist forces represented by Perot,  Clinton had a close shave. Congress approved the North American  Free Trade Agreement by a weak majority. This was another point  for Clinton.    The Seattle forum was the Clinton administration's important  move in the Asia-Pacific region. The economic boom in the  Asia-Pacific region has attracted Clinton's interest. His  meeting with Jiang Zemin in Seattle has made an obvious  improvement in the atmosphere of Sino-U.S. relations. The  successful convening of the Seattle forum has added another  great success to Clinton's economic and diplomatic activities.    Using "fair trade" as the banner, Clinton has been taking a  much tougher stance at international economic and trade talks  than in the past. "Fair trade" means in fields where U.S.  products have an edge, the United States compels other countries  to open their markets by threatening to set up trade barriers  for their products in the United States. For instance, now that  the United States is the world's largest exporter of  agricultural products and its agriculture has a relative edge  over the EC, it compelled EC countries to lower export subsidies  for their agricultural products. Moreover, the United States  exerted great pressure on Japan and South Korea, forcing them to  open up their rice markets. Although this practice works at  times, it has led to the strong dislike of its trading partners  and to their retaliatory measures.  <H5>  Military Interventions Win No Support </H5>   If one says Clinton's diplomatic achievements last year were  mainly reflected in the economic field, then the incessant  overseas military interventions were his greatest failure. It  was Bush who decided to send troops to Somalia under the banner  of UN peacekeeping forces, but it is Clinton who should be held  responsible for sending additional troops to Somalia and then  putting warlord Aidid on the wanted list. The consequences of  this were large-scale armed disputes, U.S. officers and men  getting wounded and killed, and high casualties among the  peacekeeping forces. In the face of acute criticism at home and  abroad, Secretary of State Christopher was compelled to publicly  admit last October that the United States made mistakes in  Somalia. Moreover, the United States sent personnel to hold  secret talks with Aidid to seek a political solution and fixed  31 March as the deadline for the pullout of U.S. troops from  Somalia.    The setbacks in Somalia made the Clinton administration  think  twice on the question of overseas military intervention. The  example was that when U.S. military personnel were about to land  in Haiti in accordance with the UN Security Council resolution  last October, they were barred from entry by Haiti's military  and the Clinton administration suppressed its anger and did not  hastily send ground forces to intervene. Similarly, after  repeated hesitation, Clinton never used force against Serbian  troops in Bosnia. One of the reasons for this is that he has  drawn a lesson from Somalia.    The kind of prudence shown by the United States in overseas  military interventions reflects the readjustment of its defense  policy. The emphasis of the Clinton administration's defense  plan is to build up quality armed forces; appropriately cut  military expenditure, the size of the armed forces, and overseas  military bases; and enhance quick mobility and combat  effectiveness. Its objective is to win two regional wars  simultaneously if this is necessary. It is out of keeping with  the diplomatic thinking of "putting the economy first" if the  United States gets involved in a military dispute which is not  vital to its own strategic interests. Moreover, it will find its  ability limited, it will be criticized by public opinion, and  will find the loss outweighs the gain. If the Clinton  administration can learn something from its past setbacks, does  more things like bringing about the signing of the Palestinian-  Israeli peace accord, and carries out less unnecessary military  interventions, it should be able to improve its prestige at home  and abroad.    However, it remains to be seen whether or not the United  States will take new military risks abroad in an attempt to  "revive its military prowess." Clinton has one problem, namely,  that as the president and the general commander of the Armed  Forces, his relations with the U.S. military have never been  straightened out. During the Vietnam War, he refused to serve in  the Armed Forces. No sooner had he become the president than he  legalized homosexuality in the Armed Forces and continued to cut  military expenditures, thus offending many high-ranking military  personalities. Recently, U.S. leaders had an internal argument  as to how to use limited foreign aid. Clinton and Gore were on  one side, favoring using more foreign aid to promote  environmental protection and "democratization" of other  countries, and not on traditional items related to national  security, and this was another issue with the military. At the  end of last year, compelled by pressure from the military,  Clinton could not but agree to lower the military spending cuts.  In the future, faced with frequent regional military conflicts,  nationality confrontations, religious disputes, and the  proliferation of sophisticated weapons about which the United  States is most worried, it is doubtful whether or not the  Clinton administration can really place its foreign policy  emphasis on the economy.  <H5>  Values Are Challenged </H5>   The Clinton administration considers the safeguarding of  economic security, maintaining powerful Armed Forces, and  promoting global democracy as the "three pillars" of its foreign  policy. In promoting the values of American-style "democracy"  and "human rights," Clinton really has nothing to brag about.  At international forums such as the World Human Rights  Conference held last June, Western human rights concepts sharply  contradicted the views of many developing countries. In the  face of the speedy economy development of East Asia, many  Americans admit that it is not merely Western political and  social development patterns that can lead to economic  prosperity. In an article entitled "the Clash of  Civilizations," Harvard University Professor Samuel P.  Huntington predicts that conflict between civilizations will  supplant ideological conflict, and Confucian civilization and  Islamic civilization may join hands to pose a strong challenge  to Western interests, values, and power. Some commentators hold  that Huntington's argument shows a pessimism of being incapable  of making the world accept American values. Various facts show  that in promoting "democratization" in the world today, the  United States meets no less resistance than it did during the  Cold War.    The Clinton administration has set aside $1 billion to  strive  to support Russia economically so as to expand the "democratic  family." But President Yeltsin's American-supported radical  political and economic reforms have not produced obvious  results. The bloody disputes in Moscow last October ended with  the "democratic faction's" temporary victory. But no sooner had  Americans had a breathing spell than the worrying "Zhirinovsky  phenomenon" appeared in Russia's year-end parliament elections.  The question of how the United States should cope once the  extreme nationalist forces get the upper hand in Russia will be  a big test for Clinton.    Generally speaking, in his first year of governing, Clinton  has had diplomatic achievements and failures. Economically, in  handling relations with other major powers, he seems to have  made some positive readjustments. But he has met some obvious  setbacks in overseas military interventions and has had numerous  obstacles in pursuing "democratization." The Clinton  administration does not have any immediate diplomatic issues at  the present time, and it is a rare opportunity for him to make a  review and readjustments. Can he prudently and pragmatically  conform to the trends of the times? People are waiting to see.</p>

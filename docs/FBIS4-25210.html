			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Premier Li Peng at the inauguration of the </F> Chinese Academy of Engineering and the opening of the seventh  academicians' conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on 3  June 1994]    [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- Academicians and  comrades:    On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State  Council, I hereby extend my warm congratulations on the  inauguration of the Chinese Academy of Engineering [CAE] and the  opening of the seventh academicians' conference of the Chinese  Academy of Sciences [CAS]. I would like to take this  opportunity to give my cordial regards and highest respects to  all the academicians of the two academies and all other  scientists and technicians across the country who have made  outstanding contributions to China's scientific and  technological undertakings.    The founding of the CAE is a major event in the engineering  communities and is of great significance for China's socialist  modernization drive. Engineering technology is the  crystallization of the people's efforts to apply scientific  theories in transforming and protecting nature. It plays an  indispensable, important role during the course of turning  scientific and technological achievements into practical  productive forces. At present, engineering technology is  progressing vigorously at an unprecedentedly high speed, showing  its great might in promoting economic and social development.  Since the founding of New China, the vast number of Chinese  engineers and technicians, displaying a spirit of patriotism and  hard struggle and striving to raise the level of engineering  technology and enhance their designing and engineering ability,  have built a large number of important projects and  infrastructure and made outstanding contributions to economic  construction and national defense. During the course of  practical construction, China has created unique engineering  features and strength in certain fields, and trained a large  number of engineers and technicians. The founding of the CAE,  with outstanding experts in the engineering communities as its  mainstay, will have an important impact on affirming the  contributions of engineers and technicians, improving their  social status, arousing their enthusiasm, giving play to their  overall strength, and stepping up the country's development of  engineering technology. The CAE is a most honorable,  consultative academic organ in China's engineering communities.  I hope the CAE will work according to rules and regulations,  and give advice and suggestions at the government's request on  the state's major engineering projects and programs, and on  research and studies on the development of major engineering  technology; and that it will make active contributions to  uniting and leading engineers and technicians across the country  in implementing the government's policies and principles on the  work of science and technology, and to academic exchanges and  cooperation at home and abroad.    The CAS Scientific Council, the highest science and  technology advisory organ of the state founded in 1955, has  played an important role in formulating and implementing the  major scientific and technological policies and plans of the  state. To further facilitate international exchanges and embody  the authoritative and honorary status of the CAS Scientific  Council, the State Council has decided to rename the Scientific  Council members academicians, while the academicians' system  will also be carried out in the CAE. This is an important  measure which conforms to the practice of the scientific and  technological communities of the world, as well as the strong  and general aspirations of the scientific and technological  communities at home. This is the first academicians' conference  of the CAS. However, we call it the seventh academicians'  conference because it is the continuation of those conferences  of the Scientific Council. During the current conference, the  first batch of foreign academicians of the CAS will be selected,  and they will yield a positive impact on opening China's  scientific and technological field wider to the outside world,  expanding international scientific and technological exchanges  and cooperation, and promoting China's scientific and  technological undertakings.    During the course of socialist modernization, we should  always adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's guiding concept that  "science and technology is the primary productive force" and  uphold the principle that "economic construction must rely on  science and technology, and science and technology must meet the  needs of economic construction." We should strive to ensure  three rational things -- meeting the major needs of economic  construction, developing the high-technological industries, and  stepping up basic research. Since the start of reform and  opening up, China's scientists and technicians have made  remarkable achievements in tackling important scientific and  technological problems, utilizing and popularizing the use of  scientific and technological achievements, promoting scientific  and technological progress in enterprises and rural areas,  conducting high-technological research, stepping up basic  research, and building key construction projects. Remarkable  progress has been made in implementing the state science fund  system and the patent system, in building high-technological  industrial parks, in carrying out "Program 863," "the Spark  Program," and the plans for advancing agriculture and for  helping the poor regions through the application of science and  technology, and in commercialization and industrialization of  scientific research results and new technologies. Reform of the  management system for science and technology is being deepened  to keep pace with reform of the economic structure. Reform of  the management system for science and technology is for the  purpose for establishing a new system that suits the development  of a socialist market economy, accords with the law of science  and technology, and builds a close tie between science and  technology and the economy; and for the purpose of promoting  scientific and technological progress, scaling scientific and  technological heights, and achieving a comprehensive and  coordinated development of economy, science and technology, and  the society.    At present, the trial of overall national strength based on  economy and science and technology among countries is becoming  more and more intense day by day. China's scientists and  technicians are a very important force, enabling our country to  achieve modernization and meet the challenge of international  competition. The CAE and CAS, as the two top academic bodies of  China's scientific and technological communities, should work  hand in hand in close coordination to make greater contributions  to the country's modernization drive. The academicians of the  CAS and the CAE, as the distinguished representatives and the  backbone of China's science and engineering communities  shouldering a heavy responsibility, should unite and cooperate  with one another, lead the scientists and technicians across the  country in working hard with a will to make the country strong,  forge ahead, strive to scale scientific and technological  heights and surpass the advanced level of the world, and  contribute wisdom and talents to building China into a great,  powerful socialist country. Scientists and engineers are a  precious wealth of our country. I hope that the party and  government leaders at all levels will take good care of our  scientists and engineers in terms of political treatment and  working and living conditions, show concern for their work and  their livelihood, and create the conditions for them to play an  even better role.    I wish the conference complete success!</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA)--Taiwan will soon send a  delegation to the capital of Zhejiang Province to learn more  about Mainland China's investigation into the March 31 Qiandao  Lake incident, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered and  robbed, Li Ching-ping, deputy director-general of the Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Monday [25 February].    Li said that the delegation, to leave sometime this week,  will be comprised of SEF officials, retired police detectives,  and relatives of the victims. SEF is Taiwan's non-official  conduit for mainland- Taiwan relations.    This will be the first time Taiwan has sent a group to learn  more about a criminal case on the mainland since the opening of  cross- strait civilian exchanges, sources said.    Beijing announced on April 17 that it arrested three men  suspected of committing the "heinous murder, robbery and arson."    Although Beijing has closed the probe of the case, it is  still unable to answer some questions posed by the victims'  relatives.    Li called on Beijing to release autopsy reports made after  the incident and said the Taiwan delegation will give the  mainland time to prepare such reports if it has not done so  already.    Li added that a time and venue have not been picked for a  proposed special meeting between SEF and its mainland  counterpart the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait (ARATS) to discuss travel safety in the wake of the boat  incident.    Li said that SEF has asked ARATS to suggest a suitable time  and venue for the meeting.    SEF proposed to hold the meeting April 27-28 in either Hong  Kong or Taipei.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Letter: Arms to Iraq - the complex objectives and high cost Sir, Surely the real irony of the so-called Iraqi arms scandal has yet to be aired. Britain almost certainly did not sell the arms but in effect gave them to the Iraqis. The exports will almost certainly have had Export Credits Guarantee Department cover which will be called upon and, as there is virtually no prospect of Iraq every repaying all its international creditors, the arms were thus a gift. Hopefully I will be contradicted? Colin Grant-Wilson, Appletrees, Market Heath, Benchley, Kent TN12 7PB</p>

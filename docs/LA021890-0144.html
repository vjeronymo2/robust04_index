			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIVE AND COUNTING  </P> <P> It is eight years since I fulfilled a lifetime ambition with my first visit to  the United States. I am enjoying my fifth, with a sixth planned for later in  the year.  </P> <P> My experiences have so far lived up to my expectations. The standard tourist  guides are excellent value for the basics, but they can't beat local and  contemporary information, whether by regular visits or by contact with a  native. It is this information that has allowed me to meet more real Americans.  </P> <P> If any of your readers have plans or thoughts of visiting the United Kingdom, I  would welcome the opportunity to meet during my next visit for an exchange of  information. It may be that clubs and associations would see this as an  appropriate subject for one of their meetings, in which case I would be happy  to formalize and illustrate my contribution, as required. I will reply to any  correspondence received at 50 Lavender Ave., Coundon, Coventry CV6 1DB,  England.  </P> <P> JOHN C. HEWITSON  </P> <P> England  </P></p>

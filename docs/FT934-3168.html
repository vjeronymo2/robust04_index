			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / US mayors add to support for registration of guns: Campaign gains impetus from passage of Brady bill Support is building in the US for the imposition of a national system for registering and licensing guns. Attorney General Janet Reno, who has been asked by President Bill Clinton to study the proposal, said yesterday she strongly favoured a licensing test to show that individuals can safely and lawfully use a gun. 'I think it should be at least as hard to get a licence to possess a gun as it is to drive an automobile,' Ms Reno said. A task force of mayors and city police chiefs also backed gun registration in a meeting yesterday with Mr Clinton to discuss crime and violence. Support for tougher controls on firearms cuts across party lines, and the suggestion for compulsory registration was in fact made to Mr Clinton by Mr Rudolf Giuliani, the Republican mayor-elect of New York, and Mr Richard Riordan, the Republican mayor of Los Angeles. Mr Clinton has not taken a firm position on the idea of registration, but he said yesterday that he believed the US was now ready to act on violent crime. 'We have to move and I think we are prepared to move,' he said. The mayors' task force also called for a ban on the manufacture, sale or possession of all semi-automatic assault weapons and their components, much higher taxes on firearms and ammunition, and much stiffer controls on gun dealers. In addition, the mayors asked for extra federal money to pay for more police officers, the prosecution of violent juvenile offenders as adults and mandatory minimum sentences for all repeat drug sale convictions. They warned, however, that such measures were only short term recommendations. 'In our view, lasting solutions lie in Washington's willingness to view affordable housing as a weapon to fight crime, to view child care, job training, recreation programs, community development and transportation to jobs as weapons to fight crime,' Mr Jerry Abramson, mayor of Louisville and president of the US Conference of Mayors, told Mr Clinton. Yesterday's White House meeting followed yet another outburst of random violence when a gunman killed five people and wounded 18 others on a New York suburban commuter train on Tuesday. At least 38 people have been killed in the US so far this year in 11 similar attacks, where an angry gunman with a grudge has opened fire at random. Proposals for compulsory gun registration have already aroused fierce opposition from gun lobbies such as the National Rifle Association. While the NRA has traditionally opposed even the most modest forms of restriction on gun ownership, registration is a particular anathema to the 3.3m member organisation's core supporters. The strongest opponents of gun controls argue that registration would allow a tyrannical government to confiscate guns; they claim that the Holocaust would not have happened without the gun registration laws passed in Germany in the 1930s. Public pressure for tougher action to curb gun violence, however, has not dissipated with the passage by Congress last month of a law requiring hand gun buyers to wait five days while their backgrounds are checked. Rather, the passage of the Brady bill after seven years of argument has released the energies of gun control campaigners to work on other measures. Further crime legislation has been passed in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but the different versions must be reconciled when Congress meets again in January before they become law.</p>

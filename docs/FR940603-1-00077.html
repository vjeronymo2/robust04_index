During the performance of this Contract, the Bidder agrees as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Bidder will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.

Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: Employment, upgrading, demotions or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection of training, including apprenticeship. The Bidder agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided setting forth the provisions of this Equal Opportunity Clause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Bidder will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the Bidder, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex or national origin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Bidder will send to each labor union or representative of workers, with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice to be provided advising the said labor union or workers' representative of the Bidder's commitments under this section, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Bidder will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and the rules, regulations and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Bidder will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and by rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to its books, records, and accounts by the administering agency and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations, and orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) In the event of the Bidder's noncompliance with the Equal Opportunity Clause of this Contract or with any of the said rules, regulations, or orders, this Contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and the Bidder may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts or federally assisted construction contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as provided by law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The Bidder will include this Equal Opportunity Clause in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by the rules, regulations, or order of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to Section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The Bidder will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the administering agency may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance; Provided, however, that in the event Bidder becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction by the administering agency, the Bidder may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Certificate of Nonsegregated Facilities. The Bidder certifies that it does not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Bidder certifies further that it will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Bidder agrees that a breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity Clause in this Contract. As used in this certification, the term ``segregated facilities'' means any waiting rooms, work areas, restrooms and washrooms, restaurants and other eating areas, timeclocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin, because of habit, local custom, or otherwise. The Bidder agrees that (except where it has obtained identical certifications from proposed subcontractors for specific time periods) it will obtain identical certifications from proposed subcontractors prior to the award of subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the provisions of the Equal Opportunity Clause, and that it will retain such certifications in its files. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7.

If the Bidder shall enter into a subcontract with any subcontractor for the performance of any part of this Contract, the Bidder shall be as fully responsible to the Owner and the Administrator for the acts and omissions of such subcontractor and of persons employed by such subcontractor as the Bidder would be for its own acts and omissions and those of persons directly employed by it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9.

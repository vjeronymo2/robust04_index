			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Ashdown backs caution on a pact with Labour LIBERAL Democrats have 'everything to lose and nothing to gain' from national pacts with other parties according to a pamphlet launched yesterday with the blessing of Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader. Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey and one of the authors of the pamphlet, said that pre-election pacts should be ruled out, but co-operation with Labour after the next election would be worthwhile if it delivered proportional representation. Senior party figures are keen that the party conference in Harrogate, which begins tomorrow should not be overwhelmed by the question of electoral pacts. However, the difficulty of achieving this was demonstrated again yesterday by the interest shown in the backing among party members for Mr Ashdown's proposal for dialogue with members of other parties. The pamphlet published yesterday says that: 'To encourage and advance the Liberal Democratic agenda' individuals and groups from within the party should hold discussions with people in Labour and other parties. But it says also that for the 'foreseeable future' the task of Liberal Democrat campaigners is to maintain the party's clear and separate identity. The conference will debate strategy in an informal session tomorrow and in a more formal debate on Wednesday. The sending of British forces to Bosnia was still not a reason to recall parliament, Mr John Major said yesterday, dismissing a demand from Mr Paddy Ashdown for MPs to be able to debate the move before the troops receive the order to set off as part of the United Nations mission.

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Silentnight shares fall on warning Shares in Silentnight Holdings fell by more than 10 per cent after Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds announced that the results seen in the first four months in the core UK bed division had been 'disappointing'. Yesterday the shares closed down 24p at 219p, having at one point fallen as low as 209p. Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said that the UK bed businesses remained 'under significant margin pressure'. Not counting closure costs, which would be taken in the accounts for the current year, he expected 'results for the first half to be lower than the first half last year', when profits grew 27 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. He explained there had been little change in the condition of the UK furniture market in the last couple of months. However, not all the news was bad: there had been an upturn in the US operation; the German bed business had been performing satisfactorily; and there had been continued healthy growth in the UK cabinet businesses. In March the group's shares tumbled 18p to 355p following a warning that profits for the year to January would be 'slightly below average market expectations'. The result, announced in May, was 3 per cent ahead at Pounds 12.4m.</p>

The municipality placed 1,044 cases violating party  discipline and the administrative discipline on file for  investigation and prosecution in the year. Of these cases, 518  are of economic ones such as embezzlement and accepting bribes  and account for 49.6 percent of the total. Of these economic  cases, appalling and major ones account for 42 percent of the  total. The municipality punished 593 party-member wrongdoers.  Of these party members, 204 were dismissed from the party; 96  were placed on probation within the party; 17 were dismissed  from their party posts; 276 were given serious warnings or  warnings; and 263 were punished with administrative sanctions.    Since the sixth Beijing municipal conference held in June  last year on encouraging officials to perform their duties  honestly and particularly since the second plenum of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission, the municipal discipline  inspection and procuratorial organs at all levels have further  reinforced their strength in investigating and handling cases  and increased quarter after quarter the number of new cases that  have been placed on file for investigation and prosecution.  According to the statistics, 177 cases were placed on file in  the second quarter; 188 were placed on file in the third  quarter; and 388 were placed on file in the fourth quarter.    Since the anticorruption struggle the municipality has  emphatically investigated and handled the cases violating the  discipline and law, which have been committed by the leading  cadres of party and government organs and by the working  personnel of judicial departments, law enforcement and  administrative departments, and economic and managerial  departments. E Zhiqiang, former chairman of the Chaoyang  district commission for foreign economic relations and trade,  was dismissed from the party on charges of embezzling public  funds and accepting bribes worth more than 8,600 yuan during his  tenure. Chen Zhiwen, former chief procurator of the Changping  county people's procuratorate, was dismissed from the party on  charges of demanding and accepting cash and materials worth more  than 21,000 yuan and embezzling public funds and material worth  more than 7,400 yuan.</p>

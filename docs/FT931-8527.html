			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Vietnam: a rocky road for investors: A gaping lack of infrastructure contributes to problems ONE of Vietnam's attractions for foreign investors is the size of its population: a plentiful supply of workers and a domestic market of 67m consumers is an enticing prospect for manufacturers. Perhaps it is fitting that the Taiwanese, the largest source of foreign capital for Vietnam, should be among the first to suffer the consequences of overcrowding. Completion of a huge Taiwanese industrial estate in a loop of the Saigon river in southern Vietnam is being delayed because the land is already occupied by scores of villagers who do not want to move without generous compensation. 'I am Vietnamese,' says Mr Don Van Hien, a 56-year-old sawmill worker, when asked whether the industrial estate does not represent progress. 'I'm looking forward to developing the country, but the government doesn't pay enough for us to move to another place.' The bare, flattened sand of the 40 hectares cleared so far - dotted with the occasional Taoist shrine which the developers have not dared to molest - comes right up to his doorstep. Behind him are the paddy fields and creeks where he and the other villagers supplement their income by farming rice or catching fish. 'I don't want to move,' says Mr Hien. 'The government wants to get more money to enrich the nation, but how can the poor people survive?' The ambitious plans of the Taiwanese - and their trials and tribulations in seeking to implement those plans - demonstrate both the opportunities and the pitfalls confronting investors in Vietnam. The Tan Thuan export processing zone, at 300ha the largest such zone planned for the country's industrial heartland around Ho Chi Minh City, is an Dollars 89m joint venture between the Central Trading and Development Corporation of Taiwan (which is owned by the ruling Kuomintang party) and Ho Chi Minh City's Communist people's committee. As in most such ventures the foreign partner provides the money and the skills and the Vietnamese provide the land. 'We have a lot of problems right now,' says Mr Chow Hong-Lin, one of the Taiwanese managers at Tan Thuan. First, there was a contingent of air defence troops who had to be moved out of their barracks in the future export processing zone; at one point they locked the gates and refused to go, and they were difficult to dislodge because they had guns. Then the villagers had to be compensated for moving. Some of them took the money and stayed in their houses, others built new shacks in other parts of the land earmarked for development. Now the company has to trace the descendants of the Chinese ancestors worshipped at the shrines to negotiate their removal. Clearing the land is only the start. The ground is boggy and tonnes of sand were trucked in to level it. The underground water is dirty and Tan Thuan must pay Dollars 4m to have fresh water piped in from outside the zone. Electricity is in short supply in southern Vietnam, so Tan Thuan, together with Hong Kong's New World Group, is planning to build a Dollars 250m thermal power station at a village 20km away. In the meantime the 15 brave companies which have already paid their deposits to set up factories in the zone are being encouraged to bring their own generators. Transport in Vietnam is also notoriously difficult, so Tan Thuan proposes to spend Dollars 55m on building a 17km road to link the industrial estate to a main road; and it intends to build a new port on the Saigon river. There are compensations of course. In exchange for building the road, Tan Thuan is to receive 600ha of land along the route, which represents an opportunity for lucrative property development in a prime area not far from the city centre. But for the time being the project is like an obstacle course for investors. 'When we built our zone at Kaohsiung in Taiwan, it didn't have anything, it was only a sandy beach,' sighs Mr Chow. 'We didn't have any problems.'</p>

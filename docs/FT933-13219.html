			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Carmakers diverge in post-bourse German trade INTERNATIONAL interest in German shares, once again, provided too much action for the official Frankfurt session to accomodate, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT managed to bridge a whole weekend as strength in last Friday's post-bourse, where the DAX index closed at 1,829.43, was translated into a rise of 22.83 to 1,836.29 in yesterday's official session. Turnover rose from DM7.7bn to DM9.4bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that the rally was broadening its base again. Foreign buyers, including Britons, re-entered the German market after some consolidation last week and DB Research, with buy recommendations for six companies, added its considerable weight to the serious analytical and strategic support which equities had already received. Inter-alia, the DB six included Daimler, Siemens, BASF and Viag. These four, accounting for a lot of the weight in the DAX, rose by DM15.50 to DM693, DM8.50 to DM656.50, DM8.90 to DM261.50 and DM8.50 to DM393.50 respectively, and Deutsche Bank itself gained DM10.50 to DM738.50. Stocks which did better than most included BMW, up DM18 to DM576, and climbing further to DM581.50 in the London post bourse. BMW, said Mr Frahm, is seen as a safer haven than Daimler - or Volkswagen, which fell DM2.70 to DM357.80, and then another DM6.30 to DM351.50 in the afternoon as the market awaited judgement in one of the legal actions following the movement of Mr Ignacio Lopex and staff from General Motors to VW. PARIS moved higher in thin volume, the CAC 40 index closing at 1,981.70, up 6.77 in turnover of just FFr1.8bn. Dealers accused Warburg of a possible downgrade in the case of BSN, down FFr15 to FFr852, but Bacot Allain, Warburg's Paris subsidiary, said that it still had BSN as a 'hold'. Gains on the day included Air Liquide, up FFr15 to FFr750 and seen as a beneficiary of Eruopean economic rercovery; and Vallourec, FFr12.70 to a new 1993 high of FFr198.90 after a FFr13.70 gain on Friday, which suggested position building to Paris professionals. AMSTERDAM continued its climb on demand for cyclical stocks, combined with options-led buying and carry-through short-covering after Friday's July index contract expiry. The CBS Tendency General index rose 1.4 to 119.4. Nedlloyd remained in demand on continuing speculation about the possibility of a merger, in spite of last week's denial that the group planned to link its container shipping arm with Sea Land, the US shipping group. The shares rose Fl 3.70 or 9.7 per cent to a 12 month high of Fl 41.80. Recently favoured cyclicals continued higher. Hoogovens rose 70 cents to Fl 41.80, Akzo Fl 3.80 to Fl 165.80 and Stork Fl 1.40 to Fl36.90. MILAN finished easier in volatile trading which left the Comit index 1.28 lower at 555.13. However, some stocks received a bost from improved liquidity, following their listing on the market's electronic trading system last Friday. Fiat, newly-listed on the electronic system, rose L141 or 2 per cent to L6,780 amid continuing talk of an asset sale or international accord. In a broadly firmer telecommunications sector, Sirti, another newcomer to the system, added L330 or 3.5 per cent to L9,580. Ferruzzi fell L29 or 7.7 per cent to L346 and Montedison was marked L47 or 7.3 per cent lower at L590. The shares came under renewed pressure amid concern that revelations by Mr Guiseppe Garafolo, a former executive, to magistrates investigating the country's political scandal, might imperil the rescue package being prepared by creditors. Olivetti moved L66 or 3.9 per cent ahead to L1,765, in heavy trade on hopes that the consortium which it heads will win franchises for Italy's second mobile telephone operator. ZURICH came under profit taking pressure which left the SMI index 14.4 lower at 2,396.4. Roche certificates shed SFr70 to SFr5,005, triggering concern that stop-loss selling might begin if the issue falls below SFr5,000. UBS bearers, one of the recent rally leaders, added SFr11 to SFr1,167 while CS Holdings shed SFr50 to SFr2,785. Analysts said that there was no change in fundamentals to explain a SFr18, or 2.2 per cent rise in Brown Boveri to SFr839. STOCKHOLM continued higher for the 10th consecutive session and the Affarsvarlden index added 4.1 to 1,152.1. However, Ericsson B shares, last week's star performer, went against the trend, easing SKr2 to SKr378. Shares in Frontline, the bulk shipping group, remained suspended at the close after the company had said that it planned to place shares at SKr21 each with a consortium of foreign institutions, raising a maximum of SKr420m. The shares were SKr2 higher at SKr29 in early trading. BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 fall 7.98 to 1,319.47 as the retailer, GIB, dropped by BFr38 to BFr1,274 in active volume of 83,600 shares. Dealers blamed profit-taking after last week's gains. VIENNA rose by 2.4 per cent, Austrian Airlines leading the market higher with a gain of Sch90, or 5.4 per cent to Sch1,750 as the ATX index briefly breached the 900 level before easing to close 20.78 higher at 898.77.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 19                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1234.12     1234.72     1234.64     1234.75 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1282.33     1282.45     1282.46     1283.57  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1234.59     1235.14     1235.42     1235.43 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1282.85     1283.36     1282.48     1283.54  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 16    Jul 15    Jul 14    Jul 13    Jul 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1234.37   1229.70   1237.14   1235.91   1232.90 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1281.68   1278.79   1283.38   1279.32   1274.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1235.60; 200 - 1284.37 Low/day: 100 - 1233.84  200 - 1280.60.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

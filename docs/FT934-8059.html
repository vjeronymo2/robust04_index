			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered Malaysian move Standard Chartered is to incorporate its Malaysian operation as required by law, but said it does not see the move as good for Malaysia or the bank. Malaysia is requiring all 16 foreign banks now operating as branches of their parent banks to locally incorporate their Malaysian business by the end of next September. The government said the move was to level the playing field between foreign and local banks in terms of access to funds.</p>

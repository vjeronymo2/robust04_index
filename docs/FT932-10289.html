			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Huge popularity seen for lottery THE NATIONAL Lottery planned for the UK could be played every week by most of the population with more people watching the live draw every Saturday night than watch Coronation Street. Such a significant impact for the lottery, to be launched next year in aid of ' good causes ', is predicted in an independent report on the national lottery published today. ) The report, by the GAH consultancy group, says that in many states and provinces of the US and Canada the lottery has become the largest contributor to government revenues. In some countries, such as Norway, the national lottery is the largest business. The success of lotteries has brought criticism in other countries, particularly the US, where jackpots have exceeded Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.90m). The licence to operate the national lottery in the UK 'represents a major business opportunity, not only for the successful bidders, but for suppliers and UK retailers who become lottery agents,' the report says. The UK national lottery could become the largest lottery in Europe, ahead of France and Spain, and could generate ticket sales of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 6bn. The report says: 'We believe Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.5bn is an achievable target.' Success will depend on the percentage of sales allocated to the licence holder for operating costs, the number of retail agents needed to achieve national coverage and the running of instant games as well as lotto. Retail outlets would be particularly important. The report says: 'It is difficult to see how the lottery will achieve its potential without the support of some of the major retailers such as J Sainsbury, Tesco, Asda, WH Smith, J Menzies, BP, Shell, Esso and Texaco among others.'

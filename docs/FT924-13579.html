			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Greenspan warns on severity of downturn THE US and Japan face an economic downturn of a kind unseen since 1945 which could prove more protracted than previous recessions this century, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, warned yesterday. Mr Greenspan, speaking to the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan, warned that if a recession was marked by a steep fall in asset prices, recovery would take longer and be more modest. There had not been a recession with this characteristic since the second world war. He cautioned his audience not to expect a surge in economic growth once an economy started to adjust to a sharp drop in real estate and asset prices. His remarks run sharply counter to the consensus among many Tokyo financiers and economists that the Japanese economy will recover from the middle of next year to grow at close to 3 per cent compared with about 1.5 per cent this year. Mr Greenspan said the US - and to some extent Japan - as well as Britain, Australia and the Scandinavian countries were confronting asset deflation which policymakers had little experience in predicting or correcting. He said old economic models that policymakers had used to guide their actions have been rendered less valuable by the unusual decline in asset values. 'A number of the old rules of thumb that policymakers used are inoperative,' he said. Asked whether the US was an 'economic basket case' because successive interest rate cuts had failed to revive the economy, he argued that the cuts had not been made to encourage growth but to ease the debt burden. 'Since 1989, the Fed has engaged in a series of interest rate reductions, the purpose was to facilitate the adjustment process . . . to stretch it out into a prolonged period of time so society does not become strained.' He added that the debt overhang was a limited problem, not a long-term structural problem. Mr Greenspan's visit comes as the Japanese economy is on the verge of a recession, with consumption stagnant after sustained falls in asset prices which have hit balance sheets. He stressed that there were significant differences between the US and Japan, such as the lower level of personal debt in Japan, which meant the process would take a different course in the two economies. He said it was too early to say whether Japanese banks struggling with a rising tide of non-performing loans would need an institution such as the publicly funded US Resolution Trust Corporation, which was set up to deal with the collapse of savings and loans small financial institutions. Mr Greenspan said that while it might be useful for aspects of the RTC to be studied, the model could not be easily transferable from the US to Japan. Lex, Page 20</p>

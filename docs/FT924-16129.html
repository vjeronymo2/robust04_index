			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Iliescu urges parties to bury the hatchet PRESIDENT Ion Iliescu warned yesterday that Romania faced an economic and social crisis. He called on the country's divided political parties to form a broad-based government of 'national reconciliation', write Virginia Marsh and Anthony Robinson. He said he was prepared to accept any coalition which found consensus within the new parliament following inconclusive results from Sunday's general election. 'This is a grave moment for the country and it is high time we went beyond political divisions and found a formula for mutual understanding,' said Mr Iliescu, who looks set for re-election in a presidential run-off on October 11. With 90 per cent of votes counted following Sunday's poll, the new parliament appears likely to balance almost equally parties favouring limited reform and a broad network headed by the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF), against proponents of faster market-oriented reforms. However, Mr Iliescu, DNSF presidential candidate, said any government would have to take into account the social costs of reform. Mr Mugur Isarescu, central bank governor and a key member of the present government, yesterday vowed to take administrative measures to clear an estimated Dollars 2.5bn in state enterprise arrears, even if it meant liquidating unprofitable companies and creating political difficulties. The US House of Representatives yesterday overwhelmingly rejected a bill, backed by the Bush administration, to restore Romania's most favoured nation trading status, writes George Graham.</p>

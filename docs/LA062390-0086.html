			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: SOME WRITERS JUST DON'T KNOW BEANS ABOUT GAME  </P> <P> Right up front, let's say something nice about Colombia. It has very  hard-working people. It makes very good coffee. And its soccer team, led by  Ready Freddy Rincon, looked absolutely super in tying West Germany, 1-1, thus  qualifying for the second round of the World Cup. Colombia, we salute you.  </P> <P> We mention this because we were reading that El Siglo, a Bogota newspaper, made  a point of pointing out that the world's press has been praising Colombia's  soccer performance and "for the first time it has forgotten to disparage our  country." Ow.  </P> <P> For the record, even as a United States journalist, I found myself very happy  for Colombia when Freddy's last-minute shot went between the German  goalkeeper's legs, touching off a celebration in northern South America that  still hasn't stopped. I even made an entry in my journal that day: "Good effort  by Colombians. Don't disparage their country."  </P> <P> Besides, after seeing the United States play soccer, I was too busy disparaging  my own.  </P> <P> Now, on to World Cup journal, Week 2.  </P> <P> Say, here's a guy some of you Americans might like. His name is Karl  Fliegenbauer, and he's a soccer-basher.  </P> <P> Fliegenbauer runs a pub in Passau, West Germany. No, the place is not called  Fliegenbauer's, although surely somebody somewhere ought to open a place called  Fliegenbauer's, or maybe McFliegenbauer's, or the International House of  Fliegenbauer's, or possibly even Thank God It's Fliegenbauer's.  </P> <P> Anyhow, my main man Karl has taken a firm stand. On the menu of his Bavarian  hofbrau, which is officially named the Weisses Kreuz, he has formally decreed  the place a "soccer-free zone," to serve solely the interests of people who  cannot stomach one more word about World Cup soccer.  </P> <P> Herr Fliegenbauer claims that any of his customers discovered discussing soccer  or even mentioning soccer will be flashed a red card, banishing them from his  establishment for the remainder of the tournament. Frankly, we suspect this was  Plan B for Karl, whose first choice probably was kicking customers soccer-style  on their bare legs with hard shoes.  </P> <P> On another tavern front, some guy in Nairobi wanted to watch the World Cup on  TV in his local corner bar. The owner told the guy he had to pay. The guy  refused. The owner told the guy he had to leave. The guy stabbed him with a  knife.  </P> <P> Well, looks like Fliegenbauer's won't be having a West Kenya branch.  </P> <P> Speaking of Africa, and we were, our old friends the Cameroon "Indomitable  Lions" stepped forward after two thrilling first-round victories and promptly  got kicked around by the winless, yet not necessarily domitable, Soviet Union,  4-0.  </P> <P> Some of us just happened to notice the interesting coincidence that the  Soviets, who just happened to need a four-goal victory to have any chance of  advancing into the second round, just happened to score four quick goals  against the Cameroonians, who just happened to have a Soviet for a head coach.  </P> <P> Nah. We prefer the version in Cameroon Tribune:  </P> <P> "The worthless victory of the USSR over the Lions" should not be taken  seriously, the Trib reported with total and understandable objectivity. The 4-0  defeat was nothing more than a "tactical" maneuver in order to fool the  second-round opponents.  </P> <P> Oh, and one more thing: Cameroon was forced to wear yellow shirts in the Soviet  game. It always plays better in green shirts, the paper reported.  </P> <P> Personally, I think this could be another ploy to fool the second-round  opponents. Cameroon should play its next game wearing white shirts with blue  trim, thereby fooling the opponents into thinking that they are actually  playing the United States.  </P> <P> Well, if Jim McMahon can fly in an acupuncturist at the last minute to help him  win Super Bowl XX, I suppose it's OK for Bryan Robson to fly in his faith  healer.  </P> <P> B. Robby is captain of the team from England. He has a heel injury that is  killing him, which is worrying both Bryan and his coach, Bobby Robson, who is  not related to Bryan and is not to be confused with anybody anywhere named  Robby Bobson.  </P> <P> To heal Bryan's heel, they sent for Olga Stringfellow.  </P> <P> Stringfellow has treated several English players, and the coach is willing to  put her faith to the test. "We are not regarding this as a last resort," Bobby  Robson maintained, but should Olga not work out, we expect the next call to be  to an American TV evangelist, followed by a voodoo priest from Haiti.  </P> <P> Rome has lifted its ban on beer and wine sales on match days, because of the  intervention of an official from FIFA, soccer's governing body.  </P> <P> The guy's heart is in the right place, as is his name:  </P> <P> Joseph Blatter.  </P> <P> Speaking of drinking, and we were, whoa, has this World Cup ever been a  sobering experience for Ivica Osim!  </P> <P> Osim, the coach of Yugoslavia, awoke one morning to find himself portrayed as  the tournament's most serious lush. A newspaper report out of Belgrade, picked  up by the Italian press, charged Osim with having consumed "11 bottles of  whiskey in one night."  </P> <P> After Yugoslavia qualified for the second round, Osim walked into a news  conference, said, "Now even in Italy they are writing I am a big drunk," then  walked out.  </P> <P> Oh, and those 11 bottles of whiskey? As best we can figure, they were spotted  near Osim's hotel door the next morning.  </P> <P> The coach said they were from another guest's wedding party.  </P> <P> By the way, another big story out of Belgrade the other day was headlined:  "Hooligans Like the Italian Prisons."  </P> <P> According to the newspaper, Politika, British soccer fans, arrested for acts of  violence and general hooliganism, were saying that "Italian prisons are like  hotels -- you can eat, drink, watch the matches on TV and have fun."  </P> <P> Funny, I heard Italian prisoners only got served garlic bread and water.  </P></p>

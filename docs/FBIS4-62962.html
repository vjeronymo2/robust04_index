			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed concern over  reports about the arrest by Uzbek police of activists of the  Uzbek Popular Movement Birlik who were to attend an  international human rights conference in Alma-Ata [Almaty]. It  was organized by the Russian-American Human Rights Bureau. This  was stated at a briefing in Moscow on Tuesday by official  representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin.    He noted the fact that one of the detained Uzbek activists  was arrested on Kazakh territory. At the same time in Tashkent  Uzbek interior bodies arrested one of the leaders of the human  rights society and the chairman of the Association of Free Women  also invited to the conference.    "There is an impression that measures were taken to prevent  Uzbek human rights activists from attending the conference.  Russia proceeds from the fact that activities of human rights  organizations are a necessary condition for the functioning of  any democratic society. Russia will strictly adhere to this  principle in relations with all states, including the CIS,"  Karasin said. In his opinion, if information about the arrest  of the human rights activists is true, it is necessary to  clarify to what extent actions of the Uzbek authorities comply  with the Charter and the Declaration on Human Rights of the CIS,  as well as corresponding documents of the UN and CSCE.</p>

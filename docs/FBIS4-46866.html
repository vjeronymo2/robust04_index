			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by NEZAVISIMOST editor in chief Volodymyr </F> Kuleba, under the "Political Diary" rubric: "Ukraine: `Khmer  Rouge' in Power"]    [Text] The election of the 50-year-old Oleksandr Moroz--the  Socialist Party leader and in the recent past the leader of the  Communist Party's odious Group of 239--as the new speaker  produced the effect of a cold shower not only on the majority of  analysts and journalists, but mainly on the so-called deputy  democrats who have been euphoric over the election results. The  left-wing majority, headed by communists, took 171 votes and  immediately made it known who is the master in the parliament.  Against this backdrop, the national-democrats' excuses--they  voted for Durdynets, they said--sound absurd and ludicrous.  Vasyl Vasilyovych spent his entire conscious life in the  Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] and the  party's elected bodies, rooting out the weed of Ukrainian  bourgeois nationalism. And now our "nationalists" have not found  anything better than to support their eternal opponent.    The special way the democratic beginnings have been taking  root in Ukraine is worthy of a separate research. Both tragic  and amusingly comic twists intertwined here. The day after  Oleksandr Moroz was elected, many papers published his carefully  retouched portrait the size of nearly a half of a newspaper  page, just like in the times of Shcherbitskyy and Brezhnev. But  what has actually happened? A speaker was elected in the  parliament--big deal; by the yardstick of a civilized democracy,  this is an ordinary procedure. Not quite, though. In Ukraine,  permeated to the bone by Bolshevik ideology, the post of the  Supreme Soviet chairman meant a lot--this man automatically  became entitled to all conceivable and inconceivable goodies,  became a member of the Politburo and the Supreme Soviet's  Presidium in Moscow. This is not just opening and closing  sessions, watching compliance with procedure, and giving the  floor. In the conditions of "wild" democracy, the speaker's job  may bring unlimited power, as the events of October 1993 in  Russia proved. Continuing the parallel with Russia, the election  of Oleksandr Moroz, coming in the footsteps of Ivan Rybkin's  election, shows, first, that the political pendulum has swung  sharply to the left, and second, the desire, to put it mildly,  of a certain part of the population to see the resurrection of  the "one and indivisible" Union.    Still, the role of O. Moroz, as well as that of the  communists' nominal leader, P. Symonenko, appears to be  transient. Having lit up brightly on the political horizon, they  will fade out just as quickly, move into the shadows, giving way  to either real directors of the spectacle being played out in  front of us (Georgiy Kryuchkov, Kostyantyn Prodan, and other  members of the "old guard"), or to other "proxies" like  themselves should the "masters" decide that their time has not  come yet. Oleksandr Moroz' tragedy also is in that, having come  to the post of the speaker with the help of communist forces, he  has now become their hostage and has lost political  independence. There is no such thing as a free lunch. This  elementary truth came to mind when Oleksandr Moroz attempted to  propose Oleksandr Tkachenko--a veteran protege of the old  Communist Party nomenklatura--as his first deputy. If before  this episode the national-democrats, skillfully separated by  experienced party apparatchiks into factions where they could  slug it out, still had some illusions regarding their own  influence on the situation, now they finally understood that for  the umpteenth time they had been fooled. It became clear that  the communists, for whom selection and placement of cadres had  always been the "key point of the whole party work," will not  surrender without a battle a single commission, job, chair, or  an ounce of power. This manifested itself especially forcefully  on 24 May, when the communists, like primitive rhinos, once  again attempted to push through A. Tkachenko by "piggybacking"  him on Durdynets as a "package deal." That would be some  bouquet! Fortunately, the opposition has enough sense to block  the vote.    I dare to suggest that we are in for some impressive  about-faces on the political scene. We have not heard the last  word from Leonid Kravchuk, whose desire to declare Crimea a "hot  spot" is quite understandable--the issue of presidential  election would then be void naturally. One has to assume that  Leonid Makarovych will now swing perceptibly to the left, or  maybe even restore his membership in the Communist Party?  Actually--and I have already advanced this idea in the  past--perhaps he never left it, simply carrying out a special  assignment: to discredit the idea of democracy and democratic  freedoms in the eyes of the people? He did accomplish this  brilliantly, as the results of the recent parliamentary  elections attest. On the other hand, Leonid Makarovych's  situation today is not enviable. I had the opportunity to see  the list of the so-called "communist mutants" (traitors,  turncoats), in which his name was among the top few.  Eyewitnesses said that Leonid Makarovych got very upset: "Why  me?" It really must hurt when one is not liked by either side....    I see the following way out of the current situation as most  acceptable--to create a unified bloc of rightist forces, which  will include all deputies of democratic orientation, and go into  flat opposition, leaving it to the communists to form the  government. Since they do not have their own economic program,  in a year or two it will become clear that all they are capable  of doing is leading the country into a dead end (by the way, the  last three years it was also communist turncoats who were in  power). This road, albeit unpopular, seems the only acceptable  one. Nevertheless, I assume that the current democrats will not  have enough guts to take it. Some have already been bought--by  an apartment in the "king's preserve," a car, or an official  position; some will be bought, since there is plenty of bait,  just hurry and swallow the hook; some are afflicted by outsized  ambitions; and some are simply naive--but all of them are split  and scattered, so there will be no common strategy; nobody has  any intention to be subordinate to someone else, each has its  own scepter. On the other hand, the current communists--whom the  populace for some reason calls "Khmer Rouge"--unlike loose  democrats, distinguish themselves by a high degree of discipline  and organization. They will have no trouble strangling their  adversaries one by one in the pursuit of communist ideals. One  can almost taste this idyll--communists in power and Kravchuk as  president.    That Leonid Makarovych will be reelected as president if the  elections are moved to fall, I personally have no doubt. The new  communist-Kravchuk alliance promises that life in Ukraine will  not be boring.</p>

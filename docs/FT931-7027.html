			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Modest step for reformers: Political tensions will limit the scope of India's budget Demonstrators, armed police and the smell of tear gas were the talk of Delhi yesterday. Tomorrow it will be economics. The Indian government survived an important challenge by suppressing a planned mass rally by Hindu militants in the centre of the capital. Tomorrow it meets an equally significant test when Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, presents his annual budget and launches a new phase of India's wide-ranging reform programme. When he addresses parliament, Mr Singh must try to convince the nation and foreign countries that the passions raised by the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque last December have not deflected the government from the vital task of modernising the economy and opening it up to international trade and investment. He faces a daunting challenge, given the determination of the Bharatiya Janata party, the rightwing Hindu party whose supporters stormed the mosque, to prolong the atmosphere of political crisis. As Mr Kantikumar Poddar, the president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, says: 'This is a very important budget for the country because of the uncertainty which has been created about the future of economic reform.' Mr Singh does not have political support for the kind of radical measures which might turn the spotlight away from Ayodhya. Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, prefers to keep his head down, in the hope that the storm raised by the BJP will blow itself out. So instead the finance minister is likely to present a modest package - and hope it will be enough to keep India on the road to economic recovery. He will take credit for the measures he has carried out so far, including cuts in protectionist customs duties, easing restrictions on foreign investors, reductions in government subsidies, and the scrapping of much of the 'licence raj' - the system under which companies needed government permission to build or expand factories. Last summer's scandal in the Bombay securities market and the Ayodhya crisis limited the speed of reform in the second half of last year, but the government has sought to regain the initiative in the past month with a spate of announcements, including the partial liberalisation of state-controlled fuel prices. The finance minister will also point out the fruits of these changes: he has pulled India out of a balance-of-payments crisis, curbed government borrowing and cut inflation in half to about 7 per cent a year. With the help of a good monsoon, economic output is growing this year at a steady annual rate of 4 per cent, up from 1.2 per cent in the year to March 1992. Exports are increasing and foreign investors have pledged about USDollars 1.3bn in the past 18 months - more than in the previous decade. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund pronounce themselves satisfied with India's progress. As the government's annual economic survey said this week: 'The phase of crisis management is over.' The question is what comes next. The budget is almost certain to contain a reduction in import duties of perhaps 20 percentage points from a current maximum of 110 per cent. There could be tax changes to encourage private-sector investment and some extra incentives for exports. The finance minister may also signal further liberalisation of the foreign exchange rate, a move which would allow the rupee to devalue, so helping exporters. All these non-controversial measures will be welcomed by Indian and foreign businessmen alike - and can be done with little fear of opposition. The finance minister is likely to propose further cuts in government borrowing, which has already fallen from 8.4 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent. His preferred route will be to reduce subsidies for fuel and fertilisers, in order to pave the way for free pricing in these vital markets. But the scope for cuts is limited. Last year, farmers, the biggest beneficiaries of hand-outs, protested so strongly against reductions that they had to be paid compensation. This year, with the government weakened by the Ayodhya crisis, ministers will tread even more warily. Mr Singh is also expected to press ahead with financial market reform, which was delayed by last year's scandal in which Rs35bn (Pounds 814m) was diverted from banks into the stock market. A top priority for reformers is the restructuring of the state-owned banks on commercial lines. In particular they want changes in a rule which requires them to put 30 per cent of their deposits into low-yield government accounts - a drain of credit away from industry. However, Mr Singh is limited by the fact that these funds are a cheap source of finance for the government. So banking reform is dependent on reform of public spending - including cuts in support for state-owned industry and consumer subsidies. If reform of subsidies and of banking will be limited by political considerations, a third important area - redundancy laws - will probably be off the agenda. The government believes that, to help promote investment, it should relax restraints on employers' powers to dismiss workers. It has been told as much by businessmen, including the British delegation which last month visited India with Mr John Major, the prime minister. But ministers have been wary of advancing reform for fear of political opposition, particularly from the left. In the wake of the Ayodhya crisis, the ruling Congress (I) party needs support from leftwing parties and labour unions to help counter the rightwing BJP and its allies. So, Mr Singh is even less likely to be bold in this area than he was before. India, therefore, will not rush its reforms. With each passing month, Mr Rao's liberalisation programme looks less like a blitz and more like a drawn-out campaign. The democratic tradition, the decentralisation of power to the provincial states, and the ability of the bureaucrats to block changes that might threaten their power all serve to stifle change. Ayodhya is yet another excuse for going slow. As Mr Freddie Mehta, a senior director of the Tata group, India's largest industrial group, says: 'You can't go as fast as Margaret Thatcher in India.' The problem is that some challenges will become harder with the passage of time. The longer it takes for the government to cut wasteful public spending, for example, the longer it will be before funds are available to invest in education and infrastructure. Half of India's population is illiterate. A quarter of the electricity produced is wasted through inefficient transmission. The government hopes that the current reforms will lay the foundations for a substantial jump in the rate of economic growth, perhaps to 7 per cent a year. With such a leap, India will be able to generate funds to meet some of its chronic investment needs and attract foreign capital. But such a take-off is still some distance away, and Mr Singh's budget is likely to be but a modest step in the right direction.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       India: road to reform % change from previous year  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             87-88  88-89  89-90  90-91  91-92  92-93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP                     4.3   10.9    5.6    5.2    1.2    4.2 Agricultural output         -0.8   21.0    2.1    2.7   -2.8    5.0 Industrial output            7.3    8.7    8.6    8.3   -0.1    4.0 Consumer prices*            10.9    8.5    6.6   13.6   13.9    8.4 Exports (dollarsbn)         12.1   13.9   16.6   18.1   17.8   19.0 Foreign exchange reserves (dollarsbn)**       5.6    4.2    3.4    2.2    5.6    5.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All years March year end.

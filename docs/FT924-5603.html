			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / ERM turmoil hastens day of a two-speed Europe: Some European officials expect to see a fixed exchange rate D-Mark bloc THE recent turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism has hastened the advent of a two- or multi-speed Europe, according to monetary officials in several continental European countries. The officials, of the 'core' countries of the European Monetary System, are quietly optimistic that currencies grouped around the D-Mark will be able to form a bloc in which parities stay virtually unchanged once the turbulence on currency markets dies down. But despite last weekend's devaluations of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo, there is much less confidence that the Iberian currencies or the British pound and the Italian lira, which at present are floating outside the ERM, will be able to maintain stable relationships with the other EMS currencies. In a number of conversations since the weekend realignment, the officials, who declined to be identified, said that they did not believe that the recent upheavals in the ERM meant the end of the system. However, most accepted that the dislocation of the ERM in the successive waves of speculation since early September had made the achievement of economic and monetary union in line with the Maastricht Treaty less certain and at least subject to delay. But unlike London-based analysts who have forecast the collapse of the ERM, the continental monetary officials are looking ahead to a period in which economic fundamentals, such as inflation and trade performance and international competitiveness, will play a bigger part than in the past in determining currency relationships in Europe. As a result, Germany, France, the Benelux countries, and possibly Ireland and Denmark, will effectively be able to form a fixed exchange rate bloc. Austria, which links its currency to the D-Mark, would also be a member of this group. There are still battles to be won, notably convincing financial markets that the Danish krone and Irish punt are not candidates for devaluation. The scale of speculation in such small currencies can be spectacular. In three hours last Friday, for example, the Belgian National Bank had to buy Dollars 1bn worth of Irish punts. But trading in the Danish and Irish currencies, as well as the French franc, was calmer yesterday. This prompted hopes that the speculators may have been deterred by the resolute action taken in all three countries to raise interest rates since Monday. While officials generally expect the inner group of ERM countries to emerge as a recognisable and cohesive group of countries, there are differences about the implications of such a development for Emu. French monetary officials believe that the recent crisis in the ERM has underlined the need for monetary union among those countries with convergent economic conditions. 'There would have been no crisis between the French franc and the D-Mark if they were a single currency,' observed one official in Paris. 'So long as there is real convergence, it should be a case of the quicker the better in turning the EMS into a single currency system.' Germany, however, is far more cautious. Earlier this month, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice president, warned against too rapid a move to Emu. He told an audience in southern Germany that the premature creation of a single European currency and central bank could be threatened by tensions in pay developments and fiscal policy. Fears about sharply rising German wages have been expressed by Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the Belgian National Bank governor. In an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, he said he regretted that the Maastricht convergence criteria made no reference to income trends and advocated an incomes policy for Germany. Indeed, while monetary officials in the EMS core countries are looking to a future in which their currencies stay closely linked to the D-Mark, there is strong underlying concern about economic developments in Germany. High labour costs and relatively high inflation compared with countries such as France, Denmark and Ireland, have caused Germany to lose competitiveness. The cost of subsidising the new eastern Lander and Germany's continuing high budget deficits have caused some officials to wonder whether the German economy will be able to fulfil the Maastricht convergence criteria by the end of 1996, when the EC is due to assess whether a majority of its member states is willing and able to embark on Emu. The consensus among senior officials is that Germany will be able to overcome its difficulties. But one noted that the D-Mark really should devalue against the French franc and other ERM currencies because of Germany's declining competitiveness. Samuel Brittan, Page 21</p>

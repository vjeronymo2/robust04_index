			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: No call for rights One change in the UK equity market between this year and last is that while rumours of rights issues have continued at full flood, the supply of new paper has slowed to a trickle. The annual results season usually provides cover for companies to pass the hat round. Yet so far this year the only substantial issues have been from Burford to acquire some of Ladbroke's property, and GKN in its attempt to snare Westland. In part that, and some unexpectedly generous dividend increases, reflect the improved financial position of companies. From a record financial deficit of 4 per cent of GDP five years ago the corporate sector has now moved back to surplus. In 1993, more than Pounds 10bn was raised in rights money, repairing balance sheets and forming a base for recovery. That additional equity, retained earnings, and reductions in working capital are probably sufficient to fund most internal needs. There may be some smaller issues from the harder hit and struggling businesses which often bring up the rear of the reporting season. But even here many of those companies which have not already had one rights issue have had two. Large-scale equity may still be raised to fund acquisitions. Returns on capital have remained high through recession, and companies may view equity raised at current ratings as cheap, even given the recent softness in the market. Yet there is still great scepticism in boardrooms and institutions about the wisdom of bids. Whatever else may depress investors, rights issues are unlikely to slow equities down in 1994.</p>

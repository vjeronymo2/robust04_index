			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Management (Health Check): Waking up to the secret of sleep When you wake in the morning, you feel refreshed, bound out of bed ready for the new day, your energy unlimited. This is the way it is meant to be. Chances are, however, that if you have a stressful job your sleep will be troubled. After a long day at work, you return home, exhausted, have a ritual nightcap, slide between the sheets, puff up the pillows and go off to sleep. You wake suddenly, staring at the ceiling, aware of the light from the clock radio. You hesitate to check the time, but cannot resist: '2:30 AM'. Then a voice in your mind starts to review the day's events: business negotiations, a cryptic medical report, financial worries and domestic problems. To make matters worse, you start worrying that you are awake and begin to fret over whether you will able to cope the following day. This is the start of a vicious cycle of stressful days, followed by sleepless nights and more stressful days, leading at worst to a nervous breakdown. Where did you go wrong? The source of the problem may be the way you perceive sleep. Many executives view sleep as a pause on the road to success, necessary to cool over-heated engines, but sleep is much more than that. It is a creative period during which the mind deals with all the seeds you have digested during the day. For decades, sleep experts have been using clinical signs and electrical waves emitted from the brain to discover the secret of sleep. They have found that a night's sleep consists of a cycle repeated four or five times during an eight-hour period. The cycles are made up of stages of increasing depth, each ending with a period of Rapid Eye Movement sleep during which muscles twitch, temperature and blood pressure fluctuate and dreams of glory and disaster buffet you. In order to get your sleep cycle back on track there are some useful steps that can be taken. BEFORE GOING TO BED Do not eat heavily or consume alcohol within 90 minutes of retiring. Do not go through your bank statements. Do not watch violent films. Do not discuss finances with your spouse. Do not consume coffee after 3pm. Do not dwell on anything likely to make you angry or sad. All these give the body and mind too much to process while other matters should be tended to. The aim is to control events so that nothing worrying, alarming, or stimulating happens before you go to bed. Instead, you should: Reserve your bed for rest. Decide that you are going to sleep well. Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills - they cut out REM sleep. Tire your body with exercise. Soothe your mind with things that have nothing to do with work, such as chess or TV. Have a hot bath. Drink warm milk with honey. DURING THE NIGHT Do not become preoccupied with an occasional sleepless night, as these are perfectly normal. But to lose sleep over lost sleep is unnecessary. If sleeplessness persists, get out of bed, drink some warm milk, take a bath and read some Tolkien. Acknowledge the mental voice as it starts the litany of worries, but do not begin a conversation with it. WHEN YOU GET UP Do not assume that you are unrested as you have not had the minimum sleep you need. How much is enough? It varies widely, but in general enough to sustain a daily energy level, commensurate with the demands of work and play. If nothing else works, consider a change of pace, or of surroundings.

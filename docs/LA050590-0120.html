			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY CHARGES 2 MORE SOLDIERS WITH MURDER  </P> <P> The Army on Friday disclosed that it has lodged murder charges against two more  soldiers who were part of the American forces that invaded Panama on Dec. 20,  1989, in the military operation to topple dictator Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> The first case was brought last month against a Ft.  </P> <P> Bragg, N. C., sergeant, charged with killing an unidentified Panamanian man who  surrendered to U.S. troops after a grenade attack had been made on their  roadblock, officials said.  </P> <P> The second case, which Army officials did not disclose last month, although the  information could have been made public under military procedures, involves the  death of a 50-year-old Panamanian woman, shot in a brothel Jan. 25.  </P> <P> The soldiers implicated in the slaying are also accused of mishandling firearms  and disobeying orders not to have "sexual contact" with Panamanian women and  other orders forbidding the use of alcohol during their deployment.  </P> <P> The dead woman was identified as Leila Diaz de Panay, according to Maj. L. D.  Walker, an Army spokesman at Ft. Ord, Calif., where the soldiers were attached  to the 7th Light Infantry Division. Walker declined to provide any further  details on the circumstances surrounding her death.  </P> <P> Sgt. Paul Finsel Jr., 25, of Arkoma, Okla., and Pfc. Mark McMonagle, 20, of  Philadelphia, were charged with murder. Finsel also was charged with conspiracy  to obstruct justice, impeding the investigation into the charges, leaving his  company against orders and losing his 9-millimeter Army pistol.  </P> <P> A third soldier, Pfc. Marc M. Gussen, 19, of Teaneck, N. J., pleaded guilty to  firearms, alcohol and obstruction of justice charges at a hearing April 23 at  Ft. Ord. He was sentenced to two years in prison and was to be given a  dishonorable discharge.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 12 Apr -- The Federal Yugoslav Information  Ministry said in a statement this evening that accreditations  would be withdrawn from the French AFP news agency correspondent  and the correspondent of the American CNN TV network.    The statement reads:    ``Federal Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic has  decided to take legal measures against the correspondents who  have been waging a fierce media war against Yugoslavia, and this  on the territory of Yugoslavia. This practically means that  accreditations will be withdrawn from the AFP and CNN  correspondents and they will not be permitted to do any further  work from tomorrow, 13 April.    "Acreditations will also be withdrawn in the next few days  from other foreign media correspondents who have been demonizing  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serb people for  months, and some of them for years," the statement says.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW KILLING ADDED TO TASK FORCE INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Homicide Task Force has taken over the investigation of the  killing of a woman found in Scripps Ranch Wednesday because of the case's  similarity to more than 40 killings it is investigating, a spokeswoman for the  task force said.  </P> <P> In many of those cases, the bodies of nude, strangled women have been found in  remote parts of the county.  </P> <P> The identity of the woman found Wednesday in an isolated strip of Scripps Ranch  Boulevard is still not known, but she was strangled with a rope and was  believed to have been a prostitute, said task force spokeswoman Lt. Liz Foster.  </P> <P> "It was enough for the task force to take the case," Foster said.  </P> <P> The dead woman was found about 20 feet down an embankment in the 10300 block of  Scripps Ranch Boulevard about 7:30 Wednesday morning. Police said the woman,  who is possibly Latina or Asian, was in her 30s and was wearing a dark blouse,  bright green pants and white sandals.  </P> <P> The woman's body was found when a woman on her way to work saw a coil of yellow  nylon rope near the sidewalk and glanced over the embankment. The rope led down  to the body and was wrapped around the victim's neck, Foster said.  </P> <P> There is evidence that, sometime during the night, the woman's body was dragged  from a vehicle parked at the curb and then either thrown or taken down the  embankment, said San Diego Homicide Lt. Paul Ybarrondo. The San Diego police  were handling the case until it was turned over to the task force late Thursday  afternoon.  </P> <P> Foster, of the task force, said that the woman was also beaten with a blunt  object.  </P> <P> "We believe we found her within a 24-hour period of her death," Foster said.  "That will help in the identification because there is evidence that has yet to  be destroyed."  </P> <P> This is the first case added by the task force since last July, when a woman  was found dead in La Mesa, Foster said. In that case, the primary cause of  death is listed as an overdose but, for reasons she wouldn't discuss, Foster  said the task force is keeping the case.  </P> <P> The joint city-county task force was formed in September, 1988, to investigate  a growing list of victims that police thought might be related to the Green  River serial killings in the Seattle area. The series of slayings here began in  1985, shortly after the similar series of killings ended in the Seattle area.  </P> <P> This is the 16th strangulation case the task force has investigated, Foster  said.  </P> <P> Officials said they are hoping that three tattoos on the woman's body will make  identifying her easier. On her left shoulder and on her left thumb is the same  tattoo of a butterfly or small flower. On the woman's left thigh, the name  "Tommy" is written vertically, Ybarrondo said.  </P></p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: GKN It would be churlish to describe GKN's results as anything but good. Strong control of costs has helped the management overcome flat market conditions, and the profits increase exceeded most expectations. There are more good things in the pipeline. The full benefit of staff reductions will come through in the second half, helping earnings even without a pick-up in the world economy. Beyond that, the company has succeeded in getting its drivelines designated as components on some promising car models, notably the new Audi 80. So it should be able to increase its market share. With a proven ability to improve productivity, the company should also be able to cope with cut-throat pricing of components. The same cannot be said of others. But much of this has been reflected in the rise of the shares since the turn of the year. GKN's yield, relative to the market, stands near a 10-year low, presumably on expectations the company can avoid a dividend cut in the toughest of conditions. Yet given the low level of cover, and the poor economic outlook, it will be 1994-95 before there is any realistic prospect of a dividend increase. That limits prospects for the shares. If its good performance continues, the company may eventually deserve a lower yield premium to the market. But that time has not yet arrived.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Josias de Souza and Gilberto Dimenstein] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco is distressed by the lack of  results from the economic policies implemented by Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso [FHC]. He expressed certain  disappointment during private conversations, adding that he  expected more from the FHC plan.    FOLHA learned that Franco said he expected an immediate,  although gradual, reduction in the inflation rate, adding that  he was surprised by the temporary inflation increase. According  to Fipe (Economic Research Institute Foundation of the USP  [University of Sao Paulo]), the inflation rate could hit 40  percent this month.    Franco usually says that during the last year of his mandate  every day is as long as a week. He has begun to doubt his own  political strategy's chances for success because of the lack of  economic results. He thought he would be able to influence his  succession. He even played with the thought of a ticket with  Fernando Henrique Cardoso as presidential candidate and former  Minister Antonio Britto as his running mate.    Franco told his closest advisers that he fears the plan will  not yield the desired effects in April, when FHC would need to  leave the government to run for an elected office. The president  avoids opening fire against his minister. But some assistants  already have began criticizing FHC openly, inclusively during  cabinet meetings. The president does not oppose the criticism,  giving his assistants the impression that he agrees with some of  what is being said.    President Franco also complains about the lack of  "partnership" spirit in Congress. He thinks deputies and  senators are delaying the approval of the plan's main items.    So far Franco maintains the promise he made to FHC not to  comment on the economy. But his patience is reaching the limit.  He says he is particularly annoyed with price increases in the  pharmaceutical industry, which he finds excessive, and our high  interest rates.</p>

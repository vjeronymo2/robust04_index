BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ARIZONA COPPER WORKERS STRIKE  </P> <P> Asarco Inc.'s Ray unit was struck Sunday by unions representing about 700  copper workers.  </P> <P> It was the first copper strike in Arizona since the turbulent Phelps Dodge  strike seven years ago.  </P> <P> The old contract expired at midnight Saturday and contract talks broke off here  around 4 a.m. Sunday, union and company officials said.  </P> <P> The union coalition had rejected the company's final offer, which would have  provided an average $2.50-an-hour wage increase over three years.  </P> <P> Robert Guadiana, the United Steelworkers official who heads the talks for the  unions, said the 24-member union committee also had "significant concerns" over  Asarco proposals he said would damage pension, insurance and disability  benefits.  </P> <P> Guadiana also cited "forced overtime" rules as another problem.  </P></p>

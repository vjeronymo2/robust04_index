			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PEACE ACTIVISTS URGE BERMAN TO TAKE STAND;  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST: MARCHING OUTSIDE THE CONGRESSMAN'S VALLEY OFFICE, A COALITION OF  ANTI-WAR PROTESTERS CONDEMNS HIS SILENCE ON MILITARY INTERVENTION IN IRAQ.  </P> <P> About 50 anti-war protesters, many of them senior citizens, marched outside  Rep. Howard L. Berman's San Fernando Valley office for nearly two hours Friday  afternoon, calling for negotiations instead of war in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Although Berman (D-Panorama City) has consistently supported economic sanctions  against Iraq as the first line of defense, representatives of the protest group  said his failure to publicly condemn going to war against Iraq amounts to  condoning it.  </P> <P> "His failure to take a position really indicates a position," said Gary Lipton,  senior assemblyman with the California Senior Legislature. "The appalling  silence is unbelievable to me."  </P> <P> Berman -- who was en route to Washington, D.C., and unavailable for comment  Friday -- has said in the past that he would not rule out low-level military  intervention if sanctions did not work. During an interview in September, he  said he feared that, if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's offensive capability  were not throttled, the United States would face an increasingly fortified foe.  </P> <P> Lipton and others said they want Berman to support legislation proposed by Rep.  Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) that would give economic sanctions against Iraq at  least a year to work before more drastic action is taken.  </P> <P> The protesters identified themselves as the newly formed Peace Coalition, which  has drawn members from such groups as the Gray Panthers, Beyond War, the county  Democratic Party and the Unitarian-Universalist Church.  </P> <P> They said they would continue their protests with visits to other San Fernando  Valley representatives in the coming weeks.  </P> <P> During a meeting with some of the group's representatives, Berman's chief  district aide -- Fausto Capobianco -- said he would see that Berman received  the group's message as soon as he landed in Washington.  </P> <P> "I know Howard has an ongoing concern in this area," Capobianco said. "But not  only did we not discuss it when he was here, I don't know what he is thinking  on the situation at all."  </P> <P> Coalition leader Jo Seidita, prefacing her remarks by saying she didn't "want  to sound rude or pushy," told Capobianco that she was disturbed by his response  and that of spokesmen for other Valley congressmen.  </P> <P> "I'm somewhat overwhelmed to hear chief aides don't know where their  congressmen stand on this," she said. "It's astonishing."  </P> <P> Many of the protesters were veteran peace marchers, having participated in  anti-war efforts during the Vietnam War. But they said anti-war sentiment is  far more widespread today than it was then.  </P> <P> "I was considered almost an enemy of the Democratic Party then," Seidita said.  "Now people are much more alert, much more aware, much more concerned."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bahattin Gunel, acting chairman of the </F> pro-Kurdish Democratic Party of Turkey, by Maggie Maxton; place  and date not given: "Our Candidates Are Threatened With Murder  and Kidnapping"]    [Text] [Maxton] Mr. Gunel, what made you, a Turk, want to  get involved in the Democracy Party [DEP]?    [Gunel] As a socialist, I am sure the right thing to do is  to solve our country's problems on a legal democratic level  within the framework of a party like ours. The DEP was founded  on 7 May 1993. Since that day it has been attempting to pursue  a policy based on the following principles:    1. The party recognizes that the Kurdish people have been  defamed, persecuted, and exploited as part of official ideology  for 70 years, and that the Kurdish problem must be solved in a  democratic, peaceful, and legal manner. I do not think there  can be any democracy and human rights without a solution to the  Kurdish problem in this country.    2. Ever since the Ottoman Empire, democracy has never been  practiced as a way of life in Turkey. But we want to practice  it.    3. The party is aimed at putting an end to the increasing  exploitation of the working class and working people. Just as  with the HEP [People's Labor Party], the DEP also sees a link  between the national democratic struggle of the Kurdish people  and the economic and political struggle of the working class.  Therefore the DEP is in favor of the unity of all democratic  forces, and is of the opinion that the various problems can only  be solved when taken together. Even so, we are often presented  as a single party that acts exclusively for the sake of the  Kurdish question.    Since the formation of the HEP, the Turkish state at last  has  a party that opposes official ideology without hesitation. The  parties that consider themselves leftist have never consistently  opposed the repressive policy that intimidates the Kurds. The  state realized that the HEP would mark the beginning of a new  era, and it attempted to strangle the new movement. One method  of doing so was to confront us in the media with the "specter"  of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and isolate us from the  remaining circles, from the progressive left, democratic forces,  and working class.    The local government elections of 27 March at last gave our  party the opportunity to present our policy directly to the  people. But the state had already prepared its own strategy.  First, the chief of the General Staff informed the political  leadership that the preconditions for holding the elections were  missing in the east and southeast of the country, and that,  therefore, the elections should be abandoned in those areas.  But they failed to convince the politicians, because the  discontinuation of the elections in the provinces would have  constituted a state weakness, showing that the state no longer  had any control over a certain part of the country. Therefore  the politicians refused.    [Maxton] It would also have shown once again that this part  of the country is virtually divided.    [Gunel] Yes. The second method against us was our exclusion  from the elections. We had started a peace campaign. Because  of a declaration that our Central Executive Council had adopted  during the election campaign, court action to ban our party was  commenced, with this action having no basis in existing  legislation. The purpose of this was to disband the party and  found a new one. At the same time, our supporters were supposed  to think that we would not be able to take part in the elections  because of our termination and turn to other parties.    But because even this was not enough and the DEP announced  that it would take part in the elections in spite of everything,  a third method was utilized. Mainly in the east and southeast,  the chairmen and members of all our regional subcommittees were  pressured to resign. We have documents and letters from the  chief of staff to party members, chairmen, and ordinary members  containing threats of murder and kidnapping. When election  candidates stepped forward despite these threats, goverment  people went to each village in which we could expect to gain  votes and threatened to burn down the entire village if we won  the elections, or to kill one man for each vote cast in our  favor.    Despite everything, we said that we would take part in the  elections, even if it meant winning few votes. But on the night  after we had presented our candidate to the public, on 13  February, 320 of our candidates, including the candidate for the  mayorship of Diyarbakir, were arrested. They were not only  tortured, but also threatened with death if they maintained  their candidacies.    Finally, highly explosive charges were laid at our district  offices in Mamak and Yenimahalle, the provincial office, and our  party headquarters. The explosion attempt occurred at a time  when two parliamentary deputies, two acting chairmen, and two  acting general secretaries were present. This was a deliberate  attempt to kill them. Apart from that, an attempt was made on  the life of our general secretary at 01:30 in the morning. He  was lucky to have survived.    [Maxton] The DEP had trouble finding candidates. Does that  apply to all provinces in varying degrees? How many candidates  did you want to have, and how many did you find?    [Gunel] We had problems almost everywhere. I think the DEP  could have found at least 15 to 20 candidates everywhere. Even  the state and Turkish public opinion know that no party would be  successful in the provinces apart from the DEP.    [Maxton] How many candidates did you manage to find under  the conditions in force?    [Gunel] We had 70 mayor candidates for the large urban  centers. Together with the smaller districts, we had a total of  390 candidates. Under normal conditions we would have had 380  candidates for the large centers and 1,800 candidates for city  councillors instead of the normal 800. The candidates who were  too scared to campaign thought not only of their own lives, but  also of the lives of their children and relatives, and of the  danger that their villages might have been burned.    [Maxton] How many candidates do not actually belong to the  DEP? For instance, the candidate for mayor of Diyarbakir is not  a DEP member.    [Gunel] About half the candidates do not belong to the  party. Our method of selecting candidates differs from that of  other parties. Our candidates were selected by the party  headquarters, but on the recommendations of local party  organizations, even taking the will of the local populace into  consideration. We found seven candidates for the post of mayor  of Diyarbakir, including the chairman of the Medical Council and  a member of the Chamber of Genetic Engineers. Diyarbakir has a  Democratic Platform consisting of 42 groups and societies who  pursue politics at a distance from the parties. The Democratic  Platform, in collusion with the local population, suggested the  director of the Emlak Bank as a candidate, and we accepted him.    [Maxton] On 16 or 17 September some mayors went over to  the DEP, so the DEP had mayors for the first time. Were they  able to bring about an understanding of communal politics, or  were they not even given the chance to do so?    [Gunel] Our friends had no chance whatsoever of presenting  our communal policy. From the day they transferred to the DEP,  their private houses and village halls were fired upon, and they  themselves were arrested or interrogated. Not a single one of  our mayors was able to sit in his office for as much as one day.  One of them was the mayor of Lice, whose office was destroyed.  The mayors of Silvan and Kozluk were immediately taken into  police custody.    Apart from that, since transferring to the DEP, our mayors  have not received a single penny in financial support from the  state. The mayor of Kozluk said recently that whereas the other  mayors had already received their payments for 1995, he had not  even received some of the money he was owed in 1992. Therefore  we have no chance of offering financial support. In any case,  the population of this region is no longer so concerned about  support, they are more concerned about staying alive without  being murdered, tortured, or expelled. So we do have a communal  political program for the region, but we have not been able to  implement it yet.    [Maxton] The SHP [Democratic Populist Party], which differs  from your party on several points, is pursuing a similar policy  of decentralization and democratization. Are you holding talks  on this subject?    [Gunel] As far as declarations are concerned, even the ANAP  [Motherland Party] is proceeding the same way we are. One can  even say that ANAP is further ahead in this respect. But I very  much doubt if these parties have much respect for the protection  of human rights. When someone deprives someone else of his  natural right, the right to life, how can he then say "man's  water should be pure and his streets clean?" The protection of  life comes first. Only then can one do something about living  standards.    [Maxton] Were there negative reactions to the DEP's decision  to withdraw for the elections? Originally there was merely talk  of withdrawing from the elections in Kurdistan.    [Gunel] On the contrary, the general impression is that the  reactions were positive. Even those who at first wanted to vote  SHP are now saying that they woid vote for us as a protest  against the arrests. I think we are capable of influencing 60  percent of our electorate. The remaining 40 percent will vote  differently through fear of punishment. Even in this phase we  will have little chance of publicity. But when we do reach our  voters, I think they will all either boycott the election or  deliberately cast invalid votes. On 9 March, our party congress  will decide what to do next, and the party organizations will  comply with what has been decided.    I think this protest will be effective, and that we will  succeed in convincing Turkish and international public opinion  that these elections are illegitimate. The illegitimacy of the  elections will be a subject of discussion from the very first  month onward, and Turkish public opinion will become  increasingly convinced that they are not legitimate, not only  because of the persecution, but also because the DEP is the only  party that can legitimately lend political expression to the  situation of the Kurdish people. If the DEP cannot take part in  the elections, then they cannot be legitimate elections.    [Maxton] A debate has been going on inside the DEP for a  long time now on whether or not the party should take part in  the elections on account of the persecution. For a long time,  the majority believed the DEP should take part. What national  or international organizations have you requested support from  in holding free elections? What assistance has been offered you?    [Gunel] When the General Staff issued the first statements  that the preconditions for holding the elections were missing,  and later when the DEP was barred from the elections, and later  still when all the other parties united against the DEP, we  realized that we were facing very undemocratic measures against  us. But we still hoped for a change during the election period.  In addition to issuing a resolution to take part in the  elections, our party congress called upon both sides to  introduce a cease-fire at least during the elections.    [Maxton] But as far as I know, this appeal for a cease-fire  hardly appeared in the press, except in the pro-Kurdish paper  GUNDEM.    [Gunel] It received a brief mention in CUMHURIYET and  AYDINLIK. Although we are acquainted with the right-oriented  structures of the state, we still believed that a cease-fire  would occur. However we decided that we would pull out of the  elections on 26 March if the state continued with its  persecution, murders, and threats. All the same, we have made  all the preparations to take part in the elections, providing  everything -- flags, loudspeakers, and handouts, even buses.    [Maxton] The DEP Deputy Sirri Sakik is supposed to have  said on 3 March: "We have withdrawn from the elections in order  to protect our people." Following the DEP decision to withdraw  form the elections, the PKK announced that it agreed with the  DEP decision and called for an election boycott. Now, election  boycotts are illegal in Turkey. Will there not be harsh  measures against those who do not turn out to vote, especially  in the Kurdish areas? How will your people be protected then?    [Gunel] Further developments are yet to be discussed. But I  can already say that we do not consider it expedient to take  part in illegitimate elections. But in any case we will seek  paths of action that are not harmful, and we will put pressure  on people not to vote if such pressure might be harmful to them.  The PKK is a different party with different methods and reaches  its decisions according to its own political perception.    [Maxton] You will probably find it very difficult to  influence the state, but you might be able to make an appeal to  the PKK through the media or some other channel.    [Gunel] No, in fact it is very difficult for us to make  contact with the PKK. But in the cities we are organized as a  legal party within the framework of the law in force, and  theoretically we should have access to the state. In any case  that is our duty, and we are doing our best to make the state  see our way of thinking. On the other hand, the PKK, with its  methods of action, has completely outlawed itself from the  system, and makes its own decisions internally, quite  independently of the state or other institutions. As part of our  peace campaign and in connection with the elections, we have  called on both sides to cease fire, telling them that the  bloodshed must stop and a peaceful solution must be found. We  actually approached both sides with our message, and for this  very reason a court action has been undertaken against us, on  the grounds that we are equating the state with the PKK. Had we  known what would happen, we would have addressed the appeal only  to the state!    [Maxton] Soon after the DEP began to explain to the public  why it felt obliged to withdraw from the elections because of  the persecution, the PKK renewed its threats against Turkish  parties. Does that have a negative effect on the DEP's attitude?    [Gunel] The PKK has its criteria for judging what is to the  advantage of the Kurds and what is to their disadvantage, and is  of the opinion that the struggle is to their advantage. I am  not saying whether or not that is correct, but whenever you have  asked us, as DEP members, about the kidnapping of journalists  and the PKK resolution about the banning of parties, we have  always said that existing problems cannot be resolved by the use  of force, but only by political means.    [Maxton] But that segment of public opinion that sympathizes  with the Kurds has not received any positive influence.    [Gunel] The segments of Turkish and international society  that sympathize with us have never really tried to understand  us. The state and our own problems and deficiencies have  prevented us from expressing ourselves properly. But society has  also failed to inquire whether we are really the way the state  makes us out to be. We have always been viewed in a biased  manner either as a Kurdish party or as a legal branch of the  PKK. If society considers our declarations correct, it should  cease making its solidarity with us dependent on the PKK's  conduct. It should criticize the PKK directly, not us.    [Maxton] The state's intimidation of the DEP is well-known  and documented. On the one hand, the state is calling upon the  Kurds to defend their rights not with force, but through  democratic methods; on the other hand, almost every single  Kurdish organization and institution has been closed. In the  end, on 2 March even the parliamentary immunity of the seven  Kurdish deputies was abolished. That shows that the state does  not give the Kurds much of an opportunity for political  expression.    [Gunel] We in the DEP have always believed that despite all  intimidation, problems must be resolved by political means and  legally. But how much longer will this be possible if sooner or  later all the people who share this principle are wiped out or  pressured into thinking differently? There will be a demand to  lift the parliamentary immunity of remaining deputies. So far,  75 of our party colleagues have been murdered, but we have not  given up. Even if all our deputies or we ourselves are in  prison, it is still expedient to continue at this level. But  that only applies as long as we are not used as a label like  Kurdish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and as long as we are  able to propose our own solutions. As long as these  possibilities of action have not been taken away from us, we  will continue on our course.    [Maxton] Several new voices have recently made themselves  heard inside the SHP, which until recently was not very  positively rated as a part of the government. SHP chairman  Karayalcin discovered, somewhat late, the existence of  depopulated villages and mentioned the danger of a "putsch by  civilian forces." Apart from that, almost every single SHP  deputy voted against lifting the parliamentary immunity of the  Kurdish deputies. Do you think this signifies a certain  breakthrough?    [Gunel] Right now Turkey is experiencing the greatest  economic and political crisis in its history. If a coalition of  parties that represent apparently opposite political streams,  Left and Right, is built, the resultant force can then be teamed  up with the government in order to contain the Kurdish problem  and the problems of democracy at least for a while. In view of  the urgency of the problems, it has not been possible to prevent  daily demands from receiving loud publicity. The daily costs of  the war cannot be borne by the budget. They worsen the economic  crisis and cause a deterioration in the economic situation of  poor people. Apart from that, the war is limiting the effect of  democracy.    In view of all this, lifting parliamentary immunity can be  viewed as no more than the drop that has caused the barrel to  overflow. We are mainly concerned with the economic costs of a  dirty war that is being waged allegedly "in defense of the  state, democracy, and the people."    [Maxton] What information do you have about the current  situation of the arrested deputies?    [Gunel] As far as we know, they have not been subjected to  physical torture yet. But they are surely under psychological  torture, and we also consider ourselves to be under such  torture. The very arrest of these deputies and the fact that  they have been deprived of their belts, shoelaces, and ties, as  though they would commit suicide, plus the allegations (since  denied by diplomatic sources) that some of them applied for  political asylum abroad -- all this is a deliberate insult that  we view as a form of psychological torture upon us. Other  things might also be happening, suggested by the fact that our  deputies have not been allowed to issue statements to the police.    If Tansu Ciller weeps before the eyes of the entire  population, it shows how much pressure is being brought to bear  against her. We have no way of knowing how this pressure is  applied, and by whom. Perhaps Tansu Ciller thinks that she  behaved incorrectly under this pressure, and that she might be  subjected to more of it.    We must observe coming developments. World public opinion,  which until now has judged events in Turkey in a biased manner,  through the eyes of the Turkish authorities, seems to be  reconsidering its attitude and is trying to make a contribution  to democracy in Turkey. We are doing our best to remain calm  despite all the intimidation, and will never resort to violent  methods of solving problems. But if the state's pressure  increases, we cannot assume any responsibility for future  developments.    [Maxton] What exactly do you expect from the Turkish parties  on the one hand, and European governments, parties, and  organizations on the other hand?    [Gunel] Because we were already aware of these dangers, we  have been telling Turkish human rights associations, trade  unions, and democratic organizations, as well as European  governments and human rights organizations, to send observers to  monitor elections in Turkey. We know that delegations of  observers are already being formed in Europe. But parliamentary  speaker Cindoruk, who normally appears as a democrat, considered  the sending of observers as an insult to "democratically  governed" Turkey. Even in Turkey delegations of observers have  been formed.    Now that we, the DEP, cannot take part in the elections,  they  have lost their legitimacy. With this opinion we wish to make a  contribution to democratization, and we hope that European  governments and organizations will also call for a cease-fire,  an end to the bloodbath, and a peaceful democratic solution.    We do not want individuals to receive protection. We have  begun to act at a legal political level, even though we know the  risks involved. Even today we do not fear trials, arrests, and  executions. Instead, we shall continue our democratic struggle.  We do not intend to flee, but we expect the Europeans to  realize that violations of human rights in Turkey have reached  such proportions that there is no more democracy in this  country, the elections are illegitimate, and the DEP is waging a  just struggle. We do not want any asylum or personal protection.    [Maxton] That means you want support so that you can  continue to be politically active on a legal level in this  country.    [Gunel] That is right. We do not know what may develop.  Some 50-60 people are dying in this country every day. This  massacre of Turks and Kurds, soldiers, guerillas, and villagers  must be stopped. We are prepared to pay a high price for this,  if necessary. The arrest of our parliamentary deputies is also  a price we have paid. But the killing must stop.</p>

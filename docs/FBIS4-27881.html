			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Choe Kyu-sik on ROK President Kim </F> Yong-sam's news briefing for ROK journalists aboard the plane en  route to Tashkent on 4 June]    [Text] [question] Are there any behind-the-scenes stories  of the summit at the dacha?    [Kim Yong-sam] Russian Foreign Ministry officials had asked  me many times not to raise serious issues since the dacha  meeting was especially arranged for friendship. I said that  anything could be discussed in a summit and asked them to leave  it up to me. President Yeltsin seemed to have expected trivial  subjects such as family or hobbies. He seemed to be surprised  when I raised the pending issues right after the small talk.  However, the atmosphere was very light.    [Question] What was the background of the decision to  suspend  the supply and sales of Russian weapons and parts to North Korea?    [Kim] President Yeltsin had been holding on to his difficult  position. He said that at least the supply of parts for North  Korea's defensive weapons should continue. I asked how could  offensive and defensive weapons be differentiated and insisted  that the supply should not continue, not even for the sake of  money. I persuaded him not to provide parts or technology  saying that even if North Korea possessed 100 weapons, those  would be useless if Russia did not provide advanced military  technology and arms. The same went with nuclear weapons. I  insisted that no concessions could be made and we could not come  to a conclusion that night. During the next day's tete-a-tete  talks, we could not reach an agreement either until the last  moment when President Yeltsin hit the table with both hands and  abruptly stood up saying: "I will make the concession to  President Kim" and concluded the talks.    [Question] What did you talk about with U.S. President  Clinton over the telephone on 3 June?    [Kim] We talked about everything we wanted for 35 minutes.  Although only two points were allowed to be announced, I think  our people should not worry about anything. The United States  has completely finished armed preparations for any contingency.  An around-the-clock surveillance system on North Korean  movements is in operation. Of course, a war should be prevented  but our people may be relieved because all preparations have  been completed for any contingency. Commander Gary Luck of the  ROK-U.S. Combined Forces is a very deliberate man. He was in  the Gulf war and has an outstanding sense of modern warfare. It  is very significant to have someone like him in the ROK.  Everything is well prepared and arranged.    [Question] Is it certain that Russia will participate in the  UN Security Council's sanctions on North Korea?    [Kim] Of course. Did President Yeltsin not say clearly in  the  joint news conference that Russia will participate? China is  known to have great influence on North Korea but actually China  gives North Korea nothing more than petroleum. Russia is the  country that gives weapons to North Korea and its relations with  North Korea are not simple.    [Question] What will happen to the North Korean loggers  issue?    [Kim] The loggers are like people without a nation. They  have had their passports seized by North Korean security  officers. I told President Yeltsin that none of the loggers  would be able to come to the ROK Embassy holding a passport and  that Russia should check each of the loggers to see if they are  holding a passport at the time of their entry to Russia.  President Yeltsin firmly promised me that every logger should  have a passport with him when they come to Russia or that they  would not be allowed to enter the country.    [Question] What was the discussion on reinforcing economic  cooperation between the ROK and Russia?    [Kim] Among the many discussions, Russia said it was  confident that it could build gas pipelines through North Korea  to provide the huge volume of gas consumed by the ROK. We  agreed to equally share the feasibility study cost of $20  million. Russia has a plan to provide gas to the ROK on a  long-term basis.</p>

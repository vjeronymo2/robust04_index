			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Lincoln Benefit will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets of the Account to compensate Lincoln Benefit for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. Approximately .85% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .40% is attributable to expense risk. Applicants represent that the charge for mortality and expense risks will not increase. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risk, Lincoln Benefit will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be profit to Lincoln Benefit. If Lincoln Benefit realizes a gain from the charge for mortality and expense risks, the amount of such gain may be used in the discretion of Lincoln Benefit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Lincoln Benefit consists of: (a) Bearing the risk that the life expectancy of an annuitant will be greater than that assumed in the guaranteed annuity purchase rates; (b) waiving the Sales Charge upon the death of a Contract owner; and (c) providing a death benefit prior to the annuity date. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Lincoln Benefit is the risk that the costs of administering the Contracts and the Account will exceed amounts received by Lincoln Benefit through imposition of the Contract maintenance charge and the administrative expense charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, issue an amended order granting exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for the mortality and expense risk. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character normally performed by the bank itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Lincoln Benefit under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Lincoln Benefit is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon their analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practices, taking into consideration such factors as: Current charge levels; charge level guarantees; benefits provided; and guaranteed annuity rates. Applicants represent that Lincoln Benefit will maintain at its home office, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology used in determining that the level of risk charge is within the range of industry practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants represent that Lincoln Benefit has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Lincoln Benefit and will be made available to the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Lincoln Benefit also represents that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Muscat, April 19 (AFP) -- Delegates on Tuesday [19  April] hailed the latest round of Middle East water talks as the  most successful since the discussions were launched more than  two years ago.    The talks, part of the multilateral track of the peace  process, were winding up Tuesday after bringing together  representatives from 43 countries and organisations, including  Israel and Arab states.    "It is the most successful round of talks by the water  committee", an Arab delegate told AFP.    "Several useful studies were presented and the meeting  yielded the first fruit of the negotiations: a desalination  research centre in Oman".    Oman proposed setting up the centre at Sunday's opening  session following a five month study with the help of  international experts.    The centre would study ways of cutting the high cost of  desalination which is sapping the resources of water-starved  Gulf states.    Omani minister of state for foreign affairs, Yusuf  Bin-'Alawi  Bin-'Abdallah, said it would benefit Arabs, Israel and other  parties as some states outside the Gulf could opt for  desalination in future to face growing water consumption.    Other projects being discussed are a meteorological centre,  a  water data bank and a regional water authority proposed by the  United States and other Western countries.    Delegates said Japan and other industrial nations renewed  pledges to support such projects and provide expertise and  technical training.    The training would benefit Palestinians most as they are on  the verge of managing their own water resources but lack the  technology and experience, the delegates said.    "The United States, France, Japan, Germany and other  industrial countries have assured us they will extend assistance  in all fields pertaining to water", Palestinian chief delegate  Riyad al-Khudayri told AFP on Tuesday.    He said the talks were gaining momentum now that  Palestinians  were creating their own water authority in line with the  September 13 autonomy accord signed between Israel and the  Palestine Liberation Organisation.    Western delegates described the Muscat disccusions as more  constructive than previous meetings but admitted final agreement  on water sharing needed time.    "Water is a vital and complicated issue and it has to do  with  politics" one delegate said. "All parties involved agree on the  need for water cooperation but there are some differences on the  extent and shape of this cooperation".    Bin-'Alawi opened the talks, the water committee's first in  a  Gulf state, with a call for cooperation to prevent potential  conflict and bring regional states closer together.    Turkey, the only country in the region to enjoy a large  water  surplus, was actively involved in the Muscat discussions but it  did not push its five-year-old proposal to supply Gulf states  with sweet water through a multi-billion-dollar pipeline.    "We have made the proposal before and it is still in force  because it was found feasible" a Turkish delegate said. "It's up  to the Arabs now to decide if they want the project".    Gulf governments have turned down the offer on the grounds  it  is expensive and poses security risks. Conference sources said  the Omani desalination research project implied the region  wanted to remain dependent on the more secure desalination  facilities, which provide them with nearly 70 percent of their  sweet water needs.    Israeli deputy foreign minister Yosi Beilin is heading a  team  of nearly 20 officials and experts, the first time the Jewish  state has sent an official delegation to a Gulf Arab country.    Jordan is taking part in the talks as an observer after  boycotting negotiations in protest at naval interceptions off  its coast by Western forces enforcing a United Nations embargo  against neighboring Iraq.    Iran, another key regional country, stayed away because it  is  opposed to negotiations with Israel.    Syria and Lebanon are boycotting all multilateral talks.  Delegates said Lebanon could be a key player in water activity  in the region given its large but unexploited water resources.</p>

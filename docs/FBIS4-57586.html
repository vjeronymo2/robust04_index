			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of article published in 20 May issue of GRANMA </F> newspaper -- read by announcer]    [Text] The Jose Marti Electric Plant in Matanzas has  rejoined the National Electric System following a 88-day  maintenance and calibration program. The plant generator is  producing over 31 megawatts, near its top performance capacity.  Chief Engineer Fermin Infante stated the generator is still  undergoing tests without interrupting the electricity generation  which, as we know, is attained by burning Cuban oil.    To give an idea of the significance of using Cuban oil, all  that is needed is to mention that from 1986 to date, this  35-megawatt unit has used almost 500,000 tons of oil which  represents a saving of $22 million. The Jose Marti Plant will  deliver an average of 19,000 megawatts a month and soon will be  testing the Varamulsion mix, a higher quality fuel mixture  containing Cuban oil.</p>

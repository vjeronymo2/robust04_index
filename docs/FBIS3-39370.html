			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The French press recently published a  number of polls on the presidential and European Parliament  elections.    The 22 January Paris weekly LE POINT published the results  of an IPSOS/LE POINT poll conducted between 14 and 17 January  among a representative sample of 1,000 individuals. Respondents  were asked their presidential candidate preference in the first  round of voting. Several hypotheses were posed:    A race including Michel Rocard, leader of the Socialist  Party (PS), Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Rally for the  Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac. The winner was Edouard  Balladur with 38 percent of the vote, followed by Rocard with 18  percent and Chirac with 13 percent. Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of  the extreme right National Front (FN) received 11 percent, the  candidate of the ecologist movement with 11 percent, the  candidate of the Communist Party (PC) 7 percent, and the  candidate of the extreme left 2 percent. Some 23 percent did not  answer.    A race including Rocard, Union for French Democracy (UDF)  leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and Chirac would be won by  Chirac with 31 percent, followed by Rocard with 21 percent, and  Giscard d'Estaing with 15 percent. The candidate of the  ecologist movement received 14 percent, Le Pen 10 percent, the  candidate of the PC 7 percent, and the extreme left's candidate  2 percent. A total of 25 percent did not answer.    In a contest including Rocard, Balladur, and Giscard  d'Estaing the lead would go to Balladur with 42 percent,  followed by Rocard with 19 percent, the ecologists' candidate  with 13 percent, Le Pen with 10 percent, Giscard d'Estaing and  the candidate of the PC with 7 percent, and the candidate of the  extreme left with 2 percent. Some 21 percent did not answer.    In a race between Rocard, Balladur, Chirac, and Senate  President Rene Monory the winner again would be Balladur with 36  percent, followed by Rocard with 17 percent, Chirac with 13  percent, the ecologists' candidate with 12 percent, Le Pen with  9 percent, the PC's candidate with 7 percent, Rene Monory with 4  percent, and the extreme left's candidate with 2 percent. A  total of 21 percent did not answer.    The last hypothesis involved a race including Rocard,  Balladur, Chirac, and Giscard d'Estaing. Balladur would overtake  all his rivals with 34 percent, followed by Rocard with 19  percent, Chirac with 14 percent, the ecologists' candidate with  11 percent, Le Pen with 9 percent, the PC's candidate with 6  percent, Giscard d'Estaing with 5 percent, and the candidate of  the extreme left with 2 percent.    Commenting on the results, Denis Jeambar notes that "nothing  can resist Balladur and Chirac": Neither a Rocard "stuck"  between 17 and 21 percent, nor the right in which the UDF is  "afflicted with electoral dwarfism." Giscard d'Estaing, he adds,  risks the "terrible humiliation" of finding himself behind Le  Pen. Finally, the UDF's Rene Monory made a very poor showing.    Jeambar also comments that the rivalry between the poll's  two strongest candidates, Balladur and Chirac, will become  increasingly exacerbated. Chirac is preparing for the  presidential election with his characteristic energy and force;  while only the real risk of a defeat would prevent him from  running, this prospect is nonexistent for the moment because of  Rocard's low scores. Faced with Chirac's power, Balladur  possesses cunning, another major ingredient in politics, Jeambar  continues. The prime minister's ability ensures him an  "exceptional" presidential potential. The war between the two  men will be "total," Jeambar predicts. Victory will go to  whoever can supplement his own specific qualities: Were Chirac  to successfully add cunning to force, he would win, and if  Balladur can add force to cunning, he would remain  "irresistible," Jeambar concludes.    Philippe Reinhard comments on the results of a SOFRES poll  (no further information) in the 20 January Paris daily LE  QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, according to which Balladur would outscore  Chirac by 10 percentage points, and president of the EC  Commission Jacques Delors by 13 percentage points. Some 44  percent of the respondents would like Balladur to be a candidate  for president, compared with 23 percent who choose Chirac. Poll  results are making Chirac's entourage "nervous," as they  indicate that even RPR sympathizers prefer Balladur as a  candidate (63 percent) over Chirac (34 percent). However,  Reinhard points out that the Chirac aides' "exasperation"  propagates the idea that a Chirac/Balladur war has now replaced  the "eternal" Chirac-Giscard face-off. Tn addition, by  criticizing "more or less openly" the prime minister's course of  action and attempting to invoke a "contract" between Balladur  and Chirac, these same aides are harming their leader. In fact,  Reinhard contends, Chirac is certainly not eliminated from the  race, for as long as he seems practically sure of beating  Rocard, the candidate of the left, "his presidential chances  remain intact." Finally, Chirac's friends should not prevent him  from being viewed as a "credible unifying force" in case  persistent difficulties and insufficient results make a Balladur  candidacy improbable, Reinhard concludes.    Writing in the 24 January LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, Philippe  Reinhard comments on the results of an TFOP/LE QUOTIDIEN poll  conducted on 20-21 January among 955 individuals over 18.  Respondents were asked to express their preference on a possible  single list of rightist candidates for the European Parliament  elections. Like a number of recent polls, they confirmed that  the RPR and within it Edouard Balladur "dominate the political  game hands down." Balladur led as head of the list with 28  percent, followed by Chirac with 16 percent, Giscard d'Estaing  with 12 percent, and a number of other candidates, each with  less than 10 percent. According to Reinhard, poll results show  that the European issue is no longer a UDF "specialty." In  addition, the Balladur government's course of action has  "dedramatized" the European debate through the "pragmatic"  management of European issues and GATT, as well as the  strengthening effect the negotiations had on Community  solidarity. A second conclusion from the poll results is the  surprising fact that Balladur is chosen over other candidates in  spite of his clear indication that he would reject the  additional burden. This "Balladurian" performance only confirms  all other poll results favoring him as the presidential  candidate, Reinhard comments.</p>

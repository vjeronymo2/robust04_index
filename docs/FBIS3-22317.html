About 2,000 super tankers carry oil from overseas sources to  India with an average of 18 tankers entering and leaving the  country's ports daily.    Besides this, the entire oil cargo from Gulf to the Fareast,  Australia and Japan passes through India's Exclusive Economic  Zone (EEZ) as it lies astride one of the major oil tanker routes  of the world.    The responsibility of combating the potential threat of an  off-shore environment disaster lies with the Indian Coastal  Guards which patrol the country 7,000 km coastline in the  eastern and western seaboards.    The Coast Guard undertook five oil spill combat operations  during the past one year alone and one of its officers told that  visiting media persons that "the force has earned recently  acclaim for its successful operation in the Andaman sea by  tackling the fire and a 40,000 zone spill.    The Coast Guard officials claimed that they had also  contained the 6,000 tonne oil spill at Bombay high recently  which was caused by the burst of a pipeline.    Coast Guard Director General, Vice Admiral K.K. Kohli, said  that because of the successful anti-spill operations, the  Government had designated his force as the "central  co-ordinating authority" for combating the maritime spill around  the country.    The Coast Guard has destroyer skimmers and chemical  dispersants like Helo TC-3 to tackle oil slicks in the sea.    For containing oil spills, boats are lowered from off-shore  patrol vessels. These boats put up oil booms which are  inflatable tubes used in the containment of oil. The bombs also  limit the movement of the oil and facilitate recovery.    As the Coast Guard demonstrated the operation, destroyer  skimmers swung into action. This equipment is used to suck oil  from oil water interface. Thus the recovered oil is sent to the  refinery for re-processing.    In another operation, oil-absorbing plastic garline like  rope  is used top mop up the oil and recover it. When oil cannot be  recovered by this process, it can be chemically dispersed by  aerial spray by Helo TCS, fixed wing dornier aircraft and  surface ship, using spill spray.</p>

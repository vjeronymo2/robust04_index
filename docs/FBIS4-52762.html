			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The United States may  tolerate the early demise of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata if he  fails to come up with a reasonable plan for the promised full  tax reform, the advisory panel chief said Friday [13 May]. U.S.  President Bill Clinton "will think that Hata is hopeless," Kan  Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a scheduled news  conference after a panel meeting.    Regardless of the political situation, the advisory panel to  the prime minister will "definitely" issue its report in June  before the Naples summit of Group of Seven (G-7) major  industrial nations in July, Kato said, stressing that a detailed  tax reform plan has become an international commitment.    Japan vowed in its March market-opening package to make a  decision on tax reform, including permanent tax cuts, by July  and to turn it into law by the end of the year, in reaction to  U.S. criticism that 6 trillion yen in tax cuts limited to the  current fiscal year is insufficient to boost domestic demand and  thus help curb persistent trade surpluses.    Kato also said that if Hata wants a long-lasting rule, he  should present concrete plans for administrative reform to win  public support for the tax reform which is to include a heavier  burden on taxpayers through offsetting tax hikes.    "Even if a cabinet holds a minority of seats in the Diet, no  party will try to pull down a prime minister that has strong  public support," Kato said.    He noted that in its June report the panel intends to call  on  the government to pave the way for tax reform, particularly  citing spending cuts, deregulation to spur market activity, and  other administrative changes. "The government should stop just  saying that it will conduct administrative reform without  showing concrete plans," Kato said, noting that only one-third  or one-fourth of past initiatives have been implemented so far.    The panel wants to show the direction for cutting and hiking  taxes as well as to revamp the current consumption tax system  for a more efficient taxation, the chairman said. But he noted  he is still not sure whether concrete figures will be included.    Kato said earlier that the report will cover various options  for politicians to decide on later, and added at the Friday  press meeting that it will be an interim report, with a final  report to be issued at the end of the year for fiscal 1996 tax  revision.</p>

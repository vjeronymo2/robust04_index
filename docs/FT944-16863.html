			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Attention turns to the outlook for earnings Wall Street US stocks made progress for a second straight session yesterday morning, with investors shifting their attention from interest rates to corporate earnings, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.89 higher at 3,821.32, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.94 ahead at 459.04. The Nasdaq composite was 6.85 better at 756.81 and the American SE composite up 0.86 at 455.98. On the NYSE, advancing issues led declines by a two-to-one margin. Volume was light, with some investors observing the Columbus Day holiday. Only 231m shares were traded by the close. Concern over an imminent tightening of monetary policy had eased a little after Friday's employment data, which suggested that the economy was not growing as fast as had been feared by many analysts. Yesterday the market began to focus more intently on the third-quarter reporting season, which was about to get under way in earnest. Anticipation of strong results pushed many stocks higher, especially those on the cyclical side. General Motors led the motor vehicle group, climbing Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 . Chrysler gained Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 45 3/4 and Ford added Dollars 1 to Dollars 28 1/4. Computer-related issues were among the most active. Micron Technology jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 35 after Goldman Sachs put the stock on its 'buy' list. Compaq was up Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 , and Digital Equipment added Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 27 7/8. Apple was near the Nasdaq's most active list, climbing Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 in volume of 4.7m shares. The stock was helped by a report that the company was close to agreeing a common computer standard with IBM, up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 71 1/2. Paper stocks were also strong. Scott Paper was marked up Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/4 on its decision to sell its SD Warren business to an international investment group. Sprint, the long-distance telephone company, appreciated Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 after breaking off talks with two regional telecoms on merging their cellular businesses. On the Nasdaq, Tele-Communications was marked up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 22 3/4 , helped by comments by CRI Media Partners. ADRs in Grupo Televisa, a Mexican media group, plunged 13.2 per cent, or Dollars 7 1/4 , to Dollars 47 1/2 after Goldman Sachs lowered its earnings estimate.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) The identity and address of the person;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The name, quantity and volume of controlled substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed or transformed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer of the controlled substance to the person;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A certification of the previous use of the controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) For destruction credits, a certification that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance was destroyed and a certification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency of the destruction process; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) For transformation credits, an IRS certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feedstock use or transformation of the controlled substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator will issue the person destruction or transformation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits equivalent to the class I controlled substance (except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I, Group VI) produced for emissive uses that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator determines were destroyed or transformed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtracting the offset of 15 percent. For controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completely destroyed under this rule, the Agency will grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction credits equal to 100 percent of volume destroyed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minus the offset. For those controlled substances destroyed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than a 98 percent destruction efficiency, the Agency will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant destruction credits commensurate with that percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction efficiency that is actually achieved minus the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset. The grant of credits will be effective on the date that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator determines that the request for destruction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation credits does not satisfactorily substantiate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the person destroyed or transformed a class I controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance (except class I, Group VI) as claimed, or that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance was not previously used for an emissive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for additional destruction or transformation credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within ten working days after receipt of notification, the person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator. The Administrator may affirm the disallowance or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant an allowance, as she/he finds appropriate in light of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available evidence. If no appeal is taken by the tenth day after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification, the disallowance will be final on that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;82.10  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of consumption allowances in addition to baseline consumption allowances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001 for class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I, Group VI, any person may obtain, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of this subsection, consumption allowances equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the level of class I controlled substances (other than used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances or transhipments) that the person has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exported from the United States and its territories to a Party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (as listed in Appendix C to this subpart).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

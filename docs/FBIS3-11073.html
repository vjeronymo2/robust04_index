Two weeks before the elections of a new OAS  secretary general, no diplomat dares make public his forecast of  the election results. For the time being, the firm candidates  are Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus Quesada and  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. The only clear indication is  that the Colombian candidate has a heavyweight vote: that of the  United States.    Argentina had promised to support the Costa Rican foreign  minister. But two months ago President Carlos Menem informed  Gaviria over the phone that if he presented his candidacy he  could count on Argentine support. Following this change of  decision, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella had to make another  phone call to explain to his Costa Rican counterpart the reasons  for the change.    According to Argentine ambassador to the OAS, Hernan Patino  Mayer, Di Tella argued that the decision to support Gaviria's  candidacy changed the whole panorama and forced a  reconsideration of the former Argentine position. Argentina also  toyed with the possibility of presenting an Argentine candidate:  the former Radical Civic Union foreign minister, Dante Caputo.  But Caputo's candidacy was never made official because the  requisite was that he comply with his mission as UN and OAS  mediator in restoring democracy in Haiti before the elections  for secretary general.    The Colombian president, whose four-year mandate expires in  August, has the support of nearly all the Latin American  countries, except for Venezuela and Chile. He also has the  support of the United States, Mexico, and Canada.    Venezuela has not promised its vote to any of these two firm  candidates because it has not yet withdrawn the candidacy of its  own foreign minister, Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas, the one with  the least support so far. Most of the Central American and  Caribbean countries have promised their support to the Costa  Rican candidate.    Costa Rican diplomacy has established the current dispute  with the current Colombian president on the terms of a  confrontation between regions, that is, between small and large  countries. Costa Rica points out that since the OAS' foundation  there has never been a Central American or Caribbean secretary  general. The first OAS secretary general was Alberto Lleras  Camargo from Colombia. He was followed by Carlos Davila from  Chile, Jose Mora from Uruguay, Galo Plaza from Ecuador,  Alejandro Orfila from Argentina, and Joao Baena Soares from  Brazil, who has been secretary general since 1984.    According to Ambassador Patino Mayer, the Costa Rican  approach is incorrect because, he said, the secretary general is  elected based on his background and never on the country he  comes from. That is why, he added, Argentina favors President  Gaviria, because he is a politician who has been very successful  in the fight against drug trafficking with the arrest of Pablo  Escobar Gaviria, he made progress in the field of human rights,  and he is leaving the presidency following elections won by a  candidate from his own political party.    "We think we have enough votes to win the elections,"  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin Rubio said on 15 March.  This belief is shared by the Argentine Foreign Ministry.</p>

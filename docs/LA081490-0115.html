			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FARRELL AIDES SUE HIS FOES, CHARGING  SLANDER  </P> <P> Two of Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell's aides filed a $1-million  slander suit Monday against three of Farrell's political opponents who had  raised questions about the propriety of his hiring of the aides.  </P> <P> The Superior Court suit was filed by Marcela Howell, who managed Farrell's  unsuccessful Assembly race in June, and Anthony Thigpenn, who worked for the  campaign.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that Kerman Maddox, Otha Johnson and Gee Martin slandered and  libeled Howell and Thigpenn when they suggested that Farrell's hiring of the  two "represented a political payoff and a misuse of public funds," said  attorney Melanie Lomax, who represents Howell and Thigpenn.  </P> <P> The two were recently hired for a total of $25,000 to work in Farrell's office.  The councilman still owes them money for their campaign work. Maddox, who has  said he will challenge Farrell for his 8th District seat next year, made the  "patronage" allegation at a recent news conference. He was unavailable for  comment.  </P></p>

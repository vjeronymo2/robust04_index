			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Japanese paper groups in link-up Honshu Paper, a leading Japanese paper and pulp company, and Takasaki Paper have agreed an alliance involving the sharing of distribution and purchasing channels. The move follows mergers by other leading Japanese paper manufacturers last year and is expected to generate further reorganisation of the country's troubled paper and pulp industry, which has been facing thinner profit margins due to over-supply and lower demand stemming from the economic downturn. Japan's material makers, including paper and pulp, cement and chemical companies, are facing increased competition from south-east Asia due to the strong yen. A shift of manufacturing centres by Japanese high-technology and export-orientated manufacturers to overseas locations has also hurt demand. The paper industry has been facing pressure from over capacity, and last April Nippon Paper Industries was created by a merger between Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, while in October, Oji Paper and Kanzaki Paper merged to become New Oji Paper. Honshu said cost-cutting from streamlining operations was limited and it had turned to a link-up with Takasaki for survival. The two companies will provide products to each other for sale under their own brand names. Both companies will invest some Y1bn (Dollars 8.9m) to buy each other's stock. Honshu intends to take 3.26 per cent of Takasaki while Takasaki is planning to hold a 0.46 per cent stake in Honshu.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> GIMME REWRITE: "I am not a journalist," says John Wayne Airport Manager Jan  Mittermeier, above, but there's her article in the current California County,  the magazine for county supervisors.  </P> <P> It's the rosiest account yet of the how the airport's "state of the art,"  "absolutely distinctive" new "dream terminal" was built. . . . The article  reports the project's cost without mentioning it was nearly $20 million over  original estimates. No mention either of bitter disputes with the contractor  that delayed opening day for five months. "I thought someone would like to see  something positive for a change," she said.

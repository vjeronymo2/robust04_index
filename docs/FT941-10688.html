			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: AXA Equity premiumincome tops Pounds 1bn Total premium income at AXA Equity &amp; Law, the life assurance and pensions arm of the AXA group, exceeded Pounds 1bn for the first time in 1993. Total funds under management in its unit trust subsidiary also exceeded Pounds 1bn for the first time. Total new business rose by 20 per cent, from Pounds 675m to Pounds 807m. Within the UK, the results reflected the emphasis throughout the life industry on single premium rather than regular premium products. Total UK insurance single premiums rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 520m, helped by the doubling of unit-linked life single premiums to Pounds 159m. Pensions single premiums were, however, 7 per cent lower at Pounds 155m. There was a 1 per cent rise in new annual premiums in the UK, to Pounds 59m, with a particular rise in mortgage-related business. Individual pensions annual premiums fell by 4 per cent to just over Pounds 24m.

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / People: Royal Armouries (International) Michael Herbert, 61, who recently retired as chairman and chief executive of the Tussauds group, owned by Pearson, has just joined the board of Royal Armouries (International), the company formed to operate the UK's first private finance initiative in the arts sector, the Royal Armouries in Leeds. The Leeds-based collection, due to open in early 1996, will be stocked largely by material from the Tower of London, but will not, says Herbert, be taking historically important and London-related items - such as Henry VIII's suit of armour - from the White Tower there. 'It's moving part of the Tower of London collection to Leeds, but in turn that means that remaining items, such as the crown jewels, will be able to have more space for display than previously,' says Herbert. The Leeds project has a combination of private and public sector finance totalling Pounds 42.5m. A trained accountant, Herbert started his working life with Peat Marwick. He joined Madame Tussaud's (as it then was) in 1967 as its first-ever qualified accountant. He became finance director in 1971, eventually taking on the role of chief executive in 1976.</p>

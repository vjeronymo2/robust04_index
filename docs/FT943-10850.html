			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: EU seeks means to ratify Gatt The European Union is drawing up a 'code of conduct' on trade negotiations which it hopes will enable it to ratify April's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) accord, officials said yesterday. The code would determine which EU institutions take the lead in new, non-trade areas to be co-ordinated by Gatt's successor body, the World Trade Organisation. The WTO is due to be established on January 1 next year. These include exchange rates, market access for services, intellectual property rights, anti-trust and social policies, and the environment. Ratification of the Gatt agreement has been on hold for months, pending a European Court of Justice decision on whether member states or the European Commission has legal responsibility for conducting negotiations and entering international agreements in the WTO. The code of conduct would avoid the problem by imposing community discipline on the member states, regardless of where the legal responsibility lay. Under the draft code, the commission would have authority to negotiate only in areas where they EU members have an agreed position. However, the commission must agree to drop the court case before the code of conduct can be adopted. The code of conduct solution is being pushed by Germany, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EU. A series of meetings has been scheduled in September to try to refine the code. Pressure has risen since it became clear that the court was unlikely to rule on the matter until the end of this year, which would mean that the EU would miss the January 1 deadline for setting up the WTO. Under EU rules, the commission is authorised to negotiate trade pacts with non-EU countries or blocs. The rules do not, however, deal with other types of international economic negotiations or accords. There is some doubt as to whether the code of conduct will succeed in resolving the dispute. Belgium, in particular, is opposed, arguing that the code will not be legally clear and that it would be better to wait for the court of justice to make its pronouncements. The commission is in favour, alongside Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner.</p>

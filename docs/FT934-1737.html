			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / State spending pushes up PSBR Higher government spending, compared with a year ago, pushed up the public sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 3.13bn last month, the Treasury said yesterday. In the first eight months of the financial year overall government borrowing totalled Pounds 30bn, compared with Pounds 22bn in the corresponding period last year. Local authorities repaid Pounds 1.21bn of debt in November, however, continuing their recent record of reducing borrowings. The figures underline how the recession has increased borrowing, partly because higher unemployment has pushed up social security spending and lower growth has held down tax revenues. Spending by central government departments, combined with interest payments and taking into account privatisation proceeds, came to Pounds 21.5bn last month. This compares with Pounds 21.32bn in October and Pounds 19.93bn in November last year. Central government revenues held up fairly well last month, totalling Pounds 17.14bn, after Pounds 18.1bn in October and Pounds 16.92bn in November 1992. Inland Revenue receipts were relatively buoyant at Pounds 4.06bn last month, after Pounds 3.85bn in the same month last year. The PSBR, which takes into account the gap between spending and revenues for both central and local government, was Pounds 2.69bn in October and Pounds 2.06bn in the previous November. In the last financial year the deficit came to Pounds 36.68bn. The Treasury's forecast in last month's Budget puts the 1993-94 deficit at Pounds 49.8bn. November was the fourth successive month in which local authorities repaid debt. In November last year they repaid Pounds 570m. So far this financial year local authorities have repaid a net Pounds 3bn, compared with repayments of Pounds 7.1bn in the equivalent period of 1992-93.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / World Trade News: US and EC try to halt oilseed war THE US and the EC this week are starting fresh talks in Geneva in the hopes of averting Dollars 1bn in US sanctions and a ruinous trade war over the Community's oilseeds subsidies. Both sides have sent signals that they are ready to find grounds for settlement. EC officials have hinted they may be able to modify their subsidies to cut production when they implement new acreage reduction provisions of the Common Agriculture Policy. The American Soyabean Association (ASA) has won two cases against the EC in the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), and has urged tough action by the US. Now it is showing signs that it is ready to compromise on a proposal which is 'meaningful, real and enforceable.' An ASA spokesman said it was 'important that the EC bring forth a proposal that is a solid step towards addressing the injury suffered by US soyabean producers'. If the talks fail to reach agreement, the US has until Friday to notify the Gatt Council that it wants the issue on its September 29 agenda. At that time it could announce its intention to impose sanctions.</p>

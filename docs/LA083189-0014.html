			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 103 AND ROXANI GILLESPIE  </P> <P> Roxani Gillespie, California's insurance commissioner, states that it is now "a  fair prediction that by and large" most Californians are "not going to get  lower insurance rates." She further states that hearings on the reviews could  take as long as 10 years.  </P> <P> I have a suggestion for Gillespie: Roll back rates immediately, as mandated by  a majority of the voters last November, and then proceed with the reviews. If  the insurance companies win out -- as they most assuredly will with her help --  they can then raise their rates in 1999 to make up for the 10 years of  rollbacks. Meanwhile, the public an enjoy a decade free of usurious insurance  rates.  </P> <P> HANK KOVELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

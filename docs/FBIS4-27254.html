			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message from King Norodom Sihanouk to his subjects; date </F> not given -- recorded]    [Text] My respects to both supreme patriarchs, to Samdech  Preah Pouthiveang, Samdech Preah Khousananda, and Samdech Preah  Mongkol Teppeacha [superior monks], and to the rest of the  Buddhist clergy; my respects to all my beloved compatriots, old  and young alike. I would like to inform you that the  inter-Cambodian conference known as the roundtable in Pyongyang,  the DPRK -- Cambodia's great friend -- has ended and has  produced the following results:    1. His Excellency [H.E.] Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun  Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranaridddh, and myself -- the five of us  responsible for solving problems for Cambodia -- agreed to  always be true and always be loyal to the principle that we will  do our best to create conditions for securing peace and security  for our Cambodian people, nation, and motherland. Our people  have suffered for more than 20 years now. They are in urgent  need of a cease-fire, of peace. Therefore, we must do our best  to restore peace and fully realize national reconciliation.  Furthermore, we will always be loyal to the sacred principle  that the country must be free from partition or secession; it  must not be divided into three, four, or more parts. We must  preserve the territorial unity and territorial integrity of  Cambodia forever. We must preserve the land and maritime  borders of an independent, neutral, and nonaligned Cambodia  which existed from 1963 to 1969 and which were solemnly  recognized by the international community.    Therefore, we must defend these borders, this 1963-69  territorial integrity and must do all we can so that all  countries in the world respect these land and maritime borders.  In order to do that we must achieve national unity, we must  regard one another as members of the same family and avoid  polarization. For this reason, the Pyongyang roundtable  unanimously agreed that although Cambodia's overall problems,  such as the problem of war, are not yet settled to a  satisfactory extent, we must carry on the talks between the  Royal Government of Cambodia and the party of Democratic  Kampuchea. Consequently, the Pyongyang roundtable decided that  in June 1994 another roundtable will be held at Damnak Chan in  the Phnom Penh Royal Palace. This roundtable will be a meeting  of representatives of H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun  Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, HRH Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh,  and Norodom Sihanouk. The five representatives will come to  the Royal Palace on 15 June, continue the work left over from  Pyongyang, and see to it that there will be progress in the  search for a solution to all problems, such as the problem of  war.    I would like to inform all of you, venerable monks and  beloved compatriots, that I Norodom Sihanouk am affected with  cancer of the bone marrow, an illness for which I did not  receive any treatment during the two months that I was having  the honor to serve my people, my country between our traditional  new year and the day I left home in May. During this time that  I was serving the people, the nation, and the motherland, I was  very tired every day and I did not receive any thorough medical  examination from my Chinese doctor to see whether the cancer had  recurred. The Chinese doctor was worried that my overwork and  lack of proper medical treatment -- as the one I received in  Beijing -- would cause a relapse. The Cambodian and French  doctors in Phnom Penh took three samples of my blood for  examination. The results of my blood test were not good. It  showed that I still had this cancer and a few other afflictions  in my system. Therefore, I needed to return promptly to the  Chinese hospital in Beijing.    However, because we also needed to hold the roundtable to  bring peace for our people and end their sufferings, I made the  ultimate sacrifice. As a result, my future was not bright and I  might become very sick and might even die. Although I was  experiencing a health problem, I agreed to make the sacrifice  and I did not recoil from personal discomfort when I had to work  relentlessly in the past few days. Why did I agree to all of  that? It was so that our nation can live in peace [words  indistinct] because of war.    It is most regrettable to me that the delegation of  Democratic Kampuchea or Khmer Rouge headed by H.E. Khieu Samphan  to the roundtable did not agree with the Royal Government and  the National Assembly.    Our Royal Government represented by HRH Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Samdech Hun Sen and our National  Assembly represented by H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, as the chairman,  fully accepted the king's proposal, that is, an immediate  cease-fire or, failing that, a permanent cease-fire as of 15  June when the war, the fighting must end without any conditions.  They also agreed to study with the Khmer Rouge ways to include  them into our Royal Government. They agreed to see whether our  Royal Government can accept the Khmer Rouge leaders as  ministers, deputy ministers, or secretaries of state. A number  of Khmer Rouge leaders are thus to be included into the Royal  Government and the Khmer Rouge army known as the National Army  of Democratic Kampuchea is to be integrated into the Khmer Royal  Armed Forces.    In this undertaking, I hoped that Pyongyang with its  excellent atmosphere and calm would be a perfect venue for us to  hold the discussion. I hoped that we would have sufficient time  to solve the problem and stop the war. [remainder of speech  unheard due to station going off the air]</p>

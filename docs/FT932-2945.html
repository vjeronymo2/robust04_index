			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gatt attacks Lome convention over bananas THE LOME convention of preferential trading arrangements between European Community members and their former colonies is expected to face its greatest threat today, as a dispute panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) condemns the convention as contrary to international trade rules. In what was being described yesterday as its hardest hitting report ever, the Gatt panel is expected to uphold on all counts a challenge from Latin American banana exporters that the EC's preferential banana import regime for developing country members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific grouping is discriminatory, and at odds with fair trade rules. The EC and a group of ACP countries were planning yesterday to block the panel report from being adopted by the Gatt Council when it meets this afternoon. But there was no disguising their consternation over the ruling. 'The report is drastic in its implications,' one banana trade expert noted. 'It will affect not just Lome countries, but any developing countries that have preferential trading arrangements with specific groups of countries.' The Gatt dispute panel, established in February after a complaint filed by Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela, ruled that the Lome arrangement could not be defended as a free trade agreement, or customs union, since the concessions are just one way. It also rejected the EC defence that these preferences were allowable for developing countries - arguing they benefit just a small group of countries, and discriminate against a large number of developing countries. The basic Gatt principle of 'most favoured nation' status demands that preferences extended to any one country or group of countries cannot be withheld from others. The panel offered a lifeline to the EC by saying it could seek a formal waiver from Gatt rules to defend its Lome commitments. The US has obtained waivers for various preferential trade arrangements which it recognises as falling outside international trade rules - not least its accord with signatories to the Caribbean Basin Initiative. The EC was yesterday predicting it would successfully weather this afternoon's storm, not just because they could block adoption of the panel report, but because it applied to a banana trade regime that is due to be replaced on July 1. The EC's agriculture ministers have proposed that from July there will be a 2m tonne per year quota for Latin American fruit, and that this will attract duty of Ecu100 per tonne. Imports of Latin American fruit above this level will attract a duty of Ecu850 per tonne. This will bring brief comfort, however. The Latin American banana exporters are expected to win approval at today's council for a new panel examining the new banana import regime. Much energy will be spent by Caribbean exporters aimed at ensuring the panel is forced to deliberate for six months, rather than follow an accelerated three-month procedure. They hope this would allow the new banana regime to become safely established. 'The most important element of our strategy now is to avoid at all cost the fast track procedure which will be requested by the Latin American countries when they request a second panel to look at the regulations governing the banana regime,' said Mr George Brizan, Grenada's agriculture minister. ACP banana exporters face a further serious hurdle on Friday this week when the European Court of Justice hears a demand from German banana importers for an injunction delaying introduction of the new regime. Germany has in the past largely imported 'dollar bananas' from Latin America, and has been deeply unhappy about new single market arrangements which would force importers to share the cost of the ACP preference scheme, significantly raising the price of bananas for Germans, who are among the world's largest consumers of the fruit. Some ACP members were also complaining yesterday that the banana panel ruling 'somewhat pre-empts' the work of a Gatt working party inquiring into the Lome convention, which is on the agenda to be established at today's council meeting.</p>

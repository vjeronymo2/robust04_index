			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (4): Partnership in an age of technical complexity - Ever more work is being farmed out THE use of contract manufacturers in the West grew rapidly over the past decade as managements reassessed their corporate strategies. As a result many companies decided to concentrate on their core activities and turn other functions, including manufacturing, over to specialist contractors. This reassessment was often prompted by the need to remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace. It also highlighted other concepts such as total quality management and just-in-time inventory control which contribute to the success of Japanese companies. Contracting out of manufacturing and assembly is well established in Japan. Recent research at Tokyo University suggests that it now accounts for over a third of Japanese companies' total manufacturing costs and will increase to over 40 per cent by the end of the decade. In the 1960s it was less than 20 per cent. Most Japanese companies farm out manufacturing in the belief that specialists can offer better quality and efficiency. It may also help them to cut costs, scale down capital spending and concentrate on what they are really good at - market research, product definition, product planning, marketing and sales. According to a survey by MHM, a market research organisation based in Ayr, Scotland, about 35 per cent of European contract electronics customers had no electronics assembly operations of their own. There are many reasons why manufacturers use contract manufacturers and cost is not always the principal one. Some studies in the US suggest that managements who use sub-contractors principally to cut overheads and jobs end up regretting the decision. Most management consultants argue that contract manufacturing should form part of an overall strategy to improve quality and competitiveness by delivering the right products to market at the right time and the right price. The basis of total quality theory is to identify, and be responsive to, the customer, produce a top quality product first time, and work to improve quality all the time. A partnership with a contract manufacturer can help achieve these aims. In any case, within the electronics industry the days are gone when OEMs can do everything themselves in order to retain most of the added value. Already most components are bought in and, since they are now so complex, the bulk of the cost of an assembled printed circuit board (PCB) lies in the components it carries. As competition in the global electronics industry has grown the competent handling of these components, some of which may cost hundreds of pounds, has become crucial if a company is to maintain its profit margins. 'The diversification of disciplines and expertise in modern electronics is driving companies to reassess their core function and raison d'etre for being in the business,' says Mr Derek Duffett, director of the Association of Contract Electronics manufacturers (ACeM). 'The 80:20 rule applies to many aspects of business, be it range of products, or range of activities; in other words only 20 per cent of products or activities produce 80 per cent of the profit,' he adds. Today companies, particularly large multinationals, are increasingly aware of the significance of both direct and indirect costs. Contracting out manufacturing frees capital to invest in core activities and enables the management to concentrate on key areas which will help to maintain a competitive edge. In addition the advent of capital intensive processes such as surface mount technology (SMT) has encouraged many OEMs, particularly those outside the electronics industry, to leave such specialist activity to contract electronics manufacturers. Electronic controls are replacing older electro-mechanical controls in many areas including automotive design, medical systems and a wide range of consumer goods such as washing machines. However many manufacturers cannot justify the cost of SMT or other automated manufacturing equipment which would stand idle much of the time. Similarly the use of a contract manufacturer can remove the need to recruit and train expensive specialist staff. The contract manufacturer's employees represent a pool of dedicated technical and production expertise which is available to the customer. Indeed most contract manufacturers now offer a full range of services to their clients including, if required, PCB design, layout, manufacture and testing. However greater flexibility and speed of response are probably the most important advantage of using contract electronics manufacturers. Most contract manufacturers have the capacity and flexible workforce to start production very quickly to meet an unexpected surge in demand. A striking characteristic of today's electronics and computer markets is the shortening of product life cycles - in some parts of the computer industry they have shrunk to as little as six months and OEMs need to move quickly from one product and technology to the next. Contract manufacturing can help to ensure this fast response and lessen the risk associated with manufacturing and holding inventory. Contractors can also work with a customer to reduce costs during a product life cycle. Other potential advantages include economies of scale in component purchasing and the use of sophisticated computerised automated manufacturing and test sys tems to improve quality and provide 'just-in-time' deliveries. Most contract manufacturers have embraced total quality programmes, and obtained certification. Sometimes there are significant cost advantages to using a contract electronics manufacturer. However, cost comparisons need to be approached carefully. Often the true costs of in-house manufacturing operations are obscured, for example by shared corporate functions. In addition, comparisons between CEMs in different parts of the world can be confusing. On the basis of labour costs alone contract electronics manufacturers in the Far East continue to have an advantage over their counterparts in Europe and North America. However the gap is narrowing and the use of increasingly automated equipment means that the cost of labour is often relatively insignificant. Most European CEMs also say that any cost advantage of manufacturing in the Far East can easily be offset by intangible costs such as delays in shipping and loss of design flexibility. Indeed a number of PC manufacturers have recently brought manufacturing back from Far East contractors. ICL, for example, stopped buying its systems from Acer, one of Taiwan's biggest OEM suppliers, following a feasibility study by consultants KPMG. The machines are manufactured by ICL at its plant in Ashton-under-Lyne. ICL also acts as a contract manufacturer in the UK for Sun Microsystems of the US. It says that its decision to bring manufacturing back from the Far East was based partly on increasing volumes and partly because the market was changing. It found that the benefits of Far Eastern cheap labour were being out-weighed by the disadvantages - higher import duties, reconfiguration on arrival, the logistics of product being at sea for six weeks, arms length quality and technology changes leading to obsolete stock. Mr Gordon Stewart of consultants Pittiglio Rabin Todd and McGrath argues that the demands placed on contract manufacturers have changed. 'Two issues are shaping the future of contract electronics manufacturing: volume flexibility and design integration.' He says that price and quality are a given. 'The keys to competitiveness now are responsiveness - lead times, volumes - and the capacity to integrate manufacturing and test processes into an OEM's own product development strategy.' But at an ACeM conference last year he also cautioned that many contract manufacturers fell a long way short of these expectations and only got by because few OEMs could manage a contractor relationship professionally. Mr Duffett, the ACeM's director, acknowledges that for many managers, who are used to in-house manufacturing using bought-in piece parts, farming out work with independent CEMs represents a significant change of practice, calling for a radically new buyer/supplier relationship. 'The days of arm's length negotiations with choices based solely on lowest price and shortest delivery are over,' he says.</p>

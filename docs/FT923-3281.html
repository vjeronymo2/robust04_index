			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / PM's pragmatism hardens into conviction: Government worth pegged to that of sterling IT IS time to take much more seriously Mr John Major's commitment to the value of the pound. It can no longer be dismissed as the ritual pledge of a prime minister in the heat of battle with speculators on foreign exchange markets. Instead, it marks the return of conviction politics. When Mr Major declared this week that he would not devalue sterling, he meant it. He staked the political authority of his government on his capacity to stick to the pledge. He may yet be overwhelmed by the financial markets. If the French vote No to the Maastricht treaty on September 20, it may be that no amount of central bank intervention can protect weaker currencies in the exchange rate mechanism. Nor might higher interest rates be enough to hold sterling's value against the D-Mark. Even if France backs the treaty on European union, it is far from clear that the markets will be tamed. As long as the recession persists and the Tory party retains a penchant for self-inflicted wounds, the doubts in the currency markets about Mr Major's resolve will remain. Talk to enough Whitehall mandarins and it is not difficult to find experienced hands who laud the prime minister's intentions but mutter darkly that the policy may be doomed. Talk to enough ministers and there are reminders of the cardinal rule that everything must bend to political reality. It is much harder to find any doubt over Mr Major's determination. He is as adamant in private as in public that he will not bend - he will defeat inflation and the ERM will provide the framework to do it. It is partly personal. It was Mr Major who, as chancellor, persuaded the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher to lift the veto on ERM membership that had led Mr Nigel Lawson to storm out of her cabinet. It took Mr Major nine months to win her round. He rightly regarded it as a triumph. Two years on, he is not willing to devalue that along with the pound. However, Mr Major is also a pragmatic politician. He outflanked more experienced rivals in the leadership race by persuading those from the right and the left of his party that he was One of Them. In Downing Street, he has displayed the same mastery of the politically possible. But inflation is an issue on which pragmatism has hardened into conviction. Long before he entered No 10, Mr Major blamed Britain's long-term economic decline on its poor inflation performance. The destruction wrought by the inflationary boom of 1988 confirmed his judgment. He believes inflation is as destructive socially as it is economically. It wrecks business profits and investment, impoverishes those on fixed incomes and - crucially for a politician with Mr Major's humble background - those struggling to climb the economic ladder by building up their savings. So if the now Lady Thatcher saw her mission in politics as the defeat of socialism, Mr Major is bidding for a place in history as the prime minister who tamed inflation. He is aware of parallels drawn with predecessors who forfeited authority in attempts to resist the markets. The most common comparison is with the then Mr Harold Wilson, whose government was torn apart by the devaluation of 1967. The lesson Mr Major draws, though, is not that Mr Wilson was unwise to take on the speculators - rather that subsequent events demonstrated it was impossible to steal a competitive edge through devaluation. Some in Whitehall have been urging Mr Major to leave an escape hatch: to keep open the option of covert devaluation in a general ERM realignment and to put some distance between himself and Mr Norman Lamont. This week Mr Major did the opposite. He dismissed realignment and deliberately praised his chancellor. He is not a masochist. He will do all he can to defend the pound without raising interest rates. Next month's Conservative party conference already promises to be rough. The prime minister does not want to court open rebellion. Now there is no going back. If the pressures intensify, Mr Major will be forced to raise borrowing costs or abandon the political authority won only five months ago in the general election. Mr Major denies that the economy will remain mired in recession so long as sterling is tied to its present rate against the D-Mark. He acknowledges that recovery will be slow but insists it will come. If he rides out the storm, his authority will be unassailable. If he loses to the speculators, it will be shredded. But then, conviction politics always were a gamble.</p>

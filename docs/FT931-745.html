			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Publicis earnings steady at FFr148.9m PUBLICIS, one of France's largest marketing services groups, maintained net profits at FFr148.9m (Dollars 26.7m) last year in the face of fierce competition in the European advertising market. Mr Maurice Levy, chairman, said that in spite of the difficult trading climate Publicis had produced a 'satisfactory performance' during the year. The group's turnover was static, at FFr19.9bn although Publicis said it would have risen by 5 per cent if there had been constant exchange rates. European advertising agencies had a tough time in 1992 because of the economic slowdown and the long-term trend away from conventional media advertising to other forms of 'below the line' marketing, which are often less profitable. These problems were aggravated in France by concern about the effect of le loi Sapin, the new regulations on media buying. However, Publicis managed to compensate for the sluggish state of the market by winning new business. Its new accounts include the advertising for Perrier and Vittel mineral water, which it was awarded by Nestle, the Swiss food group, following Mr Levy's role in co-ordinating Nestle's communications strategy during its bid battle for Perrier. Mr Levy said Publicis hoped to maintain sales in 1993, but warned that profits could be affected by the impact of le loi Sapin and by continued cuts in marketing budgets.</p>

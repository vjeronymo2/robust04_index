			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Marking time in middle England - Richard Donkin visits crucial marginals around Birmingham NUNEATON Town Hall might have been purpose-built for one of those late 1950s British comedy films where the local worthy pulls out his pocket watch as Norman Wisdom, playing the downtrodden Mr Pitkin, rides by on his milk cart. This is provincial middle England where, but for the pedestrian precinct and the Jobcentre, the pocket watch might have stopped in 1959. Nuneaton has the sort of imposing Co-op that 30 years ago no one would have dared walk past without knowing their 'divi' number. People still work a long time for the Co-op. Its last assistant manager, who retired a few weeks ago, had been there since the age of 14 with a brief break for fire-watching duty during the Coventry blitz. Continuity of employment, however, has become the exception rather than the rule. In a part of Nuneaton called Bermuda - due to an affectation of a former landowner who had been a governor of the colony - is a futuristic development housing Federal Express, perfectly positioned near the heart of the motorway network. Last week the courier company, one of Nuneaton's largest private employers, announced that the depot would close in May as part of a large-scale retrenchment programme across Europe. About 500 jobs are expected to go. This was no tired, declining industry defying progress, but one of the most vibrant of the 1980s service sectors. The failure has increased uncertainties among many service-sector employees who dominate the jobs market in spite of the West Midlands' reputation as the anvil of British manufacturing production. West Midlands Employment Information Unit says that in September last year the region had 1.25m people in the service sector, against 613,000 in manufacturing. Nuneaton job centre has 219 vacancies and 5,821 people chasing jobs. The rate of unemployment in the region has risen to just over 10 per cent from the 6 per cent of early 1990. More than 40 people hunt every job in the urban centres. Nuneaton is a blue-collar area, mostly residential - many of its people work in the Coventry car industries. It might be expected to be a Labour seat but Mr Lewis Stevens, the Conservative MP, is sitting on a 5,655 majority which Labour needs a swing of 5.5 per cent to overturn. The seat is one of an arc of Conservative marginals to the south and east of Birmingham that Labour believes it will win. A 2.5 per cent swing to Labour would cost Mr Francis Maude, the financial secretary to the Treasury, his Warwickshire North seat. The constituency is the home of Federal Express's biggest competitor, TNT. Its chief executive Mr Alan Jones, is a vocal opponent of Labour policy. Before TNT arrived in Atherstone, the town was coming to terms with the loss of most of its mining industry. TNT, with 600 staff, is Atherstone's biggest employer. It has expanded its customer base by 15 per cent in the last 12 months. Mr Jones is worried about Labour's taxation plans and their effect on his company. After working out his finances based on Mr Smith's Budget, he says, he cancelled an order for a three-piece suite and put his house up for sale.' If Labour get in there will be a meltdown in the property market,' he says. 'If people are not going to buy things there will be no market for people to make things.' The knock-on effect in the movement of goods, he says, would almost certainly lead to redundancies in his own company. Henry Tudor is said to have stayed in Atherstone before the nearby battle of Bosworth in 1485. If Mr Martin O'Brien, the Labour candidate, is to unseat Mr Maude as effectively as Henry dealt with Richard III, the issue of employment may prove to be a significant battleground.</p>

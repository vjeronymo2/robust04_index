			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Steve Rodan] </F>   [Excerpt] The Justice Ministry has drafted a plan for the  removal of all Jews from Hebron, THE JERUSALEM POST has learned,  but it remains far from certain that the cabinet is ready to  address this issue, according to sources in the Prime Minister's  Office.    Justice Minister David Liba'i alluded to his plan during a  tour of Haifa at the end of last week. "We should remove  radical Jewish elements from the heart of Arab population  centers," he said. "We must consider how much to invest in  their safety and how much of a future they have under today's  changing conditions."    The Hebron plan is based on a government assessment that the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] can no longer guarantee the safety  of the 42 families living there. Officials say there are 400  Jews in the city.    "After the events last week, there is a problem ensuring  their safety," one official said.    A senior defense official dismissed the proposal as  "rubbish," and said it has not been approved or seriously  discussed.    However, a government legal expert said military authorities  in the territories have the right to order an evacuation. He  said the easiest way would be to declare Hebron a closed  military zone.    The issue was raised at last week's Wednesday meeting of the  ministerial security committee. Several ministers called for  the removal of at least some of the families living in Hebron,  specifically those in the Bet Hadassah complex.    A diplomatic source said Rabin remains the only member in  the  security cabinet who opposes the evacuation. PLO sources said  the removal of Hebron's Jews represents a key condition to the  resumption of the peace talks. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley recovery continues LAURA ASHLEY Holdings, the clothes and home furnishings group that sees itself as a 'lifestyle brand' rather than a retailer, more than trebled its pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.68m in the six months to July 25. However, the interim dividend is passed again. Mr Jim Maxmin, who took over as chief executive a year ago at the group which had been losing money for three years, said: 'It's too early in the recovery cycle to consider paying dividends.' Most of the group's shares are in the hands of Sir Bernard Ashley, chairman, who holds 53 per cent, and the Japanese Aeon group, which has 15 per cent. Last year's interim figure was Pounds 528,000 on turnover of Pounds 132.2m. The reduction in sales to Pounds 115.9m was planned, Mr Maxmin said. 'The gross margin went up in every market and product category except garments in North America.' That part of the business had lost Pounds 1m. North America accounts for about a third of sales and has 196 shops. Although the retailing background was depressed, Mr Maxmin said most of the problems were self inflicted. There had been a 'skills deficit' in the head office in New Jersey and it had now been moved to Boston. The new management was concentrating on basic retailing disciplines. About 40 per cent of sales lie in the UK, where there are 175 shops. Mr Andrew Higginson, finance director, said UK garment sales had dropped by 14.5 per cent, 'in line with the plan', but gross margins had only fallen by 2.4 per cent. 'We have been eliminating unprofitable sales.' In the first seven weeks of the second half, sales were 15 per cent ahead of last year. In continental Europe, where there are 65 shops and more planned, both garments and home furnishings improved sales and profits. Associates - a US bed linen business and a joint venture in Japan - contributed Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.41m). Sales at Laura Ashley Japan advanced 20 per cent. Operating profit from wholly owned activities rose to Pounds 499,000 (Pounds 383,000). Operating expenses were cut by Pounds 8.4m. Interest payments came down to Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 1.42m) and net debt fell to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 13.4m), gearing of about 7 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 0.4p (0.12p), although the tax rate stayed high at 45 per cent. Mr Higginson said the tax paid on continental and associate profits represented a virtual fixed charge. As profits came back from the UK and North America, the rate would fall substantially.</p>

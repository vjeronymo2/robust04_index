			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Hongkong Telecom The 15 per cent growth in Hongkong Telecom's half-year earnings was in line with expectations. But the figures were a disappointment nonetheless. The reason was the pedestrian 11 per cent increase in turnover - pedestrian, that is, for a company valued at a substantial premium to the Hong Kong market. But for a reduced tax rate and a lower management fee paid to Cable &amp; Wireless, Hongkong Telecom's parent, earnings growth would have been more modest. Worryingly, the main culprit behind the sluggish sales picture was China. The country generates about a third of the group's international revenues, and enormous excitement among investors. In the first half, growth in call traffic with China slowed to 21 per cent compared with the 30 per cent of recent years. The unexpected slowdown is unlikely to be temporary. It highlights the risk and volatility associated with China, rather than just the opportunities. That Chinese growth rates have slipped does not obscure the enormous potential of the Chinese market, which Hongkong Telecom is well placed to exploit. But yesterday's figures will rightly serve to puncture the somewhat unreflecting euphoria which followed last month's announcement of a planned Dollars 300m direct investment in the country. Hongkong Telecom is under pressure in other areas of its international business and will shortly face intensified competition in its domestic market as well. The company may be well-placed and well-managed but the shares look expensive.</p>

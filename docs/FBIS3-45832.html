			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F> (6392 6647 1987)]    [Text] Beijing, Jan 8 (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a national  conference on agricultural work, which ended today, State  Councillor Chen Junsheng stressed: It is critical to  comprehensively carry out economic structural reform this year.  The State Council will announce a number of major reform  measures one after another, which are important steps in  establishing a socialist market economic structure. To ensure  their successful implementation, the entire party, from the top  to the bottom, must make joint efforts, and governments at all  levels and the vast numbers of cadres and masses in the  agricultural system should focus closely on this central work of  the State Council, proceed from its general interests in  everything they do, and carry out the party's rural policies in  a down-to-earth manner. They should earnestly improve  agriculture, carry out rural economic work, and strive to  accomplish this year's production tasks to create a favorable  environment for reform.    Chen Junsheng pointed out: A prominent problem in our work  for many years has been that policies are not implemented or are  distorted in the course of implementation. This is particularly  true in the case of policies affecting the immediate interests  of peasants and policies supporting and protecting agricultural  production. There are both structural causes and causes related  to awareness and work. Structural causes must be gradually  resolved through in-depth reform. However, a large amount of  facts indicates that the problem is largely rooted in awareness  and work. In many instances, structure cannot be blamed for our  failure to implement policies. The causes must be found in  subjective factors, namely, whether party and government leaders  at various levels truly regard policies as the party's lifeline  and whether they have firmly established the idea that  agriculture constitutes the foundation. Without a profound  understanding of the problems facing rural areas, agriculture,  and peasants, they will lack initiative and a sense of  responsibility in policy implementation. Whether or not we can  successfully implement the party's rural policies is a matter of  party spirit. All localities and departments must ensure  successful implementation of central policies without  obstruction.    Chen Junsheng said: Steadily increasing peasants' income and  the effective supply of agricultural produce is a strategic  issue affecting the prosperity and development of the national  economy. To increase peasant incomes more rapidly, we must  proceed from the overall interest of developing the entire  economy and earnestly implement the various principles and  policies adopted by the party and state for the countryside.  From now on, gradually improving peasants' living standards and  increasing their income by every possible means will be made an  important norm in the performance evaluation of cadres at all  levels. We must judge the work of a locality not only by the  amount of grain produced but also by the amount of the peasants'  income increased.    Speaking of this year's agricultural and rural work, Chen  Junsheng asked all localities to carry out the following tasks  in a down-to-earth manner:    1. We must never relax grain and cotton production. We must  not treat grain production lightly at any time. We are a large  country where conditions differ from one area to another. If we  misstep on this issue, no one can help us. Cotton production  has declined for two years in a row. From now on, we must use  any and all means to maintain adequate crop acreage and work  hard to restore our total cotton output to normal levels.    2. We must use the market as our guide to vigorously develop  "three-high" [high technology, high foreign exchange earnings,  and high efficiency] agriculture. While ensuring a steady  increase in grain and cotton production, we should let peasants  freely adjust their agricultural structure and develop  "three-high" agriculture. To this end we must successfully build  well the demonstration zones designated by the central  authorities for developing a type of farming that provides high  yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency. Provinces could  also designate a number of provincial- level "three-high"  agricultural demonstration zones.    3. We must continue our efforts to promote the construction  of vegetable basket projects in various parts of the country.  Large and medium-sized cities shall maintain a fixed proportion  of vegetable fields in the suburbs based on the distance to the  city proper. Vigorous efforts should be made to develop  vegetable crops, livestock breeding, and fishing. Steps should  be taken to further enliven circulation and stabilize market  supply. The State Council will soon hold a vegetable basket  project conference to focus on resolving problems of vegetable  supply around the Spring Festival and during next April or May,  the slack season.    4. We must vigorously develop town and township  enterprises. Whether peasant incomes will increase in a  sustained way in the next several years still hinges, to a large  extent, on the rate of growth and efficiency of town and  township enterprises. These enterprises must stress "internal  management" and spend more efforts on improving their standards,  quality, and efficiency.    5. We must persistently carry out the work of supervising  and controlling burdens on the peasants. Central and provincial  departments concerned must screen, in accordance with the law,  documents and projects that will affect the peasants' burdens.  Strict control should be exercised and no projects should be  undertaken without prior screening and approval to prevent  eliminated burdens from "bouncing back." At the same time,  localities should continue to implement the central policies and  laws and regulations on reducing peasant burdens and should  remove burdens from peasants accordingly.    Chen Junsheng also stressed: Agricultural departments should  earnestly change their functions and mentality, expand their  field of work, and strengthen regulation and control. They  should promote reform and pay attention to policy while taking  care of production and technology; they should concern  themselves with the production process and at the same time take  care of procurement and marketing to link them with production.    At the meeting, the Ministry of Agriculture commended 80  advanced units and 300 advanced workers who made outstanding  contributions to the control and prevention of bollworms in 1993.    Responsible persons from relevant State Council departments  attended today's meeting.</p>

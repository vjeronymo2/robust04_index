			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Call for body to probe Bar complaints A complaints bureau to investigate allegations of unsatisfactory work by barristers which could order compensation payments to clients of up to Pounds 2,000 should be established, the Bar Standards Review Body recommended yesterday. The recommendation was one of a number made by the review body, set up by the Bar Council after last year's royal commission on criminal justice drew attention to the poor performance of some barristers and called for a raising of standards. The complaints bureau, the review body suggests, should be run by a non-barrister. It should have the power to demand apologies, order compensation and refer cases to the Bar disciplinary tribunal. If the Bar agrees to the establishment of such a bureau it could be in operation by the start of 1996. It would cost about Pounds 167,000 a year to run, said Lord Alexander of Weedon QC, chairman of the review body. However, he stressed yesterday that the review body's other recommendations were aimed at improving the standards of barristers' work so that complaints were less likely. 'Prevention is still better than cure,' he said. The other recommendations include pre-trial conferences to improve early preparation of cases, publication by barristers' chambers of their working procedures and fees, and the compulsory continuation of education during the first three years of practice on issues such as case management, time manage-ment and racial aware-ness.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW EUROPE GIVES A BOOST TO VACATION TRAVEL;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE GROWING POPULARITY OF MORE EXOTIC  DESTINATIONS SPUR TICKET SALES BY INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS.  </P> <P> Expansion of U.S. air carrier service to international destinations coupled  with the historic changes sweeping across East Europe are spurring travelers to  go overseas in droves, say San Diego travel agents, who are experiencing a busy  summer.  </P> <P> But transatlantic flights aren't the only tours giving international travel a  boost, local travel agents and industry observers add.  </P> <P> Growing popularity of "exotic" destinations in the South Pacific, such as  Australia, New Zealand and the Fiji Islands, have helped U.S. airlines post  double-digit growth in revenue passenger miles the last three years. The  standard measuring stick for the airline industry, one revenue passenger mile  equals one paying passenger flown one mile.  </P> <P> Revenue passenger miles have been growing at an even healthier clip so far this  year, industry observers say.  </P> <P> During the first five months of 1990, U.S. carriers registered 42.7 billion  revenue passenger miles, up 18.5% over the 36.1 billion revenue passenger miles  recorded during the same period in 1989, according to the Air Transport Assn.,  the Washington-based industry group.  </P> <P> The number of passengers boarding international flights also increased: during  the first five months of 1990, U.S. airlines carried 15.6 million passengers,  up 14% over the 13.7 million travelers who boarded overseas flights during the  same period last year.  </P> <P> Such growth almost guarantees the fourth, consecutive year that international  travel will post a record revenue passenger miles figure, said Lee Howard,  chief executive officer of Airline Economics, a Washington-based airline  consulting firm and publisher of industry publications.  </P> <P> "A globalization movement is afoot," Howard said. "The world is getting smaller  at a geometric rate. There is more cohesiveness among countries, there are more  business connections among countries. That has created a demand for  international service and, as more international service is offered, more  people travel overseas. We're in a growth cycle."  </P> <P> Since 1987, international revenue passenger miles have increased at an average  annual rate of 10%, Howard said.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be surprised if this is a record growth year," Howard said.  "There's no question that we're going to reach a record level (of revenue  passenger miles)."  </P> <P> International travel is making a strong comeback after suffering major setbacks  suffered in 1986: the Chernobyl nuclear accident and a spurt of terrorist  activities persuaded travelers to keep their feet on the ground.  </P> <P> "With the terrorist activities that took place in 1986 behind us, we've noticed  that people are ready to go back out there," said Michelle Goggin, leisure  travel counselor at Balboa Travel in San Diego.  </P> <P> "Not only are they traveling to traditional European destinations in greater  numbers, they're going to areas, what used to be the less popular areas, in  Eastern Europe," Goggin said. "With the Berlin Wall going down, with more  countries striving toward westernization . . . with glasnost more people are  interested in going to the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Although Goggin could not provide specific figures, she said trips to Eastern  Europe this summer have "at least doubled, if not tripled" over last year.  </P> <P> Local travel agencies are booking many flights to traditional European  destinations such as Austria and Switzerland, but Hana Huvar, a travel  agent-trainee at Firstworld Travel of El Cajon, said Czechoslovakia and Poland  are gaining attention, too. Huvar should know: in May, she traveled back to her  hometown of Zlin, Czechoslovakia, for the first time since her native country  instituted a democratic form of government.  </P> <P> "There are many people who left Eastern Europe and came to live in San Diego,"  Huvar said. "Now a lot of them are going back to see what's happening in their  homeland."  </P> <P> But other regions of the world are attracting the attention of globe-trotters,  too, travel agents say. Mexico continues to be a strong lure for San Diegans.  In fact, Aero California, a Mexican airline, will start direct flights from San  Diego to Cabo San Lucas at the tip of Baja California on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The America's Cup and aggressive advertising by Australian tourism officials in  recent years have boosted the popularity of trips "down under."  </P> <P> "People want to go further than just Hawaii," Goggin said. "They're heading for  Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tahiti." A round trip fare to Sydney costs about  $1,000.  </P> <P> But Goggin is well aware that the outbreak of turmoil in foreign lands can  bring an abrupt halt to growth patterns.  </P> <P> Trips to China and excursions to Hong Kong or other nearby cities were gaining  popularity until the June 1989 civil disturbances. "Those trips have  significantly declined," said Goggin.  </P> <P> Expansion of service and the addition of destinations have also played a major  role in boosting international traffic volume.  </P> <P> "In addition to new routes, you're seeing more airports used for international  flights," said David Swierenga, ATA's assistant vice president. "Traditionally,  most international flights were from New York, Los Angeles and Miami, but, in  recent years, you're seeing international service out of places like Pittsburgh  and Dallas."  </P> <P> American Airlines, which posted a 14% June-to-June gain in revenue passenger  miles, is one such carrier that is trying to establish a presence in the  international market, said Al Becker, a company spokesman.  </P> <P> In February, American Airlines inaugurated service to Sydney, Australia, and  Auckland, New Zealand. Then in May, American introduced three non-stop routes  from Chicago to Glasgow, Scotland, to Munich and to Dusseldorf. A non-stop  flight from Miami to London just began this month.  </P> <P> "It's just a reflection of the demand for international travel," Becker said.  </P> <P> Pan Am, which services 68 cities in Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia,  Africa and the Middle East, has also benefited from the crumbling of the Iron  Curtain, said Elizabeth Hlinko, a company spokeswoman. Pan Am flies to 11  cities in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, including non-stop flights from  New York to Budapest, Moscow and Warsaw.  </P> <P> During the first six months of 1990, Pan Am registered 14.7 billion revenue  passenger miles, up 11.4% over 13.2 billion revenue passenger miles recorded  during the same period last year.  </P> <P> "With Eastern Europe becoming such a hot spot, that has certainly helped our  figures," Hlinko said.  </P></p>

Russia Is Linking This Closely with  Schedule for Withdrawing Its Troops from Estonia"]    [Text] The latest round of talks between Estonia and Russia  began outside Moscow yesterday. The agenda included the  traditional package of questions regarding troop withdrawal and  problems to do with borders and the humanitarian, legal, and  economic aspects of cooperation. For the first time, the  delegation from the Republic of Estonia will be headed at the  talks by Reino Reinart, chief of the Department for  International Organizations and Security at the republic's  Foreign Ministry, who has been given the diplomatic rank of  ambassador. It is well known that Juri Luik, the former head of  the Estonian delegation, has been appointed Estonian foreign  minister.    In the opinion of Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, the  priority issue at these talks remains the fastest possible  withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonian territory. The  Estonian side hopes that Russia will submit a written schedule  for withdrawing its troops. Laar believes that once this is  done, the republic will have the opportunity to reach agreement  with Russia as soon as possible on creating conditions for  implementing the schedule, and "by 31 August the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Estonia will be complete."    On the eve of the talks, Vladimir Tsivinskiy, secretary to  the Russian delegation at the talks with Estonia, noted in an  interview with your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent that there are  plans to submit a schedule for withdrawing troops. At the same  time, Tsivinskiy stressed, this act directly depends on a number  of factors, the most important of which is the willingness of  the two sides to sign a fundamental treaty on the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Estonia.</p>

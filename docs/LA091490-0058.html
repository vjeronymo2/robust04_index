			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> WANT REAL GRUB? SIT A SPELL AT SKOBY'S  </P> <P> Chatsworth is about as much like Wyoming as any place gets, this side of the  Santa Monica Mountains. Horses strut about in white-fenced corrals. The  foothills look close enough to touch.  </P> <P> Walk into a local hangout in this town, Skoby's Country Inn, and what do you  see? Families, natch, here for the family-style food, and also a few  leather-skinned roughnecks who look as if they've been out taming stallions all  day. In general, these guys favor the bar, where they can drink giant mugs of  beer and swap stories about their exploits. But when they get hungry, Katie,  bar the door -- they get hungry.  </P> <P> Skoby's is the right place for them. It's a rugged-looking roadhouse with a bar  full of black Naugahyde booths at one end and a sweet, rustic dining room at  the other. The dining room has turn-of-the-century ceiling fans, glass-topped  tables and beams sticking through a slanted roof. Call it mom-and-pop  deconstructionism, and don't bother any of the boys in the bar with one of  these expressions. They're just here for the grub.  </P> <P> No problem. Food comes in trencherman portions that look almost intimidating if  you aren't an endurance rider. Take the stuffed mushroom appetizer: jumbo  mushrooms the size of a Little Leaguer's baseball cap. The kitchen heaps them  with fresh ricotta cheese or good, crumbly homemade sausage. They come four to  an order, and must weigh six ounces apiece.  </P> <P> Then there's the chicken liver pate, a monstrous scoop surrounded by lettuce,  tomato and black olives. I don't endorse this one; it's food-processor-mushy  and distinctive only for its sheer bulk. The onion rings, garlic toast and  fried zucchini sticks served here are kindred spirits to the pate, oversized  and underwhelming.  </P> <P> The house specialty at Skoby's is country-style pan-fried chicken, golden brown  and four pieces to the order. Pan-fried chicken has a different character  altogether from deep-fried; it's denser, crisper, and when done skillfully, far  less oily. Skoby's chicken is dense, crisp, and so forth, but the superlatives  end there; it just doesn't taste like a whole lot. The chicken itself is a  little tired, and whatever it is dredged with could use more zip.  </P> <P> But it's still an impressive dinner, all told, and at a very low price ($9.95)  to boot. The accompaniments are all terrific. First you get a creamy cabbage  soup and a basket of moist, flaky squares of corn bread, and then with the  chicken come great mashed potatoes, peppery black-eyed peas and a viscous  country gravy that could encase a mobster's feet on his way to the bottom of  the river. If they would liven up the chicken just a bit, the dinner would be a  knockout.  </P> <P> A couple of things here are already knockouts. The unctuous homemade meat loaf,  wrapped in brown paper before baking, is the rival of any meat loaf on the  Westside. And the stuffed pork chop with corn bread stuffing is the best I've  tasted in this area, an honest dish with an honest farmhouse appeal.  </P> <P> There's much more to the menu than these dishes: several broiled fish -- sea  bass, shark and sole to name a few -- and a whole list of specialties such as  chicken fried steak and a full slab of ribs. The ribs are so big that they  stick out over both sides of the platter they are served on (too bad they're so  overdone; the meat is so soft it literally falls apart when you bite into it).  </P> <P> At lunchtime you'll find good burgers, a meaty top sirloin sandwich and a fine  club sandwich with crisp bacon on soft egg bread. Ask for some of the house  barbecue beans with your sandwich. They are sensational, with hunks of bacon in  every smoky bite.  </P> <P> You can't get the pan-fried chicken at lunch, but there is a dish called  chicken and pasta. I liked it better than the pan-fried chicken, actually. It's  half a baked chicken with that good corn bread stuffing, served on a bed of  buttered noodles and smothered with that same petroleum-jelly-thick country  gravy.  </P> <P> Have them put the gravy on the side, unless you're planning a long ride after  lunch. Like to Wyoming.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: stuffed jumbo mushrooms with ricotta, $3.95; with sausage  $4.95; home-made meat loaf, $9.95; stuffed pork chop (Wednesday only, after 5  p.m.), $7.50; homemade cheese cake, $3.25.  </P> <P>  Skoby's Country Inn, 20419 Devonshire St., Chatsworth; (818) 718-0433. Lunch  from 11:30 a.m to 2:30 p.m. Monday to Friday; dinner from 5 to 9:30 p.m. daily.  Full bar. Parking lot. All major credit cards. Dinner for two, food only, $25  to $40.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Heseltine urges drive for exports MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that he intended to invite British companies to take part in a new and challenging export drive this autumn, through seconding 100 of their staff to his department to design, promote and lead the move. 'It has never been more urgent that we as a nation - public and private sector together - strive for that tantalising prize of export-led growth which has eluded us,' he said. He also promised the launch this autumn of 15 'one-stop shops' as a step in the DTI's efforts to make business advisory services more user-friendly. The aim is to bring together services offered by local organisations such as chambers of commerce and Training and Enterprise Councils into unified and convenient advice centres. The 15 'prototypes' will be chosen from proposals put to the the DTI, in a way similar to the City Challenge process through which councils compete for government funding. The aim is to extend the scheme to all major cities. The first head of the DTI for several years to believe that government should have an industrial strategy, Mr Heseltine unashamedly set out the role of the department in supporting British companies through research and development, training, regional grants and advisory services. 'We will endorse no moaner's charter, but where industry argues a good case we will support them - in Whitehall, in Brussels - anywhere and everywhere where it is proper for us to do so.' His comments followed a very short debate in which, nonetheless, speakers expressed heartfelt concern about the fate of Britain's manufacturing base.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview granted to our reporters today,  sociology expert Alin Teodorescu commented on the results of the  first public opinion poll conducted by the Institute for  Marketing and Public Opinion Polling within the program [words  indistinct] 1994.    The areas surveyed by the poll were political options, the  popularity and notoriety of the principal Romanian political  personalities, the standard of living and quality of life, the  economic and social policy of the government, and mass media  consumption.    The poll was conducted among a representative sample of  1,100  persons with a margin of error of 3 percent.    The question referring to the direction in which our country  is heading is a question that is usually included in all  questionnaires examining the current problems of countries and  it is meant to establish the mood among the population at the  time of the poll.    In the years 1990, 1991, and 1992, Romania seemed to be the  most optimistic country in the world, as 70-80 percent of the  population believed that the country was heading in a very good  direction. Currently, things seem to be getting back to normal,  Teodorescu emphasized, as, according to international standards,  it is normal that the majority of the population should be  dissatisfied.    Regarding the quality of life, the things the Romanians are  dissatisfied about are quite clear, and they refer to the lack  of cleanliness of streets and public places, the way in which  local administration bodies exert their duties, the level of  incomes, and political life. In that context, the performance  of Parliament and the government are considered to be very low.    Referring to the mass media, Teodorescu said that there is  only one daily that really has a nationwide circulation,  covering the whole territory, and that is EVENIMENTUL ZILEI.  Local dailies rank second. The publications further down the  list are ADEVARUL, ROMANIA LIBERA, and GAZETA SPORTURILOR. The  first channel of the Romanian Television has an audience of 85  percent. The first channel of Bucharest Radio Network has an  audience of 71 percent, followed by the programs of its local  radio studios with an audience of 29 percent, and by the local  cable television programs. Foreign radio networks and private  radio networks have not gained as much in popularity as was  expected.    Regarding the popularity of political personalities, for the  first time ever the Emil Constantinescu [Democratic Convention  of Romania chairman]-[President] Ion Iliescu twosome has been  surpassed in popularity by the speaker of the Chamber of  Deputies, Adrian Nastase, who was favored by 55 percent of the  persons polled. He is followed by Emil Constantinescu with 45  percent, President Ion Iliescu with 44 percent, Petre Roman  [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front chairman] with 41  percent, Corneliu Coposu [National Peasant Christian-Democratic  Party chairman] with 39 percent, and [Civic Alliance Party  Chairman] Nicolae Manolescu with 33 percent.    Regarding the political parties for which the persons polled  would cast their votes, the parties belonging to the Democratic  Convention of Romania are heading the list with 37 percent,  followed by the Social Democracy Party of Romania with 24  percent, and the National Romanian Unity Party with 6 percent.  The question intended to establish the polled persons'  readiness to participate in an election was answered  affirmatively by 80 percent, which proves that there is an  interest in political life and a conviction that voting is  important for the way Romania will look in the future.</p>

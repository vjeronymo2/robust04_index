"Being very divided, we can hardly overcome the crisis  today", he said.    Hryb was elected to the post of speaker on Friday to replace  Stanislav Shushkevich, ousted by parliament.    The chairman-elect stressed the need for reforming the  system  of state power and spoke in favour of presidency in Belarus. In  his opinion, it would be reasonable to choose a new president  first and then elect a new parliament.    Calling himself a staunch advocate of his republic's  participation in CIS collective security system, Hryb underlined  that "it's too early to speak about Belarus pure neutrality" now  when there is a contingent of troops from a neighboring state  (meaning Russia - IF) in Belarus." He explained that Minsk and  Moscow were bound by accords according to which the withdrawal  of Russian troops from Belarus would proceed "during certain  time."    Hryb declared that his election would keep the republic's  former policy toward Russia intact, nor would it affect plans to  integrate the monetary systems of the two countries and set up a  firm economic alliance.    He favorably assessed Kebich's activity as Premier and gave  him credit for bringing the economies of Belarus and Russia  together.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report A CHANGE of sentiment brought a general rise in base metals prices on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. ALUMINIUM moved back to the highs, reacting to confirmation, after early doubts, that the giant Tajikistan aluminium smelter was all but closed. The cash price closed at Dollars 1,199 as tonne, up Dollars 17.50 on the day. ZINC lost some of its early gains after Germany's Metallgesellschaft denied it had production problems, but cash metal closed Dollars 9 higher at Dollars 1,082 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Argentine insurer's issue cleared THE ARGENTINE parliament has given the go-ahead for the privatisation of the Caja Nacional de Ahorro y Seguro. The Caja, the largest insurance company in Argentina with a 13 per cent market share, is the latest of a number of companies to be offered for sale by the government since it began an ambitious privatisation programme in August 1989. Kleinwort Benson, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, together with its local partner, Harteneck Lopez, have been retained to advise on the sale, which is expected to go ahead as soon as March next year. Kleinwort has been involved in other Argentine privatisations in the energy sector including the sale of Gas del Estado, but this is its first venture in the financial services area. Mr John Williams, of Kleinwort Benson, said that the government was seeking to sell a majority stake of between 50 and 60 per cent of a new holding company, which would in turn own the Caja's insurance and banking businesses. The government is likely to be looking for possibly as much as one-and-a-half times these assets, added Mr Williams. Caja's net assets are currently estimated at between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m. Companies in North America, Germany, and France had already expressed signs of interest, said Mr Williams, while Mapfre, the large Spanish company which already has strong Latin American subsidiaries, could also be a bidder. The Caja sells annual life, motor and general insurance. Annual premiums in the year to June 30 amounted to Dollars 503m. Its commercial and savings banks had over Dollars 566m in deposits at the end of June. At present, the company sells simple term life insurance products, but prospects for life business could be transformed by new pensions legislation planned for next year which will permit the provision of private pensions. The life industry in neighbouring Chile grew strongly in the 1980s following similar legal changes. The Caja also has good distribution with a network of 42 branches and 12 agencies. It employs 3,064 people, of whom 1,972 work in insurance and 1,092 in banking. Argentina also plans to sell off the nationalised reinsurance company Instituto Nacional de Reasseguros (Inder). probably next year.</p>

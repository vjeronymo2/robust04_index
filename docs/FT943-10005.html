			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / People: Leahy flies higher at Airbus Industrie - Names in the News Airbus Industrie has appointed an American to head its commercial activities at a time when the European aircraft manufacturing consortium is seeking to increase its market share at the expense of its bigger US rival Boeing, writes Paul Betts. The appointment of John Leahy as the European consortium's new senior vice-president commercial also reflects the gradual transformation of Airbus into a more commercially driven enterprise. 'It is a sign of a certain maturity in the 20 year old Airbus system,' said a senior Airbus executive. 'It shows that senior jobs are not awarded on the basis of an individual's passport and you don't have to be a national of one of the four European partner countries to be appointed to a top job at Airbus,' he added. Although Leahy is the second American to be appointed to the top sales job at Airbus, senior vice president positions have in the past tended to reflect a delicate balance of the four Airbus partner countries - France, Germany, the UK and Spain. Leahy is replacing Charles Masefield, a British Aerospace executive who took over the top Airbus commercial position only five months ago. Masefield is stepping down following his nomination as the next head of the UK Government Defence Sales Export Organisation. Leahy is described by colleagues as a 'street fighter' who has come up the ranks at Airbus. He joined the European consortium from Piper Aircraft in 1985 as marketing director of the group's North American division. The 44-year-old Leahy became president of the North American division in 1992.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy welcomes larger-than-expected interest rate cut ITALY WAS encouraged yesterday by the weekend's interest rate cut, but Wall Street's sharp fall on Friday subdued most bourses from the outset, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN was lifted by Sunday's full percentage point cut in the Bank of Italy's official discount rate to 11.5 per cent. The market had expected a reduction of only half a point, so the larger-than-expected cut was viewed as boding well for the June trading account, which starts on Thursday. The Comit index rose 4.08 to 581.24 in volume estimated at L150bn after Friday's thin L115bn, bloated yesterday by activity related to the expiry of monthly options. Italcementi jumped L670 or 3.2 per cent to L21,500 on better-than-expected 1990 consolidated net profits of L206bn, up from L170.3bn, although analysts suspected that the rise was helped by extraordinary items. The share was also boosted by news of a L60bn share buy-back programme over the next 18 months which came as a surprise. FRANKFURT was depressed by rumours that Mr Karl Otto Pohl, Bundesbank president, would resign, by the drop in popularity of the ruling CDU, and by a leaked McKinsey report which was said to be negative on German economic prospects. Volume slid again, from DM3.4bn to DM3bn, as the FAZ index lost 5.09 to 680.67 and the DAX closed 9.73 lower at 1,610.90. It was a day for dealers rather than investors, said Mr James Cornish at County NatWest, who added that Frankfurt was recognising that its outperformance in April had not made sense, in terms of share price valuation or economic prospects. There were individual windows to east German recovery prospects, he noted. Siemens Nixdorf, up DM13 last Friday, rose another DM7 to DM259, turnover in the stock growing from DM18m to DM49m as attention focused on April orders for data processing equipment. West German civil servants are being paid 'head money' to go east, and equipment is being bought for their new east German locations. Elsewhere, turnover in Continental fell from DM50m to DM25m as the shares lost DM6 to DM197 on profit-taking. PARIS drifted lower in quiet trading worth about FFr1.6bn, with the CAC 40 index falling 15.82 or 0.9 per cent to 1,834.45. Among weaker blue chips, Alcatel Alsthom fell FFr12 to FFr588 on 229,510 shares. Schneider, the electrical equipment group, closed FFr10 higher at FFr762, after reaching FFr767 earlier, on volume of 110,375 shares. Investors were relieved at the removal of uncertainty, following the acceptance of Schneider's bid for Square D of the US. Among the big movers, Canal Plus, the television company, gained FFr35 or 3.4 per cent to FFr1,070 on 31,450 shares. Its rival, TF1, was suspended briefly owing to an order imbalance, before closing FFr10.50 down at FFr285.50. Suez eased FFr2.20 to FFr349. The news that the financial holding company could open up the capital of Banque Indosuez was fairly well received, said one analyst, amid speculation that Suez could be considering an acquisition to improve its European merchant banking network. MADRID's general index edged higher before today's inflation news, rising 0.51 to 285.22. Turnover was moderate, but fell to about Pta15bn from Friday's heavy Pta28.9bn. Focsa, which is due to merge with another construction company, dropped Pta260 to Pta14,140. AMSTERDAM fell at the opening, and failed to recover for the rest of the session. The CBS tendency index closed down 0.5 at 94.4 in quiet trading worth Fl 480.8m. Royal Dutch led the losers, shedding Fl 3 to Fl 160.70 after setting an all-time high of Fl 165.10 on Friday. The oil company reports its first-quarter results on Thursday. Unilever, which reports its quarterly results on Friday, fell 80 cents to Fl 158.40. OSLO recouped an early loss to close at its third consecutive year's high. The all-share index gained 2.76 to 521.46. STOCKHOLM was depressed by weak overseas markets and profit-taking in Astra, the pharmaceutical company. The Affarsvarlden General index lost 6.4 to 1,037.5 in turnover of SKr315m, down from SKr325m. Astra free B shares fell SKr9 to SKr575 before the company's first-quarter profits announcement, which came after the bourse closed and were better than expected. ZURICH fell in low volume, the Credit Suisse index slipping 3.8 to 541.7. Slightly lower interest rates gave some support. In a relatively firm engineering sector, Schindler registered shares rose SFr60 to SFr1,095 before today's annual news conference. BRUSSELS, after its holidays last Thursday and Friday, was dominated by Petrofina, the oil company, which rose BFr200 or 1.7 per cent to BFr11,800 with 25,420 shares changing hands, or nearly 30 per cent of the BFr939m market turnover. The Bel 20 index closed 4.68 higher at 1,179.39. After hours, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert repeated that it would probably increase its 21 per cent Petrofina stake.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 13                            Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close  1121.90  1122.43  1123.87  1124.60  1125.18  1126.05  1125.99  1125.32             Day's High   1128.20      Day's Low   1121.90         May 10     May 9         May 8       May 7      May 3        1130.52    1125.62*      1119.87     1125.75    1129.77  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) * Indicative.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Email and Indonesian group in joint venture Email, the Australian white goods and industrial products company, said yesterday that it was setting up a joint venture with three shareholders of Indonesia's Agro Manunggal group, which owns PT Budidharma, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Budidharma is a large distributor of steel mini-mill products in Indonesia, and this represents Email's first move into the region. The joint venture company, which will be 60 per cent-owned by Email's Bisalloy subsidiary and 40 per cent by the Indonesian partners, aims to develop a market in Indonesia for quenched and tempered steel. This higher-strength steel plate could be used in the construction, defence and heavy mining equipment manufacturing markets. Initially, the product will be imported from Bisalloy and the joint venture company will act as a distributor. However, Mr John Hanna, Email's managing director, said the plan was to set up local manufacturing operations once sales of the product had built up. He forecast that this could happen within two to three years.</p>

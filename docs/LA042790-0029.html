			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO RABBIS HAVE ISRAEL TIED IN KNOTS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: AT THE HEART OF LABOR'S INABILITY TO PUT TOGETHER A COALITION IS THE  COUNTRY'S DEEP DIVISION OVER ITS IDENTITY.  </P> <P> Casual observers of Israeli politics must find this baffling: Two elderly  rabbis -- one has never set foot in Israel, neither has held political office  -- have prevented Shimon Peres from forming a government and pursuing the peace  process with the Palestinians. Even more baffling is that the two rabbis, Rabbi  Shach, 93, and Rabbi Schneerson, 88, hold diametrically opposite views on the  peace process and have been bitter enemies for years. What unites them,  paradoxically, is their condemnation of Zionism and aversion to the Labor  Party.  </P> <P> The source of the two sages' power is, of course, the influence they wield over  Israel's ultra-orthodox Jewish political parties. Holding 13 of 120 Knesset  seats, these parties are crucial for the formation of Israel's next coalition  government.  </P> <P> Rabbi Shach, head of the Ponivezh yeshiva, is the spiritual leader of two  political parties: the mostly Sephardic Shas, with six seats in the Knesset,  and the Ashkenazi Torah Flag, with two. Rabbi Schneerson -- the Lubavitcher  Rebbe -- heads the Brooklyn-based Hasidic sect of Chabad. In the 1988 Israeli  elections, Schneerson supported the third ultra-orthodox party, Agudat Yisrael,  which helped it increase its Knesset membership from two to five seats.  </P> <P> Many Israelis would like to diminish the orthodox parties' power by changing  the electoral system. One of the two major parties, Labor or Likud, would then  be better able to govern effectively. Changing the political rules, however,  would not do away with the fundamental social reality that underlies the  current political deadlock: Israeli society is deeply divided over the  definition of its own collective identity.  </P> <P> When it was founded at the end of the 19th Century, the Zionist movement aimed  to present a secular, national alternative to the traditional Jewish way of  life. But to appeal to the Jewish masses, particularly in Eastern Europe,  Zionism had to borrow its symbols from traditional Jewish culture. Thus, the  Star of David, the menorah, the idea of aliyah (pilgrimage) to Zion and many  other religious symbols were infused with a secular and national content.  </P> <P> While borrowing the symbols of traditional Judaism, Zionism could not ignore  the religious institutions that still commanded the allegiance of the vast  majority of Jews. Since orthodox Jewry was largely anti-Zionist, orthodox  groups willing to cooperate with the Zionist movement were granted a privileged  status within it.  </P> <P> By the mid-1930s, the Labor Zionist movement was the dominant force in Zionism.  It carried on the policy of trying to accommodate the representatives of  orthodox Jewry, and for the same reasons. Thus, when the Israeli government  under Ben Gurion nationalized Israel's schools in the early 1950s, only two of  the previously existing systems were allowed to continued to operate: the  independent system of Agudat Yisrael and one under the de-facto control of the  National Religious Party.  </P> <P> The religious school systems, and a whole network of state-subsidized yeshivot  (many of whose students have been exempt from mandatory military service) have  been promoting a principle of collective identity based exclusively on Jewish  ethnicity. According to this principle, the only meaningful political  distinction is that between Jews and non-Jews.  </P> <P> In contrast, official Israeli identity as defined by the state is much more  ambiguous. While Israel is considered, by law, to be a Jewish state, Israeli  citizenship rights can be enjoyed by non-Jews as well. Thus, the 18% of Israeli  citizens who are Arab are supposed to have all the rights and privileges  accorded to Jews.  </P> <P> The clash between these two principles of identity is evident now in Jerusalem,  where Jewish settlers, at the behest of government officials, have been living  in the Christian quarter since Easter week. Israel's Supreme Court Thursday  ordered them evicted.  </P> <P> In recent years, the Jewish principle of identity has been gaining ground, for  two important reasons: The continuation and increasing intensity of the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict have resulted in greater solidarity among Jews and  greater hostility toward Arabs; and Sephardic Jews, who have been economically,  politically and culturally barred from the mainstream of Israeli society, have  responded to this exclusion by reasserting their Jewish identity.  </P> <P> Disaffected Sephardic Jews have flocked to Likud, the former opposition. As a  result, the party, whose leadership is no more religiously observant than  Labor's, has become, through its rank-and-file members, the chief carrier of  the Jewish principle of identity.  </P> <P> What distances the religious parties from Labor and unites them with Likud,  then, is a much deeper schism than the ones usually recognized in Israeli  politics. It has to do with the very definition of the society's collective  identity. It transcends such issues as territories vs. peace, Sephardi vs.  Ashkenazi, Zionist vs. non-Zionist.  </P> <P> Although Rabbi Shach has frequently stated his preference for peace over  territory, he has instructed his disciples not to form a coalition with Peres.  In doing so, he alluded to the Labor Zionist movement's historical disdain for  traditional Jewish values. Similarly, Agudat Yisrael, which initially supported  Peres, insisted that he forge a majority among Jewish members of the Knesset.  When this proved impossible, given Rabbi Shach's position, Peres' efforts to  form a Labor-led government were doomed.  </P> <P> The Israeli electorate is about equally divided between a Likud-led and a  Labor-led bloc, with an additional 15% supporting religious parties. If the  strength of religious parties is reduced through electoral reform, this will  not break the deadlock between Labor and Likud. Even if an American-style  presidential system is introduced, the president will still have to work with a  deadlocked Knesset, which would prove an impossible task.  </P> <P> Israelis must decide whether they want to live in an open, democratic and  forward-looking society, or whether they want a Jewish ghetto to be  reconstructed in the Middle East. Until this decision is made, the political  deadlock will continue. And no amount of political or electoral manipulation  can change this reality.  </P></p>

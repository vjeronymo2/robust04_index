The 170-man unit was to leave for Somalia to join the  80-member advance team that left last month.    The replacements will take over duties from the first unit,  dispatched last summer as Korea's first participation in a U.N.  Peacekeeping Operation. The Army Engineering Unit is mainly in  charge of road repairs and construction.</p>

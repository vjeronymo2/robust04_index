			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Fresh twist in suncare row THE HIGH street battle over suncare products took a fresh turn yesterday when Boots, Britain's largest chemists chain, withdrew its application for an interim injunction against Superdrug, its smaller discount rival, Guy de Jonquieres writes. Boots sought the injunction last month to prevent Superdrug selling a range of private-label products called Solait, which Boots claimed could be confused with its own Soltan brand. Boots said it had withdrawn the application because it did not have time to respond to evidence introduced by Superdrug shortly before yesterday's court hearing. Superdrug claimed the application had been dropped because its evidence refuted market research submitted to the court by Boots. Superdrug also said Boots' lawyers had sought to have the research withdrawn. The two companies agreed that Boots would pay its own legal costs to date, regardless of the outcome of a full trial. Boots said it still intended to proceed to a full trial.</p>

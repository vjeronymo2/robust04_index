			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Nippon Steel buys chip maker NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, is close to acquiring a 60 per cent stake in NMB Semiconductor, an ailing Japanese electronics company, in a deal that highlights the extensive restructuring under way in Japan's manufacturing industry. The steel company confirmed negotiations with Minebea, the world's leading maker of miniature bearings, which founded NMBS in 1984 and still holds 60 per cent. The deal is estimated to be worth Y30bn (Dollars 240m). NMBS is listed on Tokyo's over-the-counter market. The Japan Securities Dealers' Association suggested that yesterday it will investigate recent trading patterns in NMBS shares, which have risen from Y425,000 to Y958,000 since December 22 on volumes 40 times larger than in early December. Trading in the shares was suspended yesterday. NMBS is a maker of memory chips, which have suffered sharp falls in price over the past two years in an increasingly competitive international market. It reported a loss of Y12.4bn in the year ended September and forecast a loss of Y4bn this year. Minebea has transferred managers to the company and pumped in fresh funds over the past few years, but the bearings maker has been badly bruised by the collapse of stock prices and the failure of several diversification projects. Last year, Minebea reported a consolidated loss of Y13.6bn. For Nippon Steel, the acquisition of NMBS would broaden its electronics expertise after initial failure in producing personal computers. Several other Japanese steel makers, including Kawasaki Steel, Kobe Steel and NKK, have begun semiconductor production, but the projects, until now, have been generally unsuccessful. Another struggling Japanese chip maker, Oki Electric, is reviewing production plans. There were reports in the Japanese press last year that Intel, the US electronics maker, which has a partnership with NMBS in the production of flash memory chips, was negotiating with Minebea, but the US company said yesterday it is not bidding. Nippon Steel suggested that a new partnership may be formed with another Japanese electronics company, such as Hitachi, to ensure the revival of NMBS. Japanese retailers, Page 18</p>

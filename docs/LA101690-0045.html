			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHESS GAME ADJOURNED; EARLY KASPAROV MOVES STUN EXPERTS  </P> <P> Chess champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov resumed their  grudge match Monday, but the game was adjourned for the night after nobody won  within the alloted time.  </P> <P> The game, which is to be resumed today, was the third in the championship  match.  </P> <P> Kasparov, 27, the highest-rated player in the history of chess, leads 1 1/2  points to 1/2 points in the 24-game title match against Karpov, 39, whom he  unseated as world champion in 1985.  </P> <P> Reuters reported that Kasparov's opening ploy involved sacrificing a rook for a  bishop. While grandmasters were shaking their heads in bewilderment over that  move, the champion stunned them further by sacrificing his queen -- the game's  most powerful piece -- for two lesser pieces.  </P> <P> In the adjourned position, Karpov has a king, rook, bishop, knight and four  pawns. Kasparov has a king, two bishops, a knight and five pawns. These are the  moves for the third game in algebraic notation. Karpov (white) and Kasparov  (black):  </P> <P> 1. d4/Nf6; 2. c4/g6; 3.

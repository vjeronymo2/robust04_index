			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 6 (AFP) -- Eleven French aid workers  held by the Bosnian Serbs for a month are to go on trial next  week accused of arms smuggling on behalf of the mainly Moslem  Bosniam army, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said Friday  [6 May]. Karadzic told a French official at the Bosnian Serb  headquarters in Pale near Sarajevo the 11 would be tried  together, according to a French source. (In Paris, the French  foreign ministry confirmed the meeting with Karadzic and again  called for the volunteer workers' release.)    The Serbs had earlier indicated only three of the men with  the non-governmental organisation Premiere Urgence (First Aid)  would face trial on Sunday while the other eight would be  released. The 11 are being held near the Serb barracks at  Lukavica, an important Serb military base just five kilometres  (three miles) outside the Bosnian capital. French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe has said the aid workers are the victims of  Serb "manipulation" and described the 11 as "hostages." Paris  has sent foreign ministry secretary general Bertrand Dufourcq to  Belgrade to demand the workers be released, as it believes the  Serbian government could hold the key to their fate.</p>

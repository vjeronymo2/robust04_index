			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: AST loss forecast prompts PC concerns A warning from AST Research, the world's fifth largest personal computer maker, that it expected to report a net loss this quarter has prompted increased concerns about a possible slowing of growth in PC sales. Computer sector stocks declined, reflecting Wall Street's nervousness about the outlook for PC sales. At the close of trade yesterday, AST was down sharply by Dollars 4 15/16 at Dollars 13 1/16 , a 27 per cent decline. Compaq Computer, the PC market leader, was off Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 34 7/8 , while Apple Computer shares declined by Dollars 1 3/16 to Dollars 35 and IBM was trading at Dollars 67 7/8 , down Dollars  3/4 . AST said delays in new products and sharp price cuts by Compaq, IBM and Digital Equipment would result in a loss for the first quarter ending October 2 and break-even results in the second quarter. 'We have encountered several unanticipated product development delays, component constraints and delivery issues,' said Mr Safi Qureshey, chairman and chief executive. Price cuts by competitors have forced AST to make 'significant price reductions on existing products to protect market share, as well as new product introductions which will have to be priced more aggressively than originally planned', he added. A month ago, AST reported record results for fiscal 1994, claiming sales growth of four times the industry average. Revenues for the year were Dollars 2.4bn, up from Dollars 1.4bn in 1993. Net income was Dollars 53.5m, or Dollars 1.59 a share, compared with a net loss after restructuring charges of Dollars 53.7m or Dollars 1.72 a share in 1993. Rumours that Compaq, the PC market leader, was trimming orders for components also fuelled concerns about the outlook for sales. But Dataquest, a market research firm, yesterday reiterated its forecast that worldwide PC sales will reach 45m units this year, a 16.3 per cent increase over 1993.</p>

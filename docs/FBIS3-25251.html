The leadership of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the  Pan-Africanist Congress, the Democratic Party, as well as  representatives of Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, were involved in  the discussions, which took place at Midrand.    A short while ago the parties said at a news conference that  they consider the double ballot paper as a fundamental,  nonnegotiable right. An action committee has been established  to arrange a meeting with President F. W. de K lerk before  Monday, at which the matter would be discussed further.    According to the negotiators, other steps could be applied  to  ensure a double ballot paper, should the current efforts fail.  Earlier today the discussions had to be interrupted when a bomb  threat was received, but the police were unable to find a bomb.</p>

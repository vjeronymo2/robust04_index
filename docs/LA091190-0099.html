			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> SCHROEDER GETS A PASSING MARK  </P> <P> How does an offensive line that did not allow a sack of Jay Schroeder in five  exhibition games allow Schroeder to get dumped five times against a wounded,  three-man Denver pass rush? Merely a case of bad technique, Coach Art Shell  said. .  </P> <P> "I know we're going to get better about it," he said. "I know the players don't  like it. They don't like to see their quarterbacks get touched at all."  </P> <P> Is Schroeder better or worse than he looked Sunday, when he completed nine of  18 passes for 118 yards and one interception?  </P> <P> "I thought Jay played pretty good except for a couple of throws," Shell said.  </P> <P> One of those was an interception in the first quarter, when Schroeder tried to  drill a pass to Willie Gault while rolling to his right. "The guy (Tyrone  Braxton) stepped right in front," Schroeder said. "You just can't do that. You  can't beat the team by turning the ball over."  </P> <P> Schroeder also was victimized by some dropped passes, too, one long toss in  particular that Tim Brown couldn't handle.  </P> <P> In other words, Schroeder's job is safe for now. Steve Beuerlein, who didn't  sign until Sept. 3, received a two-week roster exemption and didn't dress  against Denver.  </P> <P> Shell wouldn't say whether Beuerlein would be activated for Sunday's game  against Seattle.  </P> <P> Marcus Allen update: The Raiders' all-time leading rusher played more than  expected Sunday. He made a brief appearance in the second quarter but was  forced to leave the game after suffering a gash that required 10 stitches over  his right eye.  </P> <P> Allen returned in the second half and gained 28 yards in his first run of the  season. He finished with 47 yards, eight carries and one tender sore right  eyebrow.  </P> <P> Allen said Shell had told him during the week that he would play in the second  half.  </P> <P> "I wasn't surprised at all," Allen said. "There's nothing I can do. The coaches  make the decisions. I try to be a team player and take advantage of the times I  get to play. . . . I don't think I have anything to prove."  </P> <P> Veteran free safety Vann McElroy ended his summerlong holdout Monday and signed  a contract with the Raiders. No terms were disclosed. He will receive a  two-week roster exemption. . . . Shell said the team will probably not keep  three quarterbacks once Beuerlein is activated, either this week or next. . . .  Shell said rookie Garry Lewis will remain the starter at left corner over Terry  McDaniel. McDaniel, reportedly slowed by a hamstring pull, played only in pass  defense coverages Sunday and scored the game-winning touchdown on a 42-yard  fumble return.CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

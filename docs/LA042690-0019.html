			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RELUCTANT NOVICE FLOWER ARRANGING;  </P> <P> ALL THUMBS;  </P> <P> MR. OTA'S CORSAGE CLASS LEARNS TO TIE A BOW, BUT A NEWCOMER JUST GETS A CASE OF  THE TITTERS  </P> <P> They all laughed when you sat down to learn flower arranging.  </P> <P> Not overt belly-laughs, but tiny titters, circulating like so many aphids in a  Ventura College classroom. Around the room sat two dozen aspiring arranging  women.  </P> <P> The room was cool, and stood hard by the college greenhouse. The women, 20ish  to 60ish but dexterous to the last one, were there to listen and practice as  florist Ron Ota explained the subtleties of corsage construction.  </P> <P> So were you. You, however, had no knowledge of flowers and only limited  hand-to-eye coordination. The sure-fingered women around the room on this  Tuesday night were on their fourth installment of a six-session course. Hence  the titters, which would multiply as the evening progressed.  </P> <P> "Tonight, we're going to do corsages," said Ota, a compact man with a curly  perm and mustache who spends most of his time running the Flower Power Florist  shop on North Las Posas Road in Camarillo. "But to do corsages, you have to  know bows, so we're going to start with bows. Take 10 of the wires, please."  </P> <P> The wires -- 24-inch sections of green metal -- came around, and everyone took  a share.  </P> <P> "Number 24 Wire," scribbled Renee Clark of Ventura in her notebook. She had  come on the recommendation of a friend, and because her son has a prom coming  up. Soon she and the rest were wrestling with short sections of green floral  tape, trying to wrap them delicately around their wires.  </P> <P> "It's something that they've always wanted to do but they've never done," Ota  said later about his students.  </P> <P> Over the length of the course, they were scheduled to learn about vase  arrangements, corsages and centerpieces, among other things. Maybe because of  this countryside's agricultural character, Ota said, flower-friendliness seems  to run high in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "Here, a lot of people grow stuff in their yards," he said, "and they want to  use some of the stuff that they grow, rather than just cutting the flowers and  dropping them in a vase."  </P> <P> Ota, a florist since 1964, said he started teaching a single course in 1982,  "and I'd have to really fight to get 15 or 20 people. Now I get 30 or 40."  </P> <P> He offers courses occasionally through community services programs at Oxnard  and Ventura colleges, as well as the county public school system, usually  charging $35 per six-session course, plus $6 to $12 weekly for materials.  </P> <P> "He has a really good reputation," said Renee Clark.  </P> <P> "This is the class in the area," said Terri Campbell of Ojai. "Everyone knows  that this is the class to take."  </P> <P> In fact, it may be the only one there is. Employees at six different florist's  shops around the county knew of no flower-arranging courses outside those Ota  offers.  </P> <P> Ota started an advanced course at Oxnard College today, and is tentatively  scheduled to lead a beginner's class in the community services division of  Oxnard College starting June 21. Registration opens after release of the summer  schedule next month.  </P> <P> So this was a rare and valuable experience, all this tugging, twisting and  tying. And eventually, there were even roses and some white flowers with floppy  petals, which you were informed, were cymbidiums.  </P> <P> "I'm flunking bow," muttered a pessimist across the room.  </P> <P> "This is supposed to be a stress-free class," complained another.  </P> <P> "My hand doesn't like doing that," said Clark after a few minutes of ribbon  work. But by then her hands were dancing that same mysterious little dance that  Ota's had when he demonstrated in front of the room.  </P> <P> Your hands, accustomed to tasks no more demanding than the feeding of parking  meters, were less certain. Adding a ribbon to this equation only made matters  more difficult.  </P> <P> Terri Campbell, a back-yard gardener who had driven down from Ojai for the  course, looked on with alarm.  </P> <P> "He'll come around and help us," she said gently. "It looks pretty complicated,  but. . . . "  </P> <P> But nothing. It was complicated. And most of the others had already spent a  fair amount of time in the company of flowers. When Ota had asked for a show of  hands earlier in the course, some had even expressed interest in floristry as a  line of work.  </P> <P> There were others who had hidden advantages. Lorraine Yzquierdo of Carpinteria  and Betty Hewitt of Ventura both sculpted their flowers with precision and  grace -- then confessed that by day they do detail work for a manufacturer of  surgical implants in Goleta. Dexterity was their business.  </P> <P> And dexterity, as the two-hour class neared its conclusion, was increasingly  elusive. When the instructor made his final rounds, you raised a gnarled wad of  ribbon and flower.  </P> <P> "No," said Ota. "No, no, no." And in 20 seconds he had stripped down and  rebuilt the wad into something very like a corsage. He didn't do this to any of  the others.  </P> <P> "Well," said Carolee Tibbitts of Ojai, as classmates filed past to preserve  their corsages in plastic containers, "at least now you can tie a good bow."  </P> <P> The evening could have ended there, on an optimistic note. But then Terri  Campbell, who had been paying closer attention, had to interrupt.  </P> <P> "No," she said. "He cannot tie a good bow."  </P> <P>  This week's Reluctant Novice is Christopher Reynolds .... Is there something  you've always wanted to try? Let the Reluctant Novice try it for you.

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Nato troops come under German law GERMANY and its North Atlantic Treaty allies which have troops stationed in the country yesterday finalised a deal to bring them more directly under German law. The agreement deal is intended as an important symbolic gesture by the Nato allies to remove any remaining suggestion that the troops are 'occupation forces' in a defeated Germany. Although foreign troops have been broadly subject to German law in recent years, this deal tightens loopholes preventing them from operating above the law of the land. It has been negotiated over the past 16 months, at Germany's request, after Britain, France, the US and the former Soviet Union gave the go-ahead for German unification in the so-called 'two-plus-four' agreement. Some exemptions to German law are still provided for in the agreement, but the basic principle is that it will generally apply to troops stationed in the country, according to officials involved in the talks. Sensitive areas in the negotiations included protection of the environment, and the application of strict German labour laws to civilian employees of the allied forces. The German Lander, in particular, have been keen to tighten the rules controlling military exercises in environmentally sensitive areas. In a separate deal initialled yesterday, Britain, Canada and Germany agreed to terminate the treaty which allows training exercises on the Luneburg heath near Hanover. Environmentalists have been campaigning to stop destructive tank training exercises there, and they will now cease from July 31 1994, officials said.</p>

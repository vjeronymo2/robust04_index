			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, oxygenate that is added to a refiner's or importer's gasoline or blendstock downstream of the refinery or import facility may be included in the refiner's or importer's compliance calculations only if the refiner or importer is able to demonstrate with certainty that the oxygenate has been added to that party's gasoline. Provisions are included in the final rule for the manner in which refiners and importers must make this demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oxygenate blended downstream may be counted by a refiner or importer if the refiner or importer demonstrates that it performed the oxygenate blending. In addition, the oxygenate may be counted if the blending is conducted by a blender with whom the refiner or importer has a contract that specifies procedures intended to ensure proper blending, and the refiner or importer monitors the downstream blending operation through audits, inspections, and sampling and testing of the gasoline produced at the blending operation. These downstream oxygenate blending provisions are discussed more fully below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Refiners and importers also have the option of determining compliance for exhaust NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions performance either with or without the inclusion of oxygenates provided that the baseline NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  performance is determined in the same manner. Refiners and importers may elect to switch one time under certain conditions which are discussed more fully in Section VIII of the Regulatory Impact Analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enforcement of the anti-dumping standards under this rule consists of a combination of mechanisms to monitor compliance with the regulations, including: refiner/importer sampling and testing of gasoline produced or imported; record keeping; reporting; annual audits by refiners and importers; and Agency audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule specifies the manner in which penalties will be determined for violations of the anti-dumping requirements of the final rule. These penalty provisions include calculations of the number of days of violation, and presumptions regarding the properties of gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the anti-dumping requirements in the final rule, certain refiners are also required to account for blendstocks that are produced. The principal policy reason for imposing blendstock tracking and accounting is that, unless proscribed, certain refiners will have an incentive to transfer blendstocks based on the differences in baselines that will exist. These differences thus could result in the transfer of the ``production'' of gasoline from a refinery with a more rigorous baseline to another refinery with a less rigorous baseline, through the transfer of blendstocks. This transfer-of-blendstocks concern is described more fully below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Refiners and importers are required to establish a baseline of the volume of certain specified blendstocks <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  produced and transferred to others, relative to the volume of gasoline produced (the ``blendstock-to-gasoline ratio''). This baseline is established by determining, for each calendar year 1990 through 1993, the volumes of blendstocks produced and transferred, the volumes of gasoline produced, and calculating the annual and four-year average blendstock-to-gasoline ratios. Refiners may include in baseline calculations only those volumes of blendstocks for which the refiner is able to demonstrate the blendstock was used in the production of gasoline. This baseline blendstock-to-gasoline ratio must be established using the baseline auditing procedures described in &sect;80.93.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The blendstock tracking requirements apply only to certain blendstocks that have properties that are ``dirtier'' than the 1990 Clean Air Act average fuel parameters for anti-dumping. Use of the term ``blendstock'' also means that tracking applies only to non-gasoline petroleum products that are used in the production of gasoline (see 40 CFR 80.2(s)). As a result, refiners and importers are not required to track non-gasoline petroleum products where the refiner or importer can demonstrate these products are used for a purpose other than gasoline blending.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning in 1995, refiners are required to determine the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for each calendar year compliance period. This compliance period ratio is then compared with the baseline ratio. During each year 1995 through 1997, the annual compliance period ratio is compared with the largest ratio of the individual annual baseline ratios. Beginning in 1998, the compliance period ratio will be the running four-year average of the annual ratios, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 81 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  instead of an annual ratio. This is then compared with the baseline four-year average ratio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 81 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  In 1998, the compliance period ratio consists of the average of the ratios for 1995 through 1998; in 1999, the compliance period ratio consists of the average of the ratios for 1996 through 1999; etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of both the annual comparisons before 1998, and the average comparisons beginning in 1998, if the compliance period ratio exceeds the baseline ratio by ten percent or more special blendstock accounting must be carried out by the refiner, unless certain exemptions are met or the refiner has been granted a waiver by EPA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 82 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These exceptions to blendstock accounting are discussed more fully below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 82 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  For example, if the largest baseline annual ratio for a refinery is 5%, and the 1995 ratio for that refinery is 10%, this increase would be 100%, and special blendstock accounting would be required for that refinery unless exempted for other reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a case where special blendstock accounting is required, the refiner must include the properties of all blendstocks produced in its compliance calculations for the two subsequent averaging periods. In addition, the refiner must notify any recipients of such ``accounted-for'' blendstocks that the downstream party may not include the properties in that party's calculations. The second and subsequent times that the compliance period ratio exceeds the ten percent threshold, special blendstock accounting is required for the four years subsequent to the second exceedance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

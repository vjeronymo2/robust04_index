			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Letter: Currency value based on edict not a stable measure of wealth Sir, Recent comparison of chocolate bars with currency (Observer, December 8, and Letters, December 10) reminds me, if memory holds, that the original FT article in 1981 sought seriously to examine the problem of maintaining a standard measure of wealth over the passage of time, given the unreliability (ie a tendency to inflation) of fiat money. 'Hours-worked' was one method explored; eg if the average industrial wage-earner needs to work fewer hours now to buy a given product than he did 10 years ago he may reliably be considered better off, irrespective of the number of pound notes in his pay packet. An alternative to 'hours-worked' was the Mars Bar, since it represented a constant basket of basic commodities: cocoa, sugar, paper etc. Though humorous, it parallels Prof Hayek's proposals for competing currencies based on convertibility against fixed baskets of a wide selection of staples. When ERM is exposed, in the same week, as inherently flawed, both by Mr Samuel Brittan and Herr Schlesinger, should we try to patch it up or seize the opportunity to institute a completely new, and extra- (not supra-) national monetary system? For, any monetary system which depends on value ascribed simply by the edict of governments to currencies, which intrinsically have zero value, is itself inherently flawed. The values of such currencies are legal and economic fictions based solely on confidence in the economic credentials of the governments concerned. With electoral self-interest, parties, personalities and policies changing year by year - and even hour by hour - common sense and history tell us the system cannot, long term, provide a stable measure nor store of wealth. Yet, like fruit and nut cases, we persist in believing in the black magic of the system. T Robinson, 13 Shenstone, 9-11 Culmington Road, Ealing, London W13 9NL</p>

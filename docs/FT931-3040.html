			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): VAT rules are simplified for triangular transactions - EC Trade This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. VAT simplification procedures will apply to some commercial transactions which involve traders from other member states of the European Community from August 1. These changes are for so-called 'triangular' transactions. These situations arise when commercial goods are supplied in a chain involving three traders located in different member states, but where physical delivery of the goods involves their movement direct from the first member state to the third; and goods installed or assembled in the UK by traders from other EC countries. The chancellor's intention is to give legal effect to a Community-wide scheme aimed at reducing the need for intermediate suppliers to register for VAT in the country where the goods are delivered. This is a measure that the British government had argued for strongly during the single market negotiations. The government's success in these talks in persuading the other EC countries to agree to this simplification was warmly welcomed by UK businesses. The opportunity has also been taken to introduce a similar arrangement for goods installed or assembled in the UK by overseas traders. This decision will reduce the need for such overseas traders to register in the UK. The new arrangements for triangular trade were part of the VAT simplification directive which was agreed by the Twelve only on December 14 last year. It was therefore too late to be included with the single market VAT changes which were announced by the chancellor in last year's budget. The new arrangements give legal effect to extra statutory concessions which have been applied administratively in the UK since the single market came into effect in January.</p>

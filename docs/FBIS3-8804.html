According to the approved proposal, Aero Prague Co. is to  eliminate all of its bank loans and thereby also the risk of  bankruptcy. In the final stage, only four subsidiaries will  remain in the Aero Holding--Aero Vodochody, Letov Praha,  Technometra Radotin, and the Research and Testing Aviation  Institute. The National Property Fund will keep 64.8 percent of  the holding shares. Aero will hold 53 percent stake in the  subsidiaries. The debt clearing will result from the  capitalization of the main creditors' claims. The Investicni a  Postovni Banka and CSOB [Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank] will  each purchase 10-percent shares of the holding subsidiaries at  70 percent of the nominal value, and the Konsolidacni banka 27  percent.    The tender for the purchase of majority stakes in Moravan  Otrokovice and Motorlet Jinonice is to be evaluated in the near  future. The Czech Frut Ovo Co. has offered $45 million for  Motorlet, and the Canadian firm Pratt &amp; Whitney has offered  $1  million cash, $10 million in the form of know-how and $14  million in investments. The same Frut Ovo has offered $800  million for Moravan, while Bata offered only know-how. If the  tender for Motorlet is not successful, a competition will be  announced. If the talks with the bidders for Moravan are not  successful. either, the Investicni a Postovni Banka will  purchase the company, and the proceeds will be used to pay the  Aero debts. A competition is also being considered for Let  Kunovice if a suitable foreign partner is not found.    Yesterday, the ministers also discussed the conditions for  the purchase of Czechoslovak Airlines shares from Air France Co.  by the Konsolidacni Banka. Minister Karel Dyba observed that  the purchase of the French company's stake will also be  discussed by the government later today, but he refused to  publish any additional information.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to military sources, on 1 and 2 March, the  U.S. imperialists flew pursuit-assault planes, vertical take-off  and landing assault planes, and electronic jamming planes from  their overseas bases in the skies over South Korea and conducted  a provocative joint aerial war exercise for northward invasion  with the puppets with the assistance of electronic jamming.    Prior to this war exercise, EA-6 electronic jamming planes  of  the 7th U.S. Fleet based in Japan and EH-60 electronic war  helicopters based in South Korea flew the skies over Yongwol,  Hoengsong, Paju, and Pochon and did full electronic jamming.  After this, in cooperation with formations of pursuit-assault  planes and vertical take-off and landing assault planes, which  had taken off from the U.S. overseas bases, fighter-bombers and  assault planes of the U.S. Air Forces occupying South Korea and  the puppet Air Force flew by surprise to areas, where electronic  jamming was on, and frantically conducted a bombing exercise  simulating a surprise strike against the northern half of the  Republic.    This reckless war exercise was conducted with the support of  the OA-10 observation plane [kwanchukki], and approximately 350  military planes of various sorts were mobilized in the war  exercise.    This game of fire was conducted for military planes of the  7th U.S. Fleet and air corps of the U.S. Air Forces occupying  South Korea and the puppet Air Force to improve their capability  to jointly launch surprise strikes for northward aggression with  the support of electronic jamming.    As incited by the U.S. imperialists, the South Korean  puppets  frantically conducted war exercises for northward invasion in a  frontline area close the DMZ.    On 2 March, large-caliber artillery units which are deployed  in Yulli-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County of South Korea, and  Hapsu-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province, fired tens of cannon  balls on areas close to the DMZ.    On 1 and 2 March, the armed villains of the puppet Armed  Forces who are based in combat camps in Nosang-ri and Chomwon-ri  of Paju County and Koang-ri of Yonchon County launched an attack  in the direction of the Military Demarcation Line and  frantically fired large-caliber machine guns and automatic  rifles at random.    On 1 March, formations of armed helicopters and transport  planes of the puppet Armed Forces flew the skies over frontline  areas in Yonchon, Pochon, and Hwachon and frantically conducted  an exercise to provide support to ground attack units and  airlift troops and equipment to frontline areas.    On 2 March, tens of transport planes of the puppet Armed  Forces conducted an exercise involving raids and special-purpose  airlifting operations in the skies over Yanggu County, Kangwon  Province, and promoted a warlike atmosphere.    The tension on the Korean peninsula is further aggravated,  because the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are  frantically kicking up futile war commotions against the  northern half of the Republic one after another.</p>

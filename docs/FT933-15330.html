			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Patten shakes up vocational exams MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday re-launched vocational qualifications in a move to boost their image. He said that General National Vocational Qualifications were to be renamed, with the top GNVQ to be known as the vocational A-level. GNVQs are a third qualification option for people over 16 - after A-levels and the more specialised National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). The most advanced GNVQ - which had been called Level 3 and is the vocational equivalent of two A-levels - will now be known as 'advanced'. The Level 2 GNVQ - equivalent to four or five GCSEs - will be called 'intermediate' and the Level 1 GNVQ, equivalent to four lower-grade GCSEs, will be known as 'foundation'. Mr Patten said the term 'vocational A-level' would help show that the qualification was equivalent to academic exams, traditionally held in higher regard. Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's education panel, said the move was a step in the right direction. 'The term A-level is well established and recognised by employers,' he said. 'By using it to describe an equivalent vocational qualification, parents, students and employers will be able readily to recognise qualifications with high standards.' The National Association of Head Teachers was more guarded, describing the move as a 'small step in the right direction'. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman-designate of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, also welcomed the move. He said that parents had not understood the range of qualifications available beyond GCSEs and A levels. Mr Tim Boswell, minister for further and higher education, yesterday told directors of Training and Enterprise Councils that they had to show by their actions that they valued vocational qualifications. 'They represent a new currency for jobs for young people and adults alike,' he said. 'But only if employers use them and shout loudly to would-be employees, parents, young people and teachers about their value.' He said the driving force for change was the need for international competitiveness.</p>

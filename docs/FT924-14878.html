			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / DTI seeks to wind up travel agent TRAVEL PREMIUMS Incor-porated, the UK subsidiary of a US travel company, closed its London office last month, cancelling the holidays of up to 800 customers who paid in advance, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday. The DTI said Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had presented a petition to the High Court to wind up the company, which was formed in 1990 and traded in the UK as a travel agent. The Official Receiver was appointed provisional liquidator by the court pending determination of the petition, which is expected to be heard in December. The DTI said the petition had been presented 'to protect the public interest from further harm'. It added: 'We are seeking anyone who has been involved and has paid money to this company to write to the receivers.' Trading standards officers in Richmond, south-west London, said they had been receiving complaints about the company for more than three years. The company ceased trading on September 18. Travel Premiums is believed to have provided holidays offered by promotional companies which were selling timeshare properties and double-glazing. It is thought that the holidays were offered to people who agreed to attend sales presentations. The DTI said that customers should write to the Official Receiver at 21 Bloomsbury Street, London WC1B 3SS, or telephone 071-637 6559.</p>

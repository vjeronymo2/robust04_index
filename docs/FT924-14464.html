			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Bonds: EIB establishes benchmark for French franc paper THE European Investment Bank yesterday brought the first substantial offering in the Euro-French franc market since August, when the market virtually closed due to worries over the French referendum on Maastricht in September. The EIB was keen to re-establish a benchmark in the sector, since trading in its paper was disrupted by the change in Italian tax treatment of EIB paper last month. Under the new tax rules, new EIB paper is no longer exempt from withholding tax for Italian investors, and old EIB paper does not benefit from the exemption if traded in the repo market. Prior to the change, some EIB paper was trading at yields substantially lower than French OATs, but spreads widened by as much as 50 basis points as a wave of paper hit the market. The new deal, a FFr2bn 10-year offering arranged by Societe Generale, was priced to yield 34 basis points over the comparable French government bond. The deal was priced at the same level as French government guaranteed paper launched in the domestic market. Dealers said the issue, which incorporates a delayed rate settlement structure, met strong demand. Meanwhile, liquidity in the Euro-French franc market has improved in recent days, as short-term rates eased. Following the referendum, overnight rates as high as 24 per cent made it extremely expensive for banks to fund inventory, causing liquidity to dry up. However, the overnight rate fell to 11 7/8 per cent yesterday. 'The market is not yet back to normal, but conditions are improving,' said one trader. Three new issues totalling SFr1bn emerged yesterday in the Swiss franc bond market, which has benefited from its status as a safe haven during the recent turmoil in European financial markets. The issues were spread across a range of maturities, which helped the market to absorb unusually heavy supply, in addition to two 12-year domestic bond issues by Swiss utilities totalling SFr200m. The World Bank launched a large SFr500m offering of 6 1/4 per cent seven-year bonds, via Union Bank of Switzerland, which dealers said was rather aggressively priced. In addition, Belgium launched a SFr200m five-year deal via Credit Suisse and Ostterreichische Kontrollbank raised SFr300m of 10-year bonds via Swiss Bank Corporation. Swiss bond yields have fallen by about  1/2 point since last month, as investors have shifted assets into the Swiss market. A number of other borrowers are taking price indications for transactions in the sector, but some believe rates still have further to fall. The Britannia Building Society added a further Pounds 50m tranche of 13 per cent Permanent Interest Bearing Shares (Pibs) to its Pounds 60m issue. The shares offer a yield at issue price of 280 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. The issue of undated mandatorily convertible subordinated notes launched last January were converted into notes on August 1, following shareholder approval at the society's annual general meeting.</p>

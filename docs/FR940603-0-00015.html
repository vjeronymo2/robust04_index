			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director finds that Kansas' proposed amendment does not render the State provision at K.A.R. 47&hyph;2&hyph;75(e)(6) less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal provision at 30 CFR 846.5 and is approving it. Accordingly, the Director is removing the required program amendment at 30 CFR 916.16(c)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(6)(E) (iii) and (iv), Notice of Administrative Hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Kansas proposes to revise K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(6)(E)(iii) and add K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(6)(E)(iv) so that the rules would read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (E) The state agency shall cause notice to be given to any other person entitled to notice under any other provisions of law, who has not been given notice under section (d)(6)(A), as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Notice under this subsection may include all types of information provided in sections (d)(6) (A) through (D) or may consist of a brief statement indicating the subject matter, parties, time, place where the hearing will be held, locations where the general public may meet for hearings which are conducted electronically, nature of the hearing, manner in which copies of the notice to the parties may be inspected and copied, and the name and telephone number of the presiding officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The surface mining section shall also post notice of the hearing at their office and, where practicable, publish it in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the mine at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kansas proposes these revisions in response to a required program amendment placed on the Kansas program at 30 CFR 916.16(b)(17) that instructed Kansas to remove the provisions that allowed for the holding of hearings by telephone or other electronic means. The required program amendment resulted from a finding published in a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  notice dated September 13, 1991 (56 FR 46531, 46538). The finding concluded that the proposal to conduct hearings by telephone or other electronic means conflicted with existing SMCRA and State requirements for public hearings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> See also 58 FR 32850&hyph;32851 (June 14, 1993).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed revision at K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(6)(E)(iii) insures, among other things, that the notice of an administrative hearing provided to non-parties will notify members of the general public where they may go to participate in an electronically conducted hearing. Moreover, the proposed language at K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(6)(E)(iv) requires the Surface Mining Section to post such notices at its office, so that members of the general public have access to one central location where they can always obtain information about upcoming hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed language at K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(6)(E)(iv) also provides that, ``where practicable,'' the Surface Mining Section will publish the notice in a newspaper or general circulation in the area of the mine at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing. As a general rule this proposed 7-day publication notice is not inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal rules because SMCRA does not uniformly require regulatory authorities to publish advance notice of all hearings. However, there are instances where SMCRA and other provisions of the Kansas program specifically require the regulatory authority to publish advance notice of a hearing. Moreover, in those specific instances, the regulatory authority is required to publish such notice more than seven days in advance of the hearing date. See section 513(b) of SMCRA; 30 CFR 773.13(c)(2)(ii). See also K.A.R. 47&hyph;3&hyph;42(a)(43) (incorporating by reference 30 CFR 773.13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director is approving the proposed rule at K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(6)(E)(iv) with the understanding that it is a general rule and that in any particular instance where a more specific rule of the Kansas program requires publication of advance notice of an administrative hearing, the more specific rule must take precedence over this proposed general rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds that the proposed rules at K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(6)(E) (iii) and (vi) are not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal program and is approving them. Accordingly, the Director is removing the required program amendment from the Kansas program and as codified at 30 CFR 916.16(b)(17).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

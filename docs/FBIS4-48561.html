			<p>BFN     [Text] Malawians attending the inauguration of President  Bakili Muluzi in Blantyre's football stadium have begun tearing  down election posters and official portraits of former President  Kamuzu Banda. The 60,000-strong crowd also removed the  lettering of the words, Long Live Kamuzu, from the walls of the  stadium. In a conciliatory gesture, Mr. Muluzi has told the  former president that he may stay on in the glamorous Sanjika  Palace for as long as he likes. With the results of five  constituencies still outstanding, Mr. Muluzi's United Democratic  Front has won 84 of the 177 seats, compared to the 52 of Mr.  Banda's Congress Party.</p>

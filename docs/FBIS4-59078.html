It confirmed that the response to these Arab and  international efforts and initiatives was prompted by the Yemeni  people's interest to preserve their gains and unity, and  safeguard their armed forces economic structures and the  citizens' souls. It was in this respect that the YSP political  bureau responded to the calls by the United States, French,  Egyptian, and Algerian Governments, and expressed its hope that  these calls and efforts would receive the support of all the  sides concerned at a time when the battles are leading towards  comprehensive destruction.    In keeping with these efforts, the militant brother, 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP Central Committee,  continued his contacts with a number of Arab presidents,  including the Egyptian president, Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the  Syrian president, Hafiz al-Asad, and the Libyan president,  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He briefed them on developments in Yemen  and the bloody battles at the various axes of fighting.

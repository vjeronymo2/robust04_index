			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Smith attacks welfare cuts to bolster spending - Opposition Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the government of mounting 'a vicious attack on the welfare state' to pay for public spending cuts. Mr Smith's short but passionate response to the Budget prompted a roar of support from Labour MPs, who had earlier appeared demoralised by the chancellor's robust performance. He accused Mr Clarke of betraying Conservative election promises, and pledged that Labour would try to amend the finance bill to defend welfare benefits. The Labour leader warned commentators to be 'very careful' about the chancellor's forecasts for public spending, which he claimed were achieved by 'sleight of hand'. He said the government had hidden the detailed figures. He told Mr Clarke: 'You may live to regret saying that you have public borrowing 'once and for all' under control.' Mr Smith said the Budget would cost the average family at least Pounds 5 a week next year, and Pounds 5.40 a week in 1995/96 - on top of Pounds 8.50 a week imposed in the March Budget by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. He said the chancellor had glossed over changes in income tax allowances and mortgage tax relief, and he ridiculed backbench Conservative MPs for being 'so out of touch with public opinion that they actually cheered a Budget which increases taxation'. Mr Smith said taxation of insurance premiums amounted to 'a new tax on insuring your car and a new tax on insuring your home, and it is going to be very expensive because of the boom in crime that has happened under this government'. He said the VAT compensation scheme announced by Mr Clarke failed to take account of millions of poor families who would receive no benefits. Mr Smith also attacked the chancellor's 'odious' reduction of earnings related unemployment benefit as 'a trick' designed to reduce the unemployment total. But he reserved his strongest venom for the changes to invalidity benefits, which he contrasted with Mr Clarke's 'absolutely disgusting' failure to tackle tax loopholes Labour claims to have identified. 'This is a party that believes that when the chancellor needs to raise money he should turn to the sick and the poor,' he said. Mr Smith said the chancellor had failed to understand that the government Budget deficit was a symptom of Britain's economic problems, rather than a cause. He said raising taxes and cutting spending would do nothing to tackle underlying economic problems, and could worsen them. 'This is a government which ignores mass unemployment, and ignores the economic weakness which is the legacy of its party in office. This is not the government which Britain needs,' he said.</p>

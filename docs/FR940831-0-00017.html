This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks and loose fasteners found in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forward lower spar web of the inboard strut on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 and JT9D&hyph;7 series engines. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent separation of the strut from the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

That action proposed to require inspections of the inboard and outboard strut chords, stiffeners, and web to detect cracks and loose fasteners; repair of the chords, stiffeners, or web, if necessary; and replacement of any loose fastener.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, Boeing, requests that the proposed rule be withdrawn since only six cracks have been reported in the 20 years these airplanes have been in service. In addition, these cracks were found only on the inboard struts during normal maintenance. Boeing asserts that the probability of another strut with a pre-existing firewall crack experiencing loads that approach the ultimate design condition is extremely remote. Boeing adds, however, that the airplane maintenance manual is being revised to include an inspection of the lower spar web in the case of an unusual overload event. Boeing also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that the results of one operator's inspections revealed only one loose fastener on one airplane out of 24 inspected. Boeing states that the firewall webs will be reinforced during the strut modification program referenced in the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to withdraw this AD. The FAA has determined that inspections mandated by the issuance of this AD are necessary to correct the unsafe condition presented by separation of the strut from the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking in the web. These inspections are necessary until the 0.025-inch inboard webs and the 0.032-inch outboard webs are replaced as part of the strut modification program discussed in the proposal. Sonic fatigue analysis performed by Boeing in support of the decision to replace the webs has revealed that the existing inboard and outboard webs on Model 747 series airplanes addressed in this AD are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate. Recent findings from an investigation of an incident involving a Model 747 series airplane indicate that fatigue cracking found on the web of the airplane resulted from flexing or vibration of the web material. This fatigue cracking resulted in the in-flight loss of an engine during airplane operation in severe turbulence. Since the FAA considers it probable for other airplanes to have cracked webs, and since no requirements exist to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrict airplane operation in severe turbulence, the FAA finds that this AD action is necessary in order to prevent in-flight engine loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that inspections of the outboard webs be removed from the proposed rule so that the AD is consistent with the referenced service bulletin. The commenters indicate that no cracking or loose fasteners have been found on the outboard webs. The commenters also state that the design thickness of the webs (0.032 inch for the outboard web; 0.025 inch for the inboard web) represents a 28 percent difference, which should be considered significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur. The thickness of the inboard web of the incident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane mentioned previously measured 0.027 inch. The FAA finds that there is little difference between the inboard and outboard webs with standard manufacturing tolerances. Each web is similar in configuration, loading, and sonic environments. In light of these considerations, the FAA concludes that the outboard strut web is subject to the same unsafe condition as the inboard strut web and must be included in this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the compliance times for inspections of the outboard strut be extended. One commenter requests that the compliance times be revised to align with those recommended in the referenced service bulletin, less the amount of time provided for public comment on the proposal. Another commenter requests that the compliance times be extended to be consistent with a load analysis based upon the actual web thickness of the outboard strut. This commenter assumes that the proposed repetitive inspection interval is based on a load analysis of the inboard strut structure. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter requests that the compliance times for the initial inspection of the inboard strut be extended to 15 months. The commenter does not provide any justification for this request, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs that the compliance times can be extended somewhat. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance times specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this AD have been revised to reflect the times recommended in the manufacturer's service bulletin. The FAA finds that the proposed compliance time of 6 months specified for airplanes that have accumulated 6,000 or more total landings, but less than 15,000 total landings [those airplanes applicable to paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule] may be extended to 9 months. Although the service bulletin specifies a recommended compliance time of 12 months for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes, the FAA finds that, based on the service history of affected Model 747 series airplanes that fall within this group, 9 months represents the maximum interval of time allowable for these airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

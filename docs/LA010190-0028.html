			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $9 A MASS, FOR 260 YEARS, CHURCH SAYS  </P> <P> The mayor of this northern town says that Roman Catholic Church officials have  sent him a bill for more than $20,000 for a series of special Masses celebrated  since 1630.  </P> <P> The church said the town requested the special Masses in the 17th Century when  it was troubled by the plague.  </P> <P> Mayor Giuliano Gaigher said Saturday that church authorities are now insisting  on payment of 10,000 lire (about $9) for each of seven votive Masses celebrated  each year since 1630. That would bring the total bill to about $22,000.  </P> <P> "We are doing historical research. We haven't found any commitment by the town"  to pay for the Masses, Gaigher said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> The Italian news agency ANSA quoted local church officials as saying they are  willing to work out a solution.  </P></p>

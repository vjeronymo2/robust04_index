			<p>BFN     [Text] Maseru May 23 SAPA -- Police in Lesotho were still  on strike on Monday following the failure of the government to  concede to their demands, SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] radio news reported. A policeman said they were  asking for a pay increase of 60 per cent.    Reports said the Lesotho Government responded by saying  police would receive a 10 per cent increase in line with other  state departments.    The country's defence force has been deployed to prevent  plundering. There have been incidents because there were too few  soldiers to adequately patrol several rural areas.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Senior ministers rally to defend embattled Major: Tory backbenchers warn PM that a leadership challenge is likely Senior cabinet ministers yesterday sought to shore up Mr John Major's hold on Downing Street as backbench support for his leadership haemorrhaged rapidly in the wake of the debacle over enlargement of the European Union. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, all issued strong public declarations of support for the prime minister. Mr Hurd definitely ruled himself out as a candidate for the leadership. The foreign secretary, who stood against Mr Major in 1990, said: 'I don't regret having had a go but I am not going to have another.' However, Mr Clarke startled some MPs by saying that he intended to succeed Mr Major as leader of the Tory party when the prime minister stepped down. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: 'I intend to succeed John Major when John Major of his own volition goes, which I think will be a long way away.' Mr Clarke's comments were seen by some MPs as an attempt to stall the strong stream of support that has been developing behind Mr Heseltine. But his declaration that the prime minister would remain in office did little to cool the feverish atmosphere at Westminster, where centre and leftwing Tory MPs joined rightwingers in condemning Mr Major's handling of the enlargement negotiations. Few were prepared to call publicly for his resignation. But most said a leadership challenge in the autumn was inevitable unless the Conservatives performed unexpectedly well in the local, European and Commons elections due in the next three months. 'Both wings of the party are agreed that John Major will have to go after the June elections,' one leading leftwing Tory MP said. It emerged that informal talks have taken place between the Lollards, the main backbench grouping on the left of the party, and the rightwing '92 Group. Downing Street officials said Mr Major's mood was 'robust', and insisted that he was not depressed by the almost uniformly hostile media reaction to the enlargement deal. In a speech to businessmen in Belfast last night, Mr Major again defended his handling of negotiations over European Union voting, saying he was 'a realist seeking to secure our success'. He also hardened his challenge to the European Commission to ensure that the safeguards agreed on majority voting should be maintained. 'If this deal is not upheld, no one should expect the UK to continue the normal process of Community business,' he said. In Westminster, the prime minister's best hope appeared to be that tempers on the back benches would cool during the 10-day Easter parliamentary recess, which begins today. A senior cabinet minister said privately, however, that the outlook for Mr Major was bleak unless the mood of MPs had changed dramatically when they returned from constituencies. The mood of crisis was deepened by the disclosure that two of the four rightwing cabinet ministers who opposed the enlargement deal - Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury - had breakfasted at Mr Portillo's London home. Mr Portillo's friends said the pre-arranged breakfast had no connection with the leadership fever. However, it stoked speculation that cabinet rightwingers were plotting. Mr Peter Lilley, the rightwing social security secretary, further fuelled the impression of cabinet manoeuvring in a strongly Thatcherite speech praising the 'intellectual tide of the 1980s'. Mr Lilley, giving the first Spectator lecture in London, said Conservative ideas could dominate the 1990s if they were expressed with 'vigour and conviction' - qualities widely associated in the party with Baroness Thatcher. In a phrase which drew attention to the prime minister's deep unpopularity in the opinion polls, Mr Lilley ended by urging the Conservatives to take Sir Winston Churchill's advice and 'trust the people'. Meanwhile, Mr Heseltine said Mr Major would lead the Conservatives into the next election and 'win it with a large majority'. However, when asked to rule out contesting a leadership contest, he sidestepped the question.

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Bill change ruled out THE government yesterday told building societies that it would not give way to their calls for a change in the Finance Bill that would enable them to be re-paid more than Pounds 250m in tax from 1985-86. Mr John Maple, economic secretary to the Treasury, told the Building Societies Association there had been a defect in the legislation when composite-rate tax was applied to building societies and a clause in the bill was to correct that.</p>

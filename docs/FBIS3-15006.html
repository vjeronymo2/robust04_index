The president pointed out that the Azerbaijani party  considered that the conflict should not be settled by means of  force because continuation of war would be meaningless. We  stand for cease-fire and cessation of hostilities providing  territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, inviolability of its  borders and safety of its residents is guaranteed, President  Aliyev said.    Mr. Jan Eliasson stressed that it was very important for all  the parties concerned to comprehend that there is no alternative  to peaceful resolution of the conflict.    Mr. Eliasson informed that he had had a round of talks in  Moscow and Ankara, met with representatives of the  countries-members of the Minsk Group, thus made great spade-work  before he visited the region. Ceasefire - the first step on the  road to peaceful resolution of the conflict was on the agenda of  Russian talks. According to Mr. Jan Eliasson, proceeding from  the Minsk Groups step by step method of peaceful resolution of  the conflict the organization should know its following steps.  These are withdrawal of Armenian army from occupied areas,  restoration of communications, and a return of refugees to their  homes. Both parties can hold negotiations on political  settlement of the conflict after solving these problems.    Mr. Eliasson suggested to stop hostilities in occasion of  renewal of the Minsk Groups efforts on peaceful resolution of  the conflict. I hope we can achieve concord about cease-fire, he  said. At the same time he expressed his comprehension that  Azerbaijani party must be sure that the opposing party will not  take advantage of lull and start a new offensive.    The chairman of the Minsk Group stressed that the CSCE is  ready to help Azerbaijan to solve humanitarian problems raising  as a result of the conflict and to mobilize strength of the  world community to do that.    It is expected that Mr. Jan Eliasson will visit the zone of  hostilities and the districts where refugees have being placed.</p>

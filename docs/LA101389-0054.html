			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BILL PUTS FEWER LIMITS ON USE OF DESERT  </P> <P> Four California congressmen introduced legislation Thursday that would  designate 2.1 million acres of the Southern California desert as wilderness  while preserving grazing rights and authorizing motor vehicle access in some  areas.  </P> <P> The new move in the years-long battle over desert policy has the support of  multiple-use advocates who are fiercely opposed to more restrictive legislation  introduced earlier by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Rep. Mel Levine  (D-Santa Monica).  </P> <P> Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), chief sponsor of the latest bill, said it  reflects "a strongly held public desire to preserve and protect one of the  crown jewels of America's public lands."  </P> <P> Cranston and Levine, however, denounced it as a travesty and an attack on  federal wilderness legislation.  </P> <P> Rather than providing protection, Levine said, the Lewis bill amounts to "a new  kind of warfare on the wilderness unlike any before" and "turns the clock back  to the original debate of the 1960s."  </P> <P> The 2.1 million acres to be designated as permanent wilderness area would be in  51 tracts to be designated by the Interior Department's Bureau of Land  Management.  </P> <P> In at least three of the wilderness areas, vehicle access would be permitted  with the permission of the secretary of the interior. Livestock grazing would  be allowed to continue in areas where it had begun before the wilderness  designation became effective.  </P> <P> Eight back-country trail systems, accessible to the handicapped, would be  developed on the fringe of wilderness. Authority to expand them would be  conferred on the interior secretary.  </P> <P> Sponsors of the measure characterized it as the culmination of a process begun  in 1976 when the Bureau of Land Management was directed by Congress to develop  a master plan for federal land planning and management.  </P> <P> During five years of ensuing hearings and deliberations, more than 40,000  Californians wrote the Bureau of Land Management, testified at hearings or  otherwise conveyed their views on desert lands policy. The four lawmakers who  shaped the proposal said that it is an outgrowth of that interchange.  </P> <P> Besides Lewis, the bill's principal sponsors are Reps. Duncan L. Hunter  (R-Coronado), William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield) and Al McCandless (R-Bermuda  Dunes), whose districts represent most of the Southern California desert.  </P> <P> Suggesting that the bill introduced by Cranston and Levine and strongly  supported by environmental groups is a product of outsiders, Lewis said his  34-page alternative "is the people's bill."  </P> <P> The more extensive Cranston and Levine proposal would create a 1.5 million-acre  Mojave National Park east of Barstow, designate 4.4 million acres in 81  separate tracts as permanent wilderness, greatly expand the Death Valley and  Joshua Tree national monuments by making both national parks and add 20,500  acres to Red Rock Canyon State Park.  </P> <P> In addition, 3 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land would be  transferred to the National Park Service, which conservationists believe would  be more attentive to its management.  </P> <P> The Cranston-Levine bill has stirred bitter opposition from cattlemen, mining  interests, recreational users and even the military.  </P> <P> The routes and numbers of military training flights would be frozen under the  Cranston-Levine measure, while the Lewis bill would explicitly prohibit any  restrictions on military overflights in the wilderness.  </P> <P> Environmentalists want to sharply limit vehicular access to the desert areas.  But Hunter said that such access is central to the Lewis proposal, calling the  desert "the playground of the working people of California."  </P> <P> "In the desert," he said, "access is everything, and that means motorized  access."  </P> <P> Cranston called the rival bill "totally unacceptable." He said it is worse than  the status quo because it would permit vehicles in some wilderness areas,  prevent the government from determining the legitimacy of mining claims, weaken  grazing restrictions and prohibit future designation of wilderness areas.  </P> <P> Both proposals will be aired in a new round of congressional field hearings.  </P> <P> Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the national parks and public lands  subcommittee of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, has scheduled  an Oct. 28 hearing in Bishop and a Nov. 3 hearing in Barstow. A third hearing  is expected to be scheduled in Los Angeles early next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The Bureau of Land Management was directed by Congress in 1976 to develop a  master plan for federal land planning and management. During the next five  years, more than 40,000 Californians wrote BLM, testified at hearings or  otherwise conveyed their views on desert lands policy. Thursday's plan would  protect the interests of many ranchers and off-road vehicle users in the  California desert, while a competing proposal sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston  and Rep. Mel Levine is favored by environmentalists.  </P></p>

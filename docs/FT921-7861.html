			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (6): Switch to diesel cuts cost of fuel bills - Profile of DHL International (UK) AIR express company DHL International (UK) operates a vehicle fleet of some 230 company cars, nearly 290 vans and 25 trucks. Together, they cover around 16m miles a year and generate a fuel bill of between Pounds 800,000 and Pounds 1m (Dollars 1.8m). Any savings area can therefore make a significant difference to the company's overall operational costs. As a result, DHL has just decided to change around half of its all petrol-engined car fleet to diesel-powered models. The company expects the move to reduce fuel costs by more than Pounds 30,000 a year. 'We did look at the possibility of using diesel cars several years ago,' says DHL fleet manager, Clive Gardner. 'In fact, I was using one at that time. There were savings to be made but at that point it was felt a change to diesels would be too demotivating for staff and the idea was ruled out. 'Since then, though, the quality and performance of diesel cars has improved a lot. At the same time, recent general economic pressures have encouraged the company to look very closely at all costs.' That review has led to a company decision to replace the high-mileage cars used by sales personnel, typically Ford Orions, Escorts and Sierras, plus Rover 216 and 416 models, with diesel-engined versions. Apart from savings on fuel costs, says Mr Gardner, the diesel-engined cars also tend to produce better resale prices. Initial buying costs are higher, he adds, but overall the pence per mile costs work out lower. Mr Gardner believes that in addition to current considerations, there are also longer-term reasons for switching over to diesel cars. 'There seems to be a growing feeling in the motor industry that the government is moving towards introducing further tax concessions for diesel cars. And with the coming of the EC single market, I think moves will be made to reduce our diesel fuel prices to bring them more in line with those on the Continent.' DHL has an advantage over many company car users considering a switch to diesel in that it already has considerable experience of that type of engine through its van and truck operations. The company is running a fleet of 286 diesel-engined vans for its collection and delivery activities. Around 70 per cent of that van fleet are Ford Escorts, mainly 1.8 diesels, and 25 per cent are Ford Transits. More recently, the company has introduced Volkswagen Transporters, both 2.4 and 1.9 diesels, to replace some of the Escorts. 'The payload of the Volkswagens is about 25 per cent greater than that of the Escorts and with our express traffic growing last year, we needed the extra capacity,' explains Mr Gardner. At one time, DHL used to buy all its own vehicles but within the past couple of years it has changed over to using lease purchase arrangements for its vans and the cars. The basic reason for that change, says Mr Gardner, was a financial one. 'With outright purchase, we were tying up a lot of capital. Using lease purchase arrangements we have been able to release that capital for other purposes.' But DHL does still buy its heavy goods vehicles. The 25-strong fleet comprises mainly Ford Cargos, plus a few Mercedes. 'With these vehicles, we found the financial advantage was in favour of purchase,' adds Mr Gardner. DHL has 27 locations around the UK but most of its vehicles are based at the company's main operational centre at Orbital Park, Hounslow, near Heathrow Airport. Unlike many vehicle users who have opted to hand over their maintenance and general fleet management activities to third parties, DHL remains committed to controlling those operations in-house. The actual maintenance work is carried out by local garages and service centres but their work is closely monitored by DHL. That monitoring process has been further tightened up as part of the company's general move towards achieving British Standards BS 5750 quality accreditation. Explaining the policy of keeping fleet management control in-house, Mr Gardner claims DHL has well-established computerised systems, based on the use of a Car Fleet Control System fleet management package, for identifying and monitoring running costs such as maintenance. 'If we did not have the tools to handle that side of things properly then it might make sense to contract out the fleet management function. But if you can identify the costs yourself and control them, then why pass on the job to someone else?' DHL has also developed a system for analysing and monitoring the causes of accidents involving its vehicles. Drivers involved fill in various data boxes at the bottom of an accident report form and that information is then analysed to see what factors emerge. The results can subsequently be used to help train drivers in ways of avoiding such accidents in future, regardless of whether or not they were to blame. According to Mr Gardner, that training has helped to reduce DHL's fleet accident rate by nearly 50 per cent over the past four years. As far as insurance is concerned, DHL has a global policy of only insuring its vehicles on a third party basis. In addition to helping keep down premiums, Mr Gardner believes that policy also helps to put over the message to all personnel that they have a responsibility to keep down costs.</p>

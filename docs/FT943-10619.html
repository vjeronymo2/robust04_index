			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Finance boost for US shipbuilding President Bill Clinton has announced Dollars 1.3bn in approved or pending loan guarantees for four contracts designed to boost the US shipbuilding industry, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. The financing packages will benefit shipyards in Mississippi, California and Virginia and one Dollars 726m loan guarantee would support construction of 30 multi-purpose container ships in Louisiana by the Swiss-based Saracen Investment. The House of Representatives has also approved Dollars 1bn in new subsidies for shipyards and shipping lines but subsidies would not be granted unless compatible with a new multilateral pact among shipbuilding nations.</p>

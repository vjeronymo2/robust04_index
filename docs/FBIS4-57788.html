			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Violeta Chamorro and </F> Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo with unidentified reporters;  place and date not given; from the "National" Newscast --  recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] What is your opinion on the Sandinist  Congress?    [Chamorro] Speaking as a simple citizen, I think the  Sandinist Congress met as any political party would meet. Each  party must deal with its own problems.    [Reporter] But who is your candidate, Daniel Ortega or Henry  Ruiz?    [Chamorro] Young man, I do not have a candidate in any  party.  This development is fine as long as we consolidate the new  democracy with the help of conservatives, liberals, social  Christians, Sandinists, and [words indistinct]; as long as it is  done for Nicaragua's sake.    [Reporter] Do you think the contradictions within the  Sandinist National Liberation Front are real or just a smoke  screen?    [Chamorro] I really could not say. God willing, they will  benefit everyone. Everyone has a right to speak freely, to say  what he likes. This is a party -- I repeat -- just like the  liberals, conservatives, and social Christians. They should  reach an agreement for the country's benefit. I think unity  equals strength. I do not think anyone should (?perpetuate  himself), however.    [Announcer] Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo also commented on  the Sandinist Congress:    [Obando y Bravo] They will always be united and will try to  attain power in the next term. Nothing else will happen. For the  time being, there can be only criticism from and tension created  by the media.    [Announcer] Dona Violeta was questioned about the possible  presidential candidacy of Engineer Antonio Lacayo:    [Chamorro] [Words indistinct] informed, but he has not said  so. He has not told me. Anyone who wishes to run should do so.    [Reporter] But would you support him?    [Chamorro] I cannot answer that yet.</p>

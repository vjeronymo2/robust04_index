			<p>BFN     [Text] Fielding Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, as a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, while maintaining the current framework of the  coalition government is the profile of the next administration  that business leaders want to see, according to a NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN survey. On 12 April, the paper questioned senior  officials at the four major Japanese economic organizations,  including Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations], and top executives of major corporations on the  issue of Hosokawa's successor. The results indicate that  business leaders are turning away from the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], as well as that they "hope the next administration  will be one that will not move back the tide of political,  administrative, and economic reforms" (as stated by Masaru  Hayami, chairman of Japan Association of Corporate Executives),  which Prime Minister Hosokawa has undertaken. However, there  still are some business leaders who strongly call for fielding  former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe for the prime  ministership on the condition that the LDP split again.    In the survey, 20 business leaders responded to questions.  Asked "who should be the next prime minister," 10, or nearly  half, of 22 votes cast (respondents were allowed to list more  than one favorite choice) went to Hata. As to why they endorsed  him, some business leaders said "he seems stable and clean,"  while others said "he will ride the current of reform started by  the Hosokawa administration and definitely continue to promote  reform efforts."    If the current framework of the coalition government were to  be maintained, there is strong inclination toward fielding Hata,  who currently holds the no. 2 post in the Hosokawa  administration, for the prime ministership, as this is  considered the most appropriate choice. One top corporate  executive explained: "To field Mr. Hata is tantamount to  fielding Mr. Ozawa. The survey results prove there are now more  business leaders who hold expectations for Ozawa as a man of  action."    Watanabe ranked second to Hata, collecting a quarter of the  votes. Some of his supporters said they chose him because "he  is a strong leader," while others did so because "he can be  expected to promptly settle budget-related issues, including tax  system reform, since he is an economics expert." However, some  business leaders say "I cannot stand Mitchie [Watanabe's  nickname]," as they are concerned about his style of economic  management, which is said to be inflationary.    Some business leaders supported Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura (chairman of Sakigake [Harbinger Party]), who  distances himself from the Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party]-Komeito-Japan New Party bloc. He has been praised by  some business leaders who say "his abilities had much to do with  deregulation and other economic reform efforts undertaken by the  Hosokawa administration." This indicates Takemura enjoys the  support of some business leaders who are cautious about  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's high-handed political  style.    One business leader endorsed Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan, but he said: "It would be  only on the condition that he lead a tentative administration  that would merely take care of the fiscal year 1994 budget and  trade relations with the United States, which are impending  issues."</p>

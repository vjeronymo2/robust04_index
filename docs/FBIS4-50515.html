			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Make the Old Industrial Base Regain </F> Its Vigor"]    [Text] Heilongjiang is one of the earliest industrial bases  developed and constructed by the state. In the four decades and  more since the founding of the country, it has provided to the  state large amounts of oil, coal, timber, large complete sets of  power station equipment, machines, and national defense and  military equipment and 142.7 billion yuan of profits and taxes,  thus playing its role as an old industrial base.    Due to the influence of systems, policies, our own work, and  other factors, investment in technical transformation was  lacking to a serious extent in the past few years. As a result,  merely 10 percent of the large- and medium-sized enterprises,  whose output value accounted for 75 percent and whose original  value of fixed assets and profits and taxes delivered to the  state accounted for 80 percent of the province's total,  underwent systematic transformation, more than a half of their  equipment is in a state of extended service or will soon have to  be scrapped, and the products of a half of the enterprises are  in recession. Large- and medium-sized enterprises are faced  with numerous difficulties in production and operation, and an  overwhelming majority of them have been operated at low speed  and low efficiency for a long period. In addition, we have  failed for many years to build the new projects that can promote  local economic development, our industrial structure has yet to  be radically adjusted, the overall economic efficiency is low,  and the role as an old industrial base is weakening. To regain  the magnificence of Heilongjiang, accelerate economic  development, and continue to make still greater contributions to  the state, the historical task to speed up the transformation of  the old industrial base is thus included in our work schedule.    Heilongjiang enjoys complete branches of industry, strong  technological force, and pretty good equipment foundation. Many  of its products, such as the three major power resources,  heavy-duty machines, precision bearings, and flax fabrics, are  unique or very few in the country. Such a substantial  industrial foundation should be regarded as a great advantage,  not a burden. This advantage should be fully developed when we  transform the old industrial base. We should make the best of  enterprises' available assets to carry out more technical  transformation projects and fewer capital construction projects.  This is an effective way to yield quicker and greater results  with less investment. We should pay particular attention to the  technical transformation of large- and medium-sized enterprises  and enable them to be fully invigorated and play a leading and  promoting role in Heilongjiang's economic development.    We do not mean to rule out development of new capital  construction projects when we advocate more transformation  projects for the existing enterprises and less capital  construction. Heilongjiang has long failed to address its  irrational product mix, large proportion of important means of  production, and a large loss of efficiency. To change such a  situation, we should build a number of key projects focusing on  the intensive processing of such resources as oil, coal, and  timber that can lead relevant industries and support rapid  economic development. However, either in technical  transformation or capital construction, we should conduct a  serious study of the market, do a good job in scientific  appraisal, accurately select projects, and make sure that  products are marketable and investment can be recalled within a  short period after the projects are completed. We should never  spend money to buy a burden.    In technical transformation, we should emphasize  "technology." To transform the old industrial base, we should  rely on scientific and technological advances and use high and  new technology to transform traditional industries. As has been  proven in the practice of modern production, the development and  change of productive forces, the evolution of industries, the  improvement of the standing of products, the optimal  organization of enterprises' essential elements of production,  and the effective regulation of production process are all  decided by the scientific and technological advances, especially  the infiltration, radiation, and influence of high and new  technology in traditional industries. Over the past few years,  Heilongjiang has established a number of high- and  new-technology industrial development zones and science and  technology parks and has developed and initially industrialized  a number of electronic information technology, automation  technology, bioengineering technology, new materials, and other  high- and new-technology achievements. All localities should  make the best of the role of these development zones and parks  as "incubators" to distribute high- and new-technology  achievements, scientific and technological policies, and  operating mechanisms to promote the transformation of  traditional industries.    Sufficient investment is needed in transforming the old  industrial base. Shortages of funds constitute a major factor  restricting Heilongjiang's transformation of the old industrial  base. To solve this problem, we should rely on our own efforts.  After financial allocations are changed into loans, neither  local authorities nor enterprises can expect the state or the  province to allocate funds to develop projects. They can only  use their own funds or bank loans. Enterprises should use most  parts of their retained profits in technical transformation and  continuously snowball their funds for technical transformation.  When conditions permit, they may also accelerate the  depreciation of their fixed assets in line with relevant state  policies and use the increased depreciation funds chiefly in  technical transformation. It is a feasible way to use the funds  and advanced technology from outside the border to renovate old  enterprises and build joint ventures and exclusively  foreign-funded enterprises whose technology is advanced and  products are readily marketable. Heilongjiang is located at the  center of the Northeast Asian economic circle and neighbors  Russia, which has abundant resources and great market potential.  Its major cities and localities have established economic and  technological development zones or high- and new-technology  development zones, and some of them have also been designated by  the state as border open cities or pilot cities for overall  reform, which enjoy almost the same policies as coastal open  cities and very great advantages in opening up. Last year,  Heilongjiang brought in 230 million yuan from abroad, accounting  for 50 percent of the total amount brought in after border  cities were opened to the outside. Even so, the capital brought  in from abroad last year accounted for less than 1 percent of  the total of the country. This means that we have great  potential to tap.    While transforming the old industrial base with our own  efforts, we should actively strive for state support. Entrusted  by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji led  responsible comrades of relevant state ministries and  commissions to conduct investigation and study in Heilongjiang.  During that period, he helped the province address a series of  difficulties and problems, including those on the projects,  funds, and policies concerning the transformation of the old  industrial base. All localities and departments should seize  the opportunity to work in a down-to-earth manner and  realistically transform the old industrial base to enable it to  regain magnificence.</p>

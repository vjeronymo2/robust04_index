			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> '20 YEARS AFTER': WEAK WOODSTOCK VIBES  </P> <P> No mud. No traffic jams. No open drug use. No babies born. Certainly no  copulation. Plenty of bathrooms. No epithets of "pig" directed at the friendly  policemen strolling through the crowd. Only about half of 1% of the original  crowd figure. No superstar acts. No climbing on the speaker towers. No illusion  of unity or purpose or agenda. And no brown acid to avoid.  </P> <P> Other than that, the first day of the "20 Years After" music festival tribute  Saturday at Cal State Dominguez Hills was almost exactly like Woodstock.  </P> <P> To wit: a drum solo for every billed attraction! A grilled chicken booth for  every pothead! Dozens of tie-dyed T-shirt concessions! Men with hair! Earth  mamas without bras! Jams without endings! Stage dialogue like: "You people are  the music; we're just the band right now" (courtesy of Humble Pie)!  </P> <P> And, best of all, emcee and counterculture class bozo Wavy Gravy, trying  desperately to imbue this most laid-back of daze with some sense of urgency!  "If you respect our Mother Earth, let's pick up the trash a little bit," he  pleaded, making the scant littering of the Olympic Velodrome -- pardon us, the  7-Eleven Olympic Velodrome (yes, the revolution will be sponsored) -- sound  like the imminent rape of Ma World.  </P> <P> Poor Wavy had a tough time relating to some of the younger, more cynical kids  in the audience. "I'm a clown," he told them. "You're an acidhead!" some  whippersnapper shouted back. "No, I'm a clown," he repeated, a bit of resigned  sadness in his voice.  </P> <P> If there seemed to be a noticeable lack of a Woodstock vibe Saturday among the  relaxed crowd of fewer than 5,000, it may have been partly because that day's  bill was devoted mostly to acts that became more famous in the '70s than in the  '60s, like Edgar Winter and Grand Funk's Mark Farner. There was a Spinal Tap  appeal to watching semi-reunited war horses like Iron Butterfly and Humble Pie  go through their '70s chunk-rock paces, in incarnations that combine  long-in-the-tooth original members with hunky new recruits who look as though  they were conscripted at the Sports Connection.  </P> <P> Electric Flag was one of the few to reunite all its original personnel (except,  of course, the late Mike Bloomfield), in this case for the first time in 20  years.  </P> <P> Sunday's bill, which was scheduled to include such memorable Woodstock veterans  as Country Joe McDonald, Melanie, Canned Heat, Richie Havens and Sha Na Na, was  expected to draw more of the real Woodstock audience contingent.  </P> <P> "The music has been fine and it's been a good day," said Dawn Souder of  Pittsburgh, who was operating a tie-dye concession at the rear of the field  with her husband Eric. "But it doesn't seem like a Woodstock audience. It's  more like college kids, just kind of a thing to do on a Saturday."  </P> <P> The highlight of the day, as chosen by the Souders and most in attendance, was  the penultimate set by Leon Russell and Edgar Winter, in which the two keyboard  veterans fronted a tight band and alternated lead vocals. The crowd went wild  for Winter's monster instrumental smash, "Frankenstein," which proved still a  whole lot of hokey fun with Russell's piano providing a rollicking, almost  boogie-woogie undercurrent.  </P> <P> Prior to that, the still golden-throated Farner also fared well with the  audience, mixing early Grand Funk boogie (some kind of dull), mid-period Funk  pop hits (truly "Some Kind of Wonderful") and his current "God-rock,  Dee-troit-style" material (some kind of evangelistic). Even his awesomely  ill-conceived ditty about what a drag it is to go to hell, "Judgment Day  Blues," was too high-spirited to bring the crowd really dooooown, maaaaaan.  </P> <P> But, after the crowd-pleasing Winter/Russell set, the climactic "Superjam" was  a fizzle: Croaking "Roadhouse Blues" and "Back Door Man," guitarist Robby  Krieger solved the big mystery of why he was never the Doors' lead singer, and  of the other participants -- including Randy California and Tim Bogert -- only  Ginger Baker (celebrating his 50th birthday) really redeemed himself, turning  in the sole justifiable drum solo among so many that day.  </P> <P> Popular verdict among the crowd, average age about 30: The 12-hour opening day  concert seemed well-staged, well-run and, well, fun, but, according to Eric  Moser, 27, of Mission Viejo, "I think the '60s were better in the '60s."  </P></p>

Lage, who is on the third day of his official visit to  Brazil, gave a news conference that was attended by more than 20  domestic and foreign reporters at the Cuban ambassador's  residence in that country.    The vice president commented on the meeting with Franco at  the Planalto Presidential Palace, saying they broached many  issues related to the development of their countries' political  and economic relations.    He stressed that the Brazilian president reiterated his  criticism of the U.S. blockade against the Caribbean island and  the so-called Torricelli Law. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso  Amorim expressed the same criticism yesterday.    Although no agreements were signed during his visit, Lage  said big possibilities had been opened to increase their  bilateral ties.    He explained that Cuba offers facilities to foreign  investment, especially in the tourism sector. Businessmen who  invest on the island, he pointed out, will recover their  investments quickly.    Lage and accompanying delegation will travel to Rio de  Janeiro early tomorrow morning, where they will meet with local  businessmen and political personalities.</p>

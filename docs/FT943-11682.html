			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / France trims key interest rate The Bank of France yesterday trimmed its key short-term interest rate by one-tenth of a percentage point, to 5 per cent, in a further easing of monetary policy. The cut in the intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, was consistent with the central bank's strategy of tracking the German repo rate lower while maintaining a gap of 15-25 basis points. Yesterday's move leaves France's intervention rate 15 basis points above the repo rate. Economists in Paris said another cut appeared unlikely in the next month as the Bundesbank had frozen the repo rate until at least the last week of August.</p>

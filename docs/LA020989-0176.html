			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLOW BEGINNING BRANCHES INTO RECORD YEAR AT SUNKIST  </P> <P> Sunkist Growers, the giant citrus-marketing cooperative based in Van Nuys,  reported Wednesday that what had been an unpromising 1988 turned into the  firm's best year, generating record revenue and earnings for its 6,000 farmers  and packers in California and Arizona.  </P> <P> The results were reported at Sunkist's 95th annual meeting, which was held in a  sprawling exposition hall on the Ventura County Fairground, as rain lashed the  coast and freezing temperatures threatened nearby orange and lemon groves.  </P> <P> But for now the focus was on last year, which also, recalled President Russell  L. Hanlin, began with bad weather, lower-than-normal quality of fruit and a  smaller-than-expected crop to market. All the same, he said, Sunkist's sales  and other revenue totaled $886.6 million, up about 4%, despite what he called  "one of the poorest Valencia crops in memory."  </P> <P> The cooperative paid $645.9 million of that to its members, a 4.4% increase  over that paid in 1987, which also broke the record set in 1985.  </P> <P> Adding internally generated sales by Fruit Growers Supply, a sister company  that produces packing materials and other supplies for Sunkist, made the  cooperative a billion-dollar enterprise last year for the first time, Hanlin  said.  </P> <P> However, domestic sales dropped $10 million last year because of the small crop  and lower quality, he said. But export sales rose $35 million, the fifth  straight yearly increase. Foreign sales benefited from the government's  "targeted export assistance" program, which provides supplementary financing  for market development.  </P> <P> "At the same time," Hanlin said, "we were terribly disappointed that the new  treaty with Japan on citrus (and beef) did not address the enormous duties  which must be paid on imported oranges in that country."  </P> <P> Sunkist had sought to persuade U.S. trade negotiators to seek to reduce Japan's  tariffs on imported oranges instead of gaining entry for more fruit, judging  that lowering duties first would eventually pave the way to increasing citrus  import quotas. Florida's citrus industry sought increased volume to augment  exports of its specialty, orange juice.  </P> <P> The cooperative's export goal this year is to open "the potentially large  Korean market" for fresh oranges, Hanlin said.  </P> <P> The new fiscal year so far has produced uneven results, he said. Lemons and  grapefruit "are off to quite a good beginning," but the present navel orange  crop was slow to reach marketable size and sweetness. Freezing temperatures  just before Christmas hurt crops in some areas, while high winds damaged  oranges in Southern California.  </P> <P> "We have undoubtedly sustained additional damage during the course of the past  three nights, when temperatures dropped well below freezing," Hanlin said, but  he added that it is too soon to assess the extent.  </P></p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Jury awards Dollars 105m in damages against GM GENERAL Motors, the embattled automobile company, yesterday suffered a blow to its image and finances when an Atlanta jury ruled that it must pay over Dollars 105m in damages to the parents of a teenager who died in the fiery crash of a GM pick-up truck. Some Dollars 101m of the award took the form of punitive damages, levied as punishment on the company, while Dollars 4.25m was awarded for the life of the youth. GM said the verdict was incorrect and it intended to appeal. The case is part of a major controversy over the safety of certain of GM's full-sized pick-up trucks. Critics claim that vehicles built between 1973 and 1987 are firetraps because the fuel tanks are side-mounted, outside the frame of the vehicle, and are likely to catch fire in side-impact collisions. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against GM over truck accidents and last month Federal regulators opened an inquiry into the safety of the vehicles. GM insists the trucks are safe, but if the regulators decide otherwise it could mean the recall of some 4.7m trucks, at a cost to the company of millions of dollars. The Atlanta case, which could encourage further costly legal action against the company, gained celebrity status when a former GM engineer, who had previously testified on behalf of the car company, took the witness stand and alleged that GM had known for years that the trucks were firetraps. GM said after the verdict that it was confident the inquiry by federal regulators would bear out its contention that its trucks were safe. It was not surprising that 'jurors sometimes can look past the complicated technical facts and judge large companies on an emotional level in sympathy with the plaintiff'. GM said it did not intend to order a recall of its pick-up trucks. General Motors yesterday stepped up its aggressive marketing of MasterCard credit cards by launching a gold GM MasterCard, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The company also said its regular GM MasterCard, launched five months ago, had already attracted 4.5m card-holders.</p>

"We request the Goldstone Commission to investigate the  massacre as an urgent priority and to appoint both local and  international investigators," read a statement issued by Ed  Tillett on behalf of the IFP. "Zulu marchers in support of King  (Goodwill) Zwelithini's declaration of Zulu sovereignty were  fired upon by unidentified gunmen," it continued.    "Reports have also been received that shots were fired on  marchers from assassins who concealed themselves within the  ranks of march participants. The marchers were also fired upon  by strategically positioned rooftop snipers. Their presence was  confirmed by a large number of independent witnesses. The  attacks were clearly well planned and added a sinister new  dimension to political violence in this country. The majority  of the shooting victims were Zulus.    "Earlier today the IFP received information of an alleged  African National Congress plot to infiltrate agent provocateurs  among Zulu marchers. These elements were instructed to fire  randomly on march participants with the intention of triggering  a violent counter-response in order to discredit its (Zulu)  organisers and link the accompanying chaos to the IFP."    The statement continued: "In the wake of the attacks, the  IFP believes the ANC is attempting to create a climate of fear  and hysteria in the country which would justify a Transitional  Executive Council-led crackdown against those standing outside  of the ANC and National Party-defined transition process."</p>

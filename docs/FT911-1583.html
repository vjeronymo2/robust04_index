			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Croatia 'on verge of war' as 16 die in clashes MR Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, yesterday said Yugoslavia's western republic was on the 'verge of open warfare' after the most violent clashes between Serbs and Croats since the Second World War. At least 16 people were killed and 20 wounded on Thursday night after hours of gunfighting in the village of Borovo Selo in northern Croatia. In a television address yesterday, Mr Tudjman said Croatia 'will reconsider overall relations with the republic of Serbia in light of the well-established fact that not only has Serbia supported and encouraged terrorist actions and insurrection . . . but has directly organised the clashes'. The shooting reportedly started when Croatian security forces entered the predominantly Serbian village, in search of three missing policemen. Mr Stipe Mesic, who will become federal president later this month, said: 'Some of the bodies had been butchered.' 'I hope reason prevails in the army. Until now the army has not permitted itself to side with the rebels,' Mr Tudjman said yesterday. The village is now sealed off. Relations between Serbs and Croats, Yugoslavia's two biggest ethnic groups, have deteriorated as Croatia's Serbs seek to secede from the western republic to join Serbia. Mr Tudjman accused Serbia, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, of encouraging rebellion among Croatia's Serbs. Armed clashes, bombs and the mining of railway lines have become increasingly frequent since last autumn when Serbs, who are in a majority in Croatia's southern region of Krajina, proclaimed autonomy. They say Krajina will join Serbia if Croatia seeks independence from Yugoslavia. Serbian demands for autonomy since March have spread to Serbs in northern Croatia. But the government of Croatia insists the independence-minded republic will secede if the present federation of six republics is not transformed into a loose organisation of independent states. The state presidency, the eight-member head of state which is made up of representatives from the six republics and two provinces, today will hold an emergency meeting.</p>

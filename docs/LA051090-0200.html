			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> HEIGHT OF FRANCISCAN PLAZA PLAN REJECTED  </P> <P> The developer of the controversial Franciscan Plaza in the city's historic  downtown area will ask the City Council for help to avoid restrictions imposed  this week by the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> Paul Farber, developer of the Camino Capistrano project, said Wednesday he had  filed an appeal with the council to overturn Tuesday night's decision by the  commission. The commission voted 2 to 1 to approve the second phase of the  project if Farber omits plans for a third floor and makes major modifications  to the plaza's parking structure lighting.  </P> <P> "I can't live with these restrictions," Farber said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Carolyn Nash called the project "too tall, too dense and too  massive. It does not meet code and does not meet the general policies of our  city's general plan."  </P> <P> Phase two of the Franciscan Plaza proposes a restaurant, retail and office  space on a half-acre parcel. Part of the project calls for the restoration of  the 19th-Century Avila Adobe, which would become the restaurant. The first  phase, which was completed in December, included a shopping plaza, five movie  theaters and a multilevel parking structure at the corner of Camino Capistrano  and Verdugo Street.  </P> <P> Farber said he is frustrated with the commission over the height of the  project. He asked for a variance on the city's 25-foot height limitations  downtown. Phase two proposes an average height of 32 feet.  </P> <P> "I've been working with the Planning Department for two and a half years on the  third floor, because of the way the property descends toward the back," Farber  said.  </P> <P> But it was the project's height that bothered Commissioner Mary Jane Forster.  </P> <P> "I think it's an absolutely beautiful project, but I can't support a third  story," she said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Wyatt Hart voted to approve the project with the variance for the  third floor. Commissioner Gil Jones abstained, and Commissioner Jim Erickson  was absent.LEN HALL  </P></p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Finance director at Independent is asked to resign THE INDEPENDENT newspaper has asked for the resignation of Ms Suzanna Taverne, its finance director, Raymond Snoddy writes. Ms Taverne, who was appointed finance director in March 1992, is eight months pregnant and was about to take maternity leave. The Independent is an Opportunity 2000 employer - part of the campaign to boost the position of women in the workplace. It is believed that Ms Taverne, who joined The Independent in 1990 from merchant bank SG Warburg as a strategic planning executive, was told that her job was to be offered to Mr Graham Luff, managing director of Newspaper Publishing, the company that publishes both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. The changes flow from a restructuring of management following the arrival of Mr Patrick Morrissey as chief executive. Mr Luff, a qualified accountant, is now expected to return to the finance role while Ms Taverne has been offered the opportunity of working out her one-year notice at the paper in her original post of strategic planning. It is believed she is in negotiations over severance terms.</p>

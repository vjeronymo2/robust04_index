			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather slashes US maize crop FLOODS in the US Midwest and drought in the south-east have slashed US maize production to three-quarters of last year's levels, the Agriculture Department said yesterday. In its latest crop report the department estimated maize production at 7.23bn bushels compared with last year's record of 9.48bn. Yields were estimated at 113.1 bushels per acre - 18.3 bushels below last year's record of 131.4. The weather did less to reduce wheat production. The department estimated this year's output at 2.49bn bushels compared with 2.46bn last year. However, there have been widespread reports of disease problems in the Red River Valley of both Minnesota and North Dakota, as well as damage caused by moisture in South Dakota. The National Association of Wheat Growers has written to Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, to express concern about 'serious wheat quality problems'. The group is requesting establishment of a feed wheat purchase and donation programme. It has also warned that damage may begin to appear in export cargoes. Despite the damage this year's wheat crop is expected to swell surplus stocks. Because China and Russia have been largely absent from the world market, the USDA has cut its wheat export projection to 1.35m bushels. The figure last year was 50m. US soyabean production will be an estimated 1.9bn bushels, about 13 per cent below last year and the lowest output since 1988. Cotton production is estimated at 17.9m bales, a rise of 10 per cent on last year despite lack of rain in cotton-growing regions.</p>

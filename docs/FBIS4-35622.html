			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Armed Forces Command of the </F> Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date not given]    [Text] In the context of the escalation in the military  situation and in an open challenge leveled against all the Arab  and international efforts aimed to bring about an end to the  fighting in Yemen, the al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa has launched  missile and air strikes against the residential quarters and  vital civil installations in Aden. Yesterday at dawn, Aden came  under a missile attack aimed at civilian residential quarters.  The missiles were engaged by our air defenses, which shot down  one of the missiles in flight while another missile fell into  the sea. This morning two enemy aircraft tried to bomb the  little Aden refinery, one of the vital and important economic  installations belonging to our Yemeni people. Our air defenses  succeeded in foiling this treacherous attempt, which failed to  achieve its objectives. However, one of the houses of the  innocent citizens in little Aden was hit, killing a number of  women and children. The Command of the Armed Forces in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, while condemning these barbarous  acts which violate all the rules of war, reserves the right to  respond strongly and decisively to this kind of aggression. Let  those who are warned take heed.</p>

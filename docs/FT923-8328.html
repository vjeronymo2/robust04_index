			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Australian energy unit turns round CALTEX Australia, the Sydney-based petroleum group, has returned to the black in the first half to June, helped by a big asset sale. However, the company yesterday announced a heavy restructuring programme which will cut the workforce by almost 14 per cent. The company turned after-tax losses of ADollars 18.4m (USDollars 13.6m) into ADollars 7.9m profits on a 2.5 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 1.64bn from ADollars 1.59bn. The interim dividend has again been passed. The result included a ADollars 5.3m abnormal pre-tax profit - compared with nil previously - mostly comprising a ADollars 7.9m profit on the sale of a crude oil carrier. 'Whilst pressures on the industry, including sustained competition, are unlikely to abate, directors are determined to see that the Caltex group will emerge as an efficient and low-cost entity,' said Mr Barry Murphy, chairman and chief executive. The result followed a reduced interest bill of ADollars 27.3m compared with ADollars 34.8m and depreciation of ADollars 32.2m against ADollars 31.3m. Tax took ADollars 10.9m down from a ADollars 4.5m credit previously.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banesto quells Spanish banking's ridicule - A forthcoming rights issuse which could net Pta53bn FOR YEARS now it has been fashionable among the chattering core of Madrid's financial community to muse loudly and often, on the imminent demise of both Banesto, Spain's third largest bank, and its mercurial chairman, Mr Mario Conde. That will probably change with Wednesday's announcement that JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is throwing its weight behind a rights issue being prepared by Banesto by assembling a group of subscribers who could end up holding 10 per cent of the bank. Yesterday the gallery was silent. The arrangement is a sweet one for Banesto. The issue will raise, if it is taken up, Pta53bn (Dollars 452m) in one of the biggest ever capital increases in Spain. Normally, this news would have been greeted as just another effort by Banesto to claw money from its shareholders. But JP Morgan's presence is a startling vote of confidence in the bank. Not least because it has chosen Banesto as the first investment for the Dollars 1bn Corsair investment fund it closed last week after signing up 46 blue chip US institutional and individual subscribers. The US bank researched Banesto for seven months before committing itself to leading a group of investors who will guarantee to spend Dollars 200m on the rights issue. Mr Conde is himself a member of the group and could more than double his personal stake in Banesto from 2 per cent to 4.5 per cent. The psychology of this is everything. When Mr Conde helped rescue Banesto from takeover in 1987, it was an entangled mess of rival family industrial and banking interests, living off a cosy interest rate arrangement between Spain's banks and regular asset disposals every time banking profits dipped. In undoing that and separating Banesto's banking and industrial businesses, Mr Conde made enemies and gathered critics. Many of his grand plans failed - in late 1990 he was forced to call off a flotation of the Banesto industrial group after the Gulf crisis took the wind out of the markets. That could have raised more than Pta75bn at the time. Since then, he has been forced to sell industrial assets off piecemeal. His attention has been diverted from core banking and many analysts have wondered whether, as an industrialist by training, he is fit to run a bank. But JP Morgan has found something it likes. On fundamentals, Banesto is not Spain's best bank. It just meets the country's capital adequacy ratios; last year it recorded the sharpest bad debt growth among big banks; and it reported a 23 per cent fall in profits. Moreover, it is struggling to meet Bank of Spain demands that it reduce its exposure in industry to 40 per cent of equity and, later, to 20 per cent. At the moment, Banesto's exposure in industry is some 52 per cent of equity and it was always going to have to correct this by either withdrawing from industry or increasing capital. It is now doing both. Banesto officials say the group will continue to shed industrial assets  - a policy JP Morgan will probably have insisted on for its Corsair investors. And, on closer scrutiny, Banesto's bad debts turn out to be covered better than is the case at any big Spanish bank, apart from Banco Santander. Moreover, the group's profits fall disguised a healthy profit rise in the core banking business. And even critics acknowledge that Banesto has the best electronic information systems of any Spanish bank. As cost control becomes a serious factor in Spanish bank profitability, Mr Conde's planning might begin to pay its way. A Pta53bn flood of new cash would go a long way towards solving the capital squeeze that dogs Banesto year after year. But, in order to place himself and the bank well within the Bank of Spain's capital requirements on industrial holdings, Mr Conde still has to see through the sale of a regional banking affiliate, Banco de Madrid, to Deutsche Bank. Banesto is said to be asking about Pta60bn for the bank. The Deutsche Bank has reportedly offered Pta40bn. So there is still some way to go. The Germans, who need to grow their Spanish operation away from Catalonia, could still be tempted by other targets. But the point now is that, assuming the rights issue goes well, Mr Conde can stop running to his appointments. With the JP Morgan deal, things may be coming right and even the sceptics are impressed. 'We are all looking for the catch,' said Mr Frederick Artessani, of brokers Benito y Monjardin, 'but we can't seem to find one.'</p>

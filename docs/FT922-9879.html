			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Clashes in Bosnia intensify: EC says escalated conflict could lead to a reconsideration of peace efforts SHELLS exploded every few seconds near the centre of Sarajevo yesterday as the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina escalated into full-scale civil war. Sarajevo radio said the parliament building and Bascarsija, the oriental bazaar in the city centre, had been set ablaze and that Bosnia's mainly Moslem militia were advancing strongly into Serbian-controlled districts. But Belgrade radio said the Serbs were defending their positions with the help of the federal army. The EC's current president, Portugal, said the scale of the fighting and the killing of an EC peace monitor at the weekend could make the Community reconsider its peace efforts. 'This is tragic and unacceptable and could lead the European Community to seriously rethink the usefulness of continuing its efforts and sacrifices to mediate in a conflict in which those involved apparently want to maintain this or an even higher level of violence,' said Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's foreign minister. However, Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia, told the BBC that the talks must continue. 'I don't think the Community as such can just give up and forget about it. 'There is so much misery going on in Bosnia and most of the people don't want this to happen at all. It's just quite a big minority who want to fight and we've got to somehow or other see what we can do to stop it.' The EC monitoring team is suspending its operations in all former Yugoslav republics after a Belgian member of the EC team was killed near Mostar on Saturday. A journalist reached yesterday afternoon by telephone in Sarajevo, said: 'There are several explosions per minute. People are running madly on the streets looking for cover." 'The situation is very, very serious,' said Mr Marrack Goulding, the senior UN envoy, who arrived in Belgrade yesterday to assess the feasibility of a peacekeeping force in Bosnia. 'It is essential that all sides should exercise the same restraint and make the ceasefire work.' He is expected to fly to Sarajevo today and then to the Croatian capital, Zagreb. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, last night appealed for foreign military intervention. Even as the fighting continued, EC and UN monitors were still trying to rekindle local talks on a truce. UN sources said the Bosnian forces had handed 90 Yugoslav troops over to UN peace-keepers after capturing them in an ambush in Sarajevo at the weekend. On Sunday, the EC and UN had mediated a safe passage for the army convoy in exchange for the release of Mr Izetbegovic, detained on Saturday by federal army troops at the Sarajevo airport after his return from the EC-sponsored peace talks in Lisbon. One witness to the fighting in Sarajevo said: 'There is a smell of ugliness about the fighting today'. Belgrade television showed the wreckage of the weekend violence, including charred corpses of federal soldiers and burnt-out buildings. Some 500 people have been killed and at least 450,000 have been driven from their homes since fighting erupted in March over Bosnian independence. Serbs, who make up 31 per cent of Bosnia's 4.4m population, staunchly oppose independence, backed by the republic's Moslems and Croats. Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army, currently control more than half of Bosnia's territory. Tanjug yesterday said Serb irregulars had gained control of the predominantly Moslem towns of Gorazde in southeast Bosnia and Doboj, in northern Bosnia. Last night the presidency of the newly proclaimed Yugoslav republic, comprising only Serbia and Montenegro, ordered its citizens within the federal army to withdraw within 15 days. But 80,000 of the more than 100,000 troops stationed in Bosnia are from the republic itself and the order does not mention withdrawal of equipment.</p>

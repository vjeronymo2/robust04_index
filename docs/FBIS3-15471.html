Gerashchenko criticized "the policy of economic  stabilization  through lower inflation favored by the Ministry of Finance". He  also against [as received] a policy of financial encouragement  of all productions. "This will not lead to long-term  stabilization with the subsequent production boom but result in  even greater inflation", he said.    Gerashchenko dwelt on major economic indices of 1993. In his  opinion, "the most viable sector of the reformed economy is,  paradoxically, the agro-industrial complex". In his words, the  agricultural production recession was only four per cent in  1993, which is only 87 per cent of 1990.    Speaking of the activities of commercial banks, the bank  chairman noted their "passiveness due to the uncertainty in  which branches to invest". The bank chairman actually admitted  the government has insufficiently elaborated the industrial  policy.</p>

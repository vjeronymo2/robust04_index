			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Time to set sail COWES WEEK this year will be much enlivened by the presence of the fleet of ten identical 67-ft yachts which will race against each other in the British Steel Challenge Yacht Race around the world starting on September 26. The race is the brainchild of Chay Blyth who did a bit of lateral thinking on yacht racing. Whereas most races are determined by a combination of hi-tech nautical engineering and the crew's skill, with very often the competitor with the most money to throw at the problem coming in first, this race, for the first time, pits ten identical yachts (with hulls made from British Steel and designed by David Thomas) against each other. In other words, for the first time, the skill, drive and determination of the crew should determine the winners. What further makes the whole enterprise so interesting is that although each yacht is skippered by a properly-trained yachtsman the rest of the crew on each boat are all amateur volunteers They are from every walk of life - dentists, doctors, carpenters, policemen, solicitors, secretaries, vets, crane-drivers, funeral directors, and chefs - each with his or her own reason for wanting to spend the next eight months in some of the most uncomfortable conditions known to man. All this should give the social set something a little different to think about as they make their merry way from boat to shore, dexterously changing from seafaring togs to black-tie and back again. As anybody who has ever been to Cowes knows, the matter of dress is of crucial importance. Real sailing gear should, above all, look properly broken in - nothing too bright or too new should ever hit the deck. And when it comes to colour there is really no choice - the colours of the Senior Service have always been navy-blue and white and they are hard to beat. Sensibly, when it came to designing a range of functional, tough sailing gear suitable for every nautical mood from bone-aching arctic winds to scalding tropics, Uffindell &amp; West stuck to these tried and tested colours. Made by Kent &amp; Curwen, the sportswear specialists, the range offers something for anybody who likes messing around in boats as well as for those who just like to dress down at home. Reasonably priced, at Pounds 35 for a sweatshirt, Pounds 26 for a piquet polo shirt, Pounds 28 for Bermuda shorts, Pounds 39 for jogger pants, it is all good sturdy stuff. As you can see from the photograph here, the range is for men and women, much of it, like the T-shirts and polo shirts are unisex, but all of it designed not for show but for comfort and practicality. It can be bought by mail by telephoning 0793-706888 or by writing to Uffindell &amp; West, PO Box 200, SN2 5BD.</p>

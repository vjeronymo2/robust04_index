			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (1): Democracy takes root - Korea has much to feel proud of but it also has ample cause for concern as the country's success has bred new problems. Whoever succeeds President Roh next February will have to face many stiff challenges A SENSE of malaise pervades South Korea in the fifth and final year of President Roh Tae Woo's Sixth Republic. That is surprising given the considerable achievements of his administration. Democracy has taken root and is flourishing. The influence of the military, which dominated post-war politics, is declining and none of the presidential candidates has a military background. Labour and student unrest is subsiding as Koreans exercise their democratic powers  - most recently by almost denying the government a parliamentary majority in the National Assembly elections in March. The economy is still one of the world's fastest expanding, with an expected growth rate of at least 7 per cent this year following a 8.4 per cent gain in 1991. Gross national product and per capita income nearly doubled in the past five years. South Korea is winning its own cold war with North Korea, which is suffering growing economic problems as it becomes isolated in a non-communist world. Tensions are gradually easing on the peninsula as the two sides take the first steps toward eventual unification. They signed treaties last December banning nuclear weapons and promoting economic exchanges. Difficulties remain in implementing these pacts, particularly procedures for nuclear inspections in North Korea which the US government believes may soon have its own bomb. But there is optimism in Seoul that closer co-operation between the two Koreas is not far off. The reason why Koreans are worried, in spite of these favourable developments, is that the country is breeding a new set of problems. Rapid economic growth is fuelling inflation and raising wages, which is eroding South Korea's international competitiveness. Policy decisions are taking longer to reach as the strength of the democratic opposition increases. The unification process threatens to place a heavy financial burden on Seoul. Whoever succeeds President Roh next February and inaugurates the Seventh Republic will have to tackle these challenges as South Korea reaches a historical turning point. This is the completion of the country's transformation from a developing nation into a mature economy. But the transition is provoking new questions and doubts about Korea's future. The next stage in the country's development is less easy to predict with confidence. Talk about Korea becoming the next Japan has become muted. Instead, attention is focused on whether South Korea can maintain the momentum that has made it the world's 15th largest economy. The answer will largely depend on whether South Korea succeeds in restructuring its industry. The development of competitive advanced technologies and the establishment of profitable businesses in areas where the country can enjoy a strong competitive advantage are necessary to support its export-dependent economy. The country must reduce its dependence on light manufacturing and heavy industries, which prospered on cheap labour. South Korean wages are no longer low and are the second highest in Asia after Japan. This reflects the growth of organised labour following the introduction of full democracy in 1987 and the strong negotiating power workers have in an economy marked by labour shortages. Korean companies have the breathing space to make the necessary adjustments to their industrial structure. They are establishing factories in other low-wage Asian countries, including China and Vietnam, to keep production costs under control. Korea is targeting Asia to balance the loss of market share by some sectors in the US and Europe. South-east Asia may soon surpass the US as Korea's biggest export market. South Korea's family-owned business groups, or chaebol, must be careful not to allow their successful expansion in Asia to dissuade them from undertaking the difficult task of reforming themselves. The chaebol, which dominate the Korean economy, have been the main engines behind the country's industrialisation since the 1960s and their growth was fuelled by cheap government loans. But the government believes that they have become too large and unwieldly, with their activities spread across a wide range of industrial sectors. Credit restrictions have been imposed to force the chaebol to specialise and improve their efficiency, but to little avail. Although the chaebol complain about increased financing costs as a result of the credit controls, they still borrow and invest too much in unproductive areas, the government claims. A change might be effected if family ownership of the chaebol is reduced. Only about 30 per cent of the main chaebol subsidiaries are publicly listed and the government wants more of them open to outside investment, particularly from financial institutions such as banks. The government argues that institutional ownership will lead to improved management as family owners vacate top positions. A more effective reform of the chaebol would be to reduce the barriers and controls that still protect them from some competitive pressures. This would include eliminating the remaining import barriers and, more importantly, introducing full financial deregulation. An expected rise in interest rates that would follow liberalisation would probably force the chaebol to dispose of unproductive assets. Allowing the chaebol unlimited access to foreign loans could also encourage divestments. Foreign investors are cautious about lending to the chaebol because they have high gearing ratios, a legacy from their days of easy credit. Selling assets would lower the chaebol's debt burden and attract international lenders. However, the government is reluctant to give up its control over the economy and, in particular, command of the financial system. The strong role of the state in economic management has characterised South Korea's development. Although government intervention proved effective in building up Korean industry, it is producing harmful side effects as the economy matures. For example, the government's powerful influence on the financial system has led to distortions in credit allocation, hampering the development of entrepreneurial small and medium businesses. The government is committed in principle to financial liberalisation by 1997, but scepticism remains whether that deadline will be met. Deregulation and liberalisation would mean the acceptance of greater foreign involvement in the Korean economy. That is a large psychological hurdle for Koreans, who distrust outside interference, to overcome. The pace of economic liberalisation will be determined by the unification process, which could produce contradictions in government policy. If South Korea is forced to absorb North Korea in the next few years as a result of a political upheaval similar to that which occurred in Germany in 1989, Seoul will have to rely on foreign capital and industrial investments to help it revive the north. This is one factor that could accelerate liberalisation. But Korea will become a more self-absorbed country as it tackles the immense task of unification. The government may argue that economic controls are still needed to co-ordinate state and corporate efforts in rebuilding North Korea. South Korea's next president could confront perhaps the most tumultuous period in the country's history since the Korean War if unification occurs soon. Korea's great strength is the strong sense of national purpose that emerges in times of crisis, but that sentiment could rest uneasily with Korea's need to finish internationalising its economy even as it becomes reunited.</p>

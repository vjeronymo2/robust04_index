			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / EC postal reform faces hitches DRAFT legislation to increase competition in EC postal services could be ready this autumn if ministers agree to push ahead with liberalisation. The European Commission said yesterday it hoped ministers would press for formal proposals on June 16, with a view to agreeing legislation as early as next summer. But Commission 'guidelines' on the next moves, published yesterday, indicate several difficult problems. In particular, months of talks with consumers, postal administrations, governments and unions have failed to produce a detailed definition of the areas which should remain under the control of national postal monopolies. In a discussion document last year the Commission said it favoured opening express services and the mailing of publications to greater competition, and liberalising direct mail and cross-border postal services. It indicated it might allow national monopolies to retain control over domestic personal and business correspondence, but industry and consumers have yet to agree on the precise weight and price of mail which would fall into this reserved area. The Commission said yesterday it wanted to set an acceptable overall definition of the so-called 'universal service' and reserved areas, rather than build liberalisation of the sector on the shaky foundation of a series of court rulings. Mr Geoffrey Cruikshanks of the Association of European Express Carriers said yesterday that the Commission should allow competition in the market to improve the quality of services, rather than trying to influence performance with legislation. The Commission said there appeared to be general agreement on the need for EC action in separating regulation and operation of postal services, defining universal services, setting common criteria for access to the market and quality of service, and setting technical standards.</p>

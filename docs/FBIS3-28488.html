This is malicious slander and unpardonable, open challenge  to  the peaceloving DPRK which has no nuclear arms.    Ozawa unhesitatingly spread the fiction of "nuclear  armament", going far beyond the limit of "nuclear suspicion"  against the DPRK over which the Japanese reactionaries have  raised a hue and cry up until now. Judging from this, one can  see to what extremes their anti-DPRK intrigues have gone.    Ozawa made such tricky remarks adding fuel to fire at a time  when a grave crisis that might push the situation to a  catastrophic phase has been created due to the despicable  perfidy of the United States, prompted by an extremely sinister  intention to force the DPRK at any cost to accept the demand of  the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency for a  total inspection, and seek international "sanctions" and  pressure to isolate and stifle the DPRK by misleading world  opinion.    It is not hard to gather that lurking behind it is also a  wicked intention to justify Japan's nuclear armament and design  to turn it into a nuclear power and hasten this in real earnest  by spreading the fiction of the North's "nuclear armament".    Japan launched a large nuclear-capable carrier rocket H-2 on  February 4 and is soon to ignite Monju, its first fast breeder  reactor. A series of facts clearly prove in practice that the  Japanese reactionaries' moves toward a nuclear power now are  being stepped up in a very grave phase.    This is, indeed, a grave obstacle to the denuclearization of  Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula and poses a big  threat to the Korean and other Asian people.    The Japanese reactionaries' stepped-up nuclear armament is  aimed at gratifying their criminal design of overseas aggression  the first target of which is the Korean peninsula.    Such aggressive design of theirs was fully manifested in the  fact that Ozawa made no scruples of uttering meaningful words  saying Japan's countermeasure for the event of "contingency" on  the Korean peninsula should be examined.    It is as foolish as trying to destroy a rock with their  heads  to attempt to stretch their tentacles of reinvasion against the  DPRK in collusion with the United States.    We are following with heightened revolutionary vigilance  their anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves, and our people and  People's Army will never pardon those who try to infringe on  their national sovereignty and dignity.    The Japanese reactionaries must look squarely at the  steadfast will and determination of the Korean people and act  with discretion and promptly stop the anti-DPRK intrigues.</p>

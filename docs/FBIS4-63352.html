			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 22 TASS -- On his way to Brussels,  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev is to make on Monday a  stop-over in the town of Wunsdorf in west Germany. While in  Wunsdorf, he is scheduled to visit the headquarters of Russia's  Western Army Group in Germany, as well as to meet with officials  of the Deutsche Bank to discuss the funding of Russian troop  withdrawal from Germany, a spokesman for the Russian Defence  Ministry told TASS.    On Tuesday, the Russian defence minister will arrive in  Brussels. Later in the day, he is to address the NATO leadership  and defence ministers with a report on the basic principles of  Russia's military doctrine.    On Wednesday, Grachev is scheduled to have a series of  bilateral meetings with NATO defence ministers, including with  his U.S. counterpart William Perry. He will also attend a joint  meeting of NATO defence ministers, which is to concentrate on  European security and on prospects for NATO's political and  military cooperation with Central and East European states, as  well as with the CIS. At this meeting, the Russian defence  minister is expected to expound on Russia's attitude towards  NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.    On the eve of his visit to Brussels, Grachev told reporters  that Russia was interested in a more "serious and substantial  format of relations with NATO than the one envisaged by the  Partnership for Peace programme".    "We will offer an alternative scheme of partnership, already  approved by the Russian president. Its essence is that Russia  should join the programme with due regard for its significant  role and place in the system of European security and the United  Nations", the Russian defence minister pointed out.    Russia attaches much importance to Grachev's upcoming visit  to Brussels. President Boris Yeltsin expects the NATO  leadership to recognize the special status of Russia as a great  power. This "can be done either through a protocol within the  Partnership for Peace framework, or through a separate bilateral  document between NATO and the Russian Federation", Yeltsin told  TASS on Friday.    From May 26, the Russian defence minister will start an  official visit to Belgium. He is due to meet his Belgian  counterpart Leo Delcroix and to visit some military  installations. On May 27, Grachev will return to Moscow.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Not Allowing Manufacturers To Use Both LIFO and FIFO Credit Accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA requested comments on whether or not the Agency should consider implementing alternative credit accounting schemes which incorporate combinations of both LIFO and FIFO. Both EMA and DDC supported the alternative of allowing manufacturers to choose freely between LIFO and FIFO (referred to hereafter as LIFO/FIFO).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, EMA and DDC claimed that LIFO/FIFO provides the maximum credit accounting flexibility, and therefore the engine manufacturers prefer this credit accounting system. EPA believes that FIFO, in contrast with LIFO, provides the flexibility needed to encourage manufacturers to participate fully in the program. In addition, EPA believes that LIFO/FIFO would provide marginal additional flexibility over FIFO, and this additional flexibility would not be warranted in light of the concerns that the Agency has regarding use of this accounting system. These concerns are discussed later in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, EMA and DDC commented that the ABT program has a built-in discount that is incurred when credits are calculated. Some engine families have more than one transient cycle conversion factor, and only one, the most environmentally-safe, conversion factor may be used during credit calculations. EMA and DDC indicated that this calculation results in an estimated 10&hyph;20% credit ``discount.'' EPA points out that this fact applies to all credit accounting systems and therefore should not be considered as a reason to choose a particular accounting system. Furthermore, this ``discount'' applies only to those engine families containing multiple horsepower ratings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, EMA and DDC were also concerned that the averaging program would no longer exist under FIFO. On the contrary, the averaging program could still be used by manufacturers when there are no previously banked credits available, such as when a manufacturer either has no banked credits going into a model year, or in cases where the previously banked credits do not adequately cover credit needs for that model year. Under such circumstances, manufacturers may use the credits generated in the current model year in averaging and would not be required to take a discount on these credits. Credit surpluses remaining after averaging has occurred could be banked for future use, with the discount taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, EMA and DDC commented that under LIFO/FIFO, credit life cannot be extended, as EPA fears. Although credit life cannot be extended without the generation of new credits, EPA believes that the credit accounting system used should not allow manufacturers to circumvent the environmental safeguards that have been put into the program. LIFO and FIFO separately maximize the effects of different safeguards, and under LIFO/FIFO a manufacturer can use LIFO in some years to avoid credit discounting and FIFO in others to avoid credit expiration. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See ``Calculating Credits Using LIFO and FIFO Credit Accounting Methods,'' Memorandum from Paulina Chen to the docket for this rulemaking (May 14, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRDC, MECA, and ALA commented that EPA should not adopt the other proposed credit accounting alternatives and echoed concerns similar to those of EPA's regarding the problems associated with allowing manufacturers to use both LIFO and FIFO credit accounting. These concerns are: (1) The loophole created by LIFO/FIFO which could shield the manufacturers from the full impact, and subsequently diminish the overall effectiveness, of the environmental safeguards of the ABT program, and (2) the substantial increase in the complexity of the ABT program, which could also increase the potential for errors in credit tracking and affect the ultimate compliance findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, EPA does not believe that LIFO/FIFO is more suitable than FIFO, because the apparent disadvantages of LIFO/FIFO outweigh any potential advantages that have been claimed by commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Retroactivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised regulation changes the credit accounting provision for the 1992 model year reports. End-of-year reports are due within 90 days after the end of the 1992 model year. Manufacturers can correct these 90 day reports within 180 days after their submission. Presumably all manufacturers submitted their 90 day reports prior to the publication of the NPRM. Publication of the NPRM on June 10, 1993 and delays and uncertainty about the outcome of this final rule led most manufacturers to hold off in submitting their corrections report. EPA believes that this is not a retroactive change as it applies to a report that has not yet been submitted. Given the questions raised on EPA's authority to promulgate a retroactive change to the ABT regulations, and the lack of any compelling reason to revise earlier reports, EPA has decided to not make any revisions to regulations applicable to 1991 and earlier model years.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

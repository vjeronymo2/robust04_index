			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / High-security tax office to examine Queen's tax returns THE Queen's income tax return will almost certainly be scrutinised by Inland Revenue officials housed in a drab post-war building in South Wales, Andrew Jack writes. Until last week, when it emerged in a Commons written answer, the Revenue had refused to admit the existence of the Public Departments building at Tyglas Road in Llanishen, a suburb of Cardiff. About a dozen so-called Public Departments are based in different parts of the complex, which deal with the taxes of civil servants, members of the armed forces and other public employees. The centre is heavily guarded, with time-locks, double sets of doors, and opaque windows. Staff are heavily screened for security. Even tighter internal security measures surround a VIP unit within Public Department 1 in the building, which deals with the tax affairs of politicians, members of the security services and other prominent officials, including those members of the Royal Family who pay tax. Revenue officials and members of the Royal Household refused to give details about how much tax the Queen and the Prince of Wales might pay, arguing that they will be entitled to the same privacy as other taxpayers. But the memorandum of understanding for royal taxation released yesterday shows that they will be subject to interest on any late payments of tax - as well as refunds if they overpaid. Final details of what financial information the Queen sends to the Revenue have yet to be determined. The compilation of the figures will be conducted by the finance and property services division of the Royal Household, which is headed by Mr Michael Peat. A junior tax accountant has been hired by the Palace to help prepare the numbers. Mr Peat, who was made auditor of the privy purse in 1990, will supervise the process. a post held by his family for four generations.</p>

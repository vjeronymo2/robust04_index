			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ONLY 310 MOUNTAIN GORILLAS LEFT  </P> <P> The mountain gorilla will be extinct by the end of the century if action is not  taken now to protect it, Rwandan Foreign Minister Casmir Bizimungu told an  international conference on gorillas, official Radio Rwanda reported today.  </P> <P> The weeklong First International Gorilla Protection Fair opened Monday in  Kigali, Rwanda, the tiny east African country that is home to most of the  world's 310 mountain gorillas.  </P> <P> The purpose of the conference is to broaden public awareness of the gorilla's  plight, said the broadcast, monitored in Nairobi.  </P> <P> "We must preserve the gorillas' natural habitat," Bizimungu said. "If urgent  steps are not taken to protect mountain gorillas against poachers, they will no  longer exist in Rwanda by the end of the century," the broadcast noted.  </P> <P> The minister praised the work of American zoologist Dian Fossey, who dedicated  her life to studying gorillas and protecting them from poachers. But he said  such individual efforts are not enough.  </P></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar bears looking for more action - Currency Markets In the light of the dollar's dismal performance after concerted central bank intervention to support it last Friday, the foreign exchange markets will be testing the US currency's downside again this week. Cynical markets are expected to continue to ignore favourable economic fundamentals such as steady growth and low inflation in the US in favour of speculative activity. A host of US statistics, including a May survey of consumer confidence and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index, will be released this week. But economists do not expect the data to affect the market as dealers have been disregarding statistics for some time. In Germany, important cost of living indices and figures for industrial production and manufacturing output will be released this week. Under normal circumstances, statistics conforming with market forecasts of a stable inflation rate at about 3 per cent and a slowdown in the pace of growth might be expected to diminish sentiment towards the D-Mark. But most analysts believe traders are determined to drive the dollar down in an attempt to draw out further central bank action. The US government can expect little relief from the domestic monetary policies of its G7 partners. The Bundesbank has shown it is unwilling to cut its discount rate and the Bank of Japan, while vigorously intervening on behalf of the dollar last week, is unlikely to cut its interest rates while the government of Prime Minister Tsutomo Hata is in political difficulties. Furthermore, the Fed itself is unlikely to raise rates before the July 5-6 FOMC meeting, as US officials have been indicating that underlying inflationary pressures are under control. Sterling may test its upside against the dollar this week as investors relinquish their view that the UK economy is merely reflecting trends in the US. Last Friday's surprise headline figures on the UK current account deficit in the first quarter and a stable inflation profile could sustain the pound's strength against the dollar, pushing it up to the Dollars 1.56 level. Meanwhile, the D-Mark, the Swiss franc and the Dutch guilder may continue to benefit from jittery bond markets as they are perceived as safe haven currencies for investors seeking risk reduction. Developments on the European crosses could also be affected by investor perceptions of the outcome of the EU summit in Corfu.</p>

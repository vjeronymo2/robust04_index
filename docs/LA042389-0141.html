			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: ON THE STREET, BEING HOT IS BETTER THAN BEING GOOD  </P> <P> Wall Street has always liked winning streaks. Even though it spends a fortune  to hire the brainiest people it can find, the financial community is still very  partial to a hot hand. "I'd rather be hot than good," you could say, has always  been its motto.  </P> <P> Here are some of the people, concepts and things that are hot right now. Read  them quickly, because sometimes the flame doesn't burn for very long.  </P> <P> * Hottest Raider: Carl C. Icahn, the head of Trans World Airlines, is still the  man to follow if you are looking to make money from corporate restructurings.  Michael Lamb, president of Wealth Monitors in Kansas City, estimates that Icahn  has made more than $700 million from his investment in Texaco (which he tried  to take over); $300 million from his USX Corp. holdings (which he tried to take  over), and he could reap a $400-million profit if he decides to sell his stake  in TWA (which he took over). If you're looking for a hot hand to shake, Icahn's  the one.  </P> <P> * Hottest Mutual Fund Manager: David Alger, who runs the Alger Small  Capitalization Portfolio, has seen the value of his fund's holdings appreciate  20.21% so far this year. According to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks  these things, that's the best performance of any stock mutual fund so far this  year. The Alger Small Cap fund was up 17.5% in 1988, which was slightly better  than the market as a whole.  </P> <P> * Economist on a Roll: David Bostian, head of Bostian Research Associates, New  York, was the most accurate forecaster of U.S. economic growth and inflation in  1988, says Robert J. Eggert of the Blue Chip Economic Index, Sedona, Ariz.  Eggert surveys over 50 economists, and Bostian came the closest to predicting  both the GNP and consumer price index. Bostian now says the economy is  weakening, and the gross national product should grow at only 2.2% this year.  Inflation isn't a big problem, and interest rates should come down, he says.  </P> <P> * Matchmaker on Fire: While there aren't any official statistics, Wasserstein  Perella Group, the 1-year-old private investment banking firm, seems to have  been involved in the most new corporate mergers and restructuring transactions  in the first three months of 1989. Wasserstein Perella counts 14 deals it began  -- but hasn't necessarily completed yet -- in 1989, including involvement in  the proposed merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications.  </P> <P> * Analysts With the Midas Touch: Lawrence Harris of Bateman Eichler, Hill  Richards in Los Angeles was right on the money in a report last month when he  predicted that Lockheed Corp. would sell some assets and real estate and  repurchase stock. His report came out weeks before Lockheed did just that. And  Roger Redman, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis, was  on target when he predicted a restructuring at Control Data Corp.  </P> <P> * Hottest Investment Concept: Yuppies apparently want to make sure they can  afford to put their kids through college, so state bonds that help guarantee  the little yups a higher education are very popular. More than a dozen states  have already offered prepaid tuition plans or educational bonds, and another  dozen are thinking of doing so. The federal government countered recently by  making Series E savings bonds tax free, starting in 1989, for most people, if  the money is used for education.  </P> <P> * Explosive New Product: Of all the products put out by American corporations  within the past year, one of the most popular has been RJR Nabisco's  Teddygrahams, bite-sized cookies. Gorman's New Product News estimates that  Teddygrahams are now the third-best-selling cookie in the country, selling  about $120 million worth last year.  </P> <P> * Most Popular Scam: Telemarketing scams are the hottest thing on the dark side  of investing, according to Scott Stapf of the North American Securities  Administrators Assn. And, he says, this season there are three new phone scams.  In one, investors are sold precious metals that the scamster says will be  stored in a well-known bank. But the gold never quite makes it to the bank, and  the crook takes a hike. In the second, investors are sold interests in  restaurants that don't exist. And in the third scam, the crook puts his victims  into a family of scams. Stapf says this is being billed as a "hard-asset  management program."  </P> <P> * Most Surprising Company: Based on the last quarterly earnings it reported,  Jacobson Stores Inc. gave Wall Street one of the biggest favorable surprises.  According to the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, Jacobson reported  profits of $1.31 a share for its fourth quarter that ended in January. Wall  Street only expected $1.04.  </P> <P> * Hottest Stock: Shares of Silicon Systems, a California electronic equipment  manufacturer, have doubled to $20 from around $10 in the past few months.  Knight-Ridder Tradecenter, which keeps tabs on unusual stock activity, says  it's one of the hottest issues around.  </P> <P> Let's say a guy goes to the doctor, worried that he has cancer and only has  three months to live. "No," the doctor says, "you're all right. You've got  heart disease and you'll be alive for at least another six months."  </P> <P> "Thanks, doc," the relieved patient says, "that makes me feel a whole lot  better."  </P> <P> The stock market is the patient. And the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is the  doctor, who, by disclosing last week that inflation in consumer goods and  services was rising at just 6% a year, gave the patient a new lease on life.  </P> <P> The only trouble is that the financial markets, in looking at the silver  lining, failed to see the cloud.  </P> <P> The official explanation of why stocks rallied brilliantly last week was that  the government, when it reported that the nation's consumer price index rose  0.5% in March, made Wall Street feel a little better than it had been feeling,  although it didn't cure the disease. That, the stock market concluded, was  worth a nearly 42-point jump in the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday.  </P> <P> There are a lot experts who don't feel the same way about the latest inflation  figures. Rising prices, they say, are still very troublesome, even if March's  rate wasn't a blockbuster. And eventually, these experts predict, the financial  markets will pay dearly.  </P> <P> "The number released last week shows inflation rising at a rate of 6% in the  first quarter," says Rudolf Thumberg, economist with Ried Thumberg, a Westport,  Conn., financial research firm that tracks the Federal Reserve Board. "I would  say (the Fed) is not thrilled and almost certainly worried" about the latest  figure.  </P> <P> Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed a dedication toward fighting  inflation and has called 4.5% annual inflation unacceptable.  </P> <P> What makes the inflation situation even more troubling to some experts is the  fact that March's number did not include a steep rise in the price of gasoline  -- about 10 cents a gallon since late March. When gasoline prices start seeping  into the consumer price index, the experts say inflation will certainly be  aggravated. The higher inflation numbers that are expected in the months ahead  could lead, the experts believe, to another boost in interest rates.  </P> <P> If you didn't have your ear to the ground last week, you never would have  figured out why Vista Chemical Co. was one of the hottest stocks on Wall  Street.  </P> <P> On the surface, Vista looked like any other company that trotted out its  executives before a group of analysts to make some optimistic predictions. The  only difference was that Vista's stock soared before and after the Tuesday  meeting in New York, and the cause of the activity wasn't the record per-share  profits that the company was predicting.  </P> <P> Instead, analysts were chattering over the grapevine about how Vista, a  Houston-based specialty chemical company that one follower said is "intensely  worried about a takeover," was getting set to announce a special dividend. The  rumor even had a price: $30 a share, or about half what the company's shares  were selling for on the open market.  </P> <P> Vista would only say that it wants to enhance shareholder values -- it calls it  a mission -- but wouldn't be specific.  </P> <P> What do analysts think about the talk of a windfall dividend? They wouldn't be  surprised. Vista, they said, is intent on remaining independent and isn't  afraid to borrow money toward that goal.  </P> <P> The only thing in dispute, the analysts say, is when the company will take  aggressive action such as a special dividend. Most say there isn't any hurry.  </P> <P> A usually reliable Wall Street source says Pennzoil's stock portfolio these  days includes big -- but not big enough to disclose -- stakes in Lubrizol  Corp., Santa Fe Southern, Kerr-McGee Corp. and USX Corp. as well as Burlington  Resources. Will any of these become the target of a takeover by Pennzoil? Who  knows, the source says . . .  </P> <P> Not all of America's foreign trading partners are in favor of higher interest  rates. While the West Germans raised interest rates late last week, the  Japanese are said to be afraid that higher rates in the U.S. will boost the  value of the dollar. This, in turn, will increase America's trade deficit and  cause a revival of protectionist trade legislation in Washington .  </P> <P> Demand for chief executives rose sharply in the first quarter, according to  Korn/Ferry International, the management search firm. It said demand for all  executives was strongest on the East Coast, but hiring in the West and  Southeast was down . . .  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'STAR WARS'  </P> <P> For the last number of years, the United States and Soviet Union were at  loggerheads over the issue of "Star Wars." The Russians thick-headedly insisted  upon the relinquishment of the "Star Wars" project as a precondition to arms  reduction. The United States stood up to this demand and steadfastly refused to  be forced into its abandonment.  </P> <P> The Russians have finally seen the light and they no longer insist upon the  elimination of "Star Wars" as a precondition. But now we hear from Washington  that "Star Wars" is not worth a tinker's damn in the first place, and we  couldn't afford it if it was worth anything in the second place.  </P> <P> My question is: Did something get lost in translation for the last five years?  Alice, please come back from Wonderland; we need you.  </P> <P> MARTIN M. SHAPERO  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

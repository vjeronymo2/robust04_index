			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Harrington Kilbride on line with Pounds 1.27m Harrington Kilbride, the magazine group which came to the main market in December, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.27m in 1991. This was in line with the prediction of not less than Pounds 1.25m given by Mr Kevin Harrington, founder and managing director, in the prospectus. The rise from Pounds 1.01m was achieved on turnover up 50 per cent to Pounds 9.19m (Pounds 6.11m). Among the company's titles are Baby, Royal Dempster's and several business journals. Earnings emerged at 10.2p (8.1p) per share and, as was explained in the prospectus, there will be no dividend, though a payment at the interim stage of the current year is envisaged.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Amstrad beefs up its top management: Share price rises as consumer electronics group cuts pre-tax losses to Pounds 20.5m AMSTRAD, the troubled con-sumer electronics group, has rehired the technological wizard behind many of its earlier successes and is looking for a new chief executive as it seeks to restore profitability through growth and acquisition. The strategy includes closing Amstrad's Spanish subsidiary and measures to reduce the company's dependence on the professional personal computer business. Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, said that Mr Robert Watkins, who left Amstrad last year to become group managing director at Binatone, had returned to manage Dancall Radio, which Amstrad acquired last month. Mr Watkins, who was Amstrad's technical director, had been credited with helping to develop many of the company's 'blockbuster' products. Mr Sugar said: 'Mr Watkins put us in the satellite business and the personal computer business. His sole responsibility now will be to look after Dancall Radio.' The Danish cellular radio company is seen as the key to Amstrad's ambitions in mobile communications. Mr Malcolm Miller will take charge of the consumer products group, Amstrad's core business, while the new chief executive will be responsible for finding and managing acquisitions in areas, such as mobile communications and satellite systems, which have synergy with electrical and electronic products. Amstrad's results for last year showed that the group returned to profitability before charges. The share price gained 3p yesterday to close at 48p. Operating profits were Pounds 15m and the group earned interest income of Pounds 7.2m. Closure of the Spanish subsidiary, however, meant that Pounds 25m in goodwill was charged, leaving a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20.5m, compared with Pounds 70.7m. Turnover for the year to June 30 was Pounds 308.5m, 13.5 per cent down on the previous year's Pounds 356.5m. The 1992-93 figure included a contribution of Pounds 12.2m from acquisitions. Losses per share were 2p, cut from 6.7p; the company is paying a final dividend of 0.3p making a total of 0.5p. Mr Sugar said that Amstrad had continued to reduce both inventories and the lead-time of products, enabling it to increase net cash to Pounds 167m, from Pounds 162m last year. Analysts are suggesting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m for next year. Mr Sugar, who tried unsuccessfully to take the company private last year at 30p a share, says the core businesses can only generate profits of Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m a year. Split between 580m shares, he contends that earnings would be very low without substantial growth. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 24</p>

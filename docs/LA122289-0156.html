			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVESTOR GOT A BARGAIN IN BUYING FAILED S&amp;L;  </P> <P> FINANCE: REVLON CHAIRMAN RONALD O. PERELMAN STANDS TO GAIN MILLIONS AFTER  AGREEING TO TAKE OVER FIRST GIBRALTAR BANK OF HOUSTON.  </P> <P> When government officials sold dozens of failed savings and loans in the waning  days of 1988, some thrift experts criticized the deals as too generous for the  buyers and too rough on taxpayers.  </P> <P> Now the numbers on one of the largest deals are in, and the critics are saying  they were right.  </P> <P> Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of New York-based Revlon Inc. and the country's  fifth-richest person according to Forbes magazine, will recover $1.70 this year  for every $1 he invested last year in First Gibraltar Bank, a Houston savings  and loan, according to a confidential financial document obtained by Newsday.  </P> <P> First Gibraltar will provide Perelman with a $104-million profit for 1989,  according to figures derived from the document. In addition, tax breaks from  owning the S&amp;L will save Perelman $170 million in federal income taxes. The  profits and the tax savings combine to give Perelman about a 170% return on his  $160-million investment.  </P> <P> Making money isn't new for Perelman, who has built an estimated $2.75-billion  fortune from buying and selling companies. Perelman, 46, is regarded as one of  the nation's shrewdest investors.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, S&amp;L analysts were surprised when told of Perelman's return on  the purchase of First Gibraltar. "What this means is Perelman has gotten all  his money back," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., savings and loan expert who  criticized the First Gibraltar deal last year. "Everything from now on is pure  gravy. They could take that thing away from him tomorrow and he's already had a  hell of a good deal."  </P> <P> The purchase agreement calls for Perelman to get government assistance and tax  breaks for another nine years.  </P> <P> "It's a fantastic return," said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings  Institution in Washington after studying the nation's S&amp;L crisis. "If these  numbers are right, it's out of all proportion to the risks." He said risky  deals that turn out well usually have a return of about 30% a year.  </P> <P> Howard Gittis, a senior aide to Perelman, declined to comment. He said he  couldn't discuss First Gibraltar's financial performance because the  institution is in the process of selling some bonds.  </P> <P> The disclosure comes at a time of increasing concern on Capitol Hill about the  deals that savings-and-loan regulators arranged during the waning moments of  1988. Eager to unload money-losing S&amp;Ls, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,  led by M. Danny Wall, sold 68 failed institutions last December before the tax  breaks expired at year's end. The breaks allowed investors to deduct from their  other income whatever the S&amp;L would have lost if it hadn't been bailed out.  </P> <P> The cost of bailing out the savings and loans of the so-called "December deals"  and the nation's other sick S&amp;Ls is estimated at $160 billion.  </P> <P> House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) has said his  committee will investigate each of the December deals. The Perelman transaction  is the largest.  </P> <P> "Our chairman feels they're not cost-effective," said Julie Black, a  spokeswoman for the committee. "Gonzalez is really concerned that the  government did not get the best deals on these last-minute transactions." She  said First Gibraltar is likely to come up in hearings that are to begin Jan.  22.  </P> <P> Former Bank Board member Lawrence White defended the Perelman deal as the best  the government could arrange at the time. "I'm still convinced it's the best  deal we could get for taxpayers," said White, now a New York University  professor. He said it would have cost taxpayers more to liquidate the  institution.  </P> <P> White added that Perelman deserves to be compensated for the tremendous risks  he took in buying First Gibraltar. White said that no one knew for sure last  December whether the government would make good on the Bank Board promises to  S&amp;L investors.  </P> <P> Litan, however, said Perelman took little risk because the chances of the  government reneging were remote. He believes Perelman got such good terms  because he was one of the few people willing to take on a sick Texas S&amp;L.  </P> <P> First Gibraltar has about $9 billion in loans and other assets. About $4  billion worth are in default and losing money. Under the terms of Perelman's  takeover agreement, the government makes up the losses and guarantees a profit.  According to the financial document -- a confidential-offering circular used to  refinance First Gibraltar's debt -- the government will contribute about $700  million to the thrift this year.  </P> <P> With the government assistance, First Gibraltar will make about $130 million,  making it one of the most profitable S&amp;Ls in the country. Under the terms  of Perelman's takeover, he gets to keep 80% of the profits, or $104 million.  </P> <P> That's only part of Perelman's return. The rest comes in the form of a tax  break for MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, the company that owns First Gibraltar.  MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, 100% owned by Perelman, also owns cosmetics giant  Revlon.  </P> <P> MacAndrews &amp; Forbes can shield about $510 million in income in 1989, the  document said. At a 34% tax rate, that saves Perelman about $170 million in  taxes.  </P></p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Heathrow subsidence halts tube tunnelling Work on part of the Pounds 1.9bn London Underground Jubilee line extension was halted yesterday pending the outcome of an investigation into serious subsidence at Heathrow Airport. Tunnelling was stopped on two sections of the line, at London Bridge and Waterloo stations, because contractors are using the same tunnelling method suspected of causing the Heathrow collapse. The problems at Heathrow started on Friday when earth began slipping into the railway tunnel near the terminal three car park during construction of the Pounds 300m Heathrow express rail link to Paddington station. The London Underground station for terminal four is closed as is the car park for terminal three. Heathrow said flight departures were normal yesterday, and delays were no different from usual. On Sunday flights were up to 40 minutes late as airlines waited for passengers who had been delayed in arriving. The car park at terminal three is likely to remain closed until Thursday at the earliest, although Heathrow officials hope that traffic to the airport will have returned to normal by then. An inquiry is under way at Heathrow into the cause of the collapse. BAA, the airport operator, which is building the fast rail link in partnership with the British Railways Board, said it would take at least 10 days to find out what caused the tunnel collapse. Balfour Beatty, the contracting arm of BICC, the quoted UK cables company, is undertaking the construction work and was yesterday working to prevent further slippage. BICC's shares closed down 13p yesterday at 333p. Balfour Beatty said that until the cause of the subsidence was known it would be impossible to estimate the overall cost of the incident or to apportion blame. In addition to a Pounds 60m tunnelling contract at Heathrow, Balfour Beatty is one of the main contractors on the Jubilee line extension, with Taylor Woodrow, Costain and AMEC. The probe into the collapse has focused on the tunnelling technique, known as the new Austrian tunnelling method. Instead of using a cumbersome boring machine to cut the tunnel, sections are dug out with an excavator before being temporarily reinforced with wire mesh and concrete. This technique is used mainly for intricate work around stations; most of the 16-kilometre Jubilee line route is being cut using traditional methods. Picture, Page 10</p>

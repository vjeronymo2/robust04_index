			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol -- On 29 June the first session of the  Supreme Council of Crimea continued its work. Issues on the  program for economic reform in the autonomous republic, on the  structure of the government, and on target subsidies to people  with low incomes in connection with the expected rise in prices  for bread were put on the agenda.    The deputies approved a resolution on raising the excise  duties for wines, hard liquors, and beer produced in the  republic. The resolution will come into force as of 1 July. By  the way, its text coincides with a similar decree by the  president of Crimea which was signed and validated on 24 June.    The deputies postponed the issue on target subsidies so as  to  discuss it in the presence of Yuriy Meshkov.    The deputies decided to consider the situation which took  shape in the militia bodies after the approval by the Supreme  Council of Ukraine of amendments and additions to the law of  Ukraine "On militia" and "On the delimitation of powers between  the bodies of state authority of Ukraine and the Republic of  Crimea" on 28 June. In the opinion of Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of  the Supreme Council of Crimea, the Ukrainian parliament  "infringed upon the laws on the status of the Republic of Crimea  and on the delimitation of powers."    A deputy commission headed by deputy chairman of the Supreme  Council of Crimea Oleksiy Melnykov was set up to consider this  issue. On the same day the commission got down to work and met  the members of the collegium of the chief Directorate of  Internal Affairs in Crimea under the Ministry of Internal  Affairs of Ukraine. As Oleksiy Melnykov told the deputies, only  three members of the collegium agreed to work at the Chief  Directorate of Internal Affairs of Crimea. There were proposals  on the part of the deputies to lift a moratorium on holding the  Crimean referendum and terminate negotiations with the  delegation of the Ukrainian parliament.    The commission was charged with drafting a resolution on the  situation which took shape. The debate on the issue will be  continued at a regular plenary sitting on 30 June.</p>

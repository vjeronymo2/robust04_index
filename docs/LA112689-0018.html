			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRIGHT AND WRONGS;  </P> <P> THE AMBITION AND THE POWER (VIKING: $22.95; 768 PP.)  </P> <P> Jim Wright, the disgraced former speaker of the house, blossoms in this  exhaustive account of his rise and fall more splendidly than he ever seemed to  do while in power. John M. Barry, a veteran Washington journalist, spent more  than two years with the Texas congressman and his colleagues in the Democratic  leadership, nestled as close to the spine of raw political power as any  outsider could be. He attended scores of private meetings in Democratic inner  sancta, including some, apparently, where Wright made the very enemies who  helped bring him down. He was with Wright during all the high points of the  100th Congress in 1987-88, taking time out to visit the Republican side to talk  to Rep. Newt Gingrich, who "sat . . . like Madame Defarge, knitting together  his file of press clippings" about his elaborate plans for laying Wright low by  manipulating the media. These glimpses at what powerful men were thinking as  they acted gives the book the same immediacy as a photograph of the Titanic the  second it hit the iceberg.  </P> <P> Barry's accomplishment is far more than a product of the good fortune of being  on the inside when things started to pop. Other books have shown the  warts-and-all workings of Congress, notably Bernard Asdell Muskie's "The Senate  Nobody Knows." Books about the last two presidential elections by special  Newsweek teams have given us the best politique verite since the late Teddy  White's "Making of the President" series. But no study of congressional life in  all its tawdry splendor has ever combined access with execution as well as "The  Ambition and the Power." It is a Herculean effort and a magnificent  achievement.  </P> <P> In telling Wright's story, Barry conveys all the intricacy, bombast, grandeur  and villainy of what occurs on the dark side of representative democracy. The  reader often knows more than the participants and thus sees the seeds of  misunderstanding and resentment as they are planted in the minds of people who  do not listen as closely as we read. Climactic scenes on the House floor dance  on the page as though they had been blocked out by Frank Capra. Barry uses all  of Tom Wolfe's tricks -- the capital letters, exclamation points, and  interior-monologue italics -- to excellent effect. Striking details, such as a  Republican leader smashing a lectern with his fist in frustration at one of  Wright's tactics, propel the reader through complicated accounts of legislative  maneuvering that would drag in the work of a lesser writer.  </P> <P> Barry began the book after writing a newspaper profile about Wright in 1986,  soon before he was elected Speaker. Learning that Wright planned to use the  office to galvanize Democratic power in the House as no modern-day Speaker ever  had, the author won from Wright the privilege of attending virtually every  meeting where staff members were present, and also some where they were not. He  conducted hundreds of interviews as well. "Most of the events related in this  book," he writes in a note on methodology, "I personally observed." This is  refreshing in an era of proliferating anonymous, unexaminable sources, and  indeed the quality of Barry's reporting makes most newspaper work seem like the  funny papers. In exchange for access, Barry agreed, among other things, to  clear negative quotations with their authors and to withhold publication of  anything he observed until this year.  </P> <P> Wright struck this deal on the eve of his greatest political triumph. One  wonders whether, as things started to turn sour, the perpetually dieting  Speaker ever looked up at Barry from the raisin bran and skim milk he had every  morning in his ornate offices and muttered: "You still here?" If so, it was  good he listened to his better angels and let Barry stay because this book will  inaugurate Wright's revisionist period a lot earlier than most of our internal  political exiles get one. While he has not written an apologia, Barry was  obviously sympathetic to his subject, so much so that he devotes far more space  to criticizing the sloppy coverage of Wright by the national media than was  perhaps politic. He puts the ethics charges against Wright in perspective  without fully exonerating him. "Wright had a sense that rules did not apply to  him," Barry writes. After running unsuccessfully for the Senate in the early  1960s, in an impulsive moment, he paid off his campaign deficit himself and  soon found himself wallowing in personal debt, a situation this Texas populist  found intensely humiliating. As he scampered back to solvency, he became blind  to the perception of impropriety -- "(a)nd to a politician," writes Barry,  "perception was virtually reality." Wright's rule was simple: "My position now  is if the law says it's all right, I'll take the money." Indeed, he did not  ever break the law, but he also did not behave with the prudence Americans have  the right to expect from the speaker of the house -- and in the end, he seemed  to realize it. One of the many moving passages about his personal anguish comes  soon before his resignation, when he says to his daughter, Ginger Brown: "We  were just greedy. Damn it."  </P> <P> Wright's undeniable lapses end up appearing not as capital crimes but merely  Capitol ones -- levers to be used against him by adversaries who, had these  levers not been available, might well have contrived others. "Jim Wright is the  symbol of Democratic control of the House," Gingrich said. "I don't think he's  a Mafia don. He's a symbol of the machine." While Wright is hardly blameless,  few people in the book look much better.  </P> <P> For example, the excellent statesmen on the House ethics committee who claimed  Wright had committed 69 violations of House rules had in 1987 refused to take  any disciplinary action against a millionaire Rhode Island congressman,  Democrat Fernand J. St. Germain, even though he had allegedly violated those  highly malleable House rules and federal law as well. His district's voters  called him home instead last year. Stinging from charges it had gone too easy  in that case, the committee went outside Congress and hired an ambitious  Chicago lawyer, Richard Phelan, to investigate Wright. Phelan dug into Wright  with a vengeance. According to Barry, whose case is compelling, the  investigator "misled the committee repeatedly" and in the wake of Wright's  resignation was already hinting coyly about running for governor of Illinois.  </P> <P> So when Barry picked "The Ambition and the Power" for his title, he clearly  didn't mean just Wright's. This was not a morality play about an unethical man  being brought to account by his better. It was a classic power struggle that  Wright lost and his ambitious antagonists won. One reason he was a target to  begin with was that, had he prevailed, he would probably have been a force to  reckon with in Washington for a generation. "If he survives this ethical  thing," said Gingrich, in the midst of working virtually around the clock to  ensure that Wright would not, "he may become the greatest Speaker since Clay."  </P> <P> This statement would be nonsensical only to the reader who did not understand  that Gingrich seemed to personify all the rage of a Republican minority that  had not known real power in the House of Representatives for more than three  decades and that, during the 100th Congress, sweated under a Democratic  speaker's lash more than they ever had under Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, Carl  Albert, or John McCormack. Being in the minority under them was never fun,  though one Republican, California's Jerry Lewis, was honest enough to concede  that "We have just enough votes to be irresponsible." But being in the minority  under Wright was something else again.  </P> <P> As a result of Wright's vision and Reagan's Iran-contra-induced weakness, the  100th Congress was, in the estimation of Barry and many liberally inclined  pundits, "the most productive in decades." It produced dramatic overrides of  two Reagan vetoes. It produced major domestic legislation in an era when the  budget deficit had seemed to have finally put Democrats out of the domestic  legislation business. It produced the spark that led to the Arias peace plan in  Central America. And it also produced many, many congressmen who were mad as  hell at Wright for the blood and sweat he squeezed from them while making it  all happen.  </P> <P> Everyone knows how Wright's handling of the congressional pay raise early last  year -- the one they wanted without having actually to ask for it -- helped  forge one of the nails for his coffin. But pay raises aren't the only things  our representatives don't care to vote on. When Wright scheduled a vote on a  pro-labor bill, at a meeting "(o)ne member jumped to his feet, waved a doughnut  in the air, and complained, '. . . My (state's) two senators go into the  AFL-CIO convention and get a standing ovation. Then they walk across the street  to the Chamber of Commerce convention and get a standing ovation. And the  reason they do this is that the Senate is smart enough not to schedule any damn  labor bills for a vote! Why are we scheduling one for a vote?' " Snapped Wright  in another context, "That's the trouble with this place. Too many here who  shouldn't be in Congress. No guts. That's what leadership is. If you don't have  it, you shouldn't be in government."  </P> <P> Wright had the gall to articulate a vision of the national interest and expect  members to help advance it. Whether one happens to agree with it doesn't much  matter. If Wright had been a Republican speaker forcing his will by means of a  Republican majority, he would have engendered the same resentments on both  sides of the aisle. The principal business of the House is neither policy nor  ideology but rather protecting each member's individual political interests.  O'Neill himself said: "Jim doesn't have the ability to put his arm around a  member and just listen to his problems." So in the closing weeks of Wright's  political career, "the Democrats did not rally to him. No Democrat on the  (ethics) committee worked his colleagues in the off-hours, talked to them on  the floor, took them to dinner, called Phelan a liar . . . . (They) did not so  much kill him as let him die."  </P> <P> Even the reader who feels respect and compassion for Wright and anger at the  cynicism of some of those who helped bring him down may wonder whether he was  quite the man for the job. For one thing, his judgment was severely lacking at  times. The shrewd legislator who refused to intervene in the Iran-contra  investigation because "entangling himself in areas beyond his control was a  fool's errand" failed to understand that he was doing precisely that in the way  he conducted his personal affairs. One also wonders about a man who "wanted to  elevate the Speakership to a new level of power, almost equivalent to the  Presidency." In late 1987, when he and Reagan appeared together at the White  House to announce a compromise on the budget, the President "shuffled about the  stage uncertain where to stand" while Wright fielded reporters' questions about  income taxes. "Wright had become his clear rival," writes Barry, and it is fair  to ask: Who, besides a few hundred thousand voters in Ft. Worth, elected him as  pretender to the throne?  </P> <P> By pushing so hard, in a way, Wright was asking for precisely the treatment he  got. If he had sought less power, he would have run less risk. Conversely, to  pull off the institutional realignment he contemplated, to propel himself to a  position in American political life on a virtual par with the President, he  would have had to be as clean as Snow White. And even then, Gingrich might have  been able to nail him for copyright violations.  </P></p>

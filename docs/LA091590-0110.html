			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 HORSES COLLIDE AT LOS ALAMITOS IN FIRST RACE  </P> <P> A chain-reaction collision marred the opening harness race Friday night at Los  Alamitos when Lepton, undefeated in 1990 and the 1-5 betting favorite, went off  stride in mid-stretch, stopped abruptly and was run into by three horses.  </P> <P> None of the four horses involved in the wreck finished, leaving only Tracy's  Comet and Black on Black to cross the finish line first and second.  </P> <P> The show pool was divided between them, resulting in a record show payoff on  Black on Black of $159.80. The huge payoff occurred because $23,299 out of the  total show pool of $24,611 was wagered on Lepton. The prices for the winner,  Tracy's Comet, were $43.80, $21.80 and $82.20; for Black on Black, $30 and  $159.80.  </P> <P> All four horses involved in the accident walked off the track. Drivers Ross  Croghan (Lepton), Steve Desomer (Preciosa) and Rick Plano (Denali's Ginger)  escaped serious injury. Kim Vincent (Magna Amber) was held in Los Alamitos  General for observation with a severely bruised back.  </P></p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Art market defies recession: Saleroom ONE of the richest women in the world was selling the family jewels in Geneva; advertising executive Mr Charles Saatchi was trading in contemporary art in New York; and in London a Constable came under the hammer. There are few signs this week of an art market in recession. Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, a young widow, is clearing out jewels from one of the largest art collections on the Continent. The 297 lots fetched SFr19.7m (Pounds 9m), comfortably above the high Sotheby's estimate for the auction of SFr16.5m. The top price was the SFr2.53m paid by the London dealer S. J. Phillips for a jewelled gold and hardstone snuffbox made for Frederick the Great of Prussia around 1770. The price was within estimate but set an auction record for a snuffbox. A pearl and diamond tiara made for the Empress Eugenie of France in 1853 was bought by the Friends of the Louvre Museum in Paris for SFr935,000, which was double its estimate. Meanwhile, in New York, a Sotheby's auction of contemporary art brought in Dollars 20.26m (Pounds 13.34m) but was 26 per cent unsold. Mr Saatchi's most expensive disposal, 'Marilyn x 100' by Andy Warhol, sold for Dollars 3.74m, but failed to top the expected Dollars 4m and set a record for Warhol. David Hockney's famous portrait of his friends Harry Geldzahler and Christopher Scott just made its target at Dollars 1.1m. The real loser at the sale was Sotheby's owner Alfred Taubman. He submitted important Dollars 1.5m-plus pictures by Clyfford Still and Franz Kline which failed to find buyers.</p>

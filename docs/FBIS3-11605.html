The secretary issued this  warning during his speech at the ceremony in which Jorge Kondo  Lopez, a state leader of the Federation of Agricultural  Associations of Sinaloa State, presented his second work report.    Hank said, "Self-sufficiency in food means producing what is  necessary to feed our country." He recalled that four years  ago, Mexico had to import beans, and that this was very  difficult to do because of international shortages.    He said: "We do not want the country swamped with foreign  products; we must import only what we need." He said that  although at this moment it is advantageous to import basic  materials, machinery, and seeds, the ideal situation would be to  not require any imports. [passage omitted]</p>

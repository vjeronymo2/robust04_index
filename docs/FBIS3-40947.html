			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The trilateral statement by the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the elimination of  nuclear weapons on the territory of our state remains the focus  of attention. If, in the world as a whole this move is  supported on a mass scale, in Ukraine attitudes toward this  statement and its assessments are ambiguous. Our correspondent  Petro Ostapenko met Oleksandr Tarasenko, the deputy chairman of  the Supreme Council of Ukraine's Commission for Issues of  Defense and State Security, and asked him to express his  attitude toward the trilateral statement by the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States, and Russia.    [Begin recording] Ostapenko: Ukraine's President  Leonid Kravchuk and representatives of the executive bodies of  power are saying today that the trilateral statement is the  result and continuation, let us say, of the decisions by the  Supreme Council on nuclear weapons. Oleksandr, what is your  opinion? Is this true?    Tarasenko: Well, this document still needs  in-depth comprehension. First, it is called a statement, a  trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United  States, and Russia. How should we assess it today? Does it  have a legal force as an international document and as an  agreement, or is this just a statement? Upon studying it  profoundly -- yesterday our commission was considering this  document -- upon studying it profoundly, it can, in the long  run, be qualified as an international agreement. In compliance  with our current legislation -- the Constitution first and  foremost -- and in compliance with the law on the president, on  his plenary powers, the international agreements that Ukraine --  that is, the executive power, concludes in the field of defense,  military construction, military relations with neighboring and  other states, are subject to mandatory ratification by the  Supreme Council.    Why did I say that this document is an agreement and not a  statement? Because, there is a supplement to the trilateral  statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and  Russia as of 14 January, and this supplement provides specific  dates, the terms in which our strategic nuclear weapons should  be fully deactivated, their number, and so on. This goes beyond  the limits of the resolution that was adopted by the Supreme  Council. What does this supplement stipulate? This supplement  gives, for example, such parameters: Ukraine ensures the  elimination of all nuclear weapons, including strategic  offensive weapons -- that is, strategic air force, TU-160 and  other aircraft carrying nuclear missiles, located on its  territory, in compliance with its relevant agreements within the  term of seven years as is envisaged by the START I Treaty and  within the context of the statement by the Supreme Council of  Ukraine on Ukraine's non-nuclear status, all the RS-22 missiles  -- to be more specific they are called SS-24 -- on Ukraine's  territory will be deactivated within 10 months by means of  removing their warheads. What does it mean?    You know that in two thirds of our silos launcher vehicles  are filled with liquid fuel -- that is, heptyl. The entire  world already knows what kind of a liquid fuel this is. This  heptyl is a super poisonous substance, and the launcher vehicle  itself is even a bigger powder keg than the launcher vehicle and  the warhead as a whole. Proceeding from this, Ukraine and its  plenary bodies and persons must take into account their own  interests, first and foremost, and not the interests of those  who benefit from this unilaterally. I believe that the Supreme  Council, either the present or the future one, should seriously  ponder over this document, and it can be ratified only after its  parameters are specified.    Ostapenko: I am sorry to interrupt you. You have  just read out the item that has to do with all sides without  exception. But nothing is said here about the Supreme Council  resolution on the ratification of START I with reservations. It  clearly stipulates that 36 percent of launcher vehicles and 42  percent of warheads are subject to elimination today. That is  to say, these parameters have been extended to all nuclear [word  indistinct].    Tarasenko: Absolutely. They run contrary to the  Supreme Council resolution. The Supreme Council resolution and  START I envisage percentage and here is says about the complete  elimination.    In this connection I would like to say the following, so  that  our radio listeners and our compatriots, our half-brothers, as  they say, would know it: All those strategic nuclear systems  located on the territory of Ukraine are targeted at certain  objectives in the United States of America and relevant bases  beyond the borders of the U.S. Correspondingly, approximately  the same number of nuclear weapons are targeted at our  territory. Well, this is military strategy and tactics and  there is nothing incomprehensible here. Everybody understands  this: If you target me, then I target you. But this document  should also envisage adequate moves on the part of the United  States of America, and our control over this, because everyone  will control us, control how we eliminate nuclear weapons,  remove nuclear warheads, transfer them from Ukraine to Russia.  The only thing envisaged here is that Ukraine will have the  possibility to control Russia neutralizing the nuclear warheads.  However, this agreement does not envisage what the United  States will do with that quantity of strategic nuclear weapons  that are targeted at us, and what will be Ukraine's role in  carrying out control over this process, as far as the actions of  the United States are concerned.    Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin declared that they would  decode their missiles, which would then be retargetted at some  deserted islands, or something like that. Ukraine's  participation here is not envisaged, is that right?    Tarasenko: Ukraine's participation here is not  envisaged. Moreover, I disagree with such a stand, just as a  citizen and just as an inhabitant of this planet Earth. If  Ukraine eliminates these weapons, the former weapons of the  Soviet Union, as is known, then the United States of America  should eliminate and neutralize the same quantity of weapons.  This is what we are talking about, not about retargetting at  some other states, and so on. That is to say, there is no  alternative in the world to universal nuclear disarmament and  appropriate actions by all nuclear states. This is what our  politicians should insist on, and at this point I again repeat  and emphasize that the given document needs in-depth  comprehension in legal terms, in terms of international law.  What obligations, what guarantees can we talk about? Because,  they already guaranteed us something to a certain extent. Let  us not mention any names today, because there has already been  enough talk about this. Who is to blame and who, let us say,  ordered the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons from the  territory of Ukraine? Those are our weapons. They would have  been of paramount importance for the defense capacity of  Ukraine. However, we transferred those weapons and could not  cope with these ones. Here we outwitted ourselves.    Ostapenko: I know, Oleksandr, that you are  familiar with the technical condition of the strategic nuclear  weapons, missiles, and warheads located on Ukraine's territory.  Today, in numerous interviews, the military say that it is  difficult for Ukraine to service them, that Ukraine will be  unable to service them, therefore, the sooner we deactivate and  transfer these weapons, the better for Ukraine. What do you  think about it, please.    Tarasenko: You, Petro, probably touched upon a  very important aspect of this problem. It is quite clear that  nuclear warheads and their systems are the most sophisticated  systems because they should be sophisticated as they guarantee  the safety of a nuclear warhead itself and a silo as a whole.  This is why there exists a practice in the world according to  which the given warheads are serviced by the authors who  manufactured them. The authors themselves can destroy them.  There is no other process, as they say. In this respect, we  could find a state that would do this [word indistinct] but we  cannot do this without Russia because the one who will have  access there should know what it is, and so on. Therefore, every  launching system and, moreover, nuclear warhead has relevant  terms which guarantee their safety, and systems. We cannot do  this without Russia. Therefore, it is necessary either to have  very specific, responsible bilateral agreements toward that end  with Russia on ensuring periodic servicing of the warheads and  the silos as a whole or to neutralize and transfer them after  their guaranteed service life expires. There is no other way  around. Also, it could be possible to do as follows: A certain  number of warheads and silos could be dismantled without their  periodic servicing after their guaranteed service life expires.  This is the way to follow. This would be the most correct, most  appropriate way. Following it, one should move from the  warhead, from the head, as they say, to the tail. That is to  say, to dismantle the entire silo and not just remove the  warheads and leave the rest with ourselves. It would be the  same kind of a powder keg. Therefore, the most correct way is  to act in line with a stage-by-stage, unit-by-unit principle.  Both the warhead and the launcher vehicle should be dismantled  completely. This would ensure the highest level of security to  our state.    Ostapenko: One more, very important aspect, as  far as this problem is concerned. Did you see the guarantees of  Ukraine's national security in this statement and in the  supplement, the guarantees that Ukraine and the Supreme Council  were striving for and which all those living in Ukraine wish to  have.    Tarasenko: Undoubtedly, there are certain aspects  and elements of security here. There are such provisions, and  so on. But, as they say, history and mankind know instances  when such guarantees were given, when there were agreements, but  there was the Second World War despite these bilateral and  multilateral agreements, and 22 million people died and the  economies in a whole number of countries were destroyed. This  is why one should rely on God but have his own mind, as they  say. Both our military and scientific potentials should work  toward ensuring our state security -- not at the expense of  nuclear weapons now but at the expense of other highly effective  means. Such measures are being taken today. This is why,  simultaneously with the reduction and elimination of nuclear  weapons, fulfilling that resolution by the Supreme Council, we  should work concurrently toward ensuring the combat readiness of  our Armed Forces. Our commission, together with military  departments, is carrying out this work. [end recording]    [Announcer] Such is the attitude of people's deputy, deputy  chairman of the Supreme Council Commission for Issues of Defense  and State Security Oleksandr Tarasenko toward the trilateral  statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and  Russia on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.</p>

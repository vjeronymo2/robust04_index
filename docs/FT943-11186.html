			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Alitalia tries to fly higher - Robert Graham learns what Roberto Schisano intends for Italy's state airline The call for Roberto Schisano came out of the blue from a head-hunter: 'Would you be interested in serving your country?' It soon transpired that 'serving his country' meant overhauling Alitalia, Italy's loss-making national airline. For the 51 year-old Schisano, president of Texas Instruments Europe, it was a challenge hard to refuse. Having spent his working life with the US electronics multi-national, the prospect of applying his knowledge of American management techniques to shake-up an ailing state airline was irresistible. It was also the first time the chief executive of any Italian state enterprise has been actively head-hunted. Since February he has been installed as chief executive in Alitalia's cavernous new headquarters, mid-way between Rome and the city's Fiumicino airport - a building he will almost certainly sell-off as part of the airline's rationalisation. 'When I came to Alitalia, I told everyone I was a frequent flier clocking up thousands of miles annually; but I only ever flew Alitalia when it was unavoidable,' says Schisano. Such blunt talking is an essential part of the new management style, which in five months has brought about what is arguably the biggest ever cultural revolution in an Italian state enterprise. He has broken down entrenched union resistance to change, and Alitalia is likely to implement the kind of restructuring programme that Air France, the neighbouring state airline, has tried and failed to do. 'The (recent) agreement with the unions is the first building block for a new era of relations in which we must decide we have a common objective - to work together to stay in the market,' he observes. The core of the agreement centres on a near 20 per cent cut in the 20,000 strong workforce; the end of restrictive practices among cabin crew; the switching of crews among different types of aircraft; effective cuts in wages; and longer working hours. Schisano, who trained as an electronic engineer, began by spending a month between jobs soaking up everything he could about Alitalia. For a while when he arrived he simply listened - to individual managers, to groups and then to two huge assemblies of the workforce. 'The big surprise for me was to discover Alitalia was not a company as I knew one. Rather it was a conglomerate whose professional skills were not being coordinated towards a common goal.' He adds: 'Alitalia did not have an identifiable objective at all. And with time there had occurred a total divorce between people and the company.' Using one of his pithy one-liners, he summed up Alitalia as he found it: 'The company had become separated from the market; and the management had become separated from the company.' The first situation he was prepared for. The second was unexpected. Another surprise was the way Alitalia had misplaced its priorities. 'The culture of the company rotated round the machines, the aircraft. The rationale was - 'we fly because we have aeroplanes' - rather than 'we fly because we have customers'.' The customer indeed had become forgotten, not least by the flight personnel who were bent on protecting their privileges. Schisano discovered that cabin crew pay was based on 504 separate job considerations, most of which had been individually negotiated between unions and management. Although he pays tribute to the professional skills inside the airline, Schisano scarcely conceals his dismay at the lack of competitiveness that existed against other airlines. 'Our previous bench-marks were what I call the so-so bunch - the other European state airlines, not those seeking to be market leaders like Britsh Airways or Southwest in the US. And when one mentioned losses, the reply was 'Oh, we're not as bad as Air France'.' Through a combination of badly organised and poorly developed Italian airports, inadequate flight schedules and indifferent service, Schisano reckons Alitalia has been losing 2m passengers a year to competition. Thus to impose radical change and become customer-orientated, the first step was to stop the airline being run like a government department with life-long job security. Management had to be flexible, not rigidly hierarchical, and people had to be properly motivated. To achieve this, Schisano began with some simple and obvious personnel relations exercises, nevertheless unfamiliar to the Alitalia culture. 'I made myself very visible and walked about the building a lot. . . My first meeting with the unions was carried everywhere on closed circuit television. . . I cut out all the awful bureaucratese in memos and circulars.' This direct contact in turn helped to produce a creative atmosphere, in which the management could focus on drawing up a restructuring programme to restore profitability and ready the airline for privatisation. The plan itself, designed to raise productivity by 25 per cent and cut operating costs by 12 per cent, was ready by May. Remarkable by Italian standards, the main union leaders decided in less than two months to back Schisano's tough recipe for saving Alitalia. 'I set out to convince them by showing the figures in easily understandable presentations and charts,' he says with more than a hint of satisfaction. He devised comparative tables to show just how over-paid and unproductive Alitalia had become had become: cabin crews earned more than double British Airways. 'They could see our costs had been higher than revenues for the past six years. . . From this I was able to say: either we accept the restructuring plan or we go home.' The threat carried credibility because both the previous Ciampi government and the current Berlusconi administration had made it clear the airline had to stand on its own feet. According to Schisano, the government attitude makes Alitalia's plight different from that of Air France. 'Air France still behaves as if it is an arm of the French government.' Unions in strategic public service sectors like transport have traditionally held the company and the public to ransom. But Schisano gambled that the balance of power had shifted away from the unions. 'Unions need the management today; the management doesnt need the unions,' he says. His tough line appears to have paid off. Industrial action against the restructuring was largely limited to wild-cat strikes by a new militant union, which Schisano excluded from negotiations. If this sounds too much of a success story, Schisano is the first to admit Alitalia has still to prove it can be a profitable and competitive operator. It has yet to decide on a coherent policy of international alliances and is unlikely to be fully prepared for the liberalisation of European airfares. But perhaps the lesson from his brief experience is that where radical surgery is necessary, it is more easily done by someone brought in from outside. One up for the head-hunter.</p>

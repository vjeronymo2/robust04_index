			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Liberty Life cuts convertible issue Liberty Life, South Africa's largest life insurance company, has been forced to reduce its offering of convertible bonds, to Dollars 300m from the planned Dollars 360m to Dollars 500m range. Poor demand from investors in the US was blamed for the shortfall in the issue, which was priced yesterday by lead manager Robert Fleming. But the first global offering of convertible bonds by a South African company was hailed as a success by some. 'The sale represents a considerable achievement in what have been extremely difficult and uncertain currency and bond markets globally and given a market that is highly unpredictable,' said Mr James Knowles, equity syndicate manager at Kleinwort Benson. 'The size of the offering was appropriate for demand and will provide a useful benchmark. It will be a precursor to a substantial inflow of funds into South Africa,' he said. However, the shortfall will throw doubt on the country's to return to the international capital markets after its first non-racial elections in May. It was hoped the offering would pave the way for a spate of financings by the country's under-borrowed corporate sector, and was seen as a test of market sentiment following the resignation of Mr Derek Keys, the South African finance minster, on July 5. 'Although it is believed the US was disappointing, there was very strong interest in Europe,' said Mr Roddie Fleming, a director of Robert Fleming. 'The US seems to have been far more affected by Mr Keys' resignation.' However, an analyst in London said: 'This deal has not worked and it is not surprising. Very few people believed that it would be successful.' The bonds, due in 2004, with a semi-annual coupon of 6.5 per cent are non-callable for at least the first five years and have 'soft protection' for the remaining five years. They are convertible into ordinary shares of Liberty Life at R106.68 per share, representing a premium of 10.4 per cent. Robert Fleming has the option of subscribing for up to an additional Dollars 60m of the bonds.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MCDONNELL DOUGLAS TEAMSTERS OVERWHELMINGLY OK 3-YEAR PACT  </P> <P> Teamsters at McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Southern California plants ratified a  3-year labor contract after seven months of negotiation, a spokesman for the  aerospace company said today.  </P> <P> "I just got word this morning," Jim Reed said from the aerospace company's  corporate headquarters in St. Louis.  </P> <P> He said the vote took place Sunday.  </P> <P> The contract, covering 250 Teamsters from Local 692, was approved by a vote of  156 to 7. The Teamsters International had sanctioned a strike to occur as early  as today.  </P> <P> Local 692 represents truck drivers, chauffeurs and railroad freight handlers  whose wages have averaged about $15 an hour. Members carry and unload parts and  major aerospace components to the corporation's Douglas Aircraft Co. facilities  in Long Beach, Torrance and Carson, and McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Douglas spokesman Don Hanson said the pact is similar to a contract the company  signed in December with its machinists union. That contract provides a 5 1/2%  pay raise in the first year and 3% increases in each of the second and third  years. It also provides for a 4% annual lump-sum bonus for each worker, based  on the worker's total yearly wage.  </P></p>

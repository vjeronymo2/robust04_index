			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Digital reports smaller loss Digital Equipment reported smaller than expected losses for its first fiscal quarter as revenues grew modestly. The results raised hopes that the computer manufacturer would achieve its goal of returning to profitability by mid-1995 after four years of heavy losses. Digital reported a net loss of Dollars 131m (Pounds 83m), or 98 cents per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 154m, or Dollars 1.14 per share, for the same period last year. Total operating revenues for the quarter were Dollars 3.12bn, up nearly 4 per cent from Dollars 3.01bn from the same stage a year ago. A one-off gain of about Dollars 65m from a change in accounting methods, was partially offset by one-off losses related to several small divestments, the company said. Analysts had been anticipating a loss of around Dollars 1.31 per share, so Digital's first-quarter performance was viewed favourably, and the company's share price gained Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 31 7/8 at the midsession. 'While we are not satisfied with any loss, the current quarter's results contain many encouraging signs', said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive. Revenues from product sales were up 6 per cent at Dollars 1.6bn while service revenues were virtually flat at Dollars 1.47bn. 'This is the first time in six years that we have seen three consecutive quarters of order growth,' said Mr Palmer. Sales of computers based on Digital's Alpha microprocessor more than doubled and now represent 19 per cent of product revenues, he said. Digital's personal computer sales also grew strongly, nearly doubling to about 22 per cent of product revenues, or about Dollars 363m. Digital continued to cut costs in the first quarter, with sales and general expenses down 4 per cent at Dollars 836m. The company eliminated about 4,000 jobs during the quarter. Its workforce now stands at approximately 73,800, down from 115,000 two years ago. The company said that it is on track to achieve a 20,000 reduction by the end of the fiscal year, but noted that job cuts are behind schedule 'in two major European countries' which executives declined to identify.

Florida's revisions consist of the provisions contained in the rules promulgated between July 1, 1987, and June 30, 1990, otherwise known as HSWA Cluster II. These requirements are listed in Section B of this notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Florida's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that the Florida hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Florida's hazardous waste program revisions. Florida's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Final authorization for Florida's program revisions shall be effective December 27, 1994 unless EPA publishes a prior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  action withdrawing this immediate final rule.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260&hyph;268 and 124 and 270.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> B. Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Florida initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on February 12, 1985, (50 FR 3908, January 29, 1985). Florida received authorization for revisions to its program on April 6, 1992, for Non-HSWA III, IV, and V, and on January 10, 1994 for HSWA I without Corrective Action. Today, Florida is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has reviewed Florida's application and has made an immediate final decision that Florida's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Florida. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until November 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of Florida's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approval of Florida's program revisions shall become effective December 27, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

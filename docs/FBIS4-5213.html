			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- The government held the  first meeting on unification and security policy coordination at  the South-North dialogue office on Friday to review its overall  policy toward North Korea.    The meeting, presided over by Minister of the National  Unification Board (NUB) Yi Yong-tok, decided to discuss all  unification matters, diplomacy related to the North and security  to coordinate the opinions of different ministries.    The various ministries and secretaries will also push ahead  with unification- and security-related policies under the  principle that the government must seek progress in inter-Korean  relations.    President Kim Yong-sam Thursday instructed that a  Unification  and Security Policy Coordination Council be formed. The council  comprises the minister of the National Unification Board, the  foreign and defense ministers, the director of the Agency for  National Security Planning, the chief presidential secretary and  the senior secretary for foreign and national security affairs.    NUB Minister Yi said after the meeting, "We looked into the  overall situation on unification and security after adoption of  the U.N. Security Council's presidential statement and rupture  of inter-Korean working-level contact."    "We will discuss every policy to adjust differences between  ministries."    The coordination meetings will be held regularly more than  once a week, and President Kim himself will chair the sessions  when necessary.</p>

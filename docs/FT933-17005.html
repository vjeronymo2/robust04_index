			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Uranium process goes independent THE US today will spin off its uranium enrichment activities from the Department of Energy to an independent corporation, which the administration hopes to prepare for privatisation in two years. The US Enrichment Corporation will run two uranium plants - at Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio - and will have annual sales of about Dollars 1.5bn. Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, said the new company's mandate would be to regain for the US what used to be a dominant share of the world enrichment market, by changing from a bureaucracy to a business. The US, which now charges 30-40 per cent more than competitors such as Europe's Eurodif and Urenco consortia, has seen its world monopoly of enrichment services slip to 46 per cent, One of USEC's tasks will be the reprocessing of weapons-grade, highly enriched uranium from the former Soviet Union into low-enriched uranium for use in commercial power generation.</p>

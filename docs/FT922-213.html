			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Tokyo puts stress on domestic growth THE Japanese cabinet today is set to approve a five-year economic plan stressing growth in domestic demand, as Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, prepares to leave this afternoon for Washington, London and the Munich economic summit. The plan, however, includes no immediate stimulus to the economy as called for by the business community in Japan and by foreign political leaders. It has nothing to do with a separate package of measures to stimulate the economy proposed at the weekend by the ruling Liberal Democratic party, on which the government is not expected to act for at least 2 1/2 months. In effect, Mr Miyazawa will embark on his trip empty-handed in the face of rising international pressure on Japan to take measures that will reverse the steep decline in economic growth. The government is none the less hoping the five-year plan will help to deflect criticism that Japan is not doing enough to spur the economy and tame its huge trade surplus. 'The main thrust of the measures is that Japan is still determined to pursue internal demand-led growth,' said Mr Koichiro Matsuura, deputy foreign minister, yesterday. 'We made a departure from this growth plan in the past year.' Japan's trade surplus has soared in the past year, as the economy has slowed down. The plan calls for Japanese economic growth to average 3.5 per cent over the next five years, with an annual 3.75 per cent expansion of domestic demand and an annual 0.25 per cent shrinkage in external demand. This is to be achieved in part by increased government spending aimed at improving the quality of life, for example in housing. Working hours are also to be cut. Mr Miyazawa will stop for two days in Washington where he and US President George Bush will review the progress of an action plan on bilateral trade agreed by the two leaders in January, when Mr Bush visited Tokyo. A speech at the National Press Club and an interview on ABC television by Mr Miyazawa are aimed at sprucing up Japan's tarnished US image. Mr Miyazawa will then travel to London, where he will confer with Mr John Major before proceeding to Munich. Britain tomorrow takes over the presidency of the European Community.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOXING, ONCE BANNED IN CHINA, COMING BACK  </P> <P> Down an alleyway, lined with ancient houses, in a gym with no heat as the winds  of winter swirl outside, Liu Xingjun jumps rope and thinks about world  heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> "He's my hero," the 18-year-old boxer said, steam and sweat pouring from his  face. "I have his pictures all over my wall. I hope one day to be able to  battle like him."  </P> <P> Nearby, Wang Yawei slams his fists in a body bag.  </P> <P> The 26-year-old gave up a promising career as a kung-fu movie actor to fight  fulltime.  </P> <P> "We're just beginning to learn again how to box," Wang said. "I wanted to be  part of the change."  </P> <P> Banned for 27 years because of safety concerns and politics, boxing is making a  comeback in the People's Republic of China.  </P> <P> In cities along the eastern coast, where the sport always was popular, boxing  clubs are springing up and putting on competitions. Spectators by the thousands  throng to these three-round events, crunching on sunflower seeds and sipping  soft drinks, as boxers from one factory or another vie for purses worth about  $20.  </P> <P> For the first time since the communist revolution in 1949, China sent a boxing  team of two to the Summer Olympics last September in Seoul. One fighter was  eliminated in his first match, while the other made it to the second round.  </P> <P> Another team is readying for fights in Indonesia in mid-February. And a bigger  group of fighters is looking forward to the Asia Games in 1990, to be held in  Beijing.  </P> <P> "But we still have far to go," said Wang Guojun, the 57-year-old coach of  China's national team who once was the flyweight champion of China. "We don't  have any guys who've been fighting all their lives. Just a bunch of late  starters."  </P> <P> Wang had his boxing career cut short in 1959 when the government banned the  sport.  </P> <P> "It was like waking up one morning and the golden horizon had disappeared," he  said. "Everything was black."  </P> <P> The chain-smoking coach pulled out a photograph from his days in the ring --  washboard stomach, arms like anvils.  </P> <P> "Look at that," he said, sighing. "A pretty tough customer."  </P> <P> For decades, boxing was popular in the coastal cities, a cultural import from  Western imperialists who brought their sports as well as their products to  China.  </P> <P> After the revolution in 1949, boxing continued its popularity in cities such as  Qingdao, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Canton.  </P> <P> But a series of fighting accidents which left several Chinese boxers dead, and  a push by the government to rid itself of "aggressive" influences from the  West, led to boxing's demise.  </P> <P> Wang took up soccer and hockey and began his wait.  </P> <P> "But students, athletes, all sorts of people kept coming to see me, and we'd  always go a few rounds," he said, doing a quick two-step while he cut the air  with a right jab. "I always kept up hope that the ban would be lifted."  </P> <P> In 1986, Wang's dream came true and he was given the go-ahead to start a  national team.  </P> <P> The decision was part of China's push into the world of international sports to  better its image and provide a source of national pride. Since 1980, Beijing's  athletes have broken more than 100 world records and won more than 1,000  titles.  </P> <P> For the most part, sports in China is the reserve of an athletic elite. Indoor  swimming pools and wood basketball courts are off-limits to everyone but  state-sponsored professional athletes. Gymnastic instruction is limited to  those with a professional future.  </P> <P> Most Chinese get their excercise working on farms while others get theirs going  to and from work on bicycles.  </P> <P> Wang's boxing team is no exception. Promising members are borrowed from  factories and sports institutes and brought to Beijing to be tutored under  Wang's watchful eye.  </P></p>

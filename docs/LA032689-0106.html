			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> . . . "Witness to Philadelphia," the 1977 book that many critics contend is the  truest account of the 1964 civil rights murders in Philadelphia, Miss., will be  reissued next month by LSU Press in trade paperback. Credit the controversy  over "Mississippi Burning."  </P> <P> . . . Sources tip us that Premiere magazine has a sizzling May cover story on  actress Sean Young, examining her battle with actor James Woods and her exits  from the movies "Batman" and "Dick Tracy" (following on the heels of a recent  People magazine cover piece that delved into her ill-starred stardom). Young's  manager-mother Lee Guthrey, who cooperated with Premiere along with her  daughter, told us: "It was described to me as a simple profile. If it is  explosive, I'll certainly feel betrayed."  </P> <P> . . . Fat Chance Dept.: A background radio voice on "Miami Vice" the other  night announced this score: "(Miami) Heat 128, Lakers 89."  </P></p>

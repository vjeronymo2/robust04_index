			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in Myanmar  -- formerly Burma -- this morning from Laos, on his tour of  seven countries of south and southeast Asia that also includes  Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Reporter Roberto Cavada  obtained further details via telephone:    [Cavada -- live or recorded] I think it is important to  comment, for Cubans, on the expectations and the work plan of  the Cuban delegation in Myanmar.    [Unidentified reporter] The foreign minister has just  arrived  in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from Laos. He is  practically at the midpoint of his tour, which began this week  in Indonesia and which includes Thailand. In Thailand, although  it was a short visit, a technical stopover, Foreign Minister  Robaina took the opportunity to talk with the Thai foreign  minister in Bangkok. His tour also included Laos, and now  Myanmar.    I would dare say that, in fact, the tour has turned out to  be  a big success. At all his stops, the Cuban foreign minister has  been received by heads of government, foreign ministers, and the  business circles of those countries. In the case of Myanmar, I  can tell you that its foreign minister, Ohn Gyaw, visited the  island last year; one of his objectives was to explore possible  channels for collaboration between the two nations. The visit by  Robaina that begins today is considered a reaffirmation of the  relations of friendship maintained by the two nations despite  the distance that separates us.    Even though it is a weekend, the foreign minister has a very  tight schedule, with several meetings scheduled with  high-ranking figures here. On Monday he will leave for Cambodia.    This is what I can tell you about this tour of the Cuban  foreign minister through several Asian nations. Thank you,  Cavada, and greetings to Radio Rebelde listeners.    [Cavada] They have, indeed, just arrived in Myanmar, and a  great many things are to happen during the rest of the visit. We  will be alert to the latest events in connection with the visit  of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to Myanmar.</p>

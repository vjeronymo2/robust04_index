			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Taurus While the Department of Trade and Industry is worrying whether stockbrokers' analysts should lunch with the companies they cover - it seems to be concerned that they might learn too much - a much more important issue for London's financial markets is in limbo. Taurus, the paperless share settlement system which isvital if London is to remain the centre of Europe's securities industry, has already been delayed. Now the hold-up is lengthening because the DTI cannot decidewhether to regulate Taurus itself, delegate the job to London's existing regulatory organisations, or leave it to the Stock Exchange which will operate the system. The neatest solution would be to leave the job to the Exchange, reporting to the DTI. Regulation is quite messy enough in London already. It is to be hoped that the DTI can tell a lunch from a landmine.</p>

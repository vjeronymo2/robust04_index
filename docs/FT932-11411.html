			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (9): Smart in every sense - Guy Verhofstadt leads a fast-growing political party GUY Verhofstadt, leader and architect of the VLD, Belgium's newest and fastest growing political party, is young and sharp-suited. He is, in every sense, a smart politician. The Flemish liberal party (PVV) he headed was one of the only established political parties to gain parliamentary seats at Belgium's last election, in November 1991. At that election, voters demonstrated their disgust for the machinations of traditional party politics in Belgium by backing extremist, green and anti-political parties. In the chaotic aftermath, Mr Verhofstadt realised that the PVV would have to do more than rest on its laurels. 'We analysed the political situation in the country and decided it was necessary to build up what we call a democratic alternative to the present government,' he says. The result was the Flemish liberal democrat party (VLD) - 'Partij van de Burger' the party of the citizen - which was born almost exactly a year after the election. One of its aims is to break the stranglehold which, Mr Verhofstadt says, pressure groups - notably the unions - have over the Flemish and French-speaking Christian Democrat and socialist parties which form the current coalition. Other goals include cutting expenditure without raising taxes, encouraging Belgians to invest some of their extensive savings to help growth, and capping wage increases. The similarities with the radical conservatism of Mrs Margaret Thatcher are not coincidental. Since the late 1970s the PVV had been a zealous backer of the free market, and Verhofstadt, who took over as leader in 1982, was a keen follower of Thatcherite and Reaganite principles. He is still a regular visitor to the free-market Adam Smith Institute in the UK; he says the VLD has taken on some of those traits, adapting them to the Belgian system and adjusting them to take into account the mistakes which both Thatcher and Reagan made. The VLD started with an advantage in the opinion polls over the Flemish Christian Democrats (CVP). Mr Verhofstadt says it has been adding new members from across the political spectrum, including many who have never before been involved in politics. The confidence of the new party and its leader is unquestioned. When Belgium's centre-left government was teetering on the brink of collapse in March, Guy Verhofstadt was not afraid to call for immediate elections, despite the risk that a new poll would simply aggravate the electorate's disgruntlement with traditional politics. Whether the VLD can go on building on its strong foundations depends to a large extent on Verhofstadt himself, who finds himself on the right of the party he has helped to create. Just turned 40, a lawyer by training, he already has a ministerial career on his curriculum vitae: he was a tough budget minister and vice-premier between 1985 and 1988. But some say Verhofstadt is too tough, and are critical of his autocratic management style. He was one of the senior Belgian politicians asked by the King to forge a coalition after the 1991 election. His reluctance to compromise - a serious flaw in the Byzantine world of Belgian politics - was one reason why he failed. Verhofstadt himself is not a separatist, although he says there is a risk that the country will split if Belgium's regions are not given more fiscal and financial autonomy - a central plank of the VLD manifesto. But he sees his own political future as a national rather than a regional deputy. The VLD's policy is founded on a rigorous economic programme, and, as he points out, 'the economy, fiscal policy, and European economic and monetary union are all problems discussed at federal, not regional level'. If he mellows enough to become a prime minister, it will probably be of Belgium rather than Flanders.</p>

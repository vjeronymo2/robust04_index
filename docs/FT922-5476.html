			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Travel: She Who Must Be Obeyed . . . but isn't - An encounter with an Old Africa Hand in London helps Nicholas Woodsworth discover why southern Africa is suffering serious drought ON THE afternoon I was tearing around to catch a flight to South Africa, I bumped into J D F Jones, an Old Africa Hand currently disguised as Arts Editor of the FT. Was I going to the Transvaal, asked the OAH, who was skulking around the High Veld before an arts page was ever dreamed of. Indeed I was, I answered, making a rush for the door and a Heathrow train; I would be driving north from Johannesburg towards the Zimbabwe border. 'You must turn right at Pietersburg, then', he shouted after me. 'Head due east and you will run into King Solomon's Mines country. With a bit of luck you may find her.' 'Her?' I shouted back. 'Who is she?' 'She Who Must Be Obeyed, of course', the OAH replied mysteriously. Like many people, I had spent exciting hours when younger in the exotic, dangerous, heroic world of Rider Haggard. I even remembered She, mysterious ruler of a remote African tribe, a beautiful queen awesome in her power and possessed of strange and terrible gifts. But no amount of luck would help me find a figment of romantic Victorian imagination. I shook my head, putting it all down to what must have been a long editorial lunch, and forgot about it. A few days later, much to my surprise, I turned right at Pietersburg as instructed. One reason was to escape the endless plain I was driving on. Parched, dusty, and burned brown by the sun, like most of southern Africa it was suffering from the worst drought this century. Off to the east, though, I could see the green hills of the Letaba district rising in the distance. Another reason for turning right was a listing I had found in my brochure of country hotels. Not far from the town of Tzaneen, a few hours through those hills, was the Coach House, voted South Africa's best country hotel for the last four years in a row. Finally, I could not put a question out of my mind. Was there some substance to the story of She after all? Certainly the countryside was improbable enough for any sort of outlandish goings-on, even by the everyday standards Haggard's heroes were accustomed to - trackless wastes, savage beasts, blackwater fever, assegai-swinging warriors, bewitchment by tribal sorcerers. Long ago, others beside Haggard had noted the strangeness and beauty of the countryside near the Letaba River. Here is John Buchan describing, in the early 1900s, the same road I was travelling: 'Some 30 miles east of Pietersburg, the Leydsdorp coach climbs laboriously into a nest of mountains, and on the summit enters an upland plateau, with shallow valleys and green, forest-clad slopes. The average elevation may be 5,000 ft, and on all sides one can journey to an edge and look down on a wholly different land. Mists and cool rains abound, every hollow has its stream, and yet frost is rarely known. It is little explored, for until quite lately the native tribes were troublesome. It remained therefore, a paradise with a few devotees, a place secret and strange, with a beauty so peculiar that the people who tried to describe it were rarely believed.' A few things have changed in Letaba since then. Up on the plateau timber is harvested. In the rolling lands at the bottom of the escarpment there are plantations of tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados and lychees - a rich, sub-tropical garden not yet planted in Buchan's day. Nor did the passengers of the Leydsdorp coach have the wonderfully relaxing atmosphere of the present-day Coach House to settle into. Set in fragrant woods on the edge of the steep drop down to the lowlands, it is a cool oasis of comfort and civility. Apart from the current shortage of rain, the area remains what it has always been, a place of strange, misty hills and forests not much frequented by visitors. A superb rack of lamb and bottle of Cape Shiraz on a terrace overlooking the escarpment did nothing to quell the question I knew I would finally have to ask. After dinner, feeling more than slightly sheepish, I asked Sally Macneill, the Coach House's knowledgeable manageress, for enlightenment. 'But of course She exists]' Macneill responded emphatically, much to my surprise. 'She is Modjadji the Rain Queen, ruler of the Lobedu tribe, Transformer of the Clouds, the most powerful rainmaker on the continent. She lives by the Modjadji palm forest, an hour away. If you don't believe it, why don't you go and see her for yourself?' And so I did, but not without some difficulty. One can no more easily stroll into the Rain Queen's royal kraal than one can drop into Buckingham Palace for tea and a chat with with Elizabeth II. Feelers were put out, calls made, delegations sent to the nearby 'homeland' of Lebowa, where Modjadji V rules the tiny kingdom of the Lobedu people. The Modjadji, in fact, leads a much more inaccessible life than the Queen of England. She lives isolated in a royal kraal, or enclosure, and very rarely appears in public. Much of her power and mystique derives from her secretiveness. But Lobedu tradition is firm on a number of points. The Modjadji queens, all powerful rainmakers, originated in the divinely-inspired, incestuous mating of a princess and her brother. Recognising that women hold over men a seductive power that could be turned to the service of the state, they established a line of female rulers free of husbands and marital duties. Without men or armies, the Modjadji queens cunningly used their sexual powers and rain-making ability as tools of conquest to gain the fealty of powerful tribal leaders. Stories of ritual sacrifice, licentious witchcraft, and men murdered after fathering royal daughters all added to an aura of supernatural mystery surrounding the Modjadjis. Credited with immortality and regarded as the greatest magician in the land, the Rain Queen received tribute even from the great Shaka, king of the Zulus. It is little wonder that Rider Haggard took up the story. It is little wonder that I, bearing my own tribute and accompanied by Stanley, the royal translator, eventually stood before the wattle walls of the royal kraal in a state of some trepidation. I need not have. The Rain Queen may still be attended by a court of 42 'wives' - she is still allowed no husband - but exhibits neither an aura of supernatural power nor any great sexual flair. Although we were required to remove our shoes when we made our way across a dried dung floor to a complex of beehive-shaped thatched huts, the Queen received us in relaxed fashion. An enormous woman dressed in a red-and-black turban and a cotton print sporting a tusked elephant, she gave her audience reclining on the cool floor of the verandah of the royal residence. But the Rain Queen knows her worth. When I presented her with my gift, a rather nice copper bracelet - I thought - she looked at it dubiously for a long moment, then at me for an even longer moment. There is no more fobbing off the locals with cheap trade goods, the look seemed to say. Finally, she suggested a more substantial gift, in cash. I hesitated, then reached for my wallet. This, after all, was She Who Must Be Obeyed. If Shaka Zulu coughed up tribute, so must I. Besides, I had a rather important question I wanted answering. Why, I asked after lengthy preambles and pleasantries about South African inflation and the high cost of keeping 42 wives, is there no rain? The country was suffering as it has not done in living memory. Why had she failed to come up with the goods? The Queen made no bones about it. Her ancestors are furious. Last year a Lobedu peasant woman carelessly allowed a fire to run up the hill on which the royal kraal sits. By great bad luck it destroyed the burial site of the Rain Queens. Immediate propitiation was required, and the woman was ordered to sacrifice five black cows and five black sheep. She could not; all-black animals, much sought after for witchcraft purposes, command a premium price. The Modjadji ancestors have held back the rains in consequence. I came away marvelling at the idea that the fate of millions could hang on so little. I also came away with two seeds from the nearby grove of the sacred Modjadji palm. Reputed to have highly aphrodisiac qualities, the juice of the tree is said to have much to do with the Rain Queen's successful rule. One seed I keep for myself. The other is for a certain Old Africa Hand, proof that, as advised, I did indeed turn right at Pietersburg. Nicholas Woodsworth was a guest at the Coach House, PO Box 554, Tzaneen 0850.

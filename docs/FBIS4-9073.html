			<p>BFN     [Text] Albanian President Sali Berisha today received  Ambassador Norman Anderson, chairman of the CSCE mission in  Skopje.    During the meeting President Berisha told Anderson: We are  assessing your mission's efforts to preserve stability and  prevent the conflict, because Albania is deeply interested in  preventing this conflict. However, we observe with anxiety that  the tension continues to remain high and the danger great. The  latest developments in Gorazde and the defeat of the United  Nations and other institutions have greatly increased  possibilities for the conflict to spread down through the region.    Regarding the crisis in Albanian-Greek relations, President  Berisha stressed that the Albanian side has continuously tried  for a policy of understanding and cooperation with its southern  neighbor. However, he said, we ascertain that besides the  Greek-Serb alliance, the Greek Government has continuously used  the Albanian refugee factor as pressure against our country's  sovereignty.    On the other hand, Greek Government officials have attempted  to manipulate certain minority elements to fulfill Greece's open  territorial vindications against Albania. The last case -- the  massacre by the Greek commando at the recruit barracks in  Peshkepi e Siperme -- was an attack against Albania's  sovereignty, for which the Greek Government should bear  responsibility. The Greek commando came from Greek territory  and returned to this territory, too. It had all the  characteristics of a commando of the Greek special forces or  forces with special training. That is why we have raised this  problem to the UN Security Council and the CSCE and have asked  the European Union to set up a commission, despite  investigations carried out by our both commissions, because  Greece cannot be a party in the judgment.    However, we are determined to overcome contradictions  through  dialogue and hope that the other side shows the same will as  well.    Regarding Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], President Berisha stressed that Albania is  profoundly interested in cooperation with this Republic and in  its stability. A considerable percentage of the population in  that Republic is Albanian. I can say that with their  participation in the government, the loyalty they have shown  toward the coalition, and the democratic means and methods they  have used and continue to use to realize their human and  national rights, the Albanians are and will be a factor of  stability.    Without negating the achievements in the field of rights and  freedoms, we insist that the realization of their human and  national rights is an important condition for Macedonia's  stability. In this aspect, the census of the population, the  opening of the schools, and the increasing commitment of the  Albanians in the official structures can be considered by us as  important steps.    For his part, Anderson expressed his concern over the  situation in the region and particularly in Macedonia. The  pressure exerted from Serbia, the possible explosion of a  conflict in Kosova, and the blockade from the south endanger the  stability of this Republic. In this direction, the cooperation  between Albania and Macedonia is useful and serves stability in  the region. We consider the solution of many questions that  preoccupy the Albanians there to be an indispensability and we  are insisting that the Macedonian Government fulfill the demands  of Albanians. We are presently working to accomplish the census  of the population and hope that it will be held in June this  year.</p>

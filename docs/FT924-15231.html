			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Goya may fetch up to Pounds 6m: Saleroom ONE OF very few autograph bullfighting scenes by Goya is to be offered at auction at Sotheby's in London in December. It is the first important subject picture by the artist to appear on the market without export restrictions for decades. A price of Pounds 4m to Pounds 6m is expected. The picture was painted in Paris in 1824 for Goya's compatriot and political exile, Joacqun Mara Ferrer, and is being auctioned by his descendants. Goya appears to have used a palette knife and even his fingers to create an emotive and thickly impasted paint surface. According to a Sotheby's expert, the picture is in 'almost perfect condition'. The auction record for a Goya is Pts 78.4m (Pounds 315,569).</p>

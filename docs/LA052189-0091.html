			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BELEAGUERED KOHL'S PATH GETS ROUGHER  </P> <P> To many West Germans and their allies, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been a tower  of Teutonic stability. Now, however, many of them describe him in considerably  less flattering terms.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Kohl's image has shifted from that of a plodding but reliable  ally to that of a panicky political opportunist, offending Bonn's closest  friends.  </P> <P> In the wake of a series of election setbacks and policy changes, Kohl's  standing in public opinion polls has plummeted, the parties of the government  coalition are wrangling among themselves, and Kohl's future as chancellor is  said to be in doubt.  </P> <P> According to the magazine Stern, party stalwarts may dump Kohl before the  general election scheduled for December, 1990.  </P> <P> "They had Kohl to thank for their seats, posts and sinecures," Stern said, "and  they knew the elephant in the chancellery would stamp on any critic. Now there  is danger that the herd will crush its leader underfoot because it no longer  trusts him to defend their rich feeding grounds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Reasons for Shift  </P> <P> There are a number of reasons for the drastic shift in Kohl's image, but the  main reason is one that goes to the heart of West Germany's ties with its  Western allies: the issue of short-range nuclear missiles based in Kohl's  country. Kohl's position, that the allies should forgo modernizing the missiles  and enter negotiations soon with the Soviet Union on that subject, is directly  opposed to that of Washington, which is in favor of upgrading the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization's arsenal of tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.  </P> <P> Kohl has never been a popular figure, but he has confounded critics with his  ability to survive despite his stolid, wait-and-see leadership. Some observers  say his strengths have been those of a canny, tenacious provincial politician  -- useful qualities but perhaps not suitable for the leader of a major European  power.  </P> <P> Kohl has been compared to the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, the self-made  Texan who combined a sure touch on the domestic scene with a faltering step  abroad. Kohl, as Johnson was, is a big, heavy, shambling man, with a mastery of  the back-room levers of his party, who can be vindictive when crossed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequently Satirized  </P> <P> Also like the Johnson image, Kohl is a rumpled figure with a regional accent,  no facility for foreign languages, and a down-home manner, all of which are  satirized by the political cartoonists who are accustomed to worldly  chancellors such as Konrad Adenauer, Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt.  </P> <P> Kohl has always been criticized for not providing vigorous international  leadership, but this year he seems to have lost his touch on domestic policies,  and this confused and alienated voters in recent local elections.  </P> <P> In trying to placate domestic opinion, Kohl reversed himself on the missile  issue and as a consequence incurred the contempt and anger of Bush  Administration officials and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  </P> <P> Less than a month ago, Bush and Thatcher believed that in return for their  delaying a decision on the sensitive issue of modernizing the missiles in West  Germany, Bonn would not press for negotiations with the Kremlin on their  reduction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caved in to Genscher  </P> <P> But 24 hours after this deal was struck in Brussels, Kohl caved in to the  persistent demands of Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and called for  "early" talks with the Soviets.  </P> <P> He also reversed himself on the length of service for West German conscripts.  His government announced an increase from 15 to 18 months because of the  declining birthrate. Then, to the dismay of defense officials, he said the  extension would be put off. He cited "new figures" but refused to disclose  them.  </P> <P> "These decisions," a West German analyst said, "have infuriated Washington,  London, the defense community and NATO allies, but they may play well at home."  </P> <P> Angelika Volle, a senior West German policy analyst, said, "Germans want to get  rid of nuclear missiles, and they don't mind a chancellor standing up to the  U.S. and British on this."  </P> <P> Kohl has also reversed himself on health, welfare and tax reform questions --  once he realized that they were unpopular.  </P> <P> These about-faces have led to a perception of Kohl as changing course in  response to every political wind rather than providing firm guidance. Still,  some see this as an ability to adjust to popular wishes.  </P> <P> And some of Kohl's problems are not of his making. He presides over an unwieldy  coalition of three parties -- his center-right Christian Democratic Union, its  Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, which is more to the right,  and the liberal Free Democrats, who stand to the left.  </P> <P> Kohl has allowed his foreign minister, Genscher, a leader of the Free  Democrats, to take over the reins of foreign policy, to the consternation of  Washington and London, to the extent that Genscher is known as "Bonn's secret  chancellor." Genscher stands at the top in popularity polls.  </P> <P> For years, Kohl's main antagonist was Franz Josef Strauss, leader of the  Christian Social Union, who died last year. Ironically, Strauss' right-wing  image kept many ultraconservatives under the Christian Democratic tent, but  they are now voting for far-right parties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seemed Improbably Cast  </P> <P> Because of his political shifts, Kohl may not be able to recover the centrist  vote, political observers say, and he has lost the chance to be considered a  true statesman. But Kohl always seemed improbably cast for the world stage.  </P> <P> Born in the industrial city of Ludwigshafen in the wine-growing  Rhineland-Palatinate, he is the son of a Roman Catholic customs official and a  Protestant mother. In high school, he became a youth member of the Christian  Democratic Union, then studied at the University of Heidelberg, which awarded  him a doctorate in history.  </P> <P> At 29, he was elected to the Rhineland-Palatinate state legislature. He married  and fathered two sons and held a succession of political posts, in the process  learning to manipulate the party machinery. He became the youngest man ever  elected premier, or governor, of the state, then moved on to the federal level  in Bonn.  </P> <P> In 1976, he was his party's choice for chancellor but lost to Schmidt. In the  next election, in 1980, Strauss shouldered Kohl aside to run at the top of the  ticket -- and lost. In 1982, the Free Democrats switched allegiance from the  Social Democrats, bringing down the Schmidt government, and teamed up with the  Christian Democrats. Kohl was named chancellor and won the office in his own  right in 1983, then again in 1987.  </P> <P> He has weathered political crises: the Flick affair, involving charges that he  had accepted funds from industries on behalf of his party; his dismissal of a  senior general on unsupported morals charges, and his insistence that  then-President Ronald Reagan accompany him to the Bitburg military cemetery,  which contains the graves of several Nazi SS men.  </P> <P> Kohl scorns public relations advice and is confident that he can reach the  German people directly with his folksy approach. But he is a stilted speaker  and does not project well on television.  </P> <P> He is fond of pointing out that he is the first chancellor of the post-World  War II generation. He speaks of knowing the "real" Germany, as distinguished  from intellectual circles in Bonn, Hamburg and Berlin, and unabashedly praises  the fatherland concept that appeals to much of the middle class.  </P> <P> He has tended to surround himself with men whom some regard as second-rate. His  former official spokesman encouraged him to describe Soviet leader Mikhail S.  Gorbachev as a better propagandist than the Nazi propaganda chief Joseph  Goebbels -- a gaffe that froze Moscow-Bonn relations for nearly two years.  </P> <P> More recently, in part because of poor advice, Kohl mishandled the issue of a  Libyan factory with the apparent potential of making chemical weapons. Kohl  insisted that West German companies were not helping Libya build the factory  long after it had been made clear that they were.  </P> <P> This year, after regional election setbacks in West Berlin and Hesse, Kohl  appeared to panic. He quickly shuffled his Cabinet and reneged on his  commitment to the NATO on the short-range missile issue.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democrats were bolstered at the polls and the  radical Greens party decided to take part in state coalition governments,  creating a real possibility that a "red-green" combination could take power  after the next election.  </P> <P> Despite all this, few political analysts are writing off Kohl, who has proved  the skeptics wrong before. As Volle, the policy analyst, put it, "Though his  strengths are much shorter than his weaknesses, it is easy to underestimate  him."  </P> <P> For one thing, Kohl's u-turn on nuclear missiles could prove to be a big  political bonus. His position is supported by several NATO allies, and the  first domestic impact may come sooner rather than later. On June 18, West  Germans will choose their representatives to the European Parliament, as well  as local officials in the Saarland and in Kohl's own Rhineland-Palatinate.  </P> <P> Those results will be closely studied here and abroad to see whether the  phoenix of West German politics can rise again.  </P></p>

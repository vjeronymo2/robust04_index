			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls as bond yields set a fresh high Wall Street US share prices fell sharply yesterday after bond yields had risen to new highs amid disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not, contrary to expectations, lift interest rates to cool the rapidly expanding economy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.46 at 3,629.04, near its low point for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 5.50 to 442.32, while the American Stock Exchange composite weakened 4.31 to 435.42 and the Nasdaq composite was 9.90 lower at 722.96. Trading volume on the New York SE was 250.9m shares. Typically, a tightening of monetary policy by the Fed is seen as negative for stocks, because higher interest rates undermine confidence in corporate earnings and the attractiveness of equities relative to other financial assets. However, yesterday was different, because the bond market was convinced that the Fed would raise interest rates during the morning session to prevent the economy from overheating and fuelling a revival of inflation. When the Fed did not raise rates as expected, bond prices fell further from their early lows, in the process pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue up to 7.62 per cent, its highest since mid-1992. That increase prompted heavy selling of stocks. Analysts said shares also fell because the Fed's decision not to tighten policy was only likely to prolong the uncertainty that will unsettle financial markets until interest rates are raised again. Among individual stocks, Kemper jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 59 1/8 in heavy trading after the financial services group put itself up for sale following GE Capital raising its bid to Dollars 60 a share. The reaction of the market suggests that investors do not believe that a counter-offer will be made higher than GE Capital's takeover terms. General Electric, GE Capital's parent, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 94 7/8 . McKesson climbed Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 78 after it was confirmed that Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals giant, was in talks to possibly acquire part or all of the US drugs distribution group. Drug stocks as a group, buoyed by the recent merger activity, bucked the trend, with Schering-Plough adding Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 64, Pfizer firming Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 59 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb rising Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 53 3/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson holding at Dollars 40 3/4 . Tobacco shares were the most heavily traded sector of the session. RJR Nabisco declined Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 5 3/4 in volume of 3.2m shares and Philip Morris fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 amid growing concern that a new round of lawsuits was likely to be filed against the tobacco industry in the wake of recent reports that company executives knew for a long time that cigarettes caused lung cancer. Canada Toronto was weighed down by interest rate fears and stocks closed sharply lower after light trading. The TSE 300 composite index tumbled 74.9 points, or 1.76 per cent, to 4,179.1. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 583 to 183 and volume came to 48.8m shares valued at CDollars 539.5m. All 14 sub-indices closed lower, with 12 of the groups dropping more than 1 per cent. Conglomerates had the biggest decline, off 3.4 per cent, as Canadian Pacific fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 20 3/4 . Forestry lost 3.1 per cent and real estate 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 8 May -- "We are making every effort to  carry out, should the need arise, the rapid and organized  evacuation from dangerous parts of Yemen of all Russian citizens  working on contracts in that country," Viktor Posuvalyuk,  director of the Africa and Near East Department of the Foreign  Ministry of the Russian Federation told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent in a telephone conversation. He said that 113  people had already arrived by plane in Moscow from Djibouti,  which borders on Yemen, after being brought there on the French  warship, Jules Verne.    The Russian Foreign Ministry, says the Russian diplomat, is  in constant contact with its colleagues from France. Should the  situation worsen in Aden in the south of the country, we have  obtained the agreement of Paris to bring out as many Russians as  possible from there on a warship which is due to approach the  port of Aden in the near future. Our consul general in the town  has been given exhaustive instructions in this regard. As for  the country's capital, Sanaa, we have plans to bring Russians  out overland to the port of Al Hudaydah where our ship the  Khudozhnik Kustodiyev is waiting. Although Sanaa airport is,  according to our information, besieged and the situation there  is unsafe, the Russian leadership has allocated two passenger  planes which are ready to fly out there for our people if the  situation is permits.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Russian arms spending cuts 'almost end threat to US' RUSSIA is drastically reducing military spending and poses virtually no threat to the US, two top US intelligence officials told Congress yesterday. The assessment by Mr Robert Gates, the new Central Intelligence Agency, and General James Clapper, director of the Defence Intelligence Agency, could stoke congressional pressure for even steeper cuts in the US defence budget. President George Bush is expected - in his State of the Union address to Congress next week - to propose cuts of up to Dollars 50bn in defence. These would go well beyond current plans to reduce the US armed forces by 25 per cent by 1994, though Democrats are calling for up to Dollars 100bn in further reductions. Gen Clapper told the Senate Armed Services committee that the Russian republic appeared to have cut its military procurement in the first quarter of this year by about 80 per cent, compared to past years. Mr Gates noted the elimination of the SS-11 and SS-17 missiles, and of a class of submarines, as well as the winding-down of the Blackjack strategic bomber programme. For the first time in years, there was no new ballistic missile programme under way. The general said military procurement had affected 'virtually all categories of equipment', with the former Soviet republics diverting resources to feed and house troops. The military capabilities of Russia and the other ex-Soviet successor states were in profound decline, he said. However, the administration remains concerned about other threats posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation and the abrasion between Russia and Ukraine over control of the Red Army and the Black Sea fleet. Last year, Mr Gates also referred to the threat of civil disorder caused by economic reforms.</p>

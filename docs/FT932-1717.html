			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (28): Bench marks - Management STRATEGIC BENCHMARKING by Gregory Watson John Wiley Dollars 29.95 pages BENCHMARKING is one of those management practices which has taken time to take root on both sides of the Atlantic. US companies were systematically studying, and learning from, the processes of outstanding competitors, and even non-competitors, in the early and mid-1980s. But only in the current decade has this quality improvement technique become a hot topic for the consultants. One reason is that pundits initially likened benchmarking to 'industrial espionage', maintaining that the concept of sharing information and experiences was contrary to the principles of the free market. Watson argues persuasively that there need be no conflict, though he betrays a somewhat evangelistic streak when describing benchmarking as part of a coherent (American) national challenge for continuous productivity improvement. 'There is a more efficient use of 'society's resources' than requiring every company to invest in relearning the lessons of the marketplace.' As vice president, Quality, of the Office Documents Division of the Xerox Corporation - the company widely credited with inventing benchmarking - the author is at his best discussing its implementation as a business process improvement strategy rather than philosophising. It hammers home the important point that exceptional performance is achieved not just by measuring other people's results but by applying the lessons (or identifying what he calls 'process enablers'). If sometimes a shade repetitive the book is full of useful practical observations.</p>

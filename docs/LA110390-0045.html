			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPE SPILLS AT VA MEDICAL CENTER  </P> <P> A radioactive isotope spilled in a research lab at the Veterans Administration  Medical Center in La Jolla on Friday and was tracked around the hospital by  workers, contaminating several corridors and elevators, officials said.  </P> <P> The radioactive material, which is used in research and cancer therapy, was  spread in small quantities over several floors after the spill about 3 a.m.  Friday, but posed no threat to patients or staff members, hospital spokeswoman  Gayle Gray said.  </P> <P> "After they finished cleaning it up, they ran an analysis of the people  cleaning up and nothing was found on them," Gray said.  </P> <P> She said the hospital floors had been cleaned and decontaminated.  </P> <P> Gray said a team from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was scheduled to arrive  late Friday to investigate the spill.  </P> <P> "We've asked them to come just to determine that everything was all right," she  said.  </P> <P> "The levels of radiation the hospital reported to us should not pose a health  hazard to any of the people in the hospital, including people who may have  gotten the material on their clothing or shoes," commission spokesman Reg Cook  said.  </P> <P> "The only people that we're concerned about at the moment are the four people  who we understand were working at the lab where the spill occurred last night,"  he said. "We don't know what sort of contamination they may have experienced.  </P> <P> "The main thing we'd be worried about is the radiation exposure itself," Cook  said.  </P> <P> He said commission investigators wouldn't know the extent of the contamination  until they interviewed the workers, who were not identified.  </P> <P> Cook said that, when hospital staff members arrived in the morning, they found  the lab sealed with tape indicating that the area was contaminated, but the  hospital radiation safety officer did not learn of the spill until about 8:30  a.m. He said he didn't know who had sealed the lab or how many people actually  were in the lab when the spill occurred.  </P></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Mozambique queues for a better life: A wounded country, sick of war, waits in hope for the fruits of UN-run elections In the port of Beira, the war refugees who squat in the cages of an old zoo are hoping life will get better after Mozambique's first democratic elections, which were held last month. It could hardly get worse. They have no jobs and little food, their children do not go to school and, until recently, their lives were at risk from two of the zoo's older tenants: crocodiles which had also survived Mozambique's 17-year civil war. Beira voted solidly for Mr Afonso Dhlakama, the guerrilla leader-turned-politician, as did five of the six most economically important provinces of Mozambique. But Mr Dhlakama's Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) party did poorly in the capital Maputo and in the populous southern provinces, which returned the Mozambican Liberation Front (Frelimo) government to power. The people of Beira have accepted the election results with equanimity. Local Renamo leaders appealed for calm, and their calls were heeded. In the Beira office of the Geneva-based International Organisation for Migration, former Renamo and Frelimo soldiers queue together waiting for their monthly demobilisation pay cheques and news of vocational training courses which might help them start a new life. 'The first men we demobilised were not soldiers, they were slaves,' says Mr Martin Wyss, who co-ordinates the IOM's work in Beira. He was surprised at the lack of animosity between former combatants, and the absence of political debate during the election campaign. 'They were sick of war. Most have returned to their villages.' At the Renamo headquarters in Beira, a filthy, dilapidated office block, the local party representative admits he is relieved Renamo did not win. 'The government's coffers are empty and we would be castigated for not being able to rebuild the country,' Mr Manuel Perreira says. 'In another five years, we will be stronger and have a better chance of winning the next elections.' For the moment, all eyes are turned to Maputo, where the real political bargaining has begun. President Joaquim Chissano yesterday opened the country's first multi-party parliament, declaring: 'Mutual respect is the first stage of tolerance, without which pluralism is impossible.' Both he and Mr Dhlakama have had much to digest since the election results were announced nearly three weeks ago. The Frelimo government, in power since independence in 1975, was shocked to discover the extent of Renamo's support. The former guerrillas won 112 of the 250 seats in the new parliament, while Mr Dhlakama polled 33 per cent of the votes cast in the presidential election, against 53 per cent for Mr Chissano. Mr Dhlakama is no longer to be dismissed. At the same time, Mr Dhlakama knows that his performance at the polls was really a protest vote against Frelimo's autocratic 19-year rule. The economic heartland of Beira, traditional and religious chiefs, and the Makuas of northern Mozambique, the country's ethnic majority, have little in common but their hatred for a government run by southerners. Having spent the Dollars 17m (Pounds 10.3m) donated by the United Nations to fight the elections, Mr Dhlakama has few resources with which to forge a political party out of such a disparate group of constituents. Western donors have warned Mr Chissano that the survival of Mozambique's new democracy rests on his willingness to earmark state funds to finance all political parties represented in parliament - including the rebels he fought for 17 years. They have also made the renewal of aid - which finances 55 per cent of the state budget - conditional on Mr Chissano's commitment to fashioning a new government which will encompass the country's ethnic and regional diversity and prize competence above party loyalty. 'Mozambicans have shown Frelimo the yellow card,' says Mr Richard Edis, the British ambassador in Maputo. 'The question is, will Frelimo take note and stop fouling, or will it get sent off before the next elections?' Mr Edis believes the donor community is willing to reward Mozambique's orderly transition to democracy - if Mr Chissano displays the necessary pragmatism. There are few illusions regarding the fragility of Mozambique's new democracy or the difficult tasks that lie ahead. More than 3m people, displaced by the war, must be resettled. Some 75,000 soldiers must be re-integrated into civilian life and found jobs before their demobilisation pay runs out in 18 months. The country is still awash with weapons - the UN is leaving next month without completing the search for hidden arms caches - and there are fears that this may lead to increasing crime. Economic reconstruction will be slow. 'For the past two years we have lived on hope,' says Mr Jose Luis Cabaco, a long-standing Frelimo member. 'Now that the elections are over, people expect democracy to bring prosperity, just as they believed Marxism would bring development after independence. It may be just another unrealistic dream.'</p>

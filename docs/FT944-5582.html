			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rembrandt hit by mining write-down Rembrandt Group, the tobacco-based conglomerate controlled by South Africa's Rupert family, has reported a fall in net income to R508m (Dollars 143m) for the six months to September, down from R531m a year ago. The main reason for the drop was an extraordinary item of R114.3m, which represents the group's share of the write-down by mining house Gold Fields in its troubled platinum subsidiary, Northam Platinum. Its figures were also hurt by the decision not to equity account its interests in the unbundled components of the Gencor group, Engen, Malbak and Sappi, and its share of losses due to the start-up costs of cellular phone network Vodacom. However, dividends from these companies were included as investment income. In spite of this, operating income rose to R548m from R533m, while tax paid dropped to R189m from R212m. However, a rise in debt to R936m from R354m, led to higher interest paid at R45m, against R24m previously. Turnover, comprising sales, fees, rental and investment income, rose to R2.48bn from R2.23bn and an interim dividend of 19.6 cents, up from 17.04 cents, was declared. The company gave no breakdown of performance by units, but analysts estimate that the contribution of tobacco, where the company has 60 per cent of the local market, may have been hit by higher tobacco taxes.</p>

Pihl's remarks followed after his department on Wednesday  [16  March] formally brought charges against Rozhok.    "If a person doesn't go there (to a psychiatrist) by his own  will, bringing under compulsion must be implemented. The same  will be done if Rozhok won't appear before investigators.  Everything will be done according to the laws and Rozhok has  the possibility to take a lawyer," Pihl said.    The representative of Russian radical nationalist leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's misleadingly-named Liberal Democratic  Party in his speech in Narva on Jan. 25 and in an interview with  the Russian-language SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK local newspaper of the  northeast Estonian town of Sillamae "fanned inter-ethnic and  political hostility," the indictment says.

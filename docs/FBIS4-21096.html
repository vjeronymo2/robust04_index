			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] An article in Beijing XIAOFEI SHIBAO in  Chinese on 24 January 1994 presents an overview of drug use in  China's western provinces. The article begins with statistics  indicating the scope of the drug problem in China's western  cities. In Xining, there are over 1,000 registered drug users.  Xian has over 1,000 addicts, and in a railroad engineer school  in Lanzhou, one class has over 48 students that use drugs.  According to the article, with so many overt drug users, the  number of secret users is undoubtedly much greater. A survey of  over 400 drug users revealed that 72.6 percent were under the  age of 25, while 22.3 percent were between the ages of 25 and  35. Of those surveyed, 62.89 percent had a middle-school  education, 23.23 percent had completed high school, and 12.8  percent had only been to primary school. The article's  introduction also touches on the money associated with drug  trafficking. In Yunnan, 1 kg of heroin is worth 5,000-10,000  yuan. In Guangdong, 1 kg is worth 30,000-50,000 yuan, and in  Hong Kong, US$30,000-50,000.    The next section of the article discusses various methods  used to smuggle drugs, such as concealing them in tires, gas  tanks, hollowed-out books, and other devices. To pass through  customs, smugglers also conceal drugs in various body cavities,  such as the stomach or vagina. In one case a woman hollowed out  the chest of a dead infant and concealed drugs within it.    The article then moves on to the social costs associated  with  the use of heroin: broken homes, theft, murder, and  prostitution. Users often begin using drugs and later get  involved in trafficking and other crimes. One 19-year-old woman  became involved in prostitution to support her drug habit. By  the time public security caught her, she had three different  venereal diseases.    The next section sketches the personality types of drug  users. Many of the users aged 15-25 are "experimenters"--people  who know very little about heroin and are not aware of what they  are getting into. Others succumb to peer pressure. Drug users,  the article asserts, love company, and any given user will have  three to eight companions. The new affluence has produced  another group of users; drug use is seen as the "consumption of  the rich" and "high class enjoyment." However, people often  spend themselves back into poverty and destroy their households.  The misguided use of heroin as a medicinal drug has produced  yet another category of user, as some who attempt to cure  disease with it end up addicted. A related delusion  occasionally afflicts young women, who see heroin as an  effective agent for weight loss. A final category, according to  the article, consists of people who turn to drugs after divorce  in an effort to restore their emotional balance.    The final section of the article briefly discusses worldwide  statistics on drug use, noting that China was a "drug-free  nation" until the 1970s, when drug use began to become a problem  in border regions. Currently, China has 148,000 registered drug  users. However, in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu,  Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Guangdong, the actual number of  users far exceeds 150,000, according to a random survey.</p>

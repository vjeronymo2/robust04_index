			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Italy counts the cost: Bomb damage at the Uffizi art gallery in Florence after yesterday's attack is likely to top L30bn FIREMEN, policemen and visiting dignitaries yesterday replaced tourists at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, looking at bomb damage, not art. The full scale of the destruction caused by a huge car bomb only began to come to light at mid-day after museum staff had made a preliminary assessment of the gallery and its priceless treasures, and salvage teams had cleared the debris from a radius of 300 metres surrounding the Uffizi in the heart of Florence. 'The damage was far worse than I suspected,' said Mr Stefano Martelli, a junior curator. 'I live some 8km out of Florence and heard the blast but never imagined it was like this, or could be a bomb.' The sturdy 16th century structure of the gallery withstood the blast but all 30 sets of windows on either side of the museums's famous courtyard were blown in. In the street adjoining the explosion, buildings had crumbled and ancient guttering hung sadly from top floors. It was in this street, close to the River Arno, that the main casualties occurred, including the killing of five people. 'Most of us came as soon as we could and we have been working since before eight this morning to remove pictures from the damaged galleries,' said Mr Martelli. He reckons as many as 1,000 pictures will have to be moved. Police cordoned off the area around the gallery for fear of looters and the gallery itself was closed to all save staff and security experts. There is structural damage to the wing closest to the blast and the normal visitors' entrance has had part of its ceiling affected. 'The pictures have been damaged by glass fragmentation in the blast, and this has lacerated some paintings. Others have been peppered with a fine combination of dust, fragments of glass and masonry,' said another member of the gallery staff. Visiting the nearby church of Santo Stefano de la Porta, temporarily housing important 14th century works, it was possible to see glass damage. Blown in windows have gashed the paint down to the white undersurface of a Madonna, and a Giotto Madonna has been lightly peppered with minute particles. 'Luckily the most important paintings in the damaged wing had protective glass in front of them and this has saved them,' said another official. Many of those helping to clear up the damage yesterday had helped in 1976 when the Arno overflowed and flooded part of the Uffizi, causing serious damage. It is reckoned that at least L30bn (Pounds 13.2m) will be needed immediately to cover repairs. 'We have plenty of restorers - that is not the problem. It is the time taken to clean and re-hang the paintings, plus insuring that all the security systems are fully repaired,' said Mr Martelli. A full list of the damaged works should be available in the next few days but already the museum has accepted it has lost three paintings in the Caravaggesque gallery, with another 30 badly damaged. The damage was caused in galleries 25-45. Those containing the treasures of the Florentine Renaissance were completely unaffected.</p>

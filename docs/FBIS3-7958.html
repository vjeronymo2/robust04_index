			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 14 February issue of the Split daily  SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, in an article entitled "The Return of  Comrade Veljko" on page 5, criticizes the appointment of Veljko  Knezevic as head of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]  diplomatic office in Zagreb. "Croats know who Veljko Knezevic  is.... As an arrogant chief of the central committee -- as well  as the chief of SDB [State Security Service] operations -- he  was tasked with creating political conditions in Croatia that  would benefit the Serbs, both natives of Croatia and newcomers,"  SLOBODNA DALMACIJA states, adding that the return of Knezevic to  the "scene of the crime" and the forcing of Croats to accept a  "criminal" as "ambassador" contains "Milosevic's true message of  reconciliation and forgiveness." The paper remarks that, with  this appointment, Milosevic, the "Belgrade mass murderer," shows  a sense of humor typical of "sadistic maniacs" who in  "committing their crimes ridicule their victims."</p>

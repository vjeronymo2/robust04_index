			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> PANEL TO CONSIDER TWO RIDGELINE PLANS  </P> <P> The Planning Commission tonight will compare two proposed ordinances intended  to protect undeveloped ridgelines and govern hillside development throughout  Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> On Friday, a petition signed by more than 5,000 residents was delivered to the  city in support of an initiative backed by the Laguna Niguel Ridgeline  Protection and Preservation Committee, members said. A separate, city-backed  ordinance has been in the making for several months.  </P> <P> Larry Lawrence, whose San Juan Capistrano firm developed the proposal for the  city, said that planning commissioners will compare the two options tonight.  "They both try to achieve some of the same goals, so they're not really in  contrast with each other," he said. "It's just that their focus is different."  </P> <P> Members of the Ridgeline Protection and Preservation Committee, however, have  said repeatedly that they will push for their own ordinance, which they insist  is tougher than the city plan. They say they have collected enough signatures  to force a special election if city officials reject their proposal. The  committee and the city have different setback requirements.  </P> <P> One major difference in the two options is that the city's ordinance would give  "city decision-making bodies more discretion in dealing with individual  projects," Lawrence said.  </P> <P> "It's a very important distinction," he added.  </P> <P> If city officials are not allowed such leeway, Lawrence said, some property  could be rendered undevelopable, leaving the city open to potential legal  problems. "That's our biggest concern," he said, "because you can't do that  under the law."  </P> <P> Members of the Ridgeline Protection and Preservation Committee had attempted to  have their proposed ordinance put on the Laguna Niguel City Council agenda last  week to allow time to place the issue before voters in November's election.  When they learned that the issue would not be placed on the agenda, committee  members continued collecting signatures to make sure that they would have  enough to call a special election if necessary. More signatures are needed to  call a special election than are required to have a measure placed on the  ballot during a regular election.  </P> <P> "We wanted to make sure this was ironclad so there was not a question in  anybody's mind that we had enough to qualify," said Richard Taylor, chairman of  the committee. However, since a special election would be an additional burden  to taxpayers, Taylor said, committee members are hoping that city officials  will endorse their ordinance.  </P> <P> "It's been a real hard push," he said. "I feel it would be in their best  interest if they adopted it. I mean 5,000 (signers) say they want it."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission is expected to consider the two proposals tonight and  then continue the public hearing until the Aug. 28 meeting, Lawrence said.  Tonight's meeting will begin at 7 p.m. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

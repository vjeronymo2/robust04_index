			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Charnos CHARNOS pre-tax losses jumped to Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 667,000) in the six months to June 25 on sales of Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 22.7m). Losses per share were 78.2p (22.96p). The company, which makes hosiery and lingerie, said budgeted sales for the final weeks of the year should result in a pre-tax profit comparable to last time's Pounds 5.2m. It could not make a firm prediction because of uncertain factors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 24 KYODO -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  will visit four former Soviet states in Central Asia in April,  diplomatic sources in Beijing said Thursday [24 March].    The premier will visit Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan  and Kazakhstan from April 18 to 28, a diplomatic source said.    The visit will be the first visit by a top Chinese leader to  a country belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States  since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.    A visit by President Jiang Zemin to Russia could happen in  the fall, the source said.    The high-level visits are seen as resulting from China's  determination to engage in economic and trade activities with  its neighbors, especially in light of recent frictions in  Sino-U.S. relations, analysts said.    The trip will be the first overseas visit for Li since going  to Vietnam in November 1992. Li's trip, which originally  included a trip to Mongolia, was first scheduled for April last  year, but was canceled after he had a heart attack.    Mongolia is presently consulting with China for a visit by  Li  in June or July, the source said.    Trade, especially in oil and oil exploration, will be the  main theme of the trip, the diplomat said, with a 90-member  Chinese ministerial and business delegation expected to  accompany Li.    A border agreement with Kazakhstan will also be signed, he  said.</p>

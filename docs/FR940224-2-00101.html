			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Previous Pelly Amendment Certification of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 7, 1993, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt determined that nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan are engaging in trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products that diminishes the effectiveness of CITES, and so notified the President of the United States. That determination constituted a certification under the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, 22 U.S.C. 1978(a)(2), which provides that the Secretary of the Interior shall make a certification to the President if he determines that nationals of a foreign country, directly or indirectly, are engaged in trade or taking which diminishes the effectiveness of any international program for the conservation of endangered or threatened species; CITES is such a program. Secretary Babbitt announced this certification at the thirtieth meeting of the CITES Standing Committee, in Brussels, Belgium September 6&hyph;8, 1993; staff of the Service's Office of Management Authority (OMA) also participated in the meeting. The Standing Committee made several recommendations to both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan on eliminating the illegal trade in both rhinoceroses and tigers. In response to the Secretary of the Interior's certification, the Standing Committee recommendations, and after bilateral discussions with both China and Taiwan, and careful deliberation and evaluation, on November 5, 1993 the President: Reported to Congress on the certification; made several recommendations to both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan; and required that unless measurable, verifiable, and substantial progress is made by March, 1994, import prohibitions on trade with both governments would be necessary, as recommended by the CITES Standing Committee. Since that time, two CITES missions have visited both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, and bilateral meetings have taken place. A U.S. government technical assistance mission from the Departments of Interior and Justice will visit both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan in late February-early March. An evaluation of progress and a preliminary decision on possible trade prohibitions is expected in March, 1994. The thirty first CITES Standing Committee meeting will take place March 21&hyph;25 in Geneva, Switzerland, where the issues of rhinoceros and tiger trade will also be discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Information and Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has reviewed the November 8 letter, and finds that it contains sufficient information to warrant a consideration of whether nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan are undermining the effectiveness of CITES by engaging trade or taking of endangered species other than rhinoceroses and tigers. Both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan have been previously certified to the President under the Pelly Amendment for trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products. If the Secretary of the Interior finds that nationals of the People's Republic of China and/or Taiwan are diminishing the effectiveness of CITES by trading in additional species, the existing certification would be amended accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice requests comments and information from the public on the following: The international trade in the species discussed, particularly involving the People's Republic of China and Taiwan; the conservation status of these species in the wild; the effect of illegal trade on their populations; whether or not actions of nationals of the People's Republic of China and/or Taiwan are undermining the effectiveness of CITES; and on any illegal trade in these species by nationals of other countries or entities. This information will be utilized by the Service in determining whether to recommend that the Secretary amend the existing certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Author  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice was prepared by Dr. Susan S.

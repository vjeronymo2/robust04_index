			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: No punches pulled as Mrs Witte goes for gold - A bitter battle to reduce costs at Canada's Giant mine YELLOWKNIFE, capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, is a rough place at the best of times. But the mood there has turned downright ugly in the ten months since 240 workers were locked out from the Giant gold mine on the outskirts of town. Middle ground has become hard to find in the bitter dispute between Royal Oak Mines, which owns Giant, and the local branch of the Canadian Association of Steel and Allied Workers (Casaw). Brawls erupt more frequently than ever in Yellowknife's numerous bars and vandalism has become endemic. The mood among the town's 15,000 residents was captured in a recently-circulated anonymous letter, which expressed the wish that every member of the union would be 'dropped from a helicopter in the middle of Great Slave Lake with a ball and chain on each wrist and ankle'. Emotions were rubbed especially raw by the deaths of nine strike-breakers in an underground explosion at the mine last September. Although no arrests have yet been made, many residents of Yellowknife take it for granted that Casaw members were involved. Only the intensity of the Giant dispute, however, separates it from tensions which are evident throughout North American resource industries as employers and workers wrestle with sagging metal prices and competition from low-cost Third World suppliers. Mrs Peggy Witte, Royal Oak's president, sees her company as one of the few willing to confront organised labour in the drive to bring down costs. Throughout the Giant dispute, Royal Oak has single-mindedly concentrated on keeping the mine in operation, rather than taking the less painful routes of cutting production or watering down its demands for concessions from the union. Third-quarter output of 22,185 ounces was 5 per cent lower than the same quarter a year earlier, but 7 per cent up on the previous three months. Giant's fourth-quarter production was not disclosed in Royal Oak's 1992 results, published last week. 'Many of the big companies don't want to face the situation,' Mrs Witte says. She adds, however, that several of them have demonstrated their support by contributing to the reward fund - now totalling CDollars 225,000 (Pounds 120,000) - for information leading to the arrest of the those responsible for last September's murders. Mrs Witte asserts that 'nobody is aggressive enough to say: 'It's got to stop here'. I'm not willing to keep the mine open with a (labour) contract I can't live with'. Royal Oak has kept Giant operating with replacement workers flown in from the south and, more recently, with some Casaw members who have crossed the picket line. The company has rejected government efforts to impose a settlement on anything other than its own terms. Mrs Witte also refuses point-blank to take any union activists back on the payroll until last September's murders are solved. Royal Oak's uncompromising stand has won it admirers, but also many enemies. A government commission was in Yellowknife last week to hear allegations that a new union formed by replacement workers and strike-breakers is, in the words of Casaw's lawyer, a 'front organisation' for the company. 'She doesn't want to sit down and talk to us,' complains a worker manning the union's picket hut outside Giant's main gate. The hut is plastered with slogans such as 'Scabs took our jobs'. Although Mrs Witte denies it, Casaw and its sympathisers are convinced that Royal Oak's aim is to destroy the union. For Royal Oak, the nub of the issue is the survival of the mine. According to Mrs Witte, Giant has a life of at least 10 years if costs can be brought down to the USDollars 280-290 an ounce range, which is substantially below the present gold price of Dollars 330 an ounce. If not, the mine is unlikely to last longer than another two or three years without a big jump in the bullion price. Wage increases at Giant have averaged 8.3 per cent a year since the early 1980s. Prior to the lockout, workers were taking home an average of CDollars 77,000 a year in pay and benefits, with the best-paid earning CDollars 132,000, equivalent in Canada to a senior manager's salary at a large company. During negotiations with the union last year, Royal Oak offered to maintain hourly wage rates. But it wants to peg future increases to the gold price and to trim benefits, including a number of holidays, regular air fares to Edmonton, 950 km (590 miles) to the south, and the bus which carries miners between Yellowknife and the mine. Since it bought the mine in 1990, Royal Oak has succeeded in bringing down cash production costs from almost Dollars 400 an ounce to about Dollars 305 an ounce. (The latest figures exclude CDollars 3.5m in strike-related costs last year, almost all spent on extra security for the property and the replacement workers). Royal Oak has added an extra shift, changed work schedules and put greater emphasis on preventive maintenance. The replacement workers have accepted substantially lower wages than the locked-out union members. Giant's survival is crucial to Royal Oak's plans to press ahead with expansion plans in the Northwest Territories. The company, which is carving out a reputation for restoring high-cost gold mines to profitability, last month signed a deal to acquire the mothballed Colomac property, north-east of Yellowknife. It aims to reopen Colomac in 1994, bringing down operating costs from about Dollars 425 an ounce when the mine was closed to less than Dollars 300. The key to lower costs however, is running Colomac in tandem with the Giant property. Payroll, human resources, safety administration and various other functions would be combined. Mrs Witte is also interested in buying Kennecott's Con mine in Yellowknife 'if the price was right.' The labour contract at Con, which expires at the end of April, is currently being renegotiated. The mine's owners and its workers are expected to draw some sobering lessons from recent events at Giant. Observers in Yellowknife anticipate that the United Steelworkers Union, which represents the Con workers, will accept management's demands for concessions more readily than its counterpart did at Giant. Indeed, Mrs Witte predicts that the tough line she is taking at Giant will find an echo in the North American mining industry far beyond Yellowknife's two gold producers.</p>

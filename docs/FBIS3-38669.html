			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl has strongly urged  the Russian Government to refrain from any attempt to violate  the sovereignty of its neighboring states. Opening the 31st  conference on security in Munich, Kohl addressed 220 defense  politicians, diplomats and journalists. In his speech, Kohl  again supported Bundeswehr participation in so-called  peacemaking combat missions.    [Begin Kohl recording] I believe a policy which in such a  situation invokes peace, but on the other hand refuses the  international community the instruments for preserving peace, is  not credible or convincing. For that reason, I regard it as  indispensable for Germany to participate in all future  peacekeeping and peacemaking measures -- naturally, only with  our partners and friends in NATO and the European Union. We  realize that all our partners expect this of us.    Ladies and Gentlemen, this also means that Germany needs a  Bundeswehr which meets the demands made on it, including these  new demands, a Bundeswehr which must be equipped accordingly.  We have learned, perhaps more so than others, that peace and  freedom cannot be obtained at no cost. [end recording] [passage  omitted]</p>

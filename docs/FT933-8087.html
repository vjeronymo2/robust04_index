			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Trade News: ABB in link with Russian carmaker ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has formed a joint venture with AvtoVAZ (Volga Auto Works), Russia's largest car manufacturer, to make fans in Russia for the domestic and industrial ventilation market. The deal, announced yesterday, is another step in ABB's strategy to develop local production in Russia, which it views as a long-term opportunity. For AvtoVAZ, which makes Lada cars, the deal provides a use for spare capacity at its sprawling plant at Togliatti on the Volga River. A new company, Lada-Flakt, will manufacture ABB Flakt designs of axial-flow fans, which are more efficient and effective than conventional fans. ABB said axial-flow fans were a well-established product in western markets, but were not well known in Russia. 'This is why we feel we have a good chance to introduce the product,' it said. ABB will own 50 per cent of the new company, with 10 per cent owned by AvtoVAZ and 40 per cent by Ladainvest. The latter includes stake holdings by Lada Holding Company, Lada Bank and the Lada workers, who will have a 16 per cent stake in the venture as part of the continuing privatisation process of AvtoVAZ. ABB will provide technical know-how and special machinery. Lada will provide 3,000 sq metres of factory buildings and remaining plant and machinery for the fan factory, which will employ about 100 existing Lada workers. ABB said production would begin at the beginning of next year, and annual turnover was expected to be Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.7m). The joint venture would supply the Russian home market and countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States with a new generation of axial-flow fan designs. ABB confirmed last month that it is in talks over the future of a Russian defence and aero-engine factory. It would not give further details yesterday on these talks, which could result in a joint venture to produce power plant for the local market. AvtoVAZ has already established contacts with western companies in the automotive industry, but yesterday's deal is understood to be the first with a company outside the automotive industry. In February it formed a vehicle parts joint venture with Federal-Mogul and Allied-Signal of the US, and Sogefi of Italy. General Motors of the US is supplying engine control systems to the Russian company, whose car plant is one of the largest in the world. ABB has confirmed it received a SFr322m (Pounds 144.7m) order in March for a power station from the Libyan state's Secretariat of Energy, Reuter reports from Zurich.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Accidents at work 'going unreported' Many thousands of accidents at work each year go unreported, and most could be prevented, Labour said yesterday, citing a Health and Safety Executive estimate. Mr Kevin Barron, Labour frontbench spokesman on health and safety, said 143,244 serious accidents were reported at work in 1992-93. There were 368 deaths as a result of accidents at work and a further 22,807 serious injuries - 120,069 victims required three or more days off work.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSMAN BEILENSON  </P> <P> I have had the personal privilege of working with Rep. Beilenson over the last  nine years in areas affecting this community and can attest to the fact that  his interest in the well-being of this community has been demonstrated over and  over and in many ways. This includes his work relating to issues such as  transportation, environment and recreational space.  </P> <P> Beilenson has been most active in securing funds to expand the Santa Monica  Mountains wildlife areas. He has also been extremely instrumental in working to  bring funds to provide recreational facilities for the Sepulveda Basin. It is  through his efforts that the Valley will be the beneficiary of a 26-acre  recreational lake, which will open within the next 18 months in the Sepulveda  Basin.  </P> <P> Beilenson brings a unique ability to representing not only his constituents but  the country as well. His background enables him to present a broad view of the  issues we face and his committee assignments have focused in those areas, such  as intelligence, budgets and areas affecting the Rules Committee. He is an  individual who I feel brings tremendous knowledge, experience and above all,  the highest integrity to the office he serves.  </P> <P> STUART M. SOLOMON  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

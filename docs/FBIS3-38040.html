			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [International Affairs Department, Operational Information </F> Department report: "Two Russian Spies Caught. Clinton Delayed  a `Present' Until the Day of the Defenders of the Fatherland"]    [Excerpts] According to information received from the  United States yesterday, after two years of surveillance the FBI  has arrested Aldrich Ames, a CIS department chief with a 30-year  service record, and his Colombian-born wife, Maria del Rosario  Casas. The agents, charged with spying for the USSR and later  Russia, face life imprisonment. The emergence of yet another  "Rosenberg case" -- they were executed in the early 1950's for  selling nuclear secrets to the USSR -- might well not have  transcended the limits of the talk about the hard life of  "cloak-and-dagger knights" were it not for a juicy detail.  KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned from confidential sources that  Aldrich Ames was detained 10 months ago, not this Monday. At  any rate, for some reason it was decided to "expose" the agents  precisely at this juncture.  <H5>  The Ames' May Have Been Given Up by an FIS "Mole" </H5>   Boris Labusov, official at the Russian Foreign Intelligence  Service [FIS]'s press bureau, said in response to your  KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent's request that he comment on the  report: "Under the Russian Law on Foreign Intelligence, this  incident will not be commented upon." A trustworthy source  close to the FIS spoke to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent  about the actual mood that has reigned among FIS chiefs after  the exposure of the Ames'. The atmosphere of shock and  despondency at the loss of a very valuable agent has been  compounded by a suspicion, which has already evolved into a firm  conviction, that Aldrich Ames was given up to the Americans by  an as yet unidentified high-ranking official of the FIS itself.  "This is a `mole' we have been dug up from within," the  KOMMERSANT-DAILY source claims. "Moreover, judging from the Ames  case, the level of information he has had access to limits the  number of potential traitors to a very narrow range of persons.  It is at the level of Primakov's deputies." [passage omitted]  <H5>  Qui Prodest? </H5>   The "spy passions" in relations between Moscow and  Washington  have been a common phenomenon, but it is unclear why it was  decided, after two years of surveillance, to "expose" the agents  precisely at this stage and with such a brouhaha. As a matter  of fact, according to reports from FIS sources, the Russian  special services' "catch" of Western spies in 1993 was worthy of  being registered in the Guinness Book of World Records: It  exceeded even the record high of 30 or so spies achieved under  Vladimir Kryuchkov. And no clamor whatsoever! According to the  rules of "the invisible war," however, if someone is caught  red-handed here, this gesture is set to be reciprocated  oversees. The only cause of "indignation" may be the "dumping"  practiced by CIA recruiters in Russia: They pay virtually no  "regular salaries," whereas "lump sum" payments usually do not  exceed $30,000-40,000.    The war of intelligence services has tended to climax in  periods of chilliness in interstate relations. Evidently, they  have presently decided in the United States that the time has  come. Why now? There are a number of suggestions. The U.S.  Congress has just started the consideration of the next year's  budget, and the draft has not contained lavish financial  promises to the CIA. So far. But what appears to be the actual  reason is the emerging chilliness in Russia's relations with the  West. Furthermore, a meeting of the Group of Seven finance  ministers will open on Saturday. The main question is the  revision of the system of assistance to Russia. Washington has  already hinted that if Russia "takes appropriate steps," the  United States "will continue productive cooperation" (meaning  the $2.5 billion of U.S. assistance). As a result of the  chilliness, however, the as yet vague outlines of hostility  toward the Chernomyrdin government may take on a more definite  shape. And the former linkage of the assistance to the demand  that "reform should continue" may be replaced by a more familiar  rivalry with Russia. Of course, two arrested agents are not  enough to change a climate. But they do spoil the weather.</p>

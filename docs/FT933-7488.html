			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Sharp rise in east German investment INVESTMENTS in eastern Germany increased sharply last year despite the recession in western Germany and the high level of labour costs in the region, the Ifo institute for economic forecasting reported yesterday. But investments in western Germany continued to decline, a trend which is expected to continue all year. Investments in the five new states increased by 30 per cent to DM16.6bn (Pounds 6.4bn) last year, compared to 1991, with raw materials, food processing and services sector accounting for over 70 per cent. But signs of investment in the region's uncompetitive industrial base, or indications of the growth of new industrial sectors, have yet to emerge. According to the Ifo survey, investments in industry rose 12 per cent in 1992 but will decline this year. The high level of investments in the east is partly explained by earlier commitments by west German companies made immediately after unification, which were spread over a few years, and backed by generous subsidies. This trend is expected to continue throughout 1993, when investments are likely to peak at DM20bn. The investment growth in the east is in marked contrast to those in western Germany. They fell 6 per cent in 1992 over the previous year because of the recession.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NAVAL ACADEMY TO REFIT STADIUM  </P> <P> Refurbishing a battleship was never like this.  </P> <P> The Naval Academy hopes to add 48 luxury sky-boxes to 32-year-old Navy-Marine  Corps Memorial Stadium by the start of the 1991 football season, according to  Athletic Director Jack Lengyel.  </P> <P> The Naval Academy Athletic Assn. -- the privately funded organization that  operates the Navy sports program -- signed an agreement Thursday with  University Partners to market the boxes and a new club-level seating area.  Construction will begin after the 1990 season if commitments have been received  for 80% of the new seats.  </P> <P> Navy, which has not had a winning season since 1982, wanted a revamped stadium  to go with its revamped schedule for the 1990s. The Midshipmen have  discontinued longstanding series with Eastern powers Syracuse and Pittsburgh,  and will play only two home games this fall against Division I-A teams --  Boston College and Akron.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IMPORT BAN URGED ON LEG-TRAP FURS  </P> <P> The European Community's Executive Commission today proposed banning the import  of furs from animals caught in leg-hold traps.  </P> <P> The measure would ban imports of furs or fur products originating "in a country  where the leg-hold trap is still used or where the trapping methods used for  the listed species do not meet internationally agreed humane trapping  standards," the commission said. Listed species included beaver, otter, coyote,  wolf, lynx, bobcat, sable and raccoon.  </P> <P> The leg-hold trap has been banned in more than 60 countries -- but not in  Canada, the United States or the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Hungary's left in poll uprising: Only the liberals can prevent a landslide by ex-communists Hungarian liberals yesterday began an uphill battle to stop the former communists translating their victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections into a landslide in the second and decisive round of voting on May 29. With 32.5 per cent of the vote, the Hungarian Socialist party, the successor to the communist regime, won 55 seats, took the lead in a further 158 and came within reach of an outright majority in Hungary's 386-seat parliament. The Hungarian elections establish as a firm trend the resurgence of former communists in the region on a tide of public disillusionment with the pain of economic transition. Socialists are back in power in Poland and Lithuania and only in the Czech Republic have the ruling conservatives maintained their popularity. The Socialist surge came at the expense of the governing conservatives. Voters, bitter at the decline in their living standards, gave the Hungarian Democratic Forum only 12 per cent of the vote. But the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, whose 19.4 per cent of the vote put it in second place, called on voters yesterday to switch to it in the run-off election later this month to avert a Socialist political monopoly. A Free Democrat comeback would deny the Socialists an outright majority and make the most likely outcome of the election a coalition between the two parties. As in Poland, the Hungarian ex-communists may offer the premiership to the leader of their smaller coalition partner, the Free Democrats', Mr Gabor Kuncze. Hungary's stock market had discounted a strong Socialist showing in the elections but the prospect of an outright majority for the former communists caused consternation. Only one transaction took place in the first 45 minutes of trading yesterday. But when activity did begin there were few price movements and the BSE index closed down just 1.56 on 1619.22. Compensation coupons, the vouchers issued by the conservative government to owners of property confiscated by the former communist regime, fell to an all-time low of 49.5 per cent before recovering slightly. These special securities can be used to buy state property, and while the Socialists have said they will continue with this privatisation programme, the market doubts they will be as generous as the current government in offering state companies for coupons. A public offering for compensation coupons of shares in Danubius Hotels, one of Hungary's three large hotel chains, was massively oversubscribed as investors sought to reduce their holdings of the securities. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the former and likely future Socialist finance minister, also said in an interview that he would immediately halt the small shareholder programme, a Hungarian variant of mass privatisation which allows small investors to pay for public issues on an instalment basis. But Mr Bekesi, who represents the strong technocratic wing of the party, reaffirmed the Socialists' overall commitment to privatisation. He indeed suggested he would open the economy further to foreign investors, who have already injected more than Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) into Hungary in the last five years.</p>

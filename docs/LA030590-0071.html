			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> BEING SLICKER THAN TEFLON AT AMERICAN EXPRESS  </P> <P> James D. Robinson III has a set of moves that even the late Harry Houdini, the  leading escape artist of his time, would have admired. The difference is that  Houdini escaped from tanks filled with water, and Robinson, chairman of  American Express Co., escapes from tanks filled with sharks. Corporate sharks,  that is.  </P> <P> It is really slick. Within the past year, Robinson has walked away, seemingly  untouched, from at least four debacles that would have gotten most corporate  chairmen torn apart. The list:  </P> <P> * The disaster at Shearson Lehman Hutton, in which American Express finally  said Sunday that it would buy up the 39% of the stock in the brokerage that it  doesn't already own by exchanging 0.426 of its own shares for each Shearson  share.  </P> <P> * The Safra scandal, in which American Express was caught falsely accusing  banker Edmund Safra, one of its competitors, of laundering money, and ended up  agreeing to pay $8 million to Safra-selected charities to buy its way out of  trouble.  </P> <P> * The insider trading scandal, in which American Express' investment banker,  Salim B. (Sandy) Lewis, pleaded guilty to manipulating the price of Fireman's  Fund stock upward on American Express' behalf. There's no sign that AmEx knew  or condoned what Lewis has pleaded guilty to doing, but it raises the question  of how American Express came to have a crook representing it.  </P> <P> * The RJR Nabisco fiasco, described in the best-selling book "Barbarians at the  Gate." The authors describe in great detail the behind-the-scenes role that  Robinson, unhappy with the way Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen was handling  things, played in trying to help Shearson do the deal. Cohen has taken the  blame, but you have to wonder why Shearson fared so miserably despite so much  personal attention from Robinson.  </P> <P> In most big, visible companies such as AmEx, any of these four reverses would  have led to reams of news articles wondering who should be blamed. Any two  within a year would have sparked a spate of "What's Going On at American  Express?" articles. All four would have put the chairman on the street.  </P> <P> Yet, here is Jim Robinson, sailing along, seemingly unscathed. Likewise,  American Express maintains its reputation as a well-managed, high-class  company. This has to be one of the best jobs of financial public relations in  the memory of man. It's such a good campaign that you don't even see it.  </P> <P> Consider the Shearson debacle. AmEx, which paid $900 million for Shearson in  1981 and up until Sunday's announcement owned 61% of it, had been offering  Shearson around for months. Last week American Express said if it couldn't find  a buyer it was going to put $1 billion into Shearson just to save it. As the  late Sen. Everett Dirksen once said, "A billion dollars here and a billion  dollars there, and soon you're talking about real money."  </P> <P> Robinson, of course, wasn't running Shearson. But he had AmEx buy the company,  he presided over the departure of Shearson Chairman Sanford I. (Sandy) Weill  and he installed Cohen, on whose watch disaster has struck.  </P> <P> How does Robinson escape all this unscathed?  </P> <P> Part of the answer, of course, is that except for Shearson, none of these  things makes a significant difference in American Express' income statement.  </P> <P> As American Express' first-rate public relations people point out, shareholders  have done quite well under Robinson. American Express' stock is up 367% in the  10 years ending Dec. 31, 1989, compared to 228% for the Dow Jones industrials  and 227% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. American Express makes  good money; its balance sheet is strong; it has made some fine acquisitions  such as Investors Diversified Services.  </P> <P> You can argue that American Express would have done even better had it stuck to  its franchises rather than embarking on a series of glitzy, largely  undistinguished diversifications that distracted money and management effort  from credit cards, direct marketing and Travel Related Services. But that's an  abstract argument, hard for stockholders to get excited about.  </P> <P> The real secret to Robinson's ability to escape being tarred with disasters is  probably that he is extremely adept at what PR people call "damage control."  This often seems to consist of throwing people over the side, quickly. These  human sacrifices seem to appease the gods. It's the decentralized, "my  responsibility, your fault" school of management.  </P> <P> This has been the pattern since at least 1979, when American Express launched a  hostile takeover attempt for McGraw-Hill, the publisher of Business Week  magazine, then backed off for reasons that have never been disclosed. The human  sacrifice in that case was American Express President Roger Morley, who also  served on the board of McGraw-Hill. He's now known in some quarters as  "Morley's ghost."  </P> <P> Peter Cohen served as the human sacrifice for both the Shearson and RJR Nabisco  reverses. And Harry Freeman, an executive vice president in the corporate  affairs department, took early retirement for failing to detect and stop the  smear campaign against Safra. Sandy Lewis, of course, was the fall guy for the  Fireman's Fund manipulation, which took place years ago but for which Lewis  pleaded guilty last year.  </P> <P> In all, an amazing escape record. If Robinson can ever distill and manufacture  whatever it is that allows him to be so good at deflecting criticism, American  Express will have a fabulous new product. One that will put Teflon to shame.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> COMPANY, CITY SCRAP OVER MEETING NOTES  </P> <P> City Manager Paul Brady Jr. declined Wednesday to release his notes of a Jan.  10 meeting with top city and Irvine Co. officials, despite the company's  suggestion that he do so.  </P> <P> In a statement Tuesday, the company encouraged Mayor Larry Agran and Brady to  release the notes, which the company said would provide evidence that Agran had  threatened to delay action on Village 38, a company project, unless it backed  off its support for an overpass expansion proposal that the mayor opposes.  </P> <P> "It's not that there is anything in the notes that is a problem," Brady said  Wednesday. "It's just that they're notes to file, and they're not meant for  release. . . . They're not part of any public record."  </P> <P> The exchange followed a Tuesday press conference by Agran, in which the mayor  produced copies of two memos indicating that a senior officer of the Irvine Co.  recently suggested that the company is planning several mass mailings on an  overpass proposal for Yale Loop.  </P> <P> "The city of Irvine is involved in what has so far been a successful struggle  for independence," Agran said.  </P> <P> That independence, he added, is threatened by the company's efforts to sway the  outcome of the overpass dispute and simultaneously aid Agran's political foes.  </P> <P> In a three-page written response, company officials dismissed Agran's  allegations and said the mayor is trying to "drive a wedge between the company  and the community" for political reasons. The statement further said its  support for the overpass proposal does not include endorsement or support of  candidates who back the measure.  </P> <P> Agran opposes the proposal to widen two Yale Loop pedestrian overpasses so they  can accommodate auto traffic, while his chief opponent, Councilwoman Sally Anne  Sheridan, supports the idea.  </P> <P> Sheridan, however, said she receives no support from the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> One of the two Yale bridges spans the San Diego Freeway; the other crosses the  Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroad tracks. The bridges can already  accommodate emergency vehicles.  </P> <P> Costs for the project are still undetermined, but preliminary estimates have  indicated a tab of about $3 million per bridge.  </P> <P> The matter will go before city voters on the June 5 ballot, at the same time  that voters will elect a mayor and two council members.

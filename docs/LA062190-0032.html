			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: FRESH APRICOT SEASON: IT'S SHORT AND SWEET  </P> <P> Don't blink, or you'll miss this year's apricots. The short season also  accounts for the fact that there are so few recipes calling for fresh apricots;  they're hardly around long enough to think of how to cook them.  </P> <P> Fanny Farmer did, however, manage to dash off this dessert, made with a puree  of fresh apricots that serves well as a pie filling or a topping for ice cream,  yogurt or pancakes.  </P> <P> APRICOT WHIP  </P> <P> 1 cup fresh apricots, pitted, sliced thin, but not peeled  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sugar or mild honey  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons lemon juice  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 3 egg whites  </P> <P> Simmer apricots in water to cover 10 minutes. Drain. Puree in blender or food  processor. Transfer to heavy-bottomed saucepan.  </P> <P> Add sugar to apricot puree and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until  thickened. Remove from heat and add lemon juice and salt. Let cool to lukewarm.  </P> <P> Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Whisk 1/3 of whites into puree, then  fold mixture into remaining whites. Spoon into 1-quart souffle dish.  </P> <P> Place dish in pan of hot water and bake at 300 degrees until firm, about 45  minutes. Serve warm. Makes 4 servings.  </P></p>

How does it  correspond to reality?    Owing to the fact that officially published data from  Russia's State Committee for Statistics do not consider the  seasonal impact, they have economic meaning only when compared  with the previous year's corresponding period.    Different procedures for determining the physical volume and  seasonal leveling are used for the purposes of a practical  appraisal of the current situation. A group of specialists from  the Russian Federation Government's Economic Situation Center,  Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for Market Problems,  Russian Academy of Sciences' Computer Center, and the RSPP  [Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] Institute of  Experts regularly acquaint the public with one of these systems  and the results obtained as a result.    The Russian Federation Government's Workers' Center for  Economic Reforms has also conducted a seasonal leveling of the  physical volume index of industrial production calculated by  Russia's State Committee for Statistics. The main components of  the calculation procedure are similar in both cases. At the same  time, it is necessary to point out differences that exist.    1. The mentioned group of specialists constructed the  physical volume index on the basis of 40 (later 42)  representative commodities. Russia's State Committee for  Statistics used a set consisting of 372 commodities in 120  industrial branches and sub-branches, which embraced 70 percent  of the total volume of industrial products.    2. The group of specialists constructed the physical volume  index as the average geometric value of 42 rows. In our case, a  weighting method in constant prices based on the actual  production structure, which has been accepted in international  practices, was used.    3. The 42 commodities selected by the group of specialists  reflected the structure of industrial production and also the  proportions between Groups A and B in accordance with conditions  in 1990. In our calculations, the production structure changes  annually as a result of the deferent production dynamics in the  various branches depending on the actual change in the  relationships between them.    The results obtained were subjected to dual verification.  First, they were compared with the data obtained from a total  accounting of the enterprises. Second, the results of the  seasonal leveling were compared with the results of a direct  comparison with the corresponding period of the previous year.  In both cases, the magnitude of the deviation did not exceed 1.5  percent. This is completely acceptable with the present state of  our domestic statistics.    The results of our calculations are reflected in the table.  It is not difficult to see that these results differ noticeably  from the data obtained by the mentioned group of experts.    In May 1993, the experts pointed out a substantial reduction  in the rates of decline (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 36) and in  June -- even a stabilization in the level of production  (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 40). According to our data, an  evident acceleration in the industrial decline occurred during  May-June.    The experts called the production decline in August 1993 an  "absolute record for all the time of observations -- a decline  which had not existed before" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 49).  True, they had already tacitly rejected this thesis a month  later, judging from a graph published in FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA,  No 54. According to our data, the decline in August, although it  was extremely deep, unquestionably did not yield to the August  1992 slump in its scale.    In September 1993, the experts again fixed "high menacing  rates of decline" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 53). At that time,  there was not only no decline in fact but a so-called  compensating industrial upsurge was present.    Finally, the experts noted a "slowing down in the rates of  decline" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 54) in October, at a time  when our data simply testified to the stabilization of  industrial production.    Moreover, the experts did not once note any industrial  production growth during the two years, at a time when they set  the rates for its decline from minus 5 percent to minus 44  percent during various months converted to a year's rate (cf.  the graph in FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 53). These data  contradict not only our calculations but also real life.    Generally speaking, the picture of industrial production  dynamics during the last three years looks as follows. During  the first half of 1991, a gradual reduction in the level of  industrial production was noted. The first sharp drop came  during August 1991 when the putsch occurred. After a certain  rise in September, the disintegration of the old economic and  political system, which had begun, caused an accelerating  decline during the fall of 1991, which concluded with a sharp  decline in January 1992.    It is evident that the price liberalization, which was  implemented at the time, was not able in principle to have a  decisive impact on the decline in the level of production.  Rather long time lags between the change in consumer demand and  the reaction of the production supply to it exist. Accumulated  factors from the production, political and administrative  disintegration during the fall of 1991 played the main role in  the decline during January 1992.    The absence of an impact on production dynamics from the  freeing of prices is also confirmed by the February-April 1992  data, when industrial production remained at a stable and even  higher level during the three months than in January. It was  only in May under the influence of a really reduced demand and  the heightened crisis of nonpayments that production began to be  curtailed, reaching its maximum level of decline in August 1992  (minus 13.6 percent by July 1992). All told, production declined  by 25.4 percent during the four months (April to August).    The mutual crediting of nonpayments, which was done in the  summer of 1992, along with massive credit pumping caused a  compensating increase in production of 11.5 percent in September  1992. Thanks to the vigorous credit support, the production  level subsequently remained practically stable for eight months  -- up to April 1993; however, it was paid for by Russian  consumers in the form of 25-30 percent monthly inflation. The  decline in January 1993 is not included in the calculation  because it was caused not by economic but by purely calendar  reasons -- the Christmas holidays were celebrated on a large  scale for the first time in the country.    The next stage in the cut-back of production was connected  with the new stage of the government's crucial financial and  monetary policy, which began during the first months of 1993.  Production fell by 19.6 percent from April to August, including  9.7 percent in August 1993 when compared to July.    The new period of industrial production stabilization  (September-December 1993), which then began with the stricter  monetary policy and real lowering of inflation rates (to 13  percent in December), is evidence of exceptionally important  changes in the economy. This means that industry had basically  already discarded production volumes oriented toward an  artificially exaggerated inflationary demand and had really  begun to draw nearer to a rational level that did not need to be  supported by credit drugs. It was from this or a slightly lower  level that the revival stage and then healthy industrial growth  could begin this year with the insuring of strict financial  limitations.    Thus, the statements, which have recently been heard about  the production catastrophe that has begun, are unfounded.    The expected sharp decline in production during January 1994  in no way differs in its nature from the one in January 1993.  The only difference is that instead of having two days off as a  year ago, the country preferred not to work two weeks this year.  It is possible to expect that compensation will occur in  February for the January decline.    At the same time, the coming change in the government's  economic policy and the next enthusiasm for a credit emission  will exert a depressing affect on the level of industrial  production. The inflation caused by this will deprive the  producers of incentives to even maintain the production process.  Then (but not now as some are hurrying to declare), the country  could really find itself in a so-called "stagflation trap" where  the incentives for production provided by an additional credit  emission are more than stifled by the inflation unleashed as a  result of it.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

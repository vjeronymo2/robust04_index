			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Bakhtiar murder trial starts in Paris The alleged assassins of Iran's former prime minister, Mr Shahpour Bakhtiar, will go on trial in Paris tomorrow in a case which is likely to further strain relations between France and Iran. The trial will focus on whether Mr Bakhtiar, the last prime minister of the late Shah of Iran, was killed on the orders of Tehran's Islamic government. Three Iranians, including a relative of Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the country's president, will answer charges for the 1991 assassination. Six others will be charged in absentia. The Iranian government has denied any involvement in the killing, which was one of dozens of assassinations of opponents of the Tehran regime over the past decade. But Mr Jean-Louis Bruguiere, a senior investigating judge, claims that Iran's secret services were involved in the crime. The French government has implemented tight security at the Palais de Justice, where the trial will take place. The case, to be heard by seven magistrates, is expected to last about a month. Relations between France and Iran have been damaged by Tehran's support for Moslem fundamentalists seeking the overthrow of the military-backed regime in Algeria, a former French colony, and by a French crackdown on Islamic fundamentalism. Following the assassination of five French nationals in Algeria in August, the French interior ministry introduced sweeping stop-and-search operations and interned 26 suspected Moslem militants. Last week the government said it would enforce a ban on wearing Islamic headscarves in secular state schools. Twenty-five students have been expelled from French schools for wearing headscarves. Mr Francois Bayrou, the education minister, said he had ordered schools to bar 'ostentatious religious symbols' and said there were few alternatives to expulsion when persuasion failed. The move has brought an angry reaction from Iran and from other Islamic countries.</p>

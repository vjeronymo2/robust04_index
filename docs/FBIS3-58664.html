			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis has said it is  ridiculous for the Turks to believe Greece has aggressive plans  because its defense doctrine is well known. Arsenis' comment  came in response to Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  statement about Greek threats not enabling Turkey to  demilitarize its western shores. The minister described Turkish  verbal aggression as an awkward effort to attract international  attention. He added there has been no increase in the number of  airspace violations, which remain at the same level. He said  Turkish planes are immediately intercepted.    On Saturday [22 January] the defense minister will meet  Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis in Thessaloniki to discuss  the joint Greek-Cypriot defense area.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: What to say Your complaint stands a much greater chance of being taken seriously if you have prepared your case well and can show you have done all you can. The regulators and ombudsmen suggest the following tips: Write first to the compliance officer at the company that sold the product (in the case of an investment product) or to the trustees (for a company pension scheme). State clearly the nature of the complaint. Give clear contact details, including daytime telephone number. Provide the name of the investment or product, the date you took it out, and the name of the salesman (if relevant). Quote all relevant policy and reference numbers. Photocopy letters and supporting material. Impose a deadline for the reply. You should receive an acknowledgement of your letter within seven days, but allow two months for the actual investigation before proceeding to the regulator or ombudsman. Check to see if there is a consumer action group that is co-ordinating complaints. (See The Jordans' experience).</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMNESTY COURSE MAY COME TO END FOR LACK OF FUNDS  </P> <P> Irene Facio faced the 46 Latino men and women, and cheerfully led them in a  slow chant extolling the virtues of the toothbrush.  </P> <P> Holding up a drawing of the instrument, Facio urged the students in the crowded  classroom to repeat in unison: "The toothbrush keeps our teeth clean!"  </P> <P> She then took them through a dozen more practice sentences that helped  familiarize the students with other household vocabulary words, such as salt,  coffee, food, store and clothes.  </P> <P> "Muy bien," she congratulated the class members -- many of whom spoke no  English. "You are all getting better."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Government Funding  </P> <P> Because of a lack of funds, however, the students may be the last to enroll in  a four-week class in rudimentary English, government and U.S. history that the  Bell council of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) offers to  amnesty applicants.  </P> <P> "We're out of money," complained Bell LULAC head Rudy Garcia, who has been  running the classes without any government funding since last November. "These  people want to continue to come to class, but they won't be able to if the  state doesn't give us money."  </P> <P> The once-illegal immigrants who have applied for amnesty need to take at least  40 hours of such class instruction, one of the last requirements for applicants  to gain U.S. citizenship.  </P> <P> The Latino community-based organization has certified more than 400 amnesty  applicants who have attended the classes, which are held at the Cudahy Social  Services Center. About 250 are enrolled in day and evening classes, and another  450 are on a waiting list, Garcia said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Missed the Deadline  </P> <P> But state Department of Education officials have rejected the council's funding  request, saying the organization was one of a handful of nonprofit agencies in  the state that filed after the department ran out of money allocated for  amnesty classes. The education department administers the state's portion of  the $1.8 billion allocated by the federal government over a five-year period  for amnesty classes.  </P> <P> As a result, hundreds of eligible amnesty applicants on waiting lists from  Bell, Bell Gardens, Maywood, Cudahy and Huntington Park would have to look  elsewhere for classes. Although most public schools in the area offer amnesty  classes, many also have waiting lists, officials say.  </P> <P> The possible closure of the Bell LULAC classes comes at a time when lawmakers,  community leaders and educators, citing a lack of classroom space and proper  organization, are estimating that thousands of Latinos who have applied for  amnesty nationwide may not fulfill the class requirement in time.  </P> <P> Applicants have 16 months from the time their amnesty application is approved  by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to find a class that  teaches them civics and English proficiency.  </P> <P> "We are very concerned that the bottleneck that's been created by the lack of  funding is detrimental to the amnesty program," said Beverly Hunter-Curtis, a  staff member for state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). Torres is chairman of  the Joint Committee on Refugee Resettlement, International Migration and  Cooperative Development.  </P> <P> The Bell LULAC council has relied on local private donations to pay for office  space, utilities and teaching materials, Garcia said. The classes offered by  the Bell LULAC council are approved by the INS, and Garcia argues that he  should qualify for the $500 per student that other community-based  organizations receive.  </P> <P> Garcia said that even though he received $1,200 last month from local business  owners, he does not have money to pay the five full-time staff members who  teach the classes, fill out the necessary paper work and occasionally accompany  applicants to the local INS office once they complete the class.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought $1 Million  </P> <P> The teachers have been conducting the classes on a voluntary basis until the  organization's fiscal problems could be resolved.  </P> <P> Garcia's problems with the state Department of Education began early last fall  when he applied for state funding. Based on an enrollment projection of 2,000  students, Garcia asked for $1 million.  </P> <P> Garcia said state education officials lost his original application, then told  him when he reapplied in late December that his application was submitted too  late. He said he was told no more money was available in the fiscal year that  ends in June.  </P> <P> "It was incompetence," Garcia said. "We waited and waited, but never heard  about (the original application)." Garcia also said that education department  officials did not list the Nov. 1 deadline to submit a funding request, a claim  that education officials dispute.  </P> <P> "I was surprised when they said there was a deadline," Garcia said.  Hunter-Curtis said a number of other organizations -- including some that did  receive funding -- have said that they were unaware of a deadline. "We were  never really clear ourselves that there was a deadline," Hunter-Curtis said.  </P> <P> John Schaeffer, head of amnesty funding for the state education department,  said he could not comment on whether the state had lost the original  application.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Up to 15 Groups Lost Funds  </P> <P> But, he said, the Bell LULAC had applied much later than most other  organizations, and was not the only organization that lost out by applying for  money past the November deadline.  </P> <P> "By November, it started getting tough," Schaeffer said, saying that the  deadline had been extended a few weeks to allow new providers to get funding.  Between 10 and 15 organizations eventually had to be denied funding, he  estimated.  </P> <P> "It got to be ridiculous to keep on funding projects that came in very, very  late," Schaeffer said.  </P> <P> "Had we had the money, we would have funded (Bell LULAC)," Schaeffer continued.  "We want all the providers we can get because there is a tremendous demand out  there. We just came to the point that we were out of money."  </P> <P> Schaeffer said that the department has argued for the past year that there  would not be enough funding to support the need for classes. The $80 million  that was allocated this year to class providers, including public school  systems, was far short of the department's needs to provide class space for all  applicants, he said.  </P> <P> "We have said that we needed $50 million to $70 million more than that to make  it through this year," Schaeffer said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bill Would Add $50 Million  </P> <P> Garcia said that the organization "wasn't geared up to teach" until late  summer. However, after deciding to open classes and receiving INS  certification, Garcia said that he would have made the November deadline if the  state had not lost the original application.  </P> <P> Torres has authored a bill, now in the Senate Education Committee, that would  provide an additional $50 million to fund amnesty classes.  </P> <P> "No one should be denied full participation simply because there is not enough  money," Torres said. "The agencies (providing money) have to get their act  together to make sure that people will not be denied the opportunity to  participate."  </P> <P> A recent study found that 1.2 million of the nation's estimated 2 million  amnesty applicants reside in California, with 51% living in Los Angeles County,  said Joseph Flores, Los Angeles Community College District facilitator for  amnesty programs.  </P> <P> "It is clear now that the need is far greater than anticipated," Flores said.  He added that 77% of amnesty applicants in the county are illiterate in  English, and about 30% of those are illiterate in their native language.  </P> <P> "The need for educating these people is obvious," Flores said. "But they want  education. They are going after education like there's no tomorrow, taking  whatever classes they can get."  </P></p>

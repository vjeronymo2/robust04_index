			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour row on votes for shadow team A SPATE of claims and counter-claims about past practices in shadow cabinet elections broke out in the Labour party yesterday as a move developed to change the voting arrangements for next month's shadow cabinet elections. Mr Ron Davies, MP for Caerphilly, said that there was a very clear suggestion that on some occasions the ballot box had been opened and votes counted before the close of the poll. 'Now if that happens and you have knowledge of the placing of candidates and you also have in your possession a number of ballot papers, then obviously you are well placed to affect in a very clear and a very direct way the outcome of the election,' he said on BBC Radio. Mr Bryan Gould, a shadow cabinet member and contender for the Labour leadership, said yesterday that there were sufficient grounds for an inquiry into the claims. He said that he had never taken part in deals or been involved in such activity, but that anyone who had been involved in shadow cabinet elections in recent years, would know 'that blank ballot papers are in the possession of some campaign managers'. Mr Ray Powell, a senior Labour whip, said that on previous occasions some MPs had given him blank ballot papers so that he could exercise proxy votes on their behalf, but that these had to be used to support their chosen candidates. He vigorously denied that there was any need for an inquiry, and added: 'For anybody to suggest or imply that any member of parliament would give licence to any other MP to use his discretion as to how he should vote or she should vote is absolutely ridiculous.' Mr Jeff Rooker, MP for Perry Bar, has written to shadow cabinet members urging that forthcoming party elections are scrutinised by an outside body. The matter is likely to be raised at a meeting of the parliamentary party next week or the week after. But the official party line was that when substantial allegations were made, they would be examined by the shadow cabinet and officers of the parliamentary party. While some in the official camp were accusing their colleagues of raising the issue in order to gain publicity for their own shadow cabinet election chances, there is also some concern among MPs that senior frontbenchers who are supporting Mr Gould in the leadership contest should not find themselves unfairly penalised. The shadow cabinet elections overlap with the leadership elections: nominations close on 16 July - just two days before the leadership vote - but the ballot does not close until 23 July.</p>

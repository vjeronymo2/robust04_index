			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Manchester Olympics 'would bring in Pounds 4bn' NORTH-WEST England would benefit to the tune of at least Pounds 4bn and gain the equivalent of 11,000 full-time jobs if Manchester were to succeed in its attempt to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the management consultants. About Pounds 2.5bn would be generated by capital investment in new facilities, environmental improvements and regeneration projects. Running the games would be worth a further Pounds 1.5bn in sponsorship, media activity, merchandising, tourism and additional income. Manchester's final bid document was yesterday given the official blessing of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to underline the government's commitment. Manchester is bidding against Brasilia, Berlin, Milan, Istanbul, Beijing and Sydney. Mr Major said legislation was expected soon to give the organising committee the necessary powers to plan and implement the event. He plans to visit Lausanne in April to see Mr Juan Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee. Mr Tim Johnston, who led KPMG Peat Marwick's study team, said the figures were conservative. Other benefits might include extra tax revenues to the government of about Pounds 400m and a contribution to the UK balance of payments, which a 1990 study by two academic economists put at Pounds 500m. 'We have only attached figures to what we can be reasonably be sure of,' said Mr Johnston. 'We have not even tried to assess the inward investment that might flow because of increased worldwide interest in Manchester, although it would be very easy to say this might be worth 30,000 jobs.' The games would generate 110,000 person-years of work, the study says. Economic regeneration will be one of the criteria used by the International Olympic Committee when it awards the games in September. The compactness of the Olympic site will also be a criterion. The bid document says 21 of the 25 Olympic sports would be within a 20-minute drive of the Olympic village in Manchester. The soccer tournament would use stadiums in Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Nottingham, Sunderland and Newcastle, as well as Manchester, while baseball would be staged at Old Trafford cricket ground. Sailing would be in Cardigan Bay, based on Pwllheli, north Wales, with shooting and modern pentathlon at Chester. Liverpool would stage the boxing and volleyball in an arena at King's Dock - next to the Albert Dock - which is to be developed to a Richard Rodgers architectural design. The government has already given Pounds 70m towards the bid, and work is under way on a velodrome for cycling and an arena for gymnastics. Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority yesterday announced an extension of its tram system to the main Olympic stadium site, which is already being cleared.</p>

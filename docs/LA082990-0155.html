			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BEACH BOYS BENEFIT FALLS SHORT  </P> <P> A recent Beach Boys benefit concert not only fell far short of its expectations  to raise money for the hurricane-stricken Isle of Palms Fire Department, but  firefighters say it almost put them in debt.  </P> <P> Fire Chief Larry Britton said he initially had hoped the Sunday event would  raise at least $50,000, now he's happy they didn't lose money.  </P> <P> They'll probably make about $1,500, he said.  </P> <P> If the group had been able to perform on the beach, things might have been  better.  </P> <P> Organizers blamed the poor turnout partly on Mayor Carmen Bunch, who refused to  allow the Beach Boys to play in Isle of Palms, citing the traffic headaches the  concert would cause. The concert was held about 20 miles inland, at Ladson.  </P> <P> Bunch said Tuesday she wished she had never heard of the Beach Boys. She said  the event was not worth all the turmoil, and believes islanders couldn't afford  the tickets. "It was risky business to begin with," she said.  </P></p>

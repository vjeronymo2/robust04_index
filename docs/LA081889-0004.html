			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FINEST CITY WEEK BEGINS SATURDAY WITH PARK PICNIC  </P> <P> From a home states picnic in the park to an ice cream social on the water, it's  time for every San Diegan, native and transplanted, to revel in his or her  residency. This Saturday marks the beginning of America's Finest City Week.  </P> <P> AFC Week, something of a nine-day, citywide block party, is presented by the  Junior Chamber of Commerce in celebration of San Diego. U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson  created the event when he was mayor in 1972 after San Diego lost the bid for  the National Republican Convention. The mayor's office had organized the event  every year until 1982, when the Junior Chamber took over.  </P> <P> The following events are scheduled from Saturday through Aug. 27:  </P> <P> * AUG. 19: The Home States Picnic -- Representatives from all 50 states will  exhibit traditional items and sell food from their respective regions from 10  a.m. to 4 p.m. at 6th Avenue and Laurel Street in Balboa Park.  </P> <P> * AUG. 20: AFC Week Half-Marathon -- More than 5,000 runners will participate  in the 12th annual race, beginning at 7 a.m. at Cabrillo National Monument in  Point Loma and finishing in Balboa Park. High school cheerleaders, comedians,  magicians and belly dancers will entertain runners along the route.  </P> <P> * AUG. 23: AFC Jazz Bash -- KIFM radio and Omni Hotel are co-hosts to this  concert featuring saxophonist Richard Elliott and keyboard player Steve Bach,  beginning with happy-hour festivities at 5:30 p.m. at the Omni Hotel, 910  Broadway Circle.

To charge by phone, call 278-TIXS.  </P> <P> * AUG. 25: Beach Ball -- From 6 p.m. to midnight, the Catamaran Resort Hotel  will look like something out of "Beach Blanket Bingo," complete with palm  trees, sand and a limbo contest. Tickets are $15 in advance and $20 at the  door. The dance is sponsored by Y-95 radio and the Junior Chamber of Commerce,  and all proceeds will benefit the American Lung Assn., the Make-A-Wish  Foundation and the Assn. for Retarded Citizens.  </P> <P> * AUG. 26: Kids' Day at The Bay -- Chuck E. Cheese will preside over this  bayside extravaganza, featuring Hula Hoop contests, bean bag tosses, clowns,  jugglers and mimes, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Bonita Cove in Mission Bay.  </P> <P> * AUG. 27: Ice Cream Social -- The event, sponsored by Baskin Robbins, takes  place from 2 to 5 p.m. at Seaport Village.

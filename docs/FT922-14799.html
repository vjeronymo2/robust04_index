			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates stay firm The torpor of the last few weeks returned to the UK money market yesterday following Wednesday's hectic activity. The mood of uncertainty that has enveloped the market will continue, barring a decisive lead in tomorrow's opinion polls for either of the main parties, but dealers said prices had already gone a long way towards discounting a Labour majority or hung-parliament. Rates remained firm, with the three-month interbank rate holding steady at just over 11 per cent. The market is still discounting at least a half point rise in base rates after the election, but a decisive one or two point rise is considered more likely. A substantial increase in base rates, should the markets decide to test a new Labour government, would enable the Labour party to demonstrate its commitment to the current value of sterling. The increase could be more easily reversed than a half-point rise which might not satisfy the sceptical markets. With sterling hovering just below DM2.84, it is still about 7 pfennigs above its DM2.7780 floor in the EMS. With funds still available to the UK, both from the Bank of England and other European banks, some analysts suggest a rise in base rates could be avoided through support of the UK currency. Rates at the long end also firmed. The one year rate rose to 11 5/16 - 1/4 from 11 15/16 - 3/16 . June short sterling opened down one basis point at 88.70 and hovered just above before closing at 88.71. The Bank of England supplied liquidity where necessary but the market seemed surprisingly loath to sell out the shortage. The Bank's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 950m which it later revised to Pounds 1bn. It provided early assistance with the purchase of Pounds 370m band-2 bank bills at 10- 3/8 per cent. Later in the morning the Bank provided a further Pounds 51m of assistance buying Pounds 25m of band-1 bank bills and Pounds 26m of band-2 bank bills, at the same rate. It continued to operate in the afternoon buying Pounds 90m band-2 bank bills, after revising the forecast liquidity shortage to Pounds 800m. Late assistance of Pounds 40m took total official intervention operations for the day to Pounds 551m, leaving the market seemingly around Pounds 250m under-relieved. The overnight rate, in the thinly-traded closing minutes dropped to 10 1/8 - 7/8.</p>

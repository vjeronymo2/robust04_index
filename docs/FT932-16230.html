			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese try to ease tensions with US ONE OF Japan's most senior trade officials, Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs, has gone to Washington in another attempt to ease trade tensions before the arrival of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, later this month. Mr Hatakeyama is expected to reject a US proposal for quantitative measures to track market access in Japan but to discuss the possibility of increased procurement of US products. The visit, described by the Trade Ministry as an unofficial follow-up to the trip made last month by Mr Yoshi Mori, Japan's trade minister, comes as several trade disputes threaten to flare up again. In particular, the Japanese authorities are considering action against the US carrier Northwest Airlines over what they see as that airline's failure to respect guidelines regarding onward flights from Japanese destinations. The Vietnamese government has given Bank of Tokyo approval to open a representative office in Ho Chi Minh City which the bank hopes will be a go-between for the increasing number of Japanese companies interested in Vietnam, writes Robert Thomson. It will be the first Japanese bank to open an office in Vietnam if, as expected, the Finance Ministry in Tokyo also gives its approval. Japanese companies have targeted the country as a medium-term, low-cost site for component supply to manufacturing industry. Most Japanese joint ventures signed in the past three years have been in fisheries, agriculture and the oil industry. China has chosen Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the Japanese heavy equipment maker, to provide a Y8bn (Pounds 46m) polyethylene plant for a site in Jilin province, in the north, which will supply farmers with plastic film for greenhouses and plastic food wrap.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "The World Faces a Crisis of Nuclear Proliferation"]    [Text] The United States, the ROK, and Japan are kicking  up an uproar over the DPRK nuclear issue. From the  international inspections to the sanctions proposal submitted to  the UN Security Council, the state of events is developing  through twists and turns and is attracting people's close  attention.    However, in the world as a whole, especially after the end  of  the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, nuclear  proliferation has become an inevitable trend. This has become a  hidden peril facing world peace.    Some countries have already secretly developed their own  nuclear weapons. Reportedly, Israel and India possess or will  soon possess nuclear weapons; Iraq, Iran, and Libya are also  likely to become possessors of nuclear weapons. There are also  signs that Pakistan is developing nuclear bombs. In order to  deal with the Indian "threat," it is no wonder that Pakistan  might develop nuclear weapons. In October 1990, the then Bush  administration of the United States accused Pakistan of  developing nuclear weapons and froze economic and military  assistance to Pakistan. After Clinton took office, the new  administration prohibited the sale of 38 F-16 fighters to  Pakistan on the same grounds. Recently, foreign news agencies  have said that Pakistan has imported sophisticated machinery  from two German companies to refine enriched uranium.    On 13 June, a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry  said: "Pakistan is exploring the possibility of importing  certain sophisticated machinery from countries which can produce  such equipment." These remarks actually exposed something the  spokesman tried to cover up or deny.    A more complicated and potential crisis of nuclear  proliferation not only exists in reality, but is also spreading.    After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the 15 republics  of the former Soviet Union took their own course independently.  This has made it uncertain whether the gigantic nuclear  arsenal, missile force, and nuclear submarine fleet of the  former Soviet Union is still under effective control.    On 16 June, Riyabev, first vice minister of nuclear industry  in the Russian Government, announced that in the last 18 months,  ten cases of the theft of nuclear fuel had occurred in Russia.  In one case, the stolen fuel was highly enriched uranium-235,  which can cause nuclear fission, and in nine other cases,  uranium-238 was stolen. Uranium-238 is less likely to cause  nuclear fission if it lies idle.    The stolen highly enriched uranium-235 was in the possession  of a scientific research and production center in Bodolisk in  Moscow Oblast. An employee of the center stole a total of about  1.5 kg of uranium-235 on several occasions. The criminal was  arrested in April this year and the stolen nuclear materials  retrieved. The authorities are investigating the criminal's  background.    In addition, the Russian federal counter-espionage  department  arrested three thieves last March in St. Petersburg. The  criminals sold 3 kg of uranium-235 to some Germans for $300 per  gram. The uranium was stolen from a nuclear plant in the Moscow  suburbs. Two of the three criminals were salesmen from a meat  shop and one was a plumber. They transported the enriched  uranium in a container.    After the above-mentioned cases were publicized, Western  countries were stunned by Russia's failure to effectively manage  its nuclear materials. In particular, an underground market for  secret transactions in nuclear materials stolen and smuggled  from Russia has arisen in some West European countries. Some  Middle East oil- producing countries and Islamic countries have  a strong interest in buying such materials. If Russia still  cannot effectively check the illegal outflow of nuclear fuel,  sooner or later more countries will be able to produce atomic  bombs. Moreover, there has been a brain among nuclear  scientists in Russia and Ukraine.    The United Nations will be plagued by a complicated  situation  of nuclear proliferation and will find that it can do very  little to bring this under control.</p>

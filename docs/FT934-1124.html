			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Leading Article: OECD pulls its punches The economic cycle has its ups and down but so do the lives of international economic officials. Last week, the atmosphere in Geneva was one of heady excitement at the conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. Yesterday, life returned to normal as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published its half-yearly short-term outlook for the economies of the industrialised world. The OECD's latest outlook is not one of its better productions. The language of international bureaucracy is never particularly inspiring. And the OECD's numerical projections are barely worth studying, given the OECD's atrocious forecasting record in recent years. Moreover, as the report acknowledges at the beginning but then does not discuss further, the biggest challenges facing the main industrialised economies are not to do with short-term macroeconomic management. The OECD is at its best when producing thorough and prescriptive analyses of structural issues. And the need to find ways to tackle persistent unemployment or over-stretched welfare systems is the main current preoccupation of governments everywhere. But these issues barely rate a mention. The OECD's difficulty with short-term analysis is that political sensitivities make it hard for the organisation to do more than spell out the options that governments face and the risks ahead. As long as the advice is kept relatively broad and consensus-based - the need to remain vigilant in the fight against inflation or to reduce structural fiscal deficits - than all is well. But translating these general aims into policy prescription is much more difficult. Promising recovery The US is a case in point. Many US economists publicly, and OECD economists privately, are already getting itchy about the need for a rise in America's currently low short-term interest rates as an increasingly promising recovery takes root. Yes, inflation is also low - as President Clinton pointed out last week in an attempt to pre-empt a rate rise. But as Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan will well understand, by the time inflation starts to accelerate it is already to late to start tightening policy. Yet there are also risks in an early tightening. For, as the OECD points out, the debt-based difficulties that the US, Japan and most of the English-speaking developed world have suffered recently make it possible that consumers will respond only slowly to signs of increased prosperity, especially in countries such as the US or Britain where there are tax increases in the pipeline. The solution for the US is almost certainly to leave the decision to Mr Greenspan, whose recent record has been impressive. That, given its support for independent central banks and the absence of direct advice in the report, must be the OECD's preferred solution. Deepening recession Nor is the OECD any more forthcoming when discussing the other short-term dilemmas facing developed country finance ministers. Japan's deepening recession looks increasingly like a credit crunch, as the OECD report acknowledges, with the implication that neither even lower interest rates nor more public investment are likely to help much. But although the Outlook rightly points out the evidence that banks are not lending to credit-worthy customers, it stops short of discussing the kind of publicly financed recapitalisation of the banking sector that the Japanese economy now needs. In Europe, the OECD does a good job of outlining the options. Most indicators of the stance of German monetary policy suggest that it is too tight - but wage inflationary pressures persist. Unless German interest rates fall fast enough, the economic costs for France of trying to maintain a tight link between the Franc and the D-Mark risk becoming unsustainably high. The OECD report, while setting out the risks and benefits for France in cutting short rates below Germany's, ends up still sitting on the fence. Yet this Economic Outlook is not a waste of time. Given the OECD's forecasting record, it would be easy to dismiss any short-term advice. But by laying out the issues while avoiding detailed prescription, the OECD adds to the sum of economic understanding. Better still, it should drop the forecasts entirely.</p>

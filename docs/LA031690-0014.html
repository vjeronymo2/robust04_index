			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIDDEN HILLS MAY CHALLENGE JUDGE'S ORDER ON HOUSING  </P> <P> The chairman of the Hidden Hills Planning Commission said the commission is not  "intimidated" by a judge's order that city officials approve a plan to build  lower-cost housing in the wealthy community.  </P> <P> The remarks by Harvey A. Cohen came during the city's first public hearing on  the merits of a controversial development proposal that includes a 48-unit  lower-cost apartment building for senior citizens.  </P> <P> Cohen is among four candidates challenging three City Council incumbents in an  election next month, in which the housing proposal is the major issue.  </P> <P> Last week, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. declared  he is ready to order the Planning Commission and the town's City Council into  his courtroom to ensure that they approve the housing plan.  </P> <P> Schoettler's stand stems from his authority over the settlement of a 1984  lawsuit against the city. The judge held that in the settlement, the city  committed itself to building lower-cost housing within two years of annexing a  site for the development project. The annexation took place last month.  </P> <P> At the public hearing Wednesday night, the commission was reminded of  Schoettler's position by Benjamin M. Reznik, an attorney for the project's  developer, Danny Howard of Tarzana.  </P> <P> Cohen responded: "I do not believe this community or this Planning Commission  is intimidated by the lawsuit. We fully intend to take our time and do what is  right for the community."  </P> <P> Cohen told more than 50 residents, most of whom were opposed to the project,  that the commission will not act before residents have full knowledge of the  proposal, "whether it takes six months or six years."  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, this will not be rammed down anyone's throat" Cohen  said.  </P> <P> Cohen and the three other commissioners present said they have not made up  their minds about the senior housing proposal.  </P> <P> "We all realize that this has to be thoroughly investigated," said Commissioner  Jack Durrie, who added that the panel should also consider "what is legally  appropriate." The final decision is the City Council's.  </P> <P> The commission tentatively scheduled a study session for Monday, and another  public hearing for March 29.  </P></p>

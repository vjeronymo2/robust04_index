			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Second payment for B&amp;C creditors Creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the financial services group which collapsed in June 1990 with debts of about Pounds 1bn after heavy losses by its leasing subsidiary, Atlantic Computers, are to be given a second payment. B&amp;C Holdings' creditors will each receive a payment of Pounds 110m, amounting to 5p in the pound, bringing the total they have received so far to 10p in the pound. Creditors of B&amp;C Group Finance, who were paid 14p earlier in the year, are also to receive a further payment in early October, though the administrators have not said how much it will be. Both groups have fared badly compared with the creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth Merchant Bank who have now been paid a total of 78p in the pound.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(joe)": "The RDP Group Arms Consortium Is </F> Expanding"]    [Text] Jihlava--The RDP Group shareholding company, which  affiliates the largest special production manufacturers, will  expand to include at least another four enterprises;  negotiations are under way on the entry of several more  enterprises. This was one of the conclusions reached yesterday  at the company's general assembly. The RDP Group's aim is to  create a system of mutual cooperation involving the Czech Army,  the central bodies of state administration, and the arms  manufacturers and to participate in the modernization of the  Czech Army. According to officials from the Defense Ministry,  the suppliers of final equipment for the Czech Army should, on  principle, be domestic entities. Roughly 30 percent of the 2.5  percent of the state budget earmarked for the Defense Ministry  has been set aside for modernizing the Czech Army. The ministry  is now drawing up the priorities of the program for the Army's  modernization. The modernized T-72 tank and the Aero L-59  aircraft, for example, with all probability will be among the  new military systems.</p>

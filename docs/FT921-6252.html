			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bridgestone gives warning as profits slide 15.9% BRIDGESTONE, the Japanese tyre-maker, reported a 15.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y76.6bn (Dollars 590m) in the year to end December. However, the company forecast that much of those earnings would be erased in its consolidated accounts by the continuing cost of digesting Firestone Tire and Rubber, its US acquisition of four years ago. While the company is yet to finalise its consolidated accounts, Bridgestone indicated that group after-tax profit would total Y7.4bn, a 66 per cent increase on last year, but well below the parent company's after-tax profit, which rose 21 per cent to Y62.9bn. 'It is difficult to say how much of that difference is directly related to restructuring Firestone, but we estimate that there is a net loss of about Dollars 500m for the overseas operations,' a Bridgestone spokesman said. The company is hoping that its US subsidiary, Bridgestone/Firestone, will report a profit this year, but is relying on a recovery in the US economy, and particularly in the car market, to fuel sales. Parent sales for the year to end December rose 1.7 per cent to Y736.48bn, with domestic sales rising 8 per cent to Y551.3bn, despite a downturn in the Japanese car industry last year, while exports fell 14 per cent to Y185.18bn. Tyre sales, which account for 74 per cent of the total, fell 1 per cent, but sales of diversified products, including industrial rubber, chemicals, and sporting goods, rose 10 per cent to Y194.38bn. The company said tougher competition was expected in the coming year, as the international economy is weak and domestic economic growth has turned down. It said these conditions would mean that extra emphasis will be needed on the development of new technology and products. For the year to end December, the parent is expecting a 2 per cent increase in sales to Y750bn, and that after-tax earnings will fall to Y40bn.</p>

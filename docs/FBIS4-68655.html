			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Portnikov: "Crimea: A Bridge or Barrier? </F> Elimination of the Regrettably Known Methods for Resolving  National Problems Required"]    [Text] Russia and Ukraine found themselves facing the  barrier of the Crimean problem, by the way, not for the first  time in the several tense years of building bilateral relations.  The victory of Yuriy Meshkov, who did not conceal his intention  of altering the status of autonomy, in the presidential  elections in Crimea compelled Kiev to take a close look at the  contours of the drifting peninsula while confronting Moscow once  again with an unresolvable dilemma--the choice between desire  and possibility.    The desire to "recover" Crimea is so clear that it would be  unwise to conceal it. At the same time, it is specifically  Russia, along with the USA, that is the guarantor of territorial  integrity of Ukraine which is parting with its nuclear armament.  It is specifically Russia, which is building relations with its  own ex-autonomies with difficulty, that is interested the least  out of all the countries in the world in any territory  proclaiming recognized independence and possibly shifting into  another state. In other words the Crimean issue appears far more  complex in Russian policy than in the Ukrainian one.    It seems that the first Crimean president, Yuriy Meshkov,  who, in the course of his visit to Moscow, talked of political  stability on the peninsula in a tone reminiscent of his recent  opponent, Nikolay Bagrov, head of the Crimean Parliament, is  beginning to understand this. Stability for Crimea, however, is  maintenance of the status-quo. Attempts at sharp changes in it  are no longer stability but the start of a civil war, a  Russian-Ukrainian confrontation, activization of the movement of  Ukrainian Tartars which will swiftly transcend constitutional  bounds, and destroy the resort. It is possible that this will  not signal the end of the political career of Yuriy Meshkov  himself as he would be able to establish himself in Simferopol  with the aid of the Black Sea Fleet, just as Vladislav Ardzinba  did in Sukhumi. But who needs a second Sukhumi today?    The Crimean president, who evidently expected to become an  equal partner of Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, could have  convinced himself at negotiations about the future of Crimea  that more influential political forces in both countries are  transforming him into a hostage of the situation on the  peninsula. In that sense Meshkov, known only for his activity at  meetings, is much more convenient than Bagrov from whom few  expected any uncoordinated actions. For Russia, which is  striving today for the return of "spheres of influence" lost  following disintegration of the Soviet Union, needs not Crimea  as part of it, but a lever for pressure on the most ambitious of  the former Soviet republics (even though very soon Kazakhstan  will easily surpass Ukraine here). For Ukraine Crimea is  important as a real demonstration of the "sinister" intentions  of the neighboring country and as proof of political pluralism:  in our country even declared antagonists achieve success, Kiev  is not London which acted far more rigidly and energetically in  a similar situation in Ulster.    That is the way it will be as long as Crimea is a barrier.  But even Yuriy Meshkov is already speaking of a Crimean bridge.  But is the building of such a bridge possible given the initial  positions of Moscow, Kiev, and Simferopol? I fear that up to now  the stones used in building the foundation of such a bridge  might prove to be merely new boulders for the barrier. The money  which Russia plans to grant for the return of Crimean Tartars  and the special emphasis which Ukraine makes on its financial  participation, indicates that both countries know about the  existence of another way. After all Crimea gained the status of  a republic not because of any special position it has by  comparison with other Ukrainian oblasts, but because the  republic was already there and ceased to exist after the tragic  deportation of indigenous people, primarily of Crimean Tartars.  They remain the only deported nation which has not restored its  statehood even formally. Simply speaking: their past, their  tragedy was utilized by completely different people. Political  careerism, however, which is noticeable in the case of the  former Yugoslavia, leads only to slaughter. Before Crimea  becomes the next hot spot Moscow and Kiev should use all  possible channels of influence to legitimize the status of  indigenous nations of the peninsula, naturally, taking into  consideration the rights of those who enjoyed their hospitality.  By the way, the latter form a majority anyway. They can elect a  president and a parliament. The returnees only have a few seats  consolidated by quota. That decision, however, will hardly  secure true political stability on the peninsula. The principal  problem of Crimea is that it may prove to be a ticking bomb even  without becoming "a bone of contention." They might come to  their senses in Simferopol after it is too late. Moscow and Kiev  should help the Crimeans realize the unique position in which  their land has been placed by historical circumstances and find  nonstandard political moves--in other words, exclude the  possibility for resolving national problems by the regrettably  known methods. Believe me, that is more important than success  or failure of the loudmouthed promises by Yuriy Meshkov, the  economic experiments of Yevgeniy Saburov, and even the fate of  the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

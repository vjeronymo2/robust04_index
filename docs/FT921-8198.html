			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Western capital to help uplift Lenin's home town - Maker of the world's largest transport aircraft is set for a revolutionary venture LENIN'S home town is the site of a bold attempt to marry the pride of former Soviet communist industry with western capital. Although the town of Ulyanovsk itself is stubbornly clinging to the name it received in honour of the revolutionary who started life as Vladimir Ulyanov, its huge aviation plant has turned itself into a joint-stock company, able to sell shares to outside investors. In its pursuit of foreign capital, the maker of the Antonov-124, the largest transport aircraft in the world, has even given itself a western-sounding name, Aviastar. And it plans soon to sign a deal with Robert Fleming, the UK investment management company, to produce a medium-range passenger aircraft, the Tupolev 204, upgraded with Rolls-Royce engines and western avionics. 'We do not know the intricacies of market economics,' admits Mr Viktor Mikhailov, the plant's general manager, whose taciturn appearance conceals a tough entrepreneur. But he is confident that 'with western capital, as well as your know-how in sales and marketing, we can produce a plane that is not only far cheaper but which can compete in all other respects with any western equivalent'. He doubts he will be allowed into European and US markets, but he sees potential in Asia and the Far East, and even Russia. For the domestic market, he is already producing a no-frills Russian-only version. Rolls-Royce, which would supply engines to the TU-204 similar to those which fit most Boeing-757s, has been involved in the negotiations though it will not be taking a stake in the venture. It would be paid out of foreign exchange earnings from sales of the aircraft outside the former Soviet bloc. Built on the banks of the Volga River, the aircraft plant is a typical product of a Brezhnevite passion for sprawling industrial complexes equipped at great expense with imported technology and endowed with their own housing, social care, farms and shops. But under the combined effect of market reforms and government bankruptcy, the plant is increasingly having to fend for itself. The state has cut off all funds and investment, leaving unfinished key parts of the plant such as the paint shop. Military orders which used to account for most of the plant's business have shrunk to almost nil, and the government still owes money for past deliveries of aircraft. Moscow has also landed the plant's management with responsibility for the livelihood of 160,000 people - workers and their dependants who live and work on this 6,500-hectare site, including the street cleaners, doctors and teachers who work in the township built specially for the factory. This means that two-thirds of Mr Mikhailov's revenues are gobbled up by social spending. Apart from this, Mr Mikhailov's biggest worry is the high prices charged by monopoly producers and the difficulties of maintaining traditional contracts with suppliers. 'You can't have democracy without discipline,' he says, echoing the deep dissatisfaction of many Soviet managers with the economic effects of the Soviet system's collapse. Although his production has not been affected for the first quarter of this year, he warns that a failure by republics to keep up previous deliveries to each other's plants will spell disaster. Mr George Horton, the tireless American who heads Fleming's Russian investment fund, says it is too early to tell how much foreign capital would be required for the Tu-204 project because it is not yet clear how many aircraft will be produced. Although a prototype could be ready for the Farnborough air show in September, it will take at least three years to get the aircraft certified in the west. Mr Mikhailov says it would cost Dollars 1bn to modernise the plant to his satisfaction - for instance to expand production of the Antonov-124, and turn it into an 800-seat passenger aircraft. His figure would presumably include building flats for all his workers. But he knows he will have to content himself with far less. Like Fiat in its talks with the Russian carmaker Avtovaz, Robert Fleming wants to insulate its investment by creating a separate company for the joint project, rather than to buy directly into Aviastar. This is because Aviastar itself, like other big companies such as Kamaz, the truck maker, carries a heavy burden of non-productive assets, such as schools and housing, which as Kamaz found through bitter experience when offering shares last year, are of no attraction to western investors. Given the political instability and the difficulties of investing in Russia, such a marriage does not promise to be easy to start with. But both the western and Russian partners say they are looking for a long-term relationship. 'At the end of the day you have faith that the Russian government will not do something to hurt foreign investors, because they need foreign capital,' says Mr Horton. 'If you don't believe that, you shouldn't be here.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The head of state, President Pascal Lissouba,  received French Ambassador Andre Michel this morning. The two  men took this opportunity to review the relations between Congo  and France, said the French diplomat after his audience with the  president.    [Begin recording] [Michel] President Lissouba and I met to  review the relations between Congo and France. Our discussions  focused on cooperation in fields that could strengthen relations  between the two countries. We also discussed development  projects that could be implemented quickly to solve some social  problems and benefit the most destitute of the Congolese people.  We have already held an initial meeting with Congolese partners  and foreign financial backers to associate them with the  implementation of the first identified projects that will be  launched in the next two weeks. That is the general outline of  our discussions.    [Unidentified correspondent] You said you reviewed bilateral  relations between France and Congo. On this issue, Congolese  are interested to know the nature of the relations between Congo  and France. Are these relations excellent, or is something  wrong with regard to what is happening in our country these days?    [Michel] Our relations are excellent. From our point of  view, there are no problems with Congo except those relating to  the insecurity prevailing in the Congolese capital, and that is  a subject of concern for the French nationals residing here. In  addition, we should not forget the problem relating to the  devaluation of the CFA franc and the ensuing economic problems.  All these factors should be studied with utmost care and  serenity, and we believe there are solutions to all these  problems and that security should be ensured. We will  contribute to its maintenance, as we have in the past through  cooperation. As for the devaluation of the CFA franc, we are  naturally very much alert to how the situation will evolve, to  the cost of living, and to the price of essential goods. With  the assent of the Congolese authorities, we will see if there is  a need to facilitate things and help out in maintaining things  in reasonable proportion for the Congolese people.    [Correspondent] You are talking about insecurity. France  should consider the fact that it is responsible for what is  happening in Brazzaville, and the French Government has  announced that the centennial of the Brazzaville conference will  be finally celebrated in France. Why is this?    [Michel] Listen, the centennial of the Brazzaville  Conference  is an important event that the Congolese authorities intend to  celebrate in favorable and satisfactory security conditions.  All Congolese, regardless of their political ideas, should  associate themselves with this important moment in the bistory  of Congo, Franco-Congolese history, and African history. Today,  of course, we agree that serenity and security do not exist, and  the Congolese authorities have wisely suggested that it should  be postponed to a later date. France--which is celebrating a  centennial, the liberation of France, the landing, and the  Brazzaville Conference--will also commemorate all these  important events on 30 January. This will not prevent the  Congolese authorities from celebrating this anniversary. We  will celebrate with them, and all the works we began on the  occasion will continue and will be completed in time.    [Correspondent] Speaking of insecurity, I wanted to say that  France (?has its share) of responsibility in this.    [Michel] France does not feel responsible for this  situation.  What is happening today in Congo is the responsibility of the  Congolese people. I think they have some difficulties as far as  internal politics is concerned, and these problems should be  resolved through democratic practices and the Constitution. The  country has institutions that are functional. We are saying  today that if the Congolese institutions are functional, they  should continue to be so that all the Congolese people should be  able to express themselves through them.

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL OFFICIAL URGES REPORTING OF AIDS CASES  </P> <P> Mandatory reporting of AIDS infection "makes all the sense in the world" to  help Americans stricken by the virus receive proper care, a federal health  official told the National AIDS Commission on Monday.  </P> <P> Dr. James W. Curran, director of the HIV/AIDS program for the federal Centers  for Disease Control in Atlanta, said he thinks the time has come to start  keeping confidential government records listing the names of people infected  with the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus.  </P> <P> AIDS activists have long argued against such mandatory reporting, saying they  fear that health agencies cannot ensure that the names of HIV-infected people  will not become public. About 20 states require mandatory reporting of the  names of HIV-infected people to health officials. However, only a handful  actually are implementing that policy, Curran said.  </P> <P> The expense of offering HIV-infected people the proper medical treatment  appears to be a major reason that states are dragging their feet in requiring  HIV infection to be reported, he said.  </P></p>

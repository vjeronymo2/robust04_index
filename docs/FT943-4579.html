			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Getting the measure of PR - Claims that public relations cannot be evaluated are increasingly questioned Ever since public relations emerged as a discipline in its own right, the industry has been struggling to prove its effectiveness and professionalism. But attempts to evaluate PR are often hampered by the belief that its methods are too subtle and results too intangible to be measured. The view that PR was too 'creative and intuitive' to be evaluated was long held by Shirley Horn, UK director of corporate communications at Hewlett-Packard, the computer manufacturer. Until three years ago, the nearest she came to measuring the effectiveness of her work was 'eyeballing the size of the clippings binder'. But in 1991 she was sent, under duress, on a three-day course about total quality management. It convinced her that PR was a process that could be evaluated like other disciplines. 'I emerged on a soapbox,' she says. 'Since then, we have been successfully applying total quality management methodology to PR processes - documenting, measuring and continuously improving the effectiveness of each process.' She now measures everything from the correlation between coverage and the speed of response to journalists' telephone calls, to the number of thank-you letters written by dinner guests. Horn's belief that PR can be usefully evaluated is increasingly widely shared. 'This is the age of 'if you can't measure it, don't do it',' says Sandra Macleod, managing director, Europe, of Carma International, a media evaluation service. It is one of more than a dozen media evaluation services recently established in the UK which quantify trends in media attitudes to various issues and messages affecting a company. Part of the value of media assessment to a PR department is that it helps underpin the case for a particular budget. Jane Drew, a public affairs manager at American Express, finds that using the Carma evaluation system helps demonstrate to senior management the effectiveness of PR campaigns. 'We find it useful because PR is not taken as seriously as marketing or finance,' she says. Evaluation reports can also suggest ways to improve a PR campaign. Bass, the brewing company, uses the Impact system developed by Infopress, a PR consultancy, to keep track of messages concerning matters such as quality, innovation, tradition and management. If the tracking studies show that a message such as 'Bass offers quality brands' is being expressed less frequently in the press, the company will try to remedy the trend by, say, making extra efforts to publicise awards won by its beers, says Lesley Allman, external communications manager. Evaluation reports may persuade companies to drop a campaign. For instance, a drive by Philip Morris to counter criticism about the impact of tobacco on health was found to be fruitless. Other benefits of evaluation reports include identifying journalists who have been particularly favourable or hostile towards a company. PR departments may also be able to assuage the wrath of a chief executive incensed by a negative article, by demonstrating that overall coverage of the company is becoming more positive. Conversely, a critical press can sometimes alert a company to an area of weak performance. But not everyone believes that media evaluation techniques are a satisfactory measure of PR's effectiveness. One inevitable problem is that PR managers have no direct control over the results of their efforts in the media. Moreover, it may be hard to disentangle the impact of a public relations programme from that of other marketing exercises, such as direct mail, promotions or sponsorship. Another problem is that media response to a PR campaign is not the full story. The ultimate purpose of most PR campaigns is to influence consumers, or target groups such as shareholders or parliamentarians. The impact of the campaign may need to be monitored by using survey research, setting up focus groups, keeping track of share price movements and measuring sales. PR evaluation also does not weigh success in limiting press criticism after a damaging news story has emerged. Admittedly, companies that continually attract negative comment can measure the performance of their PR departments by keeping track of the volume of negative messages in the coverage. The department can also measure its success in tempering the bad news with some positive messages. But most commentators agree that the greatest obstacle to PR evaluation is cost. Although it may be reasonable to justify spending Pounds 10,000 to evaluate the effectiveness of a PR budget of, say Pounds 250,000, the cost of evaluation represents a large proportion of a small budget, unless research is carried out in-house. There is a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the part of PR consultancies and their clients to find the extra cash to evaluate their campaigns. Quentin Bell, president of the UK Public Relations Consultants Association, recently dropped an attempt to introduce a standard evaluation tool for the PRCA's members because of the lack of support for the move from clients and consultancies. Jon White, a visiting professor of public affairs at City University, believes that the need of PR practitioners to evaluate activities is 'partly a matter of professional insecurity'. He points out that PR is not alone in experiencing difficulties with measurement and evaluation, which present problems in all areas of management. The point is echoed by Mike Beard, president of the Institute of Public Relations, who argues that other disciplines such as finance, human resources, law and marketing rarely have standard evaluation systems. 'Other professions are not obsessed by the issue, nor should we be,' he says. Yet the absence of an industry-wide measurement technique is regretted by many people who believe that PR needs to improve its professionalism. 'It would make the industry more quality-oriented if it allowed itself to be subject to evaluation,' says Dermot McKeone, deputy chairman of Infopress. Quentin Bell goes further. It is crucial that PR demonstrates its effectiveness, he argues. 'Unless we can get clients to insist on evaluation, there will not be a PR consultancy business in 25 years' time.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 15 Jun (INA)--Dr. Hans Sterchen has  emphasized that the Arabs and other parties in the region are  responsible for lifting the siege imposed on Iraq without  waiting for a resolution by the United Nations and Washington.    In an interview published in ALIF BA' magazine, published  today, Sterchen, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee at the German Parliament, said the free German  parliamentarians want to see the siege on Iraqi children lifted  and to assist sick Iraqis by providing them with necessary  medicines that are in short supply in Iraq due to the  continuation of the siege.    The German parliamentarian criticized the attempts by some  parties, inside and outside the region, to interfere in Iraq's  international affairs. He stressed that Iraq should play its  role in the region's security and stability.    He referred to the credibility of the Iraqi steps that  contribute to the setting up a new order in the Arab arena that  depends on coexistence and stability based on the rule of law in  the internal and foreign sectors. He said he was impressed by  the democratic experiment and pluralism that was approved by the  Iraqi National Assembly.    Sterchen urged those concerned with humanitarian activities  to directly and actively contribute to, and assume their  international role in ending the suffering of Iraq. He  denounced the campaign against his noble humanitarian efforts to  assist Iraq's children and other social sectors.    Concluding his statement, Dr. Sterchen, the free German  parliamentarian, said: I will concentrate my efforts with the  United Nations to provide more assistance to Iraq, and I will do  all I can with the Humanitarian Assistance Committee and the  Foreign Relations Committee to use the frozen Iraqi funds in  Germany to extend humanitarian and food assistance to the Iraqi  people.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally to close at day's highs LONDON'S equity market battled gamely throughout a tense but generally thin trading session to close with overall small gains, having recovered from widespread and often double-figure losses registered earlier in the day. Triggering a late and determined rally by blue-chip shares was a whisper of an imminent sizeable corporate deal, possibly involving a Footsie stock, and a remarkable turnround in the futures market. The FT-SE 100-share index ended at the day's best level, up 8.2 at 2,544.9, having been down 16.4 to 2,520.3 within two hours of the opening. The market opened in a rather fragile mood, with marketmakers clipping prices across the board, to head off some attempted early selling caused by the latest opinion polls published over the weekend which showed the Conservatives and Labour running virtually neck and neck. Adding to the generally uneasy mood at the outset was a sizeable fall by the Tokyo market. More gloom came in the shape of an undeniably bearish review of retail sales over the Christmas period published by the Confederation of British Industry. This bearish picture for retailers was confirmed in mid-morning by official government statistics on retail sales for December which were a provisional 1 per cent lower during the period. Rather optimistically, the market had been expecting retail sales to have been at worst only marginally down in December. After the statistics were known, store shares were among the market's unhappiest areas, reacting to the figures and also to a broker downgrade of Kingfisher, one of the most important store counters. Marks and Spencer and Great Universal Stores also came in for a flurry of selling, but most store issues rallied as the day wore on. There was no shortage of bearish stories in other areas of the market. Dealers went gunning for British Aerospace as the group confirmed the departure of its finance director and a claim for Pounds 80m from Asda, the supermarket group, in the wake of a property joint venture between the two groups. Water and electricity shares stumbled as institutions looked hard at opinion polls and awaited news this week of the date of the UK Budget. Vodafone topped the active stocks list as a leading agency broker placed a near 5m block of shares ahead of a series of presentations to stockbrokers and institutions. Abbey National shares retreated after UBS Phillips &amp; Drew lowered its profits expectations. An early slide by the Footsie future kept the cash market on the defensive, but the whole picture changed during the afternoon. Wall Street opened lower but then started a slow recovery, and the Footsie future began to accelerate, boosted by a late spate of institutional buying orders. An opening 16 points premium was turned into a 33 points premium by the close. Senior marketmakers in the stock market were more than happy with the market's performance. 'There was very little selling, quite the reverse,' said one dealer, who pointed out that there had been a persistent supply of buying orders into the market even when the Footsie was 16 points down. Seaq turnover amounted to a rather disappointing 418.2m shares, compared with last Friday's 687.2m.</p>

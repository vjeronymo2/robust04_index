They include an increase in the number of  highway checkpoints, with state and municipal police forces, as  well as representatives of the civilian society, participating  in them. This announcement was made here today by the office's  head, Diego Valades.    The judicial authority visited this state to sign a  coordination agreement, aimed at optimizing and intensifying the  battle against the drug trade in Tamaulipas. On this occasion,  in the presence of Governor Manuel Cavazos Lerma, he confirmed  the fact that "the civilian society will participate extensively  in the checkpoints."    He explained that this plan was suggested by the Tamaulipas  governor, who proposed that he permit the cooperation of the  state and municipal governments, as well as the civilian  society, in the checkpoint activity, to prevent human rights  violations.    He indicated that the third parties' role would be to ensure  that the operations are intended to protect collective security,  and are not an excuse for disturbing individuals or families  when they are inspected on highways. [passage omitted]    He declared: "Mexico is setting an example of tenacity in  the  battle against drug trafficking that has earned it recognition  from other Latin American nations and the United States." He  added that this country "is an example, internationally, in  fighting the drug trade, and as a result has achieved a  reduction in that crime."    Valades Rios stressed that, in this state, "There is a great  dedication to the battle for justice, which is vital for  eradicating crime, particularly the organized type represented  by drug dealers."    He went on to say that the drug traffic must be fought, and  that "a better and more efficient systematic link between the  Federation, states, municipalities, and the population itself is  required. The effort must be the same on everyone's part, so as  to achieve justice." [passage omitted]    During the next three months, another 500 agents will join  the National Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD], raising their  numbers to 1,300. The announcement was made by the agency's  national commissioner, Raul Campos Rabago.    He added that the personnel would be trained specifically in  fighting drugs, through the Training Institute run by the  Attorney General's Office itself.    He noted: "We have 800 members but, within three months at  the most, we shall take on at least 500 more to cope with the  requirements generated by the battle against the drug traffic."  The Institute has set up six regional offices throughout the  country, but the target for the first phase is to attain 15,  which should be operating this very year.    To date, the results of the battle against the drug trade  have proven positive because, thus far this year, slightly over  160,000 kg of cocaine have been seized: "an amount unprecedented  in the nation's history." [passage omitted]    The official in charge of fighting drugs in the country  explained that the institute is paying particular heed to states  regarded as drug producers, such as Oaxaca, Michoacan, Jalisco,  Sinaloa, Sonora, and Durango, among others.    Nevertheless, other states, such as Tamaulipas, which are  serving as passageways for transporting drugs bound for the  United States market from South America, have not been  overlooked either.</p>

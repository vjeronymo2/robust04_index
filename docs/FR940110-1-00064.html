			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) For households in AHP-assisted rental housing units, rent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments, and where they are not already included in rent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments, a reasonable estimate of utility costs excluding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telephone service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.9(c)(1)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household subject to the 20 percent requirement is required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet such requirement only at the time it initially purchases or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupies a unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Alternative requirements. Section 960.9(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the 20 percent requirement shall not apply where a Bank provides subsidized advances or direct subsidies to an applicant for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rental housing project, which project also receives funds from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal or state rental housing program that requires qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households to pay as rent a certain percentage of their monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income or a designated amount, provided that the household meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the housing payment requirements of the other program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.9(c)(2)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 20 percent requirement shall not apply where the total amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of AHP funds provided through a Bank subsidized advance or direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy used to finance rehabilitation of a housing unit by a very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income household that already owns and occupies the housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit is $10,000 or less per such household. In addition, proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.9(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the 20 percent requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall not apply where the total amount of AHP funds provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a Bank subsidized advance or direct subsidy used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finance the purchase of a housing unit by a very low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household is $5,000 or less per such household. This is a change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the interim rule which permits this alternative to the 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent requirement only for households that are above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold income level for very low-income households and at or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below the income level to qualify as low- or moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households. The Board did not intend to exclude very low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households from taking advantage of this alternative when it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted the interim rule. Accordingly, proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.9(c)(2)(ii)(B) corrects this error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.9(c)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 percent requirement shall not apply where the total amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP funds provided through a Bank subsidized advance or direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy used to finance rehabilitation or purchase of a housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit by a low- or moderate-income household is $5,000 or less per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.9(c)(2)(iv) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 percent requirement shall not apply where a Bank provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidized advances or direct subsidies ultimately benefiting a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household with an income at or below the level committed to in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP application, which is participating in a self-help, sweat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equity or similar housing program. Under the proposed rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household is required to contribute its skilled or unskilled labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valued at a minimum of $2,000 per household. The household must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work cooperatively with others to construct or rehabilitate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing which the household or other program participants are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchasing or already own and occupy, and the program must involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision of the work performed by skilled builders or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project feasibility <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The AHP application must indicate that the proposed project is feasible. This determination must be based on an analysis of project sources and uses of funds, project multi-year operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pro formas for rental housing projects, projections of sales and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices for owner-occupied housing units, and local market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. The analysis must show that the project is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially viable and likely to be completed within a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time, and is likely to operate or sell and remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordable to the designated income-eligible households over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term period committed to in the AHP application. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;960.9(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A feasibility requirement also is contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.5(a)(2)(ii) of the Board's existing AHP regulation. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualifications of sponsor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The AHP application must indicate that the sponsor has the qualifications and ability to perform its responsibilities as committed to in the AHP application. See proposed &sect;960.9(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed provision is not included as a threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation, although it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under the regulation to be included by an applicant in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its AHP application. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(4). The Board believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this provision should be included as a threshold requirement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since a project should not be funded if the sponsor lacks the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications and ability to undertake the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Creditworthiness of applicant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Consistent with the Board's existing AHP regulation, &sect;960.9(f) of the proposed rule provides that the applicant must have the ability to qualify for an advance from the Bank to fund the project described in the AHP application. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910420 FT  20 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle The only surprise about Tate &amp; Lyle's increased cash offer for Bundaberg Sugar is its generosity. The 10 per cent increase to ADollars 4.10 per share is not quite of knock-out proportions, but it shows that for Tate the strategic gain is more important than further haggling about the price, mild dilution notwithstanding. Bundaberg shareholders will doubtless pause before playing too much harder to get. Although the world sugar cycle might appear to be near a turning point, the price is still in the doldrums and if anything is heading lower. Tate has won the argument. It must now win 90 per cent shareholder approval.</p>

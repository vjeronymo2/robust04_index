			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> President Augusto Pinochet's military government withdrew an offer to reform  Chile's constitution after opposition parties rejected the proposals as  insufficient. "In the face of this rejection . . . there is no room for any  reform. The opposition has closed all possibility of achieving the necessary  consensus," Interior Minister Carlos Caceres said in a statement. Saying he was  "disappointed" with the opposition response, Caceres ruled out any further  negotiations and said the government will concentrate on preparing for  December's elections.  </P></p>

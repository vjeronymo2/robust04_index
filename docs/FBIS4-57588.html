			<p>BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], today  termed the U.S.-sponsored summit slated for December 1994 in  Miami, Florida, a blow against the Ibero-American integration  movement.    In remarks to PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon said that in view of  this reality, the Ibero-American countries, the presidents of  which will meet in the Colombian town of Cartagena de Indias in  June 1994, will have to make a clear commitment to strengthen  such an integrationist movement.    Alarcon added that if a specific program of Latin American  and Caribbean integration is achieved, and if progress is  achieved toward that objective, those invited will go to the  Miami conference with the assurance of being a strong group in  an unprecedented case of Ibero-American relationship.    Alarcon added that the fourth Ibero-American summit will  become a moment of reaffirmation and consolidation of the  movement it represents. He also referred to the Cuban exclusion  from the invitations extended by the United States for the Miami  summit, and called it an attempt to return international reality  to the situation that prevailed 20 years ago.    Alarcon will leave tomorrow, 21 May, for London to comply  with an official invitation extended by the two chambers of the  British Parliament. He will stay one week in the UK.</p>

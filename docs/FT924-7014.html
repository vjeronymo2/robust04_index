			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo perilously close to quicksands - A further fall in the Nikkei could take the banks with it The Tokyo stock market is in danger of slipping back into the financial quicksands. The Nikkei average is at its lowest level for three months. It has lost about half of the gains it made in the wake of the August announcement of a Y10,700bn (Dollars 86bn) emergency government spending package to revive the economy. The wave of euphoria that greeted the package drove the Nikkei up from an year's low of 14,309 in August to a high of more than 18,908 in September. At that time Nikko Securities was not alone in describing the rally as a turning point. It forecast that the Nikkei would probably trade between 20,000 and 23,000 this autumn, with economic growth recovering strongly by the early spring of next year. Those hopes have proved ill-founded. From late September until early this month, it was still possible to believe that the August package had done the trick as the Nikkei hovered between 17,000 and 18,000. But in the last nine trading days it has lost more than 1,000 points to close yesterday at 15,993. A continued decline would have far-reaching implications for the Japanese economy because of its impact upon Japan's troubled banks. The authorities' ability to prevent further declines in two markets - in equities and in property - will determine the short-term prospects for the banks, and for the economy. Land prices are still falling. Further falls would erode the collateral for more of the banks' real estate loans. Bad debts for the top 21 banks rose by more than 50 per cent in the six months to September to Y12,000bn. So arresting the decline in property values, partly through increased government purchases of land for public works, will be vital to curtail the growth of the bank's bad debts. Share prices are central to the strength of the banks' balance sheets because about Y18,000bn of the 21 top banks' capital of about Y40,000 is made up of unrealised gains on stock transactions. With the Nikkei at between 18,000 and 20,000, the banks' capital base should be strong enough to pass the Bank of International Settlement's (BIS) capital adequacy ratios. That should allow them to increase their lending at more than 5 per cent per annum, fast enough to fuel economic growth next year of about 3 per cent. However a further fall in the stock market would eat into the banks' capital at a time when they are planning write-offs for rising bad debts; and the pressures for the market to fall further are considerable. The outlook for corporate earnings is dismal, with some analysts predicting that profits next year could fall for the fourth year in a row. Investment is still falling and consumption flat, and there is growing scepticism about whether the government's public investment programme will deliver a kick start to businesses outside the sectors which are direct beneficiaries, such as construction and steel. A more immediate worry is that companies are selling their stockholdings in other companies to raise working capital, because they are finding it difficult to raise it by bank borrowings. Other sources of demand are unlikely to prove strong enough to sustain the market. Foreign investors, who bought heavily when the market reached its summer lows, are likely to wait to see whether it will go down further. The government's pledge that the public sector postal savings system would buy more stocks is running into opposition from the ministry of post and telecommunications. It has been bombarded with complaints from savers who are unhappy that their money is being used to prop up the ailing stock market. Mr Peter Tasker, chief equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson, comments: 'The influx of public funds can slow the market's decline but it cannot chase the market back up.' However, if the banks are to pass the BIS standards by next March the market will have to stage a sustained recovery. With a huge rabbit pulled out of the hat in August, it is likely that an even bigger stimulus will be required. A further early cut in interest rates of more than 50 basis points is increasingly likely. But that will not be a panacea. The Nikkei has fallen within two weeks of four of the last five interest rate cuts. The banks could help by taking more decisive action to deal with their bad debts. But as yet they are taking a gradualist approach. So the main boost must come from fiscal policy. The supplementary budget to enact the August Y10,700bn package is stalled in the Diet which is consumed by a power struggle sparked by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will face mounting pressure to deliver a large fiscal stimulus through the 1993 budget. The problem is that political lines of command at the top of the LDP are so confused in the wake of the Sagawa Kyubin scandal that swift and decisive political leadership is unlikely. A full-scale rout taking the market back to 14,000 cannot be ruled out, though it is still unlikely. But the longer the supplementary budget remains stalled in parliament and the LDP leadership is gridlocked, the more likely it is the Nikkei will continue its dismal drift downwards, threatening to take the banks and the economy with it.</p>

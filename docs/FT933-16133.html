			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Quad talks continue to last minute TRADE officials of the US, Japan, Canada and the European Community were last night locked in negotiations in a last-minute effort to agree a broad market access deal for goods and services, aimed at reviving the stalled Uruguay Round of trade talks. The official-level talks are to be followed by a trade ministers' meeting of the four today at which participants hope to agree a package and approve a report to present to the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo tomorrow. However, considerable differences still existed, making it necessary to extend the official-level talks until the eve of the ministers' meeting. The final ministers' meeting before the summit comes after the four failed to agree a market access package at a meeting in Tokyo less than two weeks ago. US reluctance to reduce tariffs on textiles sufficiently to satisfy other members, Japan's refusal to do the same for spirits and wood products, and the EC's position on electronics were seen then as big obstacles to a wide-ranging package. Failure to reach agreement on a market access package would endanger hopes of concluding the long-stalled Uruguay Round this year.</p>

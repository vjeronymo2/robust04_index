			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE RACE RIVAL CRASHES HATFIELD NEWS CONFERENCE  </P> <P> Republican Sen. Mark O. Hatfield's opponent crashed one of his news  conferences, then got in the last question by asking Hatfield to debate him  today.  </P> <P> Hatfield, who has refused such requests from Democrat Harry Lonsdale, walked  away without responding.  </P> <P> "I'm conducting a press conference, not a circus," Hatfield said later when  asked what he thought about Lonsdale's visit Friday.  </P> <P> When Lonsdale appeared, Hatfield stumbled over his words before regaining his  composure.  </P> <P> Lonsdale stood silently as Hatfield criticized his opponent again for  supporting Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in 1985 after the Indian guru pleaded guilty  to federal crimes. Lonsdale's claim that he was merely defending religious  freedom does not wash, Hatfield said.  </P> <P> "The issue isn't religious freedom; it's a question of judgment," he said.  </P> <P> Lonsdale later criticized Hatfield for witnessing a shooting last year in  Washington, D.C., and failing to report it to police.  </P> <P> "As a citizen he had an obligation. As a senator, he had no excuse," Lonsdale  said. "We all make mistakes and do things we regret. But Mark Hatfield should  reflect on his own failings before he criticizes my judgment."  </P> <P> At a separate news conference, Gary Kahn, Lonsdale's campaign counsel, called  for a three-county task force to investigate a burglary at Lonsdale's home last  week.  </P> <P> The Deschutes County sheriff's office said the investigation has failed to turn  up any suspects. Kahn stressed that he was not accusing the Hatfield campaign  of committing the burglary.  </P> <P> Julie McGregor, a spokeswoman for Hatfield, said the senator feels "it's  unfortunate that such a crime should occur so close to an election, but it's  equally unfortunate that Lonsdale is trying to lay blame on Hatfield  supporters."  </P></p>

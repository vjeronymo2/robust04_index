			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (2): Why red ink is flowing in the US - Downturn in computer sales revenues forces painful adjustments THE 1990s, heralded as the information age, have so far turned out to be an era of stagnation for the US computer industry. Last year, for the first time in the industry's history, world computer sales revenues declined. In the US, traditionally the most buoyant computer market, the downturn has been particularly acute as large corporations slash their information technology budgets and smaller businesses hold down expenditures by delaying new computer purchases. Red ink is flowing throughout the US computer industry, with both International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, the two largest US computer makers, reporting losses in the fourth quarter and numerous smaller companies reporting disappointing results. The personal computer segment has been particularly hard hit, with sales revenues declining sharply amidst rampant price cutting. In the US, the desktop personal computer has become a 'commodity' product, with price as the only differentiating factor between dozens of different brands that are sold supermarket-style in large suburban 'superstores.' Desktop personal computer purchases by large US corporations declined by 16 per cent last year, according to a survey conducted by Peter Rogers and Natalie Billion, financial analysts at Robertson Stephens of San Francisco. 'The US corporate market for personal computers may be approaching saturation,' the analysts conclude. Seventy three percent of potential corporate users surveyed already have a personal computer. Mainframe computer sales also declined last year, according to Dataquest's world-wide data, from Dollars 30.58bn in 1990 to Dollars 26.9bn, a 12 per cent drop. 'The computer systems industry ran into two very high hurdles in 1991; the negative state of the worldwide economy and the mammoth organisational structures many vendors were supporting,' says Nancy Stewart, a senior industry analyst at Dataquest. 'In the face of this maturing market we can expect to see further cost-cutting measures and restructuring from vendors in 1992.' Even the largest computer companies are being forced to make painful adjustments; cutting jobs and consolidating manufacturing facilities. Digital Equipment, for example, recently offered early retirement incentives to ten percent of its US workforce. International Business Machines is also restructuring its vast empire in an effort to become faster on its feet. Leading US computer companies remain cautious about the outlook for 1992. A survey of corporate computer buyers conducted by Paine Webber analysts in late December 1991 concluded that even when the US economy finally rebounds, there is unlikely to be a marked increase in spending on computers. Only 24 per cent of over 400 companies surveyed said that they would increase spending on mainframes and minicomputers if the economy were to improve. However, 64 per cent would spend more on software. Instead of buying new computers, many US companies are looking for ways to extend the uses of the machines they already own. This trend is particularly apparent in the personal computer segment where software sales are soaring but hardware sales revenues are declining. North American personal computer software sales grew by over 33 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991, compared to the same period a year earlier, according to the Software Publishers Association. In contrast, personal computer hardware sales declined by eight percent last year, according to Dataquest, the US market research group. The other beneficiaries of cost-conscious recessionary psychology are workstation manufacturers whose products represent a lower cost alternative to traditional office computer systems based on mainframes or minicomputers. Computer workstations represent one of the few bright spots in the computer market, with sales continuing to expand, albeit at a slower pace than in the past. The workstation, which initially was geared to scientific and engineering users, is now making significant inroads into the commercial market. Sales to business users are the fastest growing segment of the workstation market and account for one-third of Sun Microsystems business, says Bruce Golden, director of commercial market development at Sun. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the end of the US economic downturn, whenever that occurs, will not resolve the problems faced by many computer manufacturers. In fact, the recession has only exacerbated the effects of a fundamental technology shift that is undermining the business model of established leaders in the US computer industry. The root of the turmoil in the computer industry lies in semiconductor technology advances that have produced microprocessor chips which today provide the computing power of mainframe computers build in the early 1980s. Computers built around these chips sell for a fraction of the price of mainframes and minicomputers. The 'computer on a chip' has already spawned two new categories of computers; the personal computer, which became a commercial product in the early 1980s, and the computer workstation, which became a significant market segment in the mid-1980s. Now the microprocessor chip is beginning to infiltrate the mid-range computer segment in the form of high-powered 'servers' for computer networks, that usurp the traditional role of the minicomputer. By 1994, according to some industry watchers, the microprocessor will make its appearance in a new generation of mainframe computers. The advent of microprocessor based mainframe computers is expected to produce another sharp reduction in the cost of computer power. Powerful microprocessors are one of the enabling technologies behind a fundamental change in the way computers are used. This shift toward distributed or 'client-server' computing is replacing the hierarchical 'mainframe-centric' computing of the 1980s and in the process challenging the business models upon which many leading computer companies have been built. Another powerful force for change has been the trend toward 'open systems' or standards that enable different types and brands of computers to work together. To date, this movement has been focused upon the use of the UNIX operating system, originated by AT&amp;T. Over the past few years, the computer industry has engaged in tedious battles over various aspects of software standards as it struggles to achieve the promise of 'open systems.' More important in the future will be tools that enable software developers to quickly and easily design 'multiplatform' applications programs that can run on many types of computers regardless of differences in hardware, operating system, networking protocols or other systems software.</p>

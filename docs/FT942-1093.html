			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Celebrating rites of passage: Americans know how to negotiate life's stepping stones My daughter, Caroline, graduated from Harvard recently and there was much celebration - deservedly for her; more selfishly for the parent freed of forking out Pounds 25,000-plus a year. The warm glow of the three happy days of rejoicing at 'the other Cambridge' still lingers, but with it a serious thought: that whatever else they may do right or wrong, Americans understand the importance of commemorating rites of passage - and there are few more serious than obtaining a university degree. More than that, marking the occasion properly is a long-term investment in the future, for university and graduate alike. Dim 30-year old recollections of Oxford are of a quick shuffle in a cap and gown, rented by the hour, along with a handful of others who bothered to pick up their degrees in person, the odd bottle of fizz huddled under an umbrella, and back to the grindstone. Younger friends report it has not changed much since. Harvard, America's oldest university, has been doing it properly for 343 years and so, for not as long, have most other groves of US academe, where to graduate from college (and high school and kindergarten and typing school, come to that) is regarded as worthy of proper commemoration not only by those receiving degrees but all who have helped them - parents, friends, lovers, teachers, even bank managers. Cynics say America overdoes this sort of thing, giving awards and recognitions to those who do not really deserve them. Even now a controversy rages in higher education over whether what is known as 'grade inflation' make degrees themselves worth the paper they are written on. But, as US vice-president Al Gore kept repeating (in a different context) on Harvard's glorious Commencement Day: 'The cynics are wrong.' There ought to be nothing cynical, as the university's bachelor's degree citation puts it, about 'passing into the company of educated people', nor about the sense of occasion and its own history that Harvard puts on display every year. My daughter's graduation was no exception. Of course, it helped that the weather was magical but local lore has it that it never rains on Harvard's graduation and, if it does, it is only scotch mist, which no one notices. Certainly a crowd that must have numbered 25,000, only about a third of them getting first and higher degrees, could scarce forbear to cheer at every opportunity (with the business school graduates cheerfully and greedily waving dollar bills). The featured guest speakers were Al Gore (class of '69) and recipient of an honorary degree this year, and Lani Guinier. In truth, the vice-president was not at his best in a speech that wandered more than a little from its central text - that cynicism is the enemy of democracy. But his now well-rehearsed line in self-deprecation ('I'm a living example to the millions of Americans suffering from Dutch elm disease') got appreciative laughs. But Guinier was nothing if not challenging. She is the black law professor nominated last year to run the justice department's civil rights division but ditched by President Clinton after she had come under fire from the far right for allegedly advocating weighted voting according to race. Her message - that the problem of violence in inner cities is but a mirror image of the fault lines in established society - got a few of the parents grumbling, but was delivered with a force and a logic designed to dispel complacency in the younger generation present. Best of all were the student speakers, chosen by the faculty and then given additional training by a drama coach. One gave the traditional Latin oration, replete with references to the Simpsons and Whitewater. Another wondered if the manic pursuit of goals left room for a real life. A third urged the law school graduates to take up cases pro bono (for free). A few were sentimental, but not weepy, and all were as pleased as punch to have a role in the ritual. Nine honorary degrees were awarded, the selection again showing the catholicism that Harvard prizes but which British universities, too often consumed with petty politics and ideology, sometimes fail to match - as witnessed yet again by the carping surrounding Clinton's doctorate of laws from Oxford. As well as Gore, they included Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees; Benny Carter, the black jazz musician; an ancient Harvard classics professor; and even the president of Yale, grinning as the mention of his university was greeted with universal hisses. Commencement Day is also a great occasion for alumni, marching around Harvard Yard according to their year, the very oldest in wheelchairs, their fund-raising activities for the university recorded publicly. And we are talking serious money: in less than a month since its launch, the new Harvard campaign to raise Dollars 2bn had generated over Dollars 670m, more than 1 1/2 times as much as the Pounds 268m Oxford has raised over five years. The discrepancy can be put down to differences in state support, national wealth and attitudes towards philanthropy, as well as a testament to the career successes of old Harvard men and women. But another element must surely come into play - the great sense of obligation that Harvard graduates feel towards the university. The relationship is not a one-way street. An Ivy League degree looks good on any resume, as does one from Oxbridge, although it is less of a guarantee of instant success and riches in today's tough employment market than it was in palmier economic times. But the Harvard network of important connections is not left to chance. Harvard clubs flourish all over the world, bringing people together often for more than a drink. Rarely does a week go by without my wife, Kathleen (class of '72), receiving Harvard mail - and not all of it, by a long chalk, asks for money. Oxbridge is much less good at preserving this sense of mutual assistance. This was a message I tried to convey in a modest speech last autumn to an Oxford dinner and it seemed to have been well-received (even by John Patten, the education secretary). But there has been no communication from the college since, and my inclination to contribute to the Oxford fund has not grown more keen. Harvard, on the other hand, does even the little things well in sending its products on their way. Within two hours of getting her degree from the Master of Leverett House, Caroline had it framed: a quick service for just 27 bucks by the Harvard Co-op, ready to be hung forever on a wall. I am not sure in what dark closet my rumpled piece of paper can be found.</p>

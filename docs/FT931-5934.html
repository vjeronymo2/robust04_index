			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Pension investment benefited trustees THE two former pension fund trustees of the Universal Computers Group, now in receivership, invested more than half the scheme's assets in a company which paid them nearly Pounds 90,000 in fees and dividends and granted them interest-free loans with no set repayment date. UCG is the parent company of Ferrari Holdings, the Stock Exchange listed computer services company which went into receivership in July 1990. The two trustees, Mr Raymond Frederick Lewis and Mr Robert Woodland, were directors of UCG. Neither of the two men was authorised to conduct investment business in the UK. The company which received the largest single investment is an investment company, Giltpeak plc, in which the pension scheme invested Pounds 512,000 of its Pounds 562,000 capital. The company was incorporated on July 27 1990 and did not begin trading until nearly six months later. Giltpeak, whose address is the same as the home address of Mr Woodland, also paid Pounds 22,855 to Mr Woodland's wife for furniture, fixtures and fittings, say the audited accounts for the year ended December 31 1991, the only year for which accounts are available. The accounts show that at year-end Mr Woodland and Mr Lewis had outstanding loans of Pounds 14,404 and Pounds 15,936, which had peaked during the year at Pounds 32,004 and Pounds 61,806 respectively. The accounts say the loans pay no interest and have no set repayment date. The accounts also show that the company had total turnover for the year of Pounds 223,722 and profits of Pounds 41,363, of which Pounds 40,000 were spent on dividends on common shares. Although the pension scheme provided almost all the financing for Giltpeak, it has no voting shares. Instead, it holds preference shares which pay interest at 10 per cent per year and are redeemable in three tranches beginning with a Pounds 170,000 payment at the end of this month. According to the pension scheme's current trustees, GM Benefit Consultants, appointed by the High Court in December 1992, the two men dismissed the former trustee, actuarial consultants Noble Lowndes, a month before the company went into receivership in July 1990. They then removed the scheme's professional fund managers, London and Manchester (Managed Funds) Ltd, and directed the scheme's investments into companies in which one or both men were directors. Mr Ray Coles, partner at GMBC, the current trustees, said that the pension scheme has been receiving dividends on its Giltpeak preference shares.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK : FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT AGAINST OBSOLESCENCE  </P> <P> My son said, "Guess what, Mom? I'm going to buy a CD."  </P> <P> I didn't know the kid knew what a certificate of deposit was. My heart raced.  "Do you realize that is the first mature decision you've made in years?"  </P> <P> "Thank you."  </P> <P> "The fact that you are looking ahead tells us you're beginning to see the big  picture."  </P> <P> "It's not a big deal," he said.  </P> <P> "But it is," I insisted. "It means you're finally investing in something that  will give you something back."  </P> <P> "Not really," he said. "I have to buy all new records and that'll keep me in  hock until I'm 40."  </P> <P> "What are you talking about?" I asked.  </P> <P> "CD -- compact disc. You know, a state-of-the-art stereo."  </P> <P> "What's the matter with the old one?" I asked.  </P> <P> "It's obsolete," he said.  </P> <P> It's an old story. All of his life he has fought obsolescence . . . and lost.  The camera he bought was dated before he reached his car. He purchased one that  was totally automatic, from the built-in focus to the light meter. Fifteen  minutes later, they came out with a throwaway camera.  </P> <P> When he bought his last pair of skis, I remember telling him to postdate the  check two weeks to stave off what I knew was about to happen. He didn't listen.  </P> <P> But it's the stereos that have kept him at poverty level since his first  part-time job. First, it was just a plain little turntable. Then he needed  speakers that required holes in the walls the size of fists. After that it was  needles that cost more than my wedding ring.  </P> <P> Every time he traded up, it was because the sound had been improved. It wasn't  like he was listening to the London Symphony. Besides, by the time the sound  had been refined, he had lost 50% of his hearing anyway.  </P> <P> I know in my heart that the compact disc is on its way out -- just like every  radio he bought that was followed by a smaller and a cheaper one.  </P> <P> Every watch he ever had became an antique in a matter of months. The one he  wears now does everything but shave him. His phone is 2 years old. It's out of  date.  </P> <P> My husband tells me to butt out. None of it is any of my business. Kids have to  learn lessons themselves. It has nothing to do with us.  </P> <P> He hasn't figured it out yet. His son is one paycheck away from moving home.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japan on Tuesday [31 May]  offered support for a presidential statement by the U.N.  Security Council [UNSC] "strongly" urging North Korea to suspend  the unmonitored exchange of spent fuel rods at a 5-megawatt  reactor in Yongbyon.    "The Japanese Government supports the contents of this  statement by the president of the Security Council," said a  Foreign Ministry statement read by deputy spokesman Kishichiro  Amae.    Japan also expresses concern "about the course of events and  strongly urges North Korea to immediately stop this operation  and make consultations with the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA)," Amae said.    The Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted at an  unofficial emergency session the presidential statement warning  "further Security Council consideration" should North Korea  continue to bar the IAEA from examining the discharged rods.    The 15-member council, acting at the request of the United  States after receiving a letter by U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus- Ghali from IAEA chief Hans Blix, said it is "gravely  concerned" about the IAEA's assessment. It did not, however,  directly refer to sanctions.    Amae said Japan is making "various types of diplomatic  efforts," such as urging related countries, including the U.S.,  South Korea and China, to exert their influence in dissuading  North Korea from going nuclear.    But he declined to elaborate.</p>

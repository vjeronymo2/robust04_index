			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates close level UK money rates eased slightly in the face of a substantial liquidity shortage yesterday, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.55bn in early morning, later revised up to Pounds 1.7bn. The main factor was maturing treasury bills and earlier assistance totalling Pounds 1.38bn. However, following the volatility of short rates last week which saw overnight money trade as high as 30 per cent, market participants were keen to take assistance In early assistance, the Bank of England injected a hefty Pounds 1.251bn. The main component was the purchase of Pounds 679m paper for resale to the market at 10 7/16 per cent in equal instalments on February 5 and 6. The balance was mostly in the form of band 1 bank bills, purchased at 10 3/8 per cent. In late morning an additional Pounds 200m was injected, again through the purchase of short-dated band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Afternoon assistance comprised the buying of Pounds 248m band 1 bills, with a late injection of Pounds 90m. This was sufficient to drive short rates down to well below Friday's closing levels. Overnight unsecured funds traded down to 8 per cent in mid-afternoon, from 11-10 3/4 per cent late on Friday. However, later in the day short rates firmed and finished at 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange traded up to 89.77, from 89.70 on Friday. This implies base rates of 10.33 per cent by the spring from a current rate of 10.5 per cent. In Frankfurt, call money continued to trade around 9.40/50 per cent, unchanged from the levels seen last week. Tax payments continued to drain funds from the market, but there is sufficient liquidity to keep rates comfortably below the Lombard rate. The Bank of Japan injected more liquidity than expected yesterday, leading analysts to comment that the authorities were ensuring an ample supply of funds against the background of a weak stock market. The Nikkei stock market index fell 407.5 points to close at 20,913.8, the lowest level since October 1990. In its regular operations, the Bank of Japan injected Y1,600bn funds, more than the forecast shortage of Y1,430bn. This ensured easier short money rates. Call money traded down to 5 9/16 per cent, from 5 5/8 per cent on Friday.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Management: Bringing oil to troubled waters - Foreign companies working in the former Soviet republics are taking on bureaucracy, cultural differences and hyper-inflation in their search for quality When British Petroleum, the UK oil group, awarded a contract for four steel oil platform piles in the UK North Sea to a construction yard south of the Azerbaijani capital Baku, it met an unexpected problem. The yard had never before tendered for a contract and had no idea how much it should charge for the work. 'In the end we had to suggest a fair figure to them,' a BP official explains delicately. Not only the managers but welders at the ShelfProyektStroi (SPS) yard were also initially bemused by western working methods. 'They joked we were even more bureaucratic than the Soviets,' says Peter Wells, Caspian region manager for BP Exploration. 'They couldn't understand why every piece of work they did had to be checked and given a certificate.' A team of seven supervisors from BP, John Brown Engineering and RGC Offshore lived in Baku for several months. Workers were given special training and had to pass a proficiency test before they were allowed to participate in the project. Managers, meanwhile, were taught quality control techniques and received individual instruction on what their role should be. The experiment paid off, with the finished piles being passed for use in any international oil project. 'By the end they were asking us when we would be coming back with more work,' says Wells. BP may be back before long. Last week, together with joint venture partner Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, it signed an agreement with Azerbaijan that could lead to the Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 760m) development of the giant Chirag field in the Caspian Sea. The deal, like Azerbaijan's previous deal with Amoco, and recent agreements by Chevron and British Gas-Agip with Kazakhstan, is significant. It shows that despite the well-publicised risks and problems, oil companies are mastering the art of doing deals with former Soviet republics. Moreover, the smaller republics have proved rather more fleet of foot than the lumbering Russian bear when it comes to attracting Big Oil - with important implications for their economic recovery. BP-Statoil's deal was, none the less, an uphill struggle. The alliance kept at least one person in Baku for most of the last two years, with frequent visits by teams of negotiators who ran up against a variety of problems. Some of those - poor communications and sometimes difficult working conditions - do not unduly trouble managers who have worked in countries such as Colombia, Nigeria and Vietnam. Others were more peculiar to the former Soviet Union. One was the deep lack of understanding of western business among everyone from government officials downwards. 'You often have to sit down with people and spend a lot of time explaining very patiently the most basic concepts, like risk-reward, profit and loss, things that we take for granted,' says Wells. Another problem was suspicion and resentment in some quarters. Workers at the SPS yard were more open to western ways than their bosses. Government officials, meanwhile, were more eager to deal with BP than the local producing associations, Azerineft and Kaspmorneftegaz, whose top officials - many of them comfortably ensconced in their posts since pre-Perestroika days  -reportedly did not take too kindly to western companies invading their patch. Being forced to deal directly, but solely, with the top level of government can be preferable to getting bogged down in the bureaucracy, however. In Russia, for example, oil managers complain of having to negotiate simultaneously with local producing associations, regional governments, and, in the words of one western banker working with the Russian oil industry, 'just about every Moscow ministry and committee that could possibly have any interest'. In the smaller republics, oil managers are often able to go straight to the top and, provided they can get a binding deal ratified by parliament, they are happy to do this even in the absence of established legislation on property rights, taxation and royalties. Both Chevron's and British Gas's negotiations in Kazakhstan were conducted with deputy prime ministers and were closely monitored by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who personally signed Chevron's deal. Similarly, in Azerbaijan, BP-Statoil's deal was negotiated directly with the government and signed by Isa Gambarov, chairman of Azerbaijan's parliament and effectively number two to the president, Abulfaz Elchibey, who also took a keen interest. There are obvious risks to this approach: 'If the government goes, so could our deal,' one BP negotiator admitted privately. While Elchibey is a democratically-elected and popular president, his position could become insecure, particularly if he fails to stop the fighting in the disputed Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. However, the man seen as most likely to replace him, Itibar Mamedov, has a programme of accelerated democratisation and economic reform. 'There are risks everywhere, that's part of the oil business,' says John Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration. Investment and oil are needed by any government, he says. There is also the argument that economic growth can itself promote political stability. Barring political disaster, BP-Statoil's agreement may become an example of the benefits such deals can bring both to oil companies and to the host republic. At more than 1bn barrels, the field will be an important addition to BP's reserves. Moreover, while some technology will have to be imported, BP-Statoil plans to construct as much as possible of the infrastructure at Baku's SPS yard. It will also employ Azerbaijanis offshore and in local management, which Browne says could provide jobs for 700 people. While the share of profits between BP-Statoil and Azerbaijan is yet to be agreed, Browne told local reporters last week he expected a 'very, very hearty majority' of revenues to go to the republic. If both the Amoco and BP deals are successful, Azerbaijan should see its oil output more than tripled to 700,000 barrels a day by the end of the decade. There will be inevitable setbacks. The day after BP's deal was signed, the managers of Azphonesat, the only private satellite phone operator in Baku which BP had been using for its communications, found their office locked and guarded by police. They were told the local communications ministry had decided it needed to 'supervise' communications. BP officials were unruffled. 'It's not a problem. We've coped with much worse than this in Colombia.'</p>

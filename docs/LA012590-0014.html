			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: RETHINKING PERCEPTIONS OF PORK  </P> <P> The nutrient-dense quality of pork is frequently overshadowed by the  misconception that it, like many other red meats, is fatty. In response to such  perceptions, the pork industry has reduced the fat content of its pork cuts in  the marketplace.  </P> <P> Today's pork is about 50% leaner than the pork brought to market 20 years ago,  according to industry experts. Its high nutritive value is an added plus. At  about 200 calories per three-ounce serving, pork is an excellent source of  protein -- a three-ounce serving provides about 24 grams, nearly half the  Recommended Dietary Allowance.  </P> <P> Pork also is a good source of iron, offering between 5% and 10% of the RDA for  adult women in each three-ounce serving. It also contains zinc and some B  vitamins. (The recommended amount for both of these minerals was reduced when  the 10th edition of RDA was released late last year. The RDA for iron for women  is 15 milligrams, for zinc 12 milligrams. The suggested intake for men is 10  milligrams of iron, 15 milligrams zinc.)  </P> <P> There's something else that's new about pork in today's marketplace. After  evaluation of previous handling and preparation techniques, the industry has  revised the minimum safe cooking temperature for pork cuts from 170 degrees to  160 degrees. It was previously thought that the higher temperature was  necessary to prevent trichinosis, an infection caused by a parasite, trichinae.  But, according to the industry, trichinae infection is rarely seen today  because of improved feeding practices. Trichinae is killed at 137 degrees,  which falls well below either of the recommended temperatures, according to the  industry.  </P> <P> A boneless pork loin roast may now be served at either 160 degrees or 170  degrees, although cooked to the lower temperature, the meat will be slightly  pink in color and more juicy. At 170 degrees, the pork has a more developed  flavor.  </P> <P> A pork cut with the bone may also be cooked to an internal temperature of 160  degrees, but there will be an intensely pink color near the bone. For a serving  that is no longer pink, cook to 170 degrees.  </P> <P> Because of its muscle content, the recommended cooking time for pork shoulder  remains 170 degrees. It requires the additional time for even cooking and full  flavor development.  </P> <P> When roasting large cuts, it is necessary to remove the cut while still 5  degrees below the preferred end temperature and allow 15 to 20 minutes standing  time. If, for example, the desired serving temperature is 160 degrees, the  roast should be removed from the oven at 155 degrees, tented with foil and  allowed to stand. The roast will continue to cook and the temperature will rise  about 5 degrees during the rest period.  </P> <P> By following these new cooking times and by trimming cuts of any excess fat,  health experts agree it is possible for lean pork to fit into sensible eating  plans where balance and variety are compatible goals.  </P> <P> PORK MEDALLIONS WITH DIJON-DILL SAUCE  </P> <P> 1/2 pound pork tenderloin  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup plain low-fat yogurt  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon dill weed  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> Cut pork crosswise into 4 pieces.

Remove medallions to warm platter. Season both sides with garlic salt and  pepper.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, combine yogurt, mustard, dill and sugar.

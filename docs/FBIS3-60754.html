The operation will take place on  the PZL MIELEC premises, in cooperation with the Polish Aviation  Institute, designer of the aircraft. The upgraded version Iryda  M-93 will be provided with an inertial navigation system (SAGEM  ULISS) wide field of view HUD [Head-up Display], HOTAS [Hands On  Throttle and Stick] pilot interface, full color EFIS [Electronic  Flight Information System] and extended attack capability. The  first flight tests are due by the end of 1993.    Qualification of MAESTRO [Modular Avionics Enhancement  System  Targeted for Retrofit Operations], the integrated Weapon  Delivery, Navigation and Reconnaissance System designed and  supplied by SAGEM is in progress to equip the Mirage III fleet  of the Pakistani Air Force. Upgrade plans include extension of  Air to Air operational performance and introduction of Air to  Ground mode, to give the aircraft multimission capabilities. In  addition, the aircraft will be fitted with multimode pulse  doppler radar.    A first production order was issued in June 1993. Two  versions are being retrofitted, the trainer/strike aircraft and  the multirole fighter. Another version of this system, designed  by SAGEM for the Belgian Air Force Mirage V has recently  completed with full success an extensive flight test campaign.  Full operational clearance was awarded by the customer in May  1993. Production phase has recently started for upgrade of 15  single-seat Mirage V BA and 5 two-seat Mirage V BDs, two  aircraft versions are concerned, the trainer/fighter and the  attack/reconnaissance. MAESTRO (Modular Avionics Enhancement  System Targeted for Retrofit Operations), with the SAGEM  Nav/Attack systems for aircraft upgrades as cornerstone,  provides capabilities at par with today's front line fighters.  It features:    --Full inertial and GPS [Global Positioning System]  performance (SAGEM ULISS or SIGMA)    --TERCOR terrain contour matching for stealth navigation  and blind attack (SAGEM EBS 1501 Bubble Memory)    --Wide field of view HUD, FLIR [Forward-Looking Infrared]  compatible (SAGEM Group IRIS FLIR),    --HOTAS pilot interface (Hands On Throttle and Stick),    --Air-to-Ground and Air-to-Air fire control including Radar  or Laser Rangefinder    --Self protection system (Radar Warning, Chaff and Flares)    --All digital third generation mission planning system  (SAGEM CIRCE 20001).    SAGEM holds full flight test and qualification. The upgrade  is performed within the customer's overhaul facility, enabling  an extremely short turn-around and an increase of customer's  support capability. The same system and methodology have been  applied to a number of other aircraft: Jaguar International,  A5, etc.</p>

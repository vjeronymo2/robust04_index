			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mirce Adamcevski: "A Protocol on Cooperation </F> Signed"]    [Text] Moscow, 5 April -- In Moscow today, Victor Gaber,  under secretary of the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], and  Vitaliy Churkin, deputy foreign minister of the Russian  Federation, signed a protocol on cooperation between the two  ministries.    Among other things, the protocol will promote contacts and  consultations between the two ministries in relation to the  situations and perspectives in bilateral relations. The  protocol establishes that the ministries will also hold  consultations within the international organizations and forums  on the current international questions of mutual interest. This  document gives the possibility for an exchange of experts,  organization of seminars, and joint researches, assistance in  the cooperation between the archive services of the two  countries, and so on.    Macedonia and Russia agreed that the problems in the Balkans  should be overcome only through negotiations. These should also  provide the framework for the solution of the dispute between  Macedonia and Greece. This was emphasized today in the  discussions between the delegations of the Macedonian Foreign  Ministry and the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. The  delegations were headed by Victor Gaber, under secretary in the  Macedonian Foreign Ministry, and Vitaliy Churkin, deputy foreign  minister of the Russian Federation.    In the discussions the Macedonian delegation pointed out  that  neither threats, preconditions, nor any kind of restriction can  serve as a basis for negotiations, and it welcomed Russia's  prompt efforts to create a suitable climate for the solution of  the open questions in the region.    When asked about the meeting of the two delegations and  about  Russia's silence in relation to the Greek blockade, Vitaliy  Churkin stated the following: "We discussed the Balkans, our  bilateral relations, and what more we could do for their  promotion. We also discussed the problems you asked about. We  must underline that we very actively observe everything that  takes place, and not only observe, but also act the way I think  is fair and efficient in the given situation."    Political consultations between the two delegations on  bilateral relations were also viewed, and were evaluated as very  good. In so doing, latent possibilities were emphasized,  particularly those on the economic and cultural plane, arising  from the transitional period that both countries are in, as well  as the promotion of commercial and economic relations on the  level of the needs and possibilities of both countries. Plans  were also made to regulate relations by reviewing the current  ones and then signing new interstate agreements in the economic,  health, social, and other fields of cooperation.    Moreover, last night in the Macedonian Embassy in Moscow,  Victor Gaber met a group of Macedonian businessmen living and  working in Russia. On that occasion they exchanged opinions on  the present situation in the Republic of Macedonia and the  problems facing the Macedonians working in Russia.</p>

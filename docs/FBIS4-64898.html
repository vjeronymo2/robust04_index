			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rau Has Almost No Chance"] </F>   [Text] The chances of North Rhine-Westphalian  Minister-President Johannes Rau [Social Democratic Party]  becoming the next German president have deteriorated markedly  shortly before the elections. A discussion with FDP [Free  Democratic Party of Germany] federal chairman Klaus Kinkel was  disappointing for Rau. During the meeting, which had been  planned months in advance and repeatedly postponed by the FDP  because of an alleged lack of time, Kinkel promised Rau his  sympathy and support, but made it clear that he felt obliged to  recommend Union candidate Roman Herzog to the FDP electorate  before the third round of voting. Kinkel assumed that most of  his party colleagues will follow his example. This support for  Herzog is essential, claimed Kinkel, otherwise, following the  go-ahead to form a coalition with the Union, he might risk  splitting the FDP and alarming the voters.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'ONION FIELD' KILLER JIMMY SMITH ARRESTED IN ASSAULT;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE PAROLEE IS ACCUSED OF THREATENING A MAN WITH A KNIFE. HE SERVED 19  YEARS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE 1963 SLAYING OF OFFICER IAN CAMPBELL.  </P> <P> Paroled "Onion Field" police killer Jimmy Lee Smith was arrested in Van Nuys  after he allegedly threatened a man with a butcher knife, Los Angeles police  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Smith, 59, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon,  two weeks after a man complained that Smith had threatened him, Lt. Warren  Knowles said. Smith, who police said was under the influence of heroin at the  time of his arrest, was held without bail because the arrest violates  conditions of his parole.  </P> <P> It was the latest in a series of arrests for Smith since he was paroled in  February, 1982, after serving 19 years in prison for his role in the March,  1963, slaying of Los Angeles Police Officer Ian Campbell.  </P> <P> Campbell and his partner, Officer Karl Hettinger, were abducted in Hollywood by  Smith and Gregory Powell and driven to an onion field south of Bakersfield.  Powell killed Campbell and shot at Hettinger, who escaped in the darkness. The  crime and ensuing trial were recounted in Joseph Wambaugh's best-selling 1973  novel "The Onion Field," which was made into a movie.  </P> <P> Since his parole eight years ago, Smith has been arrested five times, three  times on drug charges. He was convicted of selling heroin in 1984, and he was  returned to prison three times, for periods ranging from six months to a year,  for violating his parole.  </P> <P> Police said the latest arrest followed a dispute between Smith and his former  roommate, Marcia Peltier, 49, of Van Nuys, who had ordered him to move out of  her apartment in early April.  </P> <P> Knowles said that on April 17 Peltier found all four of the tires on her car  flat and later confronted Smith, who threatened her. The following day, when  Peltier approached the car with a friend, Dana Ruvolo, 37, of Van Nuys, they  saw Smith standing next to it, Knowles said.  </P> <P> "They challenged him on what he was doing there," Knowles said. "He pulled a  rather large butcher knife from his waistband and lunged at Ruvolo."  </P> <P> Ruvolo picked up a brick to defend himself. Smith backed off and fled, Knowles  said. A police report was taken on the incident and Powell was arrested Tuesday  when patrol officers who knew him from previous encounters saw him on Zombar  Avenue near Saticoy Street.  </P> <P> Powell and Smith were twice sentenced to death for the police killing, but the  sentences were reduced to life in prison when the state Supreme Court ruled the  death penalty unconstitutional. Powell is still serving a life sentence.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Today, General Nicolas  Hermoza, chief of the High Command of the Peruvian Armed Forces,  reported that the price of cocaine base has fallen abruptly  following recent security service actions against the  trafficking gangs. Hermoza said the price of washed cocaine base  has fallen the past few weeks from $1,500 to $150 per kilo. He  presented 23 traffickers to the media, who were captured in the  jungle department of Madre de Dios while shipping 1,051 kg of  cocaine to Colombia. Hermoza also showed assets seized from the  traffickers, including electric generators, precursors to  manufacture cocaine base, communications equipment, and vehicles.    The traffickers were captured in several operations last  week  in the province of Inapari, Madre de Dios Department, on the  Brazilian borde, where a drug collection center operated.  Hermoza indicated that the cocaine paste, which was to have been  processed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombia, had arrived  from the Huallaga valleys and from the Ucayali River area.    The military commander said: "These traffickers' capture and  their equipment is proof that land and air actions in the  Huallaga and Ucayali areas have caused the trafficking axis to  be moved from there to Madre de Dios Department."    Security forces seized 3,653 kg of basic paste and captured  13 traffickers on 24 February in Boca Manu, also in Madre de  Dios Department, in the largest drug seizure ever in this Andean  country. Peru produces some 2,000 tons of basic paste per annum,  which is exported mainly to Colombia where the Cali and Medellin  "cartels" process it into the pure cocaine that is sold in the  United States and Europe. Two-thirds of all cocaine consumed in  the world is processed from the basic paste that comes from Peru.</p>

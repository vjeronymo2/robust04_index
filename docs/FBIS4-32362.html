			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, 22 June (MTI) -- The future Hungarian  prime minister, Gyula Horn, is expected to visit Bratislava in  July. The Hungarian-Slovak basic agreement could possibly be  signed during the summer, and it seems certain that Slovak  President Michal Kovac will visit Hungary prior to Hungarian  President Arpad Goncz's visit to Banska Bystrica at the end of  August.    This was reported by the international secretary of the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), Gabor Hars, in Bratislava on  Wednesday [22 June], after his talks with leaders of several  major political forces.    In an interview with MTI, Hars said the aim of his visit was  to inform his partners in Bratislava about his party's foreign  policy concepts prior to the MSZP taking over government.    Hars said Slovakia has a priority place in the MSZP's  foreign  policy.    The MSZP is ready to sign the Hungarian-Slovak basic  agreement, together with the border guarantees.    The politician was of the opinion that this could perhaps  take place during Horn's visit to Slovakia, prior to the Slovak  elections scheduled for the autumn.    During his visit, Hars held talks with the vice-president of  the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), Erzsebet Borza, an  ethnic Hungarian, and the party's ethnic Hungarian parliamentary  deputy, Jozsef Zselenak.    Hars also met former Slovak Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky,  the chairman of the Slovak Christian Democratic Movement (KDH);  the vice-president of the Vladimir Meciar-led Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Ivan Lexa; the section director of  the Slovak Foreign Ministry, Frantisek Dlhopolsky, and the  chairman of the Coexistence movement, Miklos Duray.</p>

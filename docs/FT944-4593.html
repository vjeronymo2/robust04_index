			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Russia rejects Chechnya invasion Russia and the the break-away republic of Chechnya have agreed to settle their differences without force following last-ditch peace talks held yesterday in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia. The deal appears to be expedient for both sides to save face without resorting to what promised to be a fierce and bloody conflict. Both President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya, and General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, emerged from more than an hour of talks to declare: 'There will not be a military solution to the question.' The terms of the agreement were not immediately known, although the priorities of both sides had been well-aired beforehand. Before the meeting, Gen Grachev said the Russian government had not exhausted all avenues for peace but made it clear he would treat Mr Dudayev as a representative of one the Russian Federation's constituent republics rather than as the head of a foreign state. Russian military sources suggested that Gen Grachev would insist on three conditions being met: an early meeting between Mr Dudayev and the opposition forces; the disarming of illegal military units in Chechnya; and the immediate release of all Russian servicemen captured in the recent fighting. Chechen officials had originally claimed to have captured 70 Russian servicemen but it now appears that 21 Russians have been held captive. According to the Interfax news agency, Mr Dudayev's intentions in the talks were to ensure that Russia would stop supporting Chechen opposition attacks and would withdraw its regular armed forces, which have been ominously massing on the republic's border. Mr Grachev had earlier met Chechen opposition leaders and promised them he would insist on free parliamentary elections being held. The Russian government appeared torn between wanting to re-establish its authority in a rebellious part of the federation and fearing the consequences of being drawn into a long guerrilla war. The Chechen government had made dire threats against Russia if it sent in its troops, promising 'a second Afghanistan'. The Russian parliament - and public opinion - also appeared sharply divided. While some leading politicians in Moscow urged stern measures to end the rebellion, others such as Mr Yegor Gaidar, head of the Democratic Choice party, warned that a military solution would lead 'to nothing but bloodshed and the establishment of a military regime in the country'. Chechnya, which declared its independence from Moscow three years ago, has been a festering sore in Russia's body politic ever since. The Russian government has provided financial support and moral encouragement to the Chechen opposition, which created a provisional council to oust Mr Dudayev.</p>

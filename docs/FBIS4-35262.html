			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 30 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  announced that Egypt will respond appropriately to the Sudanese  Government's provocations at the right time. There are limits  to our patience, he said.    In his 11th annual meeting with the media, President Mubarak  said Egyptians are good-natured people linked to the Sudanese  people with bonds of brotherhood and cordiality. He added: The  Sudanese Government will not provoke us into taking a position  that harms the Sudanese people, whose well-being is a matter of  concern to Egypt.    The president denied reports that 10,000 Egyptian soldiers  have been sent to Hala'ib [on the Sudanese border]. There is no  justification for such a step, he said.    He said the Sudanese Government's provocations against Egypt  are meant to cover up Sudan's internal problems. Sudan's  accusations against Egypt are shameful, he said.    The president added: I am seeking to establish peace  throughout the world, so how can I seek a conflict with Sudan?  They are trying to provoke us, but we will not be provoked  unless our security is harmed. The acts they committed against  Egypt are minor ones.    On Yemen's problem, President Mubarak said Egypt supports a  Yemeni unity established on the right foundations, not one  imposed by force.    What is happening in Yemen, he said, shows that the unity  was  not well-thought out. He said he had conveyed this view to  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. What is important now,  the president said, is to stop the fighting, disengage the  troops, and then begin a constructive dialogue.    Only arms dealers will benefit from a continuation of the  war, and the Yemeni people will be the victims, he said.    In his statements, the president also discussed a number of  domestic issues. He stressed that a housing law will not be  issued until a thorough study has been completed by all sides  and parties; it should be satisfactory to everybody, he said.    President Mubarak ruled out any dangers or contamination in  the Nile's water as a result of the war in Rwanda.    He said terrorism is not a threat to Egypt, and efforts are  under way to eliminate and uproot it. Everything is being done  cautiously, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro awaits the big stick - The tough task facing the utility's new chairman MR MAURICE Strong, United Nations globe-trotter and organiser of the 1991 Earth Summit in Rio, has taken on what may prove to be one of his toughest challenges. The 63-year-old millionaire must get Ontario Hydro's costs under control, cap its CDollars 36bn (USDollars 30bn) debt, and force power rates in Canada's most populous province into line with the national consumer price index. Ontario Hydro, he says, is 'a corporation in crisis, and it is absolutely critical that we get our fiscal house in order'. Ontario Hydro, along with Hydro Quebec, are among North America's biggest electric power utilities. They are controlled by their provincial governments and each has total available capacity of about 30,000MW. Ontario Hydro's biggest headache is the soaring costs of its nuclear generating capacity - some of which has become surplus because of slow economic growth. Ontario Hydro, with assets of about CDollars 50bn, is more than half nuclear-based. Its plants near Toronto are the showcase for the Canadian heavy water-type reactor. But operating costs at its Pickering and Bruce plants have proved much higher than expected. A retubing programme now planned at Bruce would cost CDollars 2.5bn. Similar work at Pickering burdened the budget proportionately during the 1980s. But Ontario Hydro is now struggling with the Darlington nuclear plant, originally estimated to cost CDollars 2bn for 4,000MW of installed capacity in 1977, but now carrying a total cost of CDollars 14bn. Darlington was to have been completed in 1988, but has contributed little to the Ontario grid. The three-year recession and a severe shake-up in Ontario's manufacturing industry have resulted in stagnant growth in demand for power. In the 1970s, it was growing at an average of 7 per cent or more annually. What incenses Ontario industry and consumers is a 30 per cent climb in power rates in the past three years. The utilities' debt has now reached CDollars 36bn and rates, legally, must rise in step with debt. Industrial users say the province has lost its comparative advantage of cheap power, making it more difficult for them to compete with the US. Consumers complain the rate rises are proof of the utility's inefficiency and mistakes in forecasting demand. Mr Strong, a westerner who made his first million in oil and gas, later headed Power Corp of Canada, the Montreal conglomerate, and then set up Petro-Canada, the national oil company, in the 1970s. He was recently confirmed in his new job as Ontario Hydro chairman at CDollars 425,000 a year, following Mr Marc Eliesen, who, appointed only 14 months ago by Ontario premier Mr Robert Rae, only had time to make a start on cutbacks. Mr Strong has confirmed his predecessor's cuts of up to CDollars 10bn in the utility's 10-year capital spending, About 2,000 will be cut from Ontario Hydro's payroll and retirement offers made to several thousand of its 28,000 workforce. A CDollars 13bn multi-year power purchase agreement with Manitoba has been terminated, requiring a penalty estimated at between CDollars 150m and CDollars 300m. A complete hydro electric project in Manitoba has now been delayed indefinitely. Critics charge that Ontario Hydro is in a 'death spiral' and threatens the province's whole economy. 'All through the post-war growth period, people thought Ontario Hydro could do no wrong,' said Mr Tony O'Donohue, director of the Toronto Hydro Commission, the utility's biggest single customer. 'But that was before these double-digit rate increases. Municipalities are forced to consider other sources or even producing their own power.' Some argue the only effective way to avoid disaster would be to break up and sell the utility. But the nuclear generating side would remain a millstone around the province's neck because it can never make a private-sector rate of return. And the distribution grid would remain provincially owned. Asked whether Mr Rae would allow him to wield the big stick, he replied: 'I can't do it alone, but Ontario Hydro is saveable. In a few years we'll be looking back to 1992-3 as a key transition point.'</p>

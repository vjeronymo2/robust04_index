The U.S. Defense Secretary Begins a Tour of  Countries of the Former USSR"]    [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has called the  present relationship between his country and Russia a "difficult  love affair." Speaking in George Washington University two days  before his trip to Russia, Kazakhstan, Belorussia [Belarus], and  Ukraine, the American certainly could not have known that at  roughly the same time, on the other side of the world, Russian  Foreign Minister V. Kozyrev had resorted to words relating to  the same feelings, having notified everyone both of the end of  the honeymoon in the Russian-U.S. relationship and of the  continuation of this promising marriage.    "Russia is our partner and our rival, at one and the same  time," W. Perry said. "We must be aware that our relationship  contains elements of both."    Since the declarations of passionate love have cooled a  little following the capture of CIA staffer Ames, who from 1985  allegedly worked for the USSR and then for Russia, it was  psychologically easy for the defense secretary to speak of a  smooth revision of the line of his predecessor Les Aspin, who  said only a few months ago that "the Russian military threat is  disappearing and it does not seem that it will be revived."  <H5>  Two Options, One Result </H5>   Perry outlined two probabilities in Russia's development.    "Reality No. 1 is that, even given the very best of the  imaginable outcomes in Russia today, i.e. given a fully  democratic and market-oriented Russia, this new Russia will have  interests different from ours," the defense secretary said.  "Even with our allies like France and Japan we have rivalry and  competition in addition to our cooperation, and this will be the  case with Russia."    "Reality No. 2 is the very worst of the possible outcomes,  and we must be prepared for it. It is possible that Russia will  emerge from its uneasy times as an autocratic, militarist,  imperialist state hostile to the West. In such a situation we  will truly be witnesses to the revival of something like the  Cold War, and Russia, even without the Warsaw Pact, will remain  an impressive nuclear arsenal."    In this event the secretary proposed erecting "fences"  consisting of the following measures. First, the U.S. military  budget, which has been subjected to cuts in the recent past,  remains immutable for the immediate future. Second, U.S.  nuclear weapons are improved and developed, including in the  sphere of theoretical scientific development. Third, the  program for building the submarine strike fleet is expanded,  above all by means of the most modern Seawolf-class submarines.  Fourth, special attention is devoted to improving U.S. tanks.    Responding to numerous critics inside the country, who  accuse  the present administration of making concessions to Russia on  the one hand and of jostling it into a tight corner on the  other, the defense secretary called the contrast between the two  countries' rivalry and cooperation a "false dilemma." He  acknowledged Russia's participation in the Bosnian crisis as  highly valuable.  <H5>  With His Own Eyes </H5>   The secretary said that an important part of his visit to  Moscow, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Kiev, and Minsk will be the fact that  he will be able to assure himself with his own eyes that the  U.S. taxpayers' money is working in favor of U.S. national  interests.    Speaking of the Nunn-Lugar program, so named for the  senators who initiated the allocation of money for the  destruction of the former Soviet nuclear missile arsenal, the  secretary said that this is one of the least expensive ABM  defense methods, since the threat is destroyed not in space but  while still on the ground.    In Ukraine Perry will observe the process of dismantling  ICBM's and sending them to Russia. In Belorussia he will see  how the former nuclear missile weapon bases are being  transformed. In Kazakhstan he will discuss with Kazakhs and  Russians the likelihood of the joint use of Baykonur Cosmodrome  for the commercial launching of rockets.    Although the defense secretary's speech was clearly meant  for  home consumption -- which is why it abounded with the  terminology of "national interests" -- it was imbued not only  with knowledge of Russia but also with unconcealed respect for  its military men.    It is not just that Perry called Russia's military men the  force on which the country's future largely depends. All his  views exuded awareness of the fact that military associations,  which represent an important part of the culture and the  political milieu of both countries, can create an important  channel of communication between the two countries.    Speaking of the telephone hot line and of the two telephones  which stand on his desk and on that of Russian Defense Minister  P. Grachev, Perry emphasized that professional misunderstandings  have not yet arisen between the two commands.    Perry cited the upcoming joint maneuvers by peacekeeping  forces as an example of the unusually quick development of  mutual understanding between the two countries' defense  ministries. Servicemen of the U.S. Army's 3d Infantry Division  and the 27th Motorized Rifle Guards' Division will hold joint  exercises this summer on the banks of the Volga.    Although problems of the reduction of nuclear arsenals and  the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons predominate on Perry's  agenda, he intends to discuss in detail in talks with colleagues  questions of U.S. financial assistance in the conversion of  large enterprises.    William Perry is not a professional military man. He is a  scientist and a researcher who has worked for long years in  spheres connected with the military industry. Although he has  ruled out the likelihood of contacts with extreme forces in  present-day Russian political life, he intends to hold intensive  talks not only with President B.N. Yeltsin's staffers and not  only at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense but also  with the leaders of the Duma and the Federal Assembly.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (9): Middleweight with mission - An open line foreign policy When Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, an international pariah in the eyes of the United Nations, visited Bucharest in April he was given the full red carpet treatment by his Romanian hosts. For President Ion Iliescu and Mr Teodor Melescanu, his foreign minister, the niceties of international protocol mattered less than the opportunity to continue a dialogue with their Balkan neighbour. The Serbian leader's visit allowed them to offer their good offices for the resolution of a conflict which has already cost Romania billions of dollars and which could still develop into a wider conflict. 'Starting from the idea that there is no military solution but a kind of balance of forces in former Yugoslavia, we see our role to encourage and assist the parties to find a solution and keep the lines of communication open,' says Mr Melescanu, who earlier had been host to the Croat president Franjo Tudjman and is expecting a visit shortly from the Bosnian president Mr Alija Izetbegovic. 'We believe that there can be no solution without Serbia and that pushing isolation too far encourages extremist forces. Many Serbs believe that an international conspiracy is ranged against them,' he added. But Romania's foreign policy interests range well beyond the Balkans and the wider Black Sea region which Bucharest sees as a promising focus for future economic development as well as a forum for promoting greater stability and co-operation in the region. As in Britain, Romanian politicians believe that Romania should 'punch above its weight' in international diplomacy. This belief was taken to extreme lengths during the Ceausescu years when the dictator persuaded western countries to turn a blind eye to his repressive domestic policies by defying Moscow and vying with Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito for influence among the 'non-aligned countries' of the third world. An active and highly personalised foreign policy gave Mr Ceausescu an excuse to jet-set around the world, hob-nob with the mighty, sleep in Buckingham Palace and develop political and economic ties with countries as diverse as China and Israel. The foreign policy of the post-Ceausescu regime is more modest and more closely tied to national interests. Romania's close interest in the evolution of the Yugoslav imbroglio for example can be easily explained by the long common border with Serbia which means, Mr Melescanu underlines, that 'we are vitally interested in containing the conflict and preventing its extension'. It is not only a security issue. The UN embargo on trade with Serbia has severely damaged transit down the Danube and a once thriving trade between the two countries and blocked several Romanian-Yugoslav joint ventures. On the other hand, the break up of Yugoslavia has reinforced Romania's status as the biggest state in the Balkan region, capable of playing an important role in the wider Black Sea region. To this extent, Romania looks both east and west, maintaining good relations with Greece and Turkey and anxious to rebuild its economic links with middle eastern markets. The present government is more at home with this two-dimenensional policy than opposition leaders who tend to argue that Romania's future security and prosperity depends upon the greatest possible integration into western economic and security organisations, particularly the European Union and Nato. Mr Corneliu Coposu, president of the National Peasants Party, the mainstay of the Democratic Convention, says 'the government wants to maintain its non-orientated path, to rotate the wheel to east or west'. But Mr Melescanu points to a series of recent moves that underline Romania's desire for closer ties to the west. Last year, Romania signed an association agreement with the EU and recently became the first post-communist state to sign up to Nato's proposed partnership for peace. 'No country in this area can survive on its own and neutrality is no longer applicable,' he adds. 'The only choice for us is membership of Nato which we see as an efficient supporter of democratic values.' Romania is acutely aware that economic weakness prevents it pulling its full weight as a country with 23m inhabitants and good connections to the Middle East as well as both eastern and western Europe. But its image in the west has also been adversely affected in the past by outbreaks of intolerance against ethnic minorities, especially the nearly 2m ethnic Hungarians, concentrated mainly in Transylvania, and the large gypsy communities. The exodus of hard working, ethnic Germans from the Transylvanian towns and villages, settled since the 13th century by descendants of Saxon immigrants, has already been a great cultural and economic loss. The airing of historical resentments against ethnic Hungarians by Romanian nationalists risks causing a similar haemorrhage of talent and skills unless sensitively handled by leaders of both communities. Both can rely on a degree of moral and practical support from governments in Bonn and Budapest. But such support is not available to gypsies, whose plight has worsened substantially throughout former communist Europe with the new freedom to express ancient resentments and the bitter economic contest for housing, jobs and other scarce resources. Romanians are probably no less tolerant, nor more violent, than other people. But life here is hard and still getting harder for millions of people. Until prosperity returns, an undercurrent of ethnic tension will continue to test the patience and tolerance of majority and minority alike, and affect the image which Romania presents to the wider world.</p>

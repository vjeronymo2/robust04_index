			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday he "will consider favorably"  bringing North Korean loggers to Seoul despite legal  complications.    "We are terribly concerned about the kind of conditions  which  North Koreans are subject to," Han said in a press conference at  the Foreign Correspondents Club here. Some 150 to 200 North  Korean loggers in Siberia hope to either come to Seoul or stay  in Russia, the foreign minister said, but "there are legal  complications" in trying to bring them to South Korea.    One of the problems is many of the loggers' unclear status  in  Russia, as they lack passports or some form of identification.  Seoul officials say that before they can be flown to South  Korea, the Russian Government must determine their identity,  define their status and allow their departure. But Seoul is  looking for a solution, he said, that "we will consider  favorably."    Meanwhile, he defended South Korea's national security law,  saying it had been revised through "a unanimous, democratic"  process.    "We have an adequate mechanism to protect the human rights  of  each individual," Han told the foreign journalists, responding  to claims from abroad that the law is subject to abuse. With  another inter-Korean contact just a day away, Han reiterated  that meaningful dialogue between the two is a prerequisite to  North Korea-U.S. high-level talks.    Seoul is looking not to isolate but to bring North Korea  into  the international fold, said Han, so that Pyongyang can adapt to  the post-cold war world order.    The foreign minister criticized the recent U.S. decision to  revive the Super 301 trade provision, calling it "unfortunate."    Seoul hopes that Washington will tread cautiously so that  bilateral trade relations are not harmed in the process of  applying the revived law.</p>

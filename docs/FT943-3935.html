The campaign has focused on the nutritional value of potatoes and their versatility. Consumer surveys suggest potatoes are difficult to prepare compared with pasta, sales of which are rising 10 per cent a year. So far the potato board has spent Pounds 5.5m on the campaign although the industry might be seen as overreacting. Rice consumption, although 70 per cent higher than a decade ago, is just 3kg per head in dry weight and pasta consumption is just over 2kg.

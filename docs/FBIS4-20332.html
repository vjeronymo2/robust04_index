			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Staff Correspondent Wang Xinjian (3769 0207 </F> 1696) and Staff Reporter Zhang Zichen (1728 1311 5256): "With Wu  Kunlong, deputy director of the State Comprehensive Agricultural  Development Office"]    [Text] In this new historical situation, the state has  established a new strategic project: there will be large-scale  investment in comprehensive agricultural development to bring  about macroeconomic adjustment and control and ultimately to  realize the modernization of agriculture. This systematic  project requires more investment, and in addition requires  scientific and directed logical application. To discuss such  issues as the annual collection of more than 5 billion yuan in  capital, its allocation and administration, etc., we visited the  Permanent Vice Director of the State Comprehensive Agricultural  Development Office Wu Kunlong [0702 0981 7893].    Question: What is your appraisal of the  application of investment since China initiated its project of  implementing comprehensive agricultural development?    Answer: The nation set out on the project of  comprehensive agricultural development in 1988. As of 1993, it  had invested a total of 25.31 billion yuan in capital, including  6.84 billion yuan from the central financial authorities. It is  the first incidence of such large-scale concentrated investment  since the founding of the People's Republic of China.    This project has reliable resources of capital, clear  directions for its application, policies which are quite  favorable, and a complete system. So party and administrative  leadership have given it their close attention, the masses have  welcomed it, the capital has been applied efficiently. The  investment structure reflects the state's policies on industry  and technology.    In the 25.31 billion yuan investment I referred to earlier,  75 percent was put into grain, cotton, and vegetable oil  production, 15 percent was put into the production of meat,  eggs, and aquatic products, and 10 percent went into building  forests and grasslands. Categorized by developmental and  handling measures, 80 percent was put into construction  measures, 10 percent into biological measures, and 10 percent  into scientific and technological measures. The figures show  that over the last six years there has been a total of 40  billion yuan in capital for state-fixed comprehensive  developmental investment plus farm labor force converted into  capital; this is equivalent to more than 10 percent of the gross  fixed capital in publicly owned, collective, and personal  investment during the same period. In this, the proportion for  major grain-producing areas was even greater. For example,  Anhui's gross investment in comprehensive agricultural  development was 1.23 billion yuan in 1992, which was about 10  percent of the province's gross societal fixed asset investment  (including primary, secondary, and tertiary industry). There is  no doubt that this has been very beneficial in strengthening the  reserve strength of agricultural development and regional  economic development.    Question: What have been the problems with the application  and administration of capital recent years?    Answer: There have been four aspects to this:    1) There have been too many "connecting batch" projects;  they  formed a base, and have affected capital turnover and  efficiency. In 1993, the central financial authorities made  arrangements for 1.7 billion yuan in capital, but most of this  has been taken up by projects already approved, and only 140  million yuan of the capital can really be arranged for renewal.  2) Capital is being used in a scattered fashion, getting quite a  ways away from the focus. 3) The capital has not come through on  time, local supporting capital is hard to implement, and  allocation and payment are taking too long. In some cases, units  which have made application still have not received all of the  year's capital by the end of year, which affects the pace of  their development and their accomplishment of construction  assignments. 4) Impractical repayment terms for financial  capital debts makes it difficult to repay them. These problems  demand our closest attention, we absolutely cannot be careless  about them or lower our guard. Capital investment and  administration supplement each other, so if we only pay  attention to investment and not to administration, our  developing goals will hard to attain, and there will be no way  to be efficient. So from now on, our development department and  financial department must take very seriously their  administration of capital use.    Question: What is this year's gross investment capital and  its structure?    Answer: It could increase to a total of 5.8 billion yuan  this  year (excluding the conversion value of the farmers' labor  force). It is chiefly composed of three aspects. These are the  1.9 billion yuan central financial allocation, localities'  minimum support of 1.9 billion yuan at a 1:1 rate to complete  the set, and in addition, there is a 2 billion yuan loan from  the Agriculture Bank.    Question: What is the future of agricultural development  capital?    Answer: It will certainly increase. This is because  agriculture must have more capital investment. In order to  continue making good allocations of agricultural development  capital and meet the demands of the central government's 1993  rural work conference, the 1994 financial capital budget for  support of agriculture must be higher than the normal increase  in financial income proposed in the "Agriculture Law."  Establish a grain risk fund, to be used chiefly for central  grain storage costs, and subsidize the gap between the prices  for purchases and sales of grain. Increase by 1 billion yuan  yearly until the year 2000 the funding for providing work as a  form of relief. Increase comprehensive agricultural development  capital by 200 million yuan, to 1.9 billion yuan from its  present 1.7 billion yuan. Gradually find some resolution to the  troublesome debts accruing from grain producing enterprises'  losses.    Certainly, increasing the investment in agriculture is not  just the concern of financial departments; there are many  aspects to it, such as bank credit, investment in construction,  fund-raising by agriculture itself, importing foreign capital,  etc., in addition to finance. All departments should work  together -- when everyone adds fuel the flames rise high. When  overall agricultural investment is increased, the capital for  comprehensive agriculture development will naturally increase  with it.    Question: What are the possible ways of implementing out  supporting capital?    Answer: Implementing local supporting capital is the key to  increasing investment and guaranteeing that projects will be  implemented. Beginning this year, the state will require that  fiscal authorities at the provincial level assume the lion's  share of supporting capital. In addition, this capital must be  held in reserve when making out the budget at the beginning of  each year. Now, with reform of the financial system reform, the  sources of agricultural development funds will certainly change,  and for some provinces it may be not sufficient to just rely on  that portion of the tax revenues received from occupying  cultivated land which is controlled by provincial fiscal  authorities. In these circumstances, it is essential to arrange  that part of the capital resources be kept in reserve for  contingency use. We cannot fill out our needs with bogus  supporting capital, nor can we resort to makeshift solutions.    We must really strengthen our management of capital. We  especially must strengthen that management in advance, using  capital within strictly fixed limitations. Comprehensive  agricultural development funds are different from general  administrative funds; we must make the usage of these two very  clear, never mixing them up. In the meantime, we should  strengthen our regular supervision, examination and  administration, giving financial departments the authority to  halt allocation at the first appearance of any violation of  discipline. Comprehensive agricultural development  organizations must accept the supervision of financial  departments.    Question: What adjustments should we make in the investment  mix right now?    Answer: The general breakdown of overall agricultural  development investment is that 80 percent of central and local  financial investment is used to improve the basic condition of  agricultural production and develop such major agricultural  by-products as grains, cotton, vegetable oil, sugar, and meat,  etc., while 20 percent is used to develop a variety of  operations in the regions which have the projects; of the  special loans from the Agricultural Bank, 50 to 60 percent is  used for land exploration and treatment, and 40 to 50 percent is  used for production and operations. This kind of investment mix  is of significant value in increasing the staying power of  agricultural development and increasing the output of grains,  cotton, vegetable oil, and meat. But, in the new situation of  increasing the development of a socialist market economy, it  will be inappropriate to keep on arranging our capital according  to such quotas; we must readjust. From now on, calculating with  the province as the unit, central and local financial investment  should have a quota for increasing investment for improving the  basic condition of agricultural production by not less than 70  percent, and no more than 30 percent into investment in  developing multiple operations and leading projects. As for  arranging bank credits, again counting the province as the unit,  30 percent will be used for land exploration and treatment, and  70 percent for multiple operations and leading projects. This  will reflect governmental activities and suit the demands of the  market economy while developing high output and efficient  agriculture.    Question: When will the project file system be implemented?    Answer: The project file system is a means of advanced  administration. It embodies the principle of selecting that  which is excellent and competitive, and is beneficial to  improving the efficient use of capital. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  has praised the township enterprise project file system very  highly. Some places which are carrying out comprehensive  agricultural development are in the initial stages of  establishing this system too, and these should be vigorously  expanded. Starting this year, both the State Office for  Comprehensive Agricultural Development and the provincial  development offices should establish their own project file,  gradually changing the work of setting projects to regular work.  Before applying for setting projects, each area and unit should  subject projects initially selected through feasibility  demonstration, and when state investment becomes possible, take  the project from the file and submit it to higher authority.    Permanent Vice Director Wu Kunlong stressed that each  locality must do well the preparatory work involved in  implementing the new system by suiting measures to their local  conditions, strengthening professional training, working out  detailed regulations for implementation, and link up  appropriately with the original system. Only in this way will  comprehensive agricultural development in China have great  economic and social efficiency in investment and production, and  push comprehensive agricultural development work to a new stage.</p>

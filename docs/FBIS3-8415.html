"We will not join the current government coalition of the  HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS) and this is our  fundamental position, " Weiss said. He was trying to dismiss  the impressions about his party possibly shifting into the  government camp which have been created by his intensive talks  with Slovak Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar.    However, immediately after that Weiss elaborated that it was  primarily the SNS which did not suit the SDL in this coalition.  "We are not even considering government cooperation with the SNS  as led by Jan Slota," Weiss said, adding that he did not rule  out other forms of cooperation with the HZDS.    SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik admitted that the HZDS  tried to persuade his party into joining the current government  coalition with the promise of highest state offices including  the office of president for Weiss during the talks.    "If such an offer has been made it has been rejected. But I  am not saying it was made," Ftacnik said.    Meciar has allegedly acquainted the SDL leadership with his  idea about the filling of the foreign minister post. Ftacnik  refused to give the names of the three people discussed but said  that one of them was a woman. According to journalists' circles  Minister of Labor, Social Affairs and Family Olga Keltosova  could be that woman.    Pressed by journalists, Weiss confirmed his recent critical  statements characterizing the HZDS as a "a pro-state vulgar  right-wing movement." But he explained his turn in the  direction of possible cooperation with the HZDS by the fact that  the HZDS "won the elections and still enjoys considerable  support from the public." "The time when a political adversary  should be necessarily stamped on and destroyed has passed,"  Weiss said.    He said that at talks with the HZDS the SDL concentrated  mainly on achieving an agreement on what legislative processes  were to be concluded before possible early elections and what  are to be handed over to a new parliament. The SDL rejects any  changes to the constitution, to the current administrative  division of Slovakia and any restructuring of the state  administration or of its individual structures, he said.    The SDL does not, however, refuse to cooperate with the  opposition, Weiss said, adding that he was going to inform the  opposition parliamentary parties about his last night's talks  with Meciar in the evening.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Clinton wins handsdown in Silicon Valley PROMINENT Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists, including several self-described 'life-long Republican voters', have endorsed Governor Bill Clinton as their preferred candidate for president in an unprecedented declaration of political allegiance. 'Bush has given up on California, and we have given up on him,' said one industry executive at a gathering of newly declared Clinton supporters in San Jose this week. Mr John Young, president of Hewlett-Packard, praised Mr Clinton and his campaign advisers for their responsiveness to high-tech industry and trade issues. 'I have had hours of conversations with leaders of the Clinton campaign and I have seen a response that I am not used to,' Mr Young said. As a recognised Republican, one-time chairman of the Reagan-appointed commission on industrial competitiveness and a member of the Bush administration's advisory committee for trade policy, Mr Young's backing for Mr Clinton demonstrates the level of dissatisfaction that high-technology industry leaders feel toward the Bush administration. Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, also endorsed the Clinton campaign. The Democratic candidate, he said, 'has shown the leadership and vision needed to put this country back in the forefront of leading the world again'. 'I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines and watching America lose its competitiveness,' Mr Sculley added. Mr Clinton, noting that the high-technology leaders who were lending him their support represented companies with sales in excess of Dollars 25bn (Pounds 12.6bn), said: 'I am excited, I am proud. This is unprecedented for a candidate of my party. If the economy as a whole performed as well as these companies. . . we would be in much much better shape than we are today.' Mr Clinton said that his 'national technology policy for America' would stress joint ventures between government and industry.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Chilean fears stilled Futures trading losses totalling Dollars 206m (Pounds 141m) at Codelco, Chile's state copper company, will not affect the country's 1994 budget, according to Mr Alejandro Foxley, the outgoing finance minister. Mr Foxley, testifying before a parliamentary commission investigating the losses, which amount to nearly 0.5 per cent of GDP, said the deficit would be met through a combination of last year's budget surplus and extra revenues from Codelco. Codelco would be able to provide the Treasury with an extra Dollars 61m because of higher production and lower costs than envisaged in the 1993 budget, Mr Foxley said. The remaining Dollars 145m would come from the budget surplus of Dollars 790m. The losses had been particularly painful, Mr Foxley said, as he had devoted the past four years to saving money to improve the country's fiscal position. As a member of Codelco's board Mr Foxley has been the target of opposition attack over the scandal. He said he had not known Codelco was speculating.</p>

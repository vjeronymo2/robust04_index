			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet acquires balance of Cinzano for Pounds 80m-Pounds 100m GRAND METROPOLITAN, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, has agreed to acquire Cinzano, the Italian vermouth and wines company, in which it already holds a 25 per cent stake. The outstanding shares will be bought from the Cinzano Merano family, which has owned the company since 1757, and Ifint, the investment company of the Agnelli group, in a deal estimated at between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m. Mr George Bull, chairman and chief executive of IDV, GrandMet's drinks division, said yesterday that the acquisition would greatly strengthen IDV's distribution network in Europe and South America, as well as adding one of the world's best-known brands to its portfolio. Cinzano's relationship with GrandMet companies, such as Gilbey's, dates back more than 50 years. Closer ties were established in 1985 when GrandMet bought a 25 per cent shareholding. Count Francesco Marone Cinzano, who has agreed to retain the post of non-executive president of the company, said yesterday: 'This latest step in the integration of the Cinzano network within the IDV structure is aimed at ensuring the growth and development of the trademark.' Cinzano has an annual turnover of Dollars 500m (Pounds 274.7m) and trading profits of Dollars 30m. In addition to worldwide sales of 3.5m cases of vermouth - wine blended with herbs and spices - it sells about 7m cases of sparkling wine and other drinks. Though the gradually declining international vermouth market is dominated by Martini &amp; Rossi, Cinzano has a 20-25 per cent share of the UK's Pounds 270m business and is brand leader in Germany, Canada, Japan and Argentina. Its Bianco brand ranks 8th in the UK's best-selling wines and spirits, and last year it launched higher-strength premium rosso and dry brands. In recent years, sales of Cinzano's sparkling wines, notably Asti Spumante which leads the sector in the German market, have overtaken those of its vermouth. Mr Bull said yesterday that the Cinzano brands - which have inspired a novel and a Hollywood film entitled The Secret of San Vittoria, as well as a memorable UK advertising campaign featuring Leonard Rossiter and Joan Collins in the early 1980s - still offered considerable potential for development. But from GrandMet's viewpoint, the more important aspect of the deal is the reinforcement it provides for the international marketing and distribution of IDV's entire drinks portfolio. IDV's products - which include such brands as J&amp;B Scotch whisky and Smirnoff vodka - have been distributed by Cinzano in Italy, Spain and the Netherlands; and the two companies, with Remy-Cointreau, have joint ventures in Germany and Belgium. Mr Bull said: 'We shall now have more direct control over the marketing and distribution of our brands in these important markets, especially in Germany and Italy.' IDV, which recently acquired Metaxa in Greece and AED in Spain, will now market and distribute 95 per cent of its brands in Europe through its own companies.</p>

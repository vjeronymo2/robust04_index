			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 9 (A.A.) -- Representatives of  consortium member organizations came together in Istanbul on  Monday [9 May] to evaluate the recent situation before a final  agreement is signed in Baku.    The Anatolian Agency was told that a consortium including  the  Turkish Petroleum Company TPAO and several western companies,  which are responsible for exploration and production of  Azerbaijani oil and its transportation to international markets,  and Azerbaijani National Petroleum Company SOCAR officials came  together to overcome the difference of opinion between them.    They discussed the production conditions of Azerbaijani oil  and the route of the crude oil to international markets.    The consortium includes British BP, American Amoco, Penzoil,  Mcdermott, Unocal, Ramco, Norway's Penzoil and TPAO.    TPAO is hosting the meetings which started on May 2.    Meanwhile, the sides will specify a date for the final  agreement that will be signed in Baku.    During the meetings they decided that SOCAR will not invest  in exploration and production, consortium member companies will  meet the financing of the project. At the beginning Azerbaijan  will get 70 percent of the oil but this can change in the future.    Meanwhile the most important improvement of the meetings was  that all the sides approved of the oil passing over Turkey en  route to the Mediterranean. According to this Central Asian oil  including Azerbaijani oil will flow to the Mediterranean over  Turkey in at least three or four years.    TPAO's share in Azerbaijani oil will be 2.5 percent.</p>

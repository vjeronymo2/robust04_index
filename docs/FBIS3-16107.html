The Kremlin Also Knew of Them in  Advance"]    [Text] The Washington White House and President William  Clinton personally knew that ex-President Richard Nixon, on  setting out to visit Moscow, intended to meet with leaders of  the Russian political opposition, including Zyuganov, Rutskoy,  and Zhirinovskiy. No objections were made to Nixon on this  score, nor was approval given, since these meetings were planned  within the framework of the unofficial part of the trip by the  ex-president, who had invitations both from the Russian Security  Council and from the Foreign Policy Association.    The fact that this is so was confirmed by Clinton himself,  who offered explanations to this effect on U.S. television  Wednesday. According to our data, Thomas Pickering, the U.S.  ambassador to Moscow, was given instructions, also Wednesday, to  investigate the reasons for the diplomatic mini-scandal which  marked the trip by Nixon, who was refused his preplanned  meetings with Boris Yeltsin, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and other  high-ranking staffers of the government and the presidential  entourage. Pickering has already had contacts with the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this connection, in particular  with Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov.    According to members of Nixon's delegation, the Russian  president's statement that William Clinton had "distanced  himself from the trip" was groundless.    Official Moscow was informed on the day the ex-president  arrived in Russia, i.e. last Sunday [6 March], that Nixon would  meet with opposition leaders: Foreign Ministry staffers and  representatives of the Protocol Department of the Russian  president's apparatus were issued with the program of the visit,  listing the meetings. There was more than enough time to voice  their objections and to demand that meetings be refused. But at  that stage, so I was told by Nixon's delegation, no objections  were forthcoming.    According to data from the Nixon delegation, the  ex-president  is gradually filling the gaps resulting from the refusals to  meet with him. In particular, talks with Russian  parliamentarians are scheduled for Thursday.    Attempts to obtain official comments from Russian sources --  from the Foreign Ministry, above all -- had not met with success  by the time this issue was signed to press. On a strictly  unofficial basis some diplomats regarded the report that  Pickering had contacted Mamedov as "disinformation." It was  also pointed out that the Russian Foreign Ministry has nothing  to do with Nixon's visit. It must follow from this that the  Foreign Ministry also was not familiar with the program of  meetings in advance.</p>

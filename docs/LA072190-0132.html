			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIP GLASS AND TANIA LEON OPEN 1990 CABRILLO FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Between the 27th Cabrillo Music Festival and the 28th, which began here on  Thursday night, a major historical event intervened. It was, of course, the  devastating earthquake of Oct. 17. Still recovering and busily rebuilding,  Santa Cruz will never be the same, many of the locals say.  </P> <P> The festival, however, goes on. As longtime music director Dennis Russell  Davies said at the Prelude Concert in First Congregational Church, "We're still  here," and the 1990 festival -- 12 concerts in and around the beachfront  community through July 29 -- promises a rich continuation, in Davies' 17th  summer, of the Cabrillo traditions first established by founder-conductor  Gerhard Samuel beginning in 1963.  </P> <P> Living composers are the stream from which these traditions flow. In 1990 the  presence of three composers in residence, Philip Glass, Tania Leon and Lou  Harrison, give the 28th festival its special character.  </P> <P> The inaugural concert began with an unscheduled premiere when Davies sat at the  piano and played a piece called "Opening," which Glass reportedly wrote this  week.  </P> <P> It is a seven-minute prelude, in shifting harmonies and steady triplet-figures,  of Schubertian directness and simplicity. Davies and Glass, the  conductor-pianist told his audience, dedicate it to the people of Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> More music by Glass, the motoric "Similar Motion" (1969), in a version for four  electronic keyboards -- played by Emily Wong-George, Brenda Tom, Glass and  Davies -- concluded the program.  </P> <P> In between, an international and historical stew offered welcome hearings of  chamber pieces from both ends of this century: Carlos Chavez's "Energia"  (1925), Silvestre Revueltas' "Homenaje a Federico Garcia-Lorca" (1936), Leon's  "Parajota Delate" (1988) and the U.S. premiere of Nicolaus Huber's recent "Trio  mit Stabpandeira."  </P> <P> Davies' revival of the serious, colorful and highly individual music written by  Chavez and Revueltas before World War II had to be, like so many of Davies'  programming decisions, tonic and bracing.  </P> <P> Juxtaposing them with Leon's brief and perky birthday tribute to composer Joan  Tower and the neo-abstract gloominess of Huber's Trio -- written for and  performed here by Trio Basso, the virtuoso German ensemble of viola, cello and  double bass -- was brilliant, and ear-opening.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the Prelude Concert has been an extended presentation of musical  appetizers. In 1990, and with a special sense of history, Davies continued the  tradition, uninterrupted. In a year of trauma, the message, "We're still here,"  is touching. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

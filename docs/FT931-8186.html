			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Business magazines derecognise unions THE WAVE of union derecognition by magazine publishing companies continued yesterday with the announcement that the NUJ journalists' union and the GPMU print union will no longer be recognised at several business magazines recently acquired by the publishing group Emap. Both unions said they were considering legal action on the grounds that they had not been consulted about Emap's takeover of 14 Thomson business magazines, in breach of the European Community Acquired Rights directive. About 200 employees will be affected. Emap has derecognised unions in most parts of the organisation. Reed Elsevier, the biggest magazine publisher in Britain, and Morgan Grampian have also recently derecognised unions.</p>

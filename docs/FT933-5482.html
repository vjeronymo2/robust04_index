			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Recognition hours away, says PLO ISRAELI recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation is 'a question of days, if not hours' away, according to Mr Hakam Balawi, a top aide to Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, yesterday. Mr Balawi said from the PLO headquarters in Tunis that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were 'at the final stage before reaching a compromise for announcing official mutual recognition'. He said an historic Israeli accord on recognition would be followed immediately by US agreement to resume contacts with the PLO. Palestinian leaders in Tunis were yesterday considering the text of an announcement of recognition which, Palestinian officials in Washington said, Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, had brought back from Tel Aviv after his visit to Israel on Wednesday. Senior PLO officials in Cairo said they expected to reach agreement on recognition before signing the declaration of principles on the accord with Israel offering limited self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank. This, the officials said, could be accomplished as soon as next week in Washington. The Cairo officials said that they hoped to meet Israeli terms for recognition without making formal amendments to the Palestinian Charter, something that would require a full meeting of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile. 'Those raising issues of wanting to change the charter are simply trying to raise difficulties in the peace process,' said one PLO official. He said that Mr Arafat's renunciation of terrorism against Israel, made at the United Nations in 1988, amounted to a de facto renunciation of armed struggle against the Jewish state. The next step is likely to be a PLO announcement reiterating its renunciation of violence and the 'destruction of Israel'. Israel is then expected to announce its readiness to start open talks with the PLO. The PLO official said a 'necessary' next step would be a summit meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister and said 'contacts are being made to arrange this'. In Casablanca, Mr Arafat told reporters: 'The Palestinian state is within our grasp. Soon the Palestinian flag will fly on the walls, the minarets and the cathedrals of Jerusalem.' He was speaking after talks with King Hassan of Morocco.</p>

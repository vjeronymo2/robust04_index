Cooling-off Periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some activities may present greater manipulative concerns depending upon when they occur during the distribution process. The most critical period of the offering is the period beginning immediately before pricing and continuing until the securities have come to rest in the hands of investors (i.e., when the distribution has ended). Thus, Rule 10b&hyph;6 has incorporated the concept of ``cooling-off periods.'' Generally, distribution participants and their affiliated purchasers may continue their trading and other market activities in the covered securities until the applicable cooling-off period begins, at which point they must suspend such activity until the termination of the distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bases for applying cooling-off periods are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Restrictions on bids and purchases during the entire distribution period could unnecessarily distort the market for the offered security; and (2) The effects on the offered security's price resulting from distribution participants' market activities should dissipate within a period of time. The cooling-off periods thus are intended to permit supply and demand forces independent of the market activities of persons with manipulative incentives to establish the market price of the covered securities at the time the offering is priced and when they are being sold to investors. The cooling-off periods also provide guidance to distribution participants as to what period of time is required between the cessation of their market activities (which may have increased or maintained the market price of, or involved substantial trading activity in, the covered securities) and sales to investors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In this context, rather than requiring individual broker-dealers or syndicate managers to determine when to taper off and cease their market activities, the rule supplies uniform guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3056 (October 27, 1941), 11 FR 10984 (Opinion of SEC General Counsel).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 10b&hyph;6 uses market-related criteria to fix the lengths of the cooling-off periods, which are two, five, and nine business days prior to the ``commencement of offers and sales'' in the distribution. For stock with a minimum share price of $5.00 and a public float of at least 400,000 shares (``$5/400,000 Share Test''), the cooling-off period is two business days. For all other securities, the cooling-off period is nine business days. A minimum price per share requirement was viewed as an appropriate criterion in light of the generally greater volatility of low-priced stocks, while a public float standard was viewed as providing a reasonable indication of the depth and liquidity of the market for a security. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission also considered a test based on the security's price and public float as having ``the advantage of being relatively certain and easily determinable.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraphs (a)(4)(v), (xi), and (xii).

A five business day cooling-off period applies to the exercise of standardized call options on securities satisfying the $5/400,000 Share Test, if such options were acquired after the person exercising the option became a distribution participant. This cooling-off period is intended to minimize the probability that purchases of the underlying security resulting from options exercises would occur during the two business day cooling-off period. No cooling-off period is available for inducements to purchase. No cooling-off period is applied to unsolicited principal transactions: the restriction on such activity begins as of the commencement of offers or sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is aware of the perception that by curtailing distribution participant activity, even with the availability of cooling-off periods, the rule can affect adversely the ``normal'' trading market for a security. Because of this concern, the Commission recently adopted an exception to Rule 10b&hyph;6 and a companion Rule 10b&hyph;6A permitting ``passive market making'' (i.e., transactions that follow, but do not lead, the market) by Nasdaq market makers participating in distributions of Nasdaq securities satisfying the $5/400,000 Share Test. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(4)(xiv) and 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;6A, respectively.

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: DIRECTOR O'BRIEN STEPS OUT ON  CENTER STAGE FOR 'LETTERS'  </P> <P> It's been 21 years since he last performed on stage, but Jack O'Brien,  director, has decided to take a chance on Jack O'Brien, actor, in the Old Globe  production of A.R. Gurney's "Love Letters."  </P> <P> O'Brien, who wears a third hat as artistic director of the Old Globe Theatre,  plays the part of Andrew Makepeace Ladd III, opposite Michael Learned's Melissa  Gardner through Sunday. There will be no performance today.  </P> <P> When told that many people around town have expressed interest in checking out  his performance, he laughed.  </P> <P> "There's a touch of vindictiveness in that, I think," he said last week as he  was preparing for the part. "Now that my parents are dead, I can't imagine  anyone coming to it."  </P> <P> But come they did, filling the Old Globe main stage to near capacity on a  Monday night. It wasn't the most memorable performance this critic has seen of  this love story -- the reading was more intelligent and charming than  passionate -- but the fans applauded loud and long.  </P> <P> The last time O'Brien set foot on stage -- in 1969 -- also was at the Old Globe  Theatre. But that was the unplanned result of an accident. The actor hired to  play Dromio of Syracuse in "A Comedy of Errors" dropped out suddenly. O'Brien,  who was directing the play, knew the part and therefore felt called upon to  step in for the actor, performing opposite Christopher Walken, Sada Thompson  and Jonathan McMurtry.  </P> <P> It did not seem like such a departure for O'Brien to act at the time. He had  considered himself an actor all through his college and early post-college  years, he said.  </P> <P> "I had a big singing voice for musical comedy. I thought of myself as a viable  commodity until I looked in a mirror and saw my hair going south with my  career."  </P> <P> He also made a discovery about himself during his stint in "A Comedy of  Errors." He was getting the job done -- well, as he recalls -- but he wasn't  enjoying it.  </P> <P> "I knew how to do it. I knew how to get the laughs. But I was frightened and  unhappy, and it wasn't right for me. I was terrified to go on stage. Every  entrance was traumatic. But I love to direct, and I love to watch actors work."  </P> <P> Still, 21 years has a way of diluting fears, O'Brien said. He was drawn to the  material in Gurney's "Love Letters" in much the same way he was drawn to the  playwright's "The Cocktail Hour," which O'Brien directed in 1988, and the  upcoming "The Snow Ball," which he will direct in 1991. O'Brien said that  putting himself in an actor's shoes tests "those instincts I'm operating from  in terms of supporting actors."  </P> <P> And, most importantly, he was looking forward to having a good time.  </P> <P> "I'm older, more experienced, and I know what I am and what I can do and what I  can't do. I don't think anyone is taking this seriously. It's Jack's big  adventure. I just hope it's Jack's excellent adventure."  </P></p>

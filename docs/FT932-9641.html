			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC positive about Nafta agreement THE EC has given a broadly positive response to the North American Free Trade Agreement, while reserving the right to take steps to redress potential unfair trading practices. The European Commission yesterday approved a study of the Nafta agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. The positive reaction was expected and matches the Commission's desire to avoid trade frictions with the US as it attempts to reach a successful conclusion of the Gatt Uruguay round by the end of the year. The study also concludes that the EC's political relationship with Mexico will be affected by the free trade area. 'As the Nafta draws Mexico more closely into the North American orbit, Mexico's relationship with the EC may gain importance as a counterweight' mainly because of the likely dynamic impact on the Mexican economy and its population. The report identifies, however, a number of areas where it believes the Nafta agreement could lead to a loss of EC market share in the US and Canada. Financial services and insurance: The principal problem is the possibility that Nafta privileges could be limited to companies with majority holdings based inside the Nafta area. This would be a 'very important and unjustified discrimination' against EC-controlled subsidiaries in North America. Rules of origin: The EC raises concerns about rules applying to cars and textiles which are more restrictive than in Europe even if they are not actually contradictory to Gatt. Services: The Commission warns that a failure to reach a Gatt agreement covering services could lead to substantial shifts of business to the disadvantage of the EC. This applies particularly to potential business in Mexico. Farm products: The EC could suffer in sectors such as milk products, sugar and meat exports to the Mexican market. It is particularly worried about a clause raising Mexican barriers to the same level as the US after a six-year period. Despite these worries, the Commission says the net effect of the Nafta agreement is likely to be globally positive and ought to lead to a big boost in trade with the EC. The report concludes that if trade relations are more restrictive after the sig-nature of the Nafta agreement, it should tackle these questions within the Gatt framework.</p>

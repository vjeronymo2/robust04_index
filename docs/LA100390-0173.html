			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING IT WORK;  </P> <P> WAYS TO IMPROVE ON A TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FATHER  </P> <P> If your relationship with your father is distant and you yearn to be closer,  stop dwelling on what could have been, advises Irvine psychologist Jane Myers  Drew. To make peace in a troubled relationship and move on, she recommends:  </P> <P> * Acknowledge the ways in which you feel you have been hurt or deprived.  </P> <P> * Get past these negatives by expressing your feelings either indirectly or by  talking or writing to your father if you feel ready to confront him.  </P> <P> * Accept your father as he is.  </P> <P> * Rework your relationship with him, which may mean spending more time together  or, if he is abusive, less.  </P> <P> * Forgive him for hurting you, and forgive yourself if you are feeling guilty.  </P> <P> * Give back to him in some way that makes you feel good.  </P> <P> * Look for the positive in him.  </P> <P> * Respect him for doing his best. SHERRY ANGEL  </P></p>

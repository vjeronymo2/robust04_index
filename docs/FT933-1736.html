			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Man behind Bart Simpson holds key to QVC bid - A look the choice facing shareholders in the Dollars 9.5bn takeover contest for Paramount THE Dollars 9.5bn takeover bid launched by QVC Network for Paramount Communications on Monday is riding on the reputation of a single man: Mr Barry Diller, the entertainment industry executive behind television and film hits ranging from The Simpsons cartoon series to the Indiana Jones adventure movies. When Mr Diller, one of the most respected figures in Hollywood, took a large personal stake in QVC nine months ago and joined the business as chairman and chief executive, he sparked a remarkable rise in the shares of this humdrum cable television home-shopping company. Mr Diller made clear not only that he saw an extremely exciting future for home shopping, but that he intended to build QVC into a much broader based company which would capitalise on the vast opportunities of the impending age of interactive multi-media home entertainment. The bid for Paramount, with assets ranging from the Paramount Pictures film studios to the Prentice Hall book publishing company, represents a huge leap towards Mr Diller's goal. It has been made possible by the strength of QVC's share price, which rose from around Dollars 38 when Mr Diller came aboard last December to a year's high of Dollars 73 and stood at Dollars 56 1/8, up Dollars 1/8, at the close yesterday. The hostile QVC offer for Paramount consists largely of stock, with some element of cash - as does that from rival bidder Viacom, the cable business best known for its MTV pop music channel, which made an agreed offer nine days ago. Wall Street analysts think this is just the start of a bidding war involving these two companies and, possibly, other large US and foreign media groups, which could involve much larger doses of cash. But for now, the strength of the two bids depends largely on the price Wall Street accords QVC and Viacom shares, and that largely depends on perceptions of the value the bidders would add to the Paramount business. The 51-year-old Mr Diller has the advantage of one of Hollywood's most distinguished creative records. A drop-out from the University of California, he got his start in show business in the mailroom of the William Morris talent agency, and then became an agent himself. He made his name as a programmer at the ABC network in the early 1970s, and from 1974 to 1984 headed the Paramount studios, quitting to join Mr Rupert Murdoch's nascent Fox TV network after repeated clashes with Mr Martin Davis, the then new chairman of Paramount Communications. (One of the many ironies of the QVC bid is the opportunity it could give Mr Diller to oust Mr Davis, his old adversary.) He left Mr Murdoch's News International empire in February last year, wanting a company of his own to run, and after nine months of casting around found it at QVC - a choice which amazed an entertainment industry which regarded home shopping as little more than a butt for jokes. QVC's other leading shareholders are two important cable television companies, Comcast and Liberty Media, which are enthusiastically backing the Paramount bid, pumping Dollars 1bn into QVC through an issue of convertible stock. QVC runs a 24-hour live cable channel over which it sells goods ranging from jewellery through collectibles to cookware. Mr Diller first gained an insight into its potential when he visited its studios with Diane Von Furstenberg, the fashion designer, who amazed him by selling Dollars 1.2m of dresses in just 100 minutes of airtime. Futurists have been forecasting for years that home shopping is going to be a huge business, yet throughout the 1980s it failed to take off. Now, however, Mr Diller may have caught a breaking wave. QVC is already growing strongly, with first-half revenues up 18 per cent to Dollars 536m and underlying earnings up 57 per cent to Dollars 30.9m. Early next year, it will add a new, more contemporary home shopping service, called Q2, to add to its two shopping and fashion channels. It is also in the throes of a stock swap merger with its chief rival, Home Shopping Network. QVC, which reaches some 47m US homes, targets the upper end of the market, while Home Shopping, with 60m homes, is more down-market. However, there have been rumblings that some Home Shopping directors are unhappy at the merger terms, and the Paramount bid could sideline this deal. However big the promise of home shopping, it will be just one entertainment/information segment in a multi-media industry which could offer consumers hundreds of television channels. For all the technological advances which make this possible, the key to attracting viewers will be entertainment 'software' of the kind Mr Diller produces so well. Yet Viacom too has shown itself to be on the cutting edge of popular entertainment. The choice facing Wall Street is between the man behind Bart Simpson and the company ultimately responsible for the latest US teenage fad - two peurile MTV cartoon characters called Beavis and Butt-head.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Channel 4 seeks legal guidance Channel 4 is seeking legal guidance on whether a parish council can take the company to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission over allegations that a programme unfairly and unjustly branded a local community as harbouring dangerous racists. The company was yesterday given leave to seek a High Court ruling that the commission has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint from Elmton-with-Creswell parish council in Derbyshire. Mr Justice Auld said he had some doubts about the application but 'just about on balance' there was an arguable case. Mr Jonathan Caplan QC, for Channel 4, said any programme involving allegations of disreputable behaviour in a particular area would give rise to 'a whole host of potentially admissible complaints' if the commission were allowed to hear the case. The action stems from a programme in The Brief legal series broadcast in March concerning a private member's bill on racism and racial violence being debated in the Commons. As part of its report the programme looked at an ethnic minority family. The parish council said the programme 'gave the impression that there is a serious racial problem within the community', which it denied. Scottish TV results, Page 21</p>

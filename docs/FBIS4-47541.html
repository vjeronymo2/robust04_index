Potapnev, Ye.V. Ruksha, Scientific Research </F> Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion at the Belarussian  Republic Ministry of Public Health, Minsk; UDC 57.083.3]    [Abstract] The limitations on using immune donor  B-lymphocytes (due to a limited range of antigens or pathogens  allowed for human immunization) which produce antibodies of a  given specificity--the first stage in human monoclonal antibody  production--and known advantages of in vitro  immunization prompted attempts to engineer a human hybridoma  which produces antibodies to the staphylococcal anatoxin (SA)  and examine the optimum conditions for in vitro human  lymphocyte immunization. To this end, the blood of healthy  donors without the specific antibodies to the staphylococcal  anatoxin according to the rabbit blood erythrocyte hemolysis  reaction was used. The procedure of in vitro  immunization of human peripheral blood cells with the  staphylococcal anatoxin was improved using lymphocytes separated  from monocytes and cytokins, i.e., interleukin-2 products. The  immunized human lymphocytes were subsequently used for  constructing a heterohybridoma whereby B-enriched fraction cells  were fused with the mice myeloma. An ELISA method was developed  for assessing the secreted specific antibodies and an ELISPOT  method--for determining the antibody-producing cells. The  findings confirm the expediency of in vitro  immunization for obtaining hybridomata which are producers of  human MCAs to microbial antigens. The authors are grateful to  Zh.A. Strezh and A.V. Voznyuk for biotesting of the IL-2 and  IL-6 activity and to V.D. Zobnin for phenotype research  assistance. Figures 1; tables 2; references 15: 3 Russian, 12  Western.</p>

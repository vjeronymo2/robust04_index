			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Vernes pulls out of talks with Nestle MR JEAN-MARC Vernes, the French financier, yesterday announced he had withdrawn from negotiations with Nestle, the Swiss food group, to buy part of the Vichy mineral water business. Nestle was last summer instructed by the European Commission to sell a number of the mineral water brands, including Vichy and Saint Yorre, that it had acquired in its bruising bid battle for Perrier, one of France's best-known water companies. Mr Vernes, chairman of the Vernes bank and the SCI investment concern, had been discussing the possible purchase of some of the brands under the Vichy umbrella, together with Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian businessman who is involved with SCI. However Mr Vernes said in an interview with La Tribune Desfosses, the French financial newspaper, that he had halted the negotiations. He also indicated that he might be interested in investing in some of the state-controlled companies which may be privatised after the March legislative elections. Nestle said yesterday it was continuing discussions with other parties over the sale of Vichy and Saint Yorre, although it stressed the talks were still at a preliminary stage.</p>

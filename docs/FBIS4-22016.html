			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Khovratovich report on interview with Russian </F> Interior Minister Viktor Yerin in Istanbul; date of interview  not given; published under the "This Colorful World. TRUD  Correspondents Report" rubric: "Together Against Terrorism"]    [Text] Istanbul -- Russian Interior Minister Viktor  Yerin's visit to Turkey was mainly devoted to joint actions in  the fight against national and international terrorism.    In an interview with your correspondent Yerin stated that  the  visit had been successful because it had been possible to  discuss all pressing problems of concern to both the Russian and  the Turkish side. They are primarily drug smuggling, the  illegal trade in firearms, and the fight against terrorism.  Special attention was devoted to the last question because a  bilateral agreement on it between Russia and Turkey is being  prepared.    During the talks, the minister recounted, the Turkish side  raised the question of "Russia's moral support for the actions  of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan, which is banned in Turkey."  A conference of Kurds which took place a month ago in Moscow  was cited as an example. However, it was explained to the  Turkish side that the conference was of a purely scientific  nature and that, most importantly, the aforementioned party had  nothing to do with it.    Back in 1992, during the Turkish interior minister's visit  to  Moscow, Russia and Turkey signed an agreement envisaging the  possibility of an exchange of specific operational information  about people justifiably suspected of committing crimes. During  the preparations for the current visit to Turkey, Yerin said, a  list of Russians who might commit crimes on Turkish territory  was compiled and handed over to the Turkish side.</p>

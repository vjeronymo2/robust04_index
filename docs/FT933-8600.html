			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Wereldhave chairman resigns WERELDHAVE, the second-largest property company in the Netherlands after Rodamco, said its managing board chairman Mr Meindert Kooistra was resigning. The group cited differences of opinion with the supervisory board about company policy and structure. Mr Gijs Verweij, the company's second board member, will assume his duties while a search is made for a new member of the board. At a later stage a decision will be taken on which of the two board members will become chairman, a company spokesman said. He declined to be drawn on the reasons for Mr Kooistra's departure. Wereldhave's shares did not react to news of the resignation, closing unchanged on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange at Fl 111.20. Mr Kooistra joined Wereldhave as its chairman in 1990 after the similarly abrupt departure of his predecessor, Mr Onno Huskens, who had spearheaded the company's successful hostile takeover of Peachey Properties of the UK in 1988. Koninklijke Frans Maas, the Dutch road transport group, warned that its 1993 result would be worse than forecast, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. Frans Maas had said in January that 1993 profits would be much lower than the Fl 36.5m (Dollars 18.83m) posted in 1992. The company said the recession in Europe would have a bigger impact on the turnover and results than was expected at the beginning of the year. In January, Frans Maas, 32 per cent owned by KLM, said it expected profits to fall because of lower income from customs activities.</p>

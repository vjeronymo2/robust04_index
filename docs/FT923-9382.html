			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / NatWest profits recover sharply: Second-biggest UK clearer rises 109% despite record losses on lending NATIONAL Westminster Bank's profits recovered sharply in the first half of the year, even though its losses on UK lending remained at record levels. The second-biggest UK clearing bank, as measured by the value of its assets, also said it expected staff numbers to reduce by 5,000 this year and a similar number next year. The departures of two senior executives were announced yesterday. Sir Geoffrey Littler, chairman of NatWest's merchant bank, County NatWest, and Mr John Drury, County's chief executive, are leaving. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said that Sir Geoffrey and Mr Drury 'decided that there would be no long-term role for them'. NatWest's pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 increased 109 per cent to Pounds 211m, which was also Pounds 101m more than it made in the whole of last year. Its bad debt charge fell from Pounds 902m to Pounds 864m. However, within this total charge, the loan losses suffered by the UK high street banking business increased from Pounds 556m to Pounds 638m. Lord Alexander blamed these losses on the bank's relatively high exposure to the small business lending market - where it has a market share of almost a third - and also on the bank's disproportionate presence in the south-east of England, the region hit hardest by the recession. NatWest has around Pounds 11bn of loans to small businesses and in the past couple of years has set aside about Pounds 1bn as provisions against losses on these loans. However, Mr Derek Wanless, the newly appointed chief executive, said that the bank had no plans to reduce its share of this market though it has been striving to charge small business customers more. Last year, NatWest increased the margin on small business lending - the difference between the lending rate and NatWest's funding rate - by 0.5 per cent and this margin has widened slightly since then. NatWest pushed up profits before loan losses from Pounds 984m to Pounds 1.092bn. It bucked the trend set by rivals Lloyds and Midland, which announced results last week, by increasing non-interest income or earnings from bankings commissions and fees and from sales of insurance products. These non-interest earnings rose 12 per cent. Much of the rise came from an increase in the tariffs paid by customers and also from an improvement in the rate of collecting these tariffs, thanks to the installation of a computer system which made it easier to monitor when charges are payable. On the other hand, interest income fell slightly for two reasons: The volume of interest-earning loans held by NatWest has fallen; There has been a rise in the value of loans classified as non-performing. Operating costs barely changed at Pounds 2.11bn. Within these costs, personnel expenses fell marginally. Since December, staff numbers have fallen by 3,100, in spite of the creation of 1,100 new jobs. Excluding the creation of new jobs, around 3,000 jobs were lost in the UK high street branches alone. Mr Derek Wanless said the scale of job losses was likely to remain close to this rate in the coming 18 months. The dividend has been maintained at 6.125p out of earnings of 8p against 5p a share.

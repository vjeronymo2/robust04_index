			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagasaki, June 20 KYODO -- The frequency of port  calls in western Japan by U.S. nuclear-powered submarines has  increased recently, apparently reflecting the tension over North  Korea's suspected nuclear program, Maritime Self-Defense Force  sources said Monday [20 June].    The vessels may have approached North Korean coasts to  investigate Pyongyang's military communications and various  types of radio waves, the sources said.    Nuclear-powered attack submarines of the U.S. Navy made a  record 17 calls last year at White Beach port in Japan's  southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, according to local  authorities.    Such U.S. Submarines called at sasebo port in nagasaki  prefecture, southwestern Japan, 10 times in 1993, close to a  record 11 calls the previous year, the authorities said.    Already this year, sasebo port has received visits by such  submarines on nine occasions, they said.    Yokosuka port in kanagawa prefecture, eastern Japan, had  received the largest number of calls by such vessels in the  past, but saw only 15 visits last year, about half the annual  figures of 1989 and 1991, they said.    Recently, many submarines have made port calls for only an  hour or so on each visit, informed sources said, apparently to  hand over data and fetch equipment needed for further  information gathering.</p>

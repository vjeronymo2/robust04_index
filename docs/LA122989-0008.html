			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES' 3RD AREA CODE  </P> <P> The plan by the telephone companies to add a third area code to the Los Angeles  area sparked controversy even before the ink was dry on the newspapers carrying  the story (Part A, Dec. 13). Demographic problems by businesses, the needs to  change stationery and other issues, many unknown at this time could give rise  to actions including lawsuits by irate customers.  </P> <P> Both telephone companies cite an expansion in services arising from  high-technology advances as the cause. Consumer use of cellular telephones, fax  machines, beepers and modems is involved, not to mention an increase in the  population.  </P> <P> While Pacific Bell and GTE may be correct in their assessment, there is an  alternative to allay the fears of those affected and at the same time  ameliorate the utilities' problems. Why not apply the 310 area code to the new  high-tech users; cellular phones, beepers, faxes, etc. The logistics should be  no worse than those of the 800, 900 and 976 area codes.  </P> <P> BEN URMAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries Try as it might, Lucas cannot disguise the disappointment in its first half results. Exchange rate movements accounted for nearly all the 12 per cent increase in sales as well as a large chunk of the Pounds 7.8m increase in operating profit. Demand for the company's products is sagging and prices are under pressure. Lucas insists that its rationalisation is proceeding apace, but the full benefits are still years away. Meanwhile, the company continues to eat up cash. Details are scant but it is a measure of the extent to which debt rose in the first half that the interest charge increased in spite of a Pounds 4.1m benefit from termination of an interest rate swap contract. Lucas needs the income from disposals to meet the continuing cash costs of restructuring and to pay its dividend. The logical response would be to cut the dividend. But Lucas is obviously worried about a bid. This gives the shares some support. Either Lucas struggles through, in which case the yield of nearly 7 per cent is attractive. Or it fails and a predator snaps it up. Such an assumption may be rash, though. Lucas has come late to restructuring, but a predator might not do any better in today's difficult markets. Lucas may yet have to cut its dividend and still end up fending for itself. Curiously the bid speculation is fuelled above all by the company's own behaviour: the outside world is strangely silent.</p>

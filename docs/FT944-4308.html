			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Western German growth speeds up Western German economic growth continued to speed up in the third quarter, raising concern about renewed inflationary pressures next year and damping speculation about a further cut in interest rates. The rise of 1.5 per cent (adjusted) in gross domestic product over the second quarter was more than expected, one cause being a surprise improvement in private consumption. The increase over the 1993 third quarter was 2.4 per cent, after annual rises of 2.2 per cent in the first quarter and 2.3 per cent in the second, the federal statistics office said. Mr Stephen King, economist at UK stockbroker James Capel, said growth should easily exceed 3 per cent next year. 'The policy implications of this (GDP) release are clear,' he added. 'There is no room for the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates further.' Instead, the central bank council, which left rates unchanged yesterday, should be looking seriously at higher rates in the first half of 1995. Although some economists still favour one more cut in the discount and lombard rates (now at 4.5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively) before these move up again, support for anti-inflationary increases next year is hardening. Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, said the rise in economic growth should close the gap between actual and potential GDP in 1995. Inflation should ease to around 2 per cent in the first half *something in here (HP) * before edging up again. 'The strong 1994 economic rebound, which continues to outpace expectations, renders further Bundesbank easing unnecessary and unlikely.' Reflecting the brighter economic picture, the unemployment figures in Germany's two halves improved last month. For the first time since June 1991, the eastern total fell below 1m, cutting the jobless rate to 13 per cent from 13.3 per cent in October. The western rate was unchanged at 7.9 per cent. To help underpin the economic upturn by improving incomes of the less well-off, the government announced plans to simplify the tax system and raise the tax-free minimum income level. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said income tax levels for the less well-off would be reduced to strength-en economic growth and stimulate purchasing power. Tax-free income levels will rise from DM5,600 (Pounds 2,276) a year to over DM12,000 for a single person. Tax levels above DM12,000 will also be cut to simplify the fiscal system and stimulate consumer spending. Those earning DM13,000 will have their tax reduced by about 28 per cent of what they now pay; those earning DM20,000 will pay 26 per cent less; at DM50,000 they will pay 2.4 per cent less; and at DM122,364 1.8 per cent less. The top rate stays 53 per cent. Frankfurt brushes up its act, Page 16</p>

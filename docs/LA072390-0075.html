			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> UNITED WAY GIVES OUT $3.75 MILLION  </P> <P> An AIDS information and referral service and a literacy program are among 64  health and human services agencies that will receive $3.75 million next year  from United Way of Ventura County, officials said.  </P> <P> The agencies were selected by a panel of 150 volunteers who spent nine months  screening applications, said Alex Jestrab, associate executive director of  United Way.  </P> <P> Laubach Literacy, an Oxnard-based literacy program, and AIDS Care, an  information and referral service, will each receive $14,000 from United Way, he  said. It was the first time that the agencies had applied for United Way funds.  </P> <P> Two other organizations that had previously received funding -- Community  Service Organization of Ventura County and Travelers Aid Assn. of America --  did not seek funds this year, Jestrab said.  </P> <P> The 64 agencies funded this year provide a range of services, including  counseling, youth development, health care, child-abuse intervention and  prevention, domestic violence shelters, and drug- and alcohol-abuse programs.  </P> <P> The largest allocation of $361,500 went to the American Red Cross of Ventura  County.  </P> <P> Those funds will be used to support the agency's counseling services and will  provide aid to local disaster victims, Jestrab said.  </P> <P> To qualify for funding, agencies must be established at least two years, have  broad community support and nonprofit status, Jestrab said.  </P> <P> Last year, 64 agencies received $3.5 million from United Way.

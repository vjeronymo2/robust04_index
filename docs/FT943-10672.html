			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Protests banned in East Timor Indonesia's military has banned protests in East Timor ahead of a planned trip by Japanese MPs and journalists - the first visit by foreigners since police broke up demonstrations last month, Reuter reports from Jakarta. In mid-July troops used teargas and sticks to disperse hundreds of mostly Roman Catholic protesters. About 20 people were injured. Indonesia has been widely criticised for its invasion of East Timor after the Portuguese, the former rulers, left in 1975 and a formal annexation.</p>

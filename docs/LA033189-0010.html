			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> 3 TODDLERS ALMOST DROWN  </P> <P> Three toddlers were in critical condition after nearly drowning when they fell  into a pool at a North Tustin home where they were under the care of a baby  sitter. The children were identified as Jonathon Derek Weston, 22 months;  Melissa Dianne Polsfoot, 19 months, and Arthur Matthew Griese, 14 months.  Doctors said they would know within 72 hours whether any had suffered permanent  brain damage. Authorities immediately launched an investigation into the  baby-sitting arrangement at the home of Orvel Brooks. County social worker  Karen Rater joined sheriff's deputies in the investigation but said it had not  been determined if Brooks or a member of his family had, or needed, a license  to care for the children. One unidentified mother left the house distraught,  asking herself: "How did he get in the pool? There was a six-foot fence!"  Deputies released no information on how the toddlers fell into the pool, or how  long they were in the water before Brooks found them.  </P></p>

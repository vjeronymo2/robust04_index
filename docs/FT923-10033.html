			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: BT ebullient after disappointing results - The Bottom Line FOR A company which reported its first quarter-on-quarter decline in sales since 1984, coupled with a 27.8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, BT was in a surprisingly ebullient mood this week. It was as if the telecommunications company was relieved to report a fall in profits and sales after running into so much criticism in the past for its unseemly profit increases. However, it was not the avoidance of political criticism that relieved BT. It was the fact that the results could be used as further proof, that the present regulatory regime is tough enough. Oftel has told BT to cut the price of a basket of its basic services each year by inflation minus 7.5 percentage points, compared with 6.25 points at present. The company has also been told to ensure small retail customers share in the price cuts. BT's believes its first quarter results, which saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 825m to Pounds 596m on sales of Pounds 3.27bn, down from Pounds 3.34bn, shows that the company is having a hard enough time under the existing price regime. BT's shareholders no doubt see the point. A comparison of its shares with those of Cable &amp; Wireless, the international telecommunications group, relative to the FT-Allshare over the last eight years, shows BT's shares underperforming those of its rival. Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, said the proposed price regime was 'extremely tough by any standard', and many of the detailed provisions would add to the proposals' negative impact on BT. If BT fails to agree with Oftel, the only course available to the company is to allow the matter to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Both BT and Oftel have recently talked privately about doing so. The MMC has the power to impose a solution. However, given that as BT and Oftel have threatened to go to the MMC several times in the past, the present dispute seems to point to the two sides' tough negotiating stances rather than a total breakdown of talks. What is clear is that Oftel, in spite of BT's disappointing result, will not negotiate over its price regime. It points out that it is not due to come into effect until August next year and then it would remain unchanged for four years. Furthermore, while BT's results showed the effects of the recession, particularly on inland call volumes which fell by three per cent over the past three months, the profits were affected by non-recessionary factors. There was the exceptional charge of Pounds 135m mainly relating to the loss on its divestment of its interests in Mitel Corporation, the troubled Canadian telephone equipment maker. Then there was Pounds 56m of redundancy costs relating to the voluntary retirement of 29,000 people. BT has decided to cuts its workforce down to a size comparable with its competitors in the US. At beginning of the financial year the workforce was 210,500. By 1996 the figure could be reduced to 120,000. It was no surprise to many telecommunication analysts that BT decided to speed up that process in the run-up to the new regulatory price regime. It did not go unnoticed at Oftel that BT's cost cutting exercise, which affected this quarter's results, will increase the company's profitability in the future. As far as Oftel is concerned BT's results showed a very healthy and robust telecommunications company performing well in a recession. Instead of asking how BT would fare under a tougher regulatory regime its poses a different question. 'Just think how BT would fare if there was no recession?' By next August 1993, when the proposed regulatory price regime is due to come into effect, the worse of the recession may be over.</p>

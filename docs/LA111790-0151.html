			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMITH PLANNING TO CHALLENGE ABSENTEE BALLOTS STATEWIDE  </P> <P> Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith on Friday dropped his  court battle to halt the count of more than 50,000 absentee ballots in Orange  County.  </P> <P> But Smith, who trails Republican Dan Lungren by just under 10,000 votes out of  more than 7 million cast statewide, said he is still determined to pursue a  legal challenge of more than 500,000 absentee ballots from last week's  election.  </P> <P> "Instead of litigating it twice, we're going to litigate it once," said Smith's  campaign manager, Marc Dann.  </P> <P> The Smith campaign has charged that the Republican Party may have improperly  submitted applications for absentee ballots on behalf of voters. To remedy the  situation, Smith's attorneys will ask at a hearing scheduled for Nov. 30 that  most absentee ballots be invalidated, an action that would apparently turn the  election in favor of Smith.  </P> <P> On Friday, an Orange County Superior Court judge, acting at Smith's request,  lifted a temporary restraining order that prevented Orange County Registrar of  Voters Donald Tanney from counting absentee ballots unless his office  specifically checked for fraud in the applications for absentee ballots.  </P> <P> After the hearing, Tanney said he would begin processing the ballots  immediately without the anti-fraud safeguards sought by Smith.  </P> <P> The count, which is expected to add to Lungren's lead, is likely to be  concluded on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Smith's attorney, Allan H. Stokke, told reporters that Tanney's actions are  "clearly contrary to the Election Code." But rather than fight Orange County  specifically, Stokke said, a more expansive lawsuit against Secretary of State  March Fong Eu's office would be more productive.  </P> <P> Stokke said the Smith suit would rely on a court affidavit filed this week by  Eu's elections division chief which acknowledges that her office advises county  registrars across California not to bother comparing the signatures on absentee  applications with those on returned ballots or on voters' original affidavits  of registration.  </P> <P> Smith, the district attorney of San Francisco, had led Lungren, a former  five-term congressman, by almost 29,000 votes when the statewide absentee  ballot count began. But Lungren steadily closed the gap, passing Smith on  Wednesday and declaring victory on Thursday.  </P> <P> Smith has refused to concede and is considering an unprecedented statewide  recount if the margin remains close.  </P></p>

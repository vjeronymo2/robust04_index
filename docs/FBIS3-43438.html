In a memo to the  delegation Mr Buthelezi said "the political power bases of  minorities must be constitutionally entrenched by means of a  federal system".    Otherwise, he said, "the successful majority will destroy  the  political power bases of minorities, thereby preventing forever  that a minority could become a majority in the future".    Mr Buthelezi said he was meeting the Americans at a time  when  "some of the most important decisions in the history of the IFP"  would be taken. He was referring to the party's Central  Committee meeting which got underway after he received the  Americans on Friday morning.    Mr Buthelezi defended the IFP's stance towards negotiations  in South Africa, telling the Americans that "no concessions have  been made to accommodate the Freedom Alliance or the IFP". He  alleged that during talks his party's inputs were "constantly  ignored", demands "sidelined", and concerns "silenced".  "Manipulation and arrogance characterised the process leaving no  space for true negotiations with us."    Mr Buthelezi added that during negotiations "we dramatically  reduced our original demands without being met by corresponding  efforts from our counterparts."</p>

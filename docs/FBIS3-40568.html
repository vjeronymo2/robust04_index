			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nusrat Mirza: "The Kashmir Issue and the United </F> States and China"]    [Text] The U.S. State Department's demand that "China  should also leave Kashmir" has surprised many people. This has  made the situation even more complicated, and it also shows that  the United States is taking a keen interest in this issue. The  question is, why? However, the first question is: Is China  really occupying a part of Kashmir? Both Pakistan and China have  declared that China has not taken over any part of Kashmir. The  Americans say that Pakistan had given this part of Kashmir to  China according to an agreement between the two countries.  Although, there was an agreement over border between Pakistan  and China, it is not clear if Pakistan did ([word missing]).  Then what do these words of the U.S. spokesman mean? There is no  proof of Gilgit and Hunza being part of Kashmir for the last 100  years.    One thing, however, is clear. The United States is  increasingly interested in the Kashmir issue. Does it:    1. Want to complicate the issue or is it increasing pressure  on China to make this issue a defense topic?    2. Talk about the third option or Kashmir's independence so  that it can control this region later [for the following  reasons]?    i. it can keep eyes on Pakistan, China and India. It can,  at least, control India and Pakistan this way.    ii. it wants to establish its control over this beautiful  region so it can be used as a "recreation" and "rest" area in  Asia for the Americans. iii. perhaps it wants to  keep its eyes on Central Asia and Russia and add the northern  region presently under Pakistan to it. The borders of Pakistan  and China meet here and the Americans have mentioned it.    iv. it is possible that there are special minerals in this  region and only the United States knows about it and wants to  mine them.    v. As the only superpower in the world, it wants to control  the Himalayas, the greatest mountain range in the world, and has  the control of the roof of the world, Siachen.    vi. There might be another reason which we do not know.    Kashmir is definitely beautiful and is known as the heaven  on  earth. There are many other regions and areas in the world which  are unique in their beauty, but one cannot take over all the  beautiful regions. Its beauty is an additional asset. The most  important issue could be its strategic location. It can become a  central place to control Pakistan, India, China, Russia, Central  Asia, Afghanistan, and Iran or at least can be used to keep an  eye on all these countries. Pakistan had, after all, allowed the  United States to establish its military base at Badpir in this  region which the United States used to keep an eye on Russia and  China. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, it has got  some time to make preparations before Russia is ready again. God  has given the United States this opportunity to become the only  superpower in the world. It will use it to scare other  countries, especially Pakistan, and also convince India since it  is sure of its success. Additionally, the United States is very  interested in China and Japan. Japan, because of its economic  growth, poses a challenge to the United States and it is trying  to end its "economic superpower" status. It appears that the  United States is implementing its plans now. It is possible  that, at a time when it has no danger from anywhere and is not  very busy, it will freeze Japanese assets to make it helpless or  take Japanese economic affairs in its own hands. Similarly,  China is also on its list because it has not submitted to it  like Russia did. At present it is making China go through the  same phase as Pakistan and is providing it American equipment,  weapons, computers, and loans among other things. The United  States has put it, just like Pakistan, in the favored nation  clause, and is pressuring it over the human rights issue. It  appears to be ready to close its options ([blank]) and curtail  its rights. In the past when China was behind the Iron Curtain,  or the United States was after China or it was busy in the war  between North and South Korea and China was surrounded from all  sides, Pakistan was the only route that China could use to  contact other countries in the world.    Pakistan has started the PIA [Pakistan International  Airlines] flights between Beijing and Islamabad or Karachi and  introduced China to the United States. Pakistan had to face  great pressure and problems in this effort. China has always  stood by Pakistan in difficult times. That is why the friendship  between China and Pakistan is still very strong. All kinds of  conspiracies are afoot to weaken it. The construction of the  Silk Highway between Pakistan and China has connected the two  countries and made ground travel between them possible in all  seasons. It has been commonly argued in Pakistan that the United  States considers this connection by ground a block in its  efforts and wants to remove it. Now that the State Department  spokesman has involved China in the Kashmir issue, it is  definite that the United States wants to break up this ground  connection between China and Pakistan, and wants to separate  these two countries. Many other efforts are also being made in  this connection. For example, Chinese engineers working in  Pakistan were abducted many times. There was a lot of unrest in  Xianjiang over religious awakening there, and efforts were made  to blame Pakistan for this unrest. The Chinese were told that  the Kashmiri freedom struggle will affect the Muslim-majority  province of Xianjiang.    There are also proofs of U.S. efforts encouraging the  Kashmiris to form a separate country. In 1989, Robert Oakley,  then U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, asked Kashmir Premier Mumtaz  Rathore why a third option on Kashmir was considered. Similarly,  the French ambassador talked about it to Nawabzada Nasruallah  Khan. These days, CNN and other news media are airing news about  Kashmir prominently, which is good because it would attract  world attention to atrocities being committed in Kashmir, and  would leave India alone. However, this does not seem to be  happening. The situation is moving in another direction. Fears  have increased now that the United States has started to mention  China in the context of Kashmir.    In addition, we can assume that the United States is  interested in either Kashmir's strategic location or resources,  for example, there are plenty of minerals which the nature had  given to Kashmir for centuries. The reason for this fear is that  it has happened in the past. Africa was ravaged in the 19th  century because of minerals there. The white people made the  black natives their slaves and took, and still are taking, the  minerals from there. It is not of the past but a fact of  yesterday when they made elaborate plans to control the oil  wells in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and to make Japan depend on  them. It had Iran and Iraq fight, and later encouraged Iraq to  invade Kuwait. Then it quickly sent troops there and  established its control over the oil wells in Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait, and other Arab nations under the pretext of defending  Saudi Arabia. Before that they tried to get Pakistan's support  to control these oil wells by letting the United States  establish military bases here so it could control oil routes in  the Arabian Sea. Pakistan managed to keep itself out of it. The  United States benefitted from the Iraq war in one way. Smaller  nations find themselves helpless against modern U.S. weapons.  They have accepted defeat without fighting and have knelt down  in front of the United States. We used to praise the United  States, the open mindedness of its people, and its help to free  world nations. We considered it to be a nation of high caliber  and champion of the free world nations. The situation has  changed now and fear has replaced the feeling of respect which  is not good for the Americans themselves. The United States is  losing good friends. I would like to request that the United  States be admonished about it and that history be explained to  it. It must be told that its attitude is not correct. It has not  seen the destructiveness of war on its land for centuries. We  know that it is moving toward a major crisis. That is why I  presented the idea that we protect ourselves while the United  States is focused on other issues. I want to say now that we  should organize a nongovernment movement which can play a role  in the future when something happens that we do not want. We  must express official reaction to it and not bow our head down  totally.</p>

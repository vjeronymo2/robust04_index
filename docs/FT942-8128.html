			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Travel (France): Flaubert leads to Rouen's chamber of horrors - Stanley Stewart follows in the footsteps of a literary hero to a city of executions, adultery and gruesome medical history In the Musee Flaubert in Rouen, literature and medicine compete for the visitor's allegiance. It is an unequal battle. The manuscript pages of Madame Bovary do not detain one long when the next case holds two guillotined heads. One tends to skip over Flaubert's letters to his mother to gape at a pickled foetus or the gruesome instruments of early amputation. But do not feel guilty about preferring the sensational. Flaubert would have been delighted that his literary effects are overshadowed by the chamber of horrors that is 19th century medicine. The museum, still attached to the hospital, was the home of the chief surgeon, a post held by Flaubert's father. The novelist grew up in these rooms. As a child he had skipped through the garden gate to browse among the corpses in the hospital mortuary. Dissection, still birth and unanaesthetised amputations were dinner table conversation. I came early to Flaubert. He had that mixture of cynicism and self-pity so fatally attractive to the adolescent. Later, he seemed to dog my footsteps wherever I went. I read his Letters from Egypt while sailing up the Nile, and the Temptations of St Anthony while staying in a monk's cell in St Anthony's monastery. I felt it was time I tracked the literary lion to his lair. I got the train one bright morning at Victoria and was in Rouen for lunch. Straddling the Seine, the city has a sophisticated air, as if metropolitan glamour had mysteriously flowed downstream from Paris. Certainly it has outgrown the provincial insecurities of Flaubert's time. In its medieval streets, wisely given over to pedestrians, the shops are full of antiques, haute couture and exercise machines. The Gros Horloge still strikes a symbolic curfew at 9pm, but now it is the signal for the start of the evening promenade, an aperitif at a pavement cafe, and a late dinner in one of the fashionable restaurants around the Place Vieux Marche where the English burnt Joan of Arc at the stake. Joan's bonfire is an episode from which Anglo-French relations are still struggling to recover. Her charge sheet, it has to be said, made grim reading: witchcraft, impurity, heresy and, most grave, wearing men's clothes. The site of her execution is marked by a 20-metre cross and a modern church, Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc, that revives in splendid style the ancient tradition of building a church in the form of the upturned hull of a ship. In the visitor's book I found an entry in Hindi, kindly translated by the writer. It was a cryptic piece of Indian advice. 'Nationalist leaders come and go, but railways last forever.' The Rouen-to-Paris line, inaugurated in 1843, was built by the English. Ruskin called Rouen 'the city of north Europe as Venice was of the south'. It provides a wonderful study of the imprint of different ages, of the historical ebb and flow of confidence. The centre of Rouen has one of the finest and most complete medieval districts anywhere in France. Its lanes curl between overhanging half-timbered facades, quirky, obtuse and secretive. One is never far from the canyon walls of the cathedral, dwarfing all human activity. Cobbled streets lead westward to the Renaissance and the magnificent Palais de Justice, its sense of order and proportion a direct rebuff to the anxieties of the preceding centuries. A few minutes away Napoleon, mounted on a verdigris steed, rides the 18th century to a dramatic close, in the Place de General de Gaulle. Above him the streets climb between tall shuttered windows and wrought-iron balconies, through squares of plane trees and cafes, into the bourgeois 19th century Rouen of Flaubert's Madame Bovary. If the prosecutors who charged the book with obscenity are to be believed, this sloping quarter of 'boarding schools, churches and big derelict mansions' was the birthplace of modern adultery. But Rouen was used to women setting their own sexual agenda. In 1072 a mob of priests' concubines lynched the archbishop after he dared to preach a sermon denouncing them. Down the hill, in the Place des Carnes, Flaubert himself stands above a boules pitch, nose in the air, his posture managing a swagger in bronze. The Rouennais who hurry past his feet ignore him. He had loathed the petit-bourgeois of this provincial town and they hated him right back. On Flaubert's death, Zola wrote that four-fifths of Rouen did not know who he was. The other fifth despised him. The great novelist's gaze is carefully averted from the cathedral spire, a 19th century iron-work addition which he described as 'the nightmare of a delirious blacksmith'. He was understandably put out by its erection; the building was one of his passions. 'There is something in me akin to the greenish light of Norman cathedrals,' he wrote. The cathedral's facade is familiar from Monet, who painted it no less than 30 times without, by his own admission, ever getting it right. Down the broad nave, the columns of green light alternate with columns of stone. The cathedral was the setting for Madame Bovary's fateful assignation with Leon, and this scene in the novel, the prelude to the consummation of their affair in the back of a hansom cab, is as good as any guide book for prospective visitors. In the ambulatory lies the grave of Richard the Lion Heart. In accordance with the practice of the times, Richard was buried in three places. Apparently this increased the odds of getting to heaven, as if each grave would be taken as a separate application. His body is buried at Fontevrault. Rouen has the good fortune to have the famous lion heart. Charroux drew the short straw and plays host to his bowels. Richard's magnificent castle at Les Andelys, a few miles upstream from Rouen, is one of the most dramatic sights anywhere on the Seine. I followed the road downstream along the Seine, past the docks and the smoking factories, to Flaubert's property at Croisset. The writer's house has been demolished, making way, appropriately, for a paper factory. But a pavilion still stands in a garden of lime trees where Flaubert sought the solitude he so loved. At Croisset one gets Flaubert without the surgery. The pavilion, its tall windows overlooking the river, is flooded with light. There are family photographs, souvenirs from trips to Egypt and Carthage, his pipes, and the notorious stuffed parrot. But it is impossible to seek the man without finding the macabre. There is a death-mask of his mother, and a handkerchief with which he wiped his brow moments before his death. I had hoped to find his library. The keeper of Croisset, a woman in an Iron Maiden T-shirt, directed me up the hill to the town hall. In a civic reception room in the mairie, the library resides in baroque bookcases taken from his study. The attendant opened the glass doors and browsed happily among the medical volumes inherited from his father, the sets of Shakespeare and Balzac and Victor Hugo, the first editions of the author's own works. I lifted down a copy of Madame Bovary. 'Did you know that the French government used to give every bride in France a copy?' the attendant asked. It seemed a bizarre gift, like presenting a new mother with a book on infanticide. 'Is this the council chamber?' I asked as I was leaving. 'Oh no,' the woman said. 'C'est pour le mariage civil. For weddings.' It was a final irony. Flaubert, the confirmed bachelor, believed marriage was a delusion. His books are now the silent witnesses to every marriage in Croisset. Stanley Stewart travelled to Rouen as a guest of Stena Sealink (tel: 0233-647033) which offers two-night breaks in Normandy from Pounds 129 per person. Rouen's tourist office is in a 16th century house opposite the cathedral (tel: 35 71 41 77). Both the Rough Guide and the Blue Guide publish individual guides to Normandy. Another useful publication is The Traveller in France, from the French Tourist Office at 178 Piccadilly, London W1V OAL.</p>

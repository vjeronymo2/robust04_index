			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE COMMISSION OPENS 2ND INVESTIGATION OF TOP CAMPBELL AIDE  </P> <P> The Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating whether the top aide  to state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) improperly disclosed a  $20,000 loan -- apparently made at a below-market interest rate -- from a City  of Industry firm that has been a political contributor to his boss.  </P> <P> The state political watchdog agency investigation of Campbell aide Jerome M.  Haleva comes less than a month after The Times disclosed that Haleva intervened  on behalf of the firm, United Packaging Corp., with state contract officials  last year.  </P> <P> "The issue was raised, and we will review something if it appears to merit  review," commission spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said Tuesday in confirming the  inquiry.  </P> <P> Haleva placed a telephone call to John S. Babich, deputy director of the state  Office of Procurement, in June, 1988, as United Packaging faced  disqualification on a highly competitive $1.6-million contract to supply  garbage bags to state agencies, public records show. United Packaging was the  lowest bidder, but it would have been unable to provide the bags within six  weeks of each order, as contract officials had specified.  </P> <P> After the call, procurement officials rewrote the bid specifications to allow  for a 12-week delivery time, and United Packaging won the state's business,  public records show.  </P> <P> The call from Haleva came 16 months after the company and its president, Frank  Eugene Raper, had given Haleva a $20,000 loan at 8% interest -- 2% to 3% lower  than what banks were offering the general public at the time. The loan, secured  by a second trust deed against Haleva's home, was granted in February, 1987,  and was either repaid or forgiven in early June, 1987, records show.  </P> <P> Such a discount on a loan is generally considered a gift that therefore would  be required to be disclosed on the yearly statements of economic interest  required of politicians and their staff members. Haleva did disclose the loan  in 1987, but he did not report having received a benefit in the below-market  interest rate, public records show.  </P> <P> Without discussing specifics, commission spokeswoman Michioku said the agency  has the authority to investigate the possibility of a conflict of interest and  failure to disclose financial dealings by legislative staff members such as  Haleva.  </P> <P> Michioku also said the loan inquiry is the second FPPC one to involve Haleva,  whose annual salary is more than $90,000 and who is widely known for his  political acumen.  </P> <P> The first investigation, which is continuing, began earlier this summer after  newspaper reports disclosed that both Haleva and Campbell had failed to report  receiving free use of a car and driver during the Republican National  Convention in 1988.  </P> <P> The car, a Lincoln Continental, was provided by Asbestos Environmental  Controls, a New Orleans firm that had sought Haleva's help when it encountered  difficulties on a state contract last year.  </P> <P> The firm had donated $27,000 to Campbell campaign funds during 1987 and 1988.  It faced disqualification as an asbestos consulting firm because it had failed  to properly submit certification papers to state officials. Haleva called the  state architect's office and got a delay that allowed the company to file its  certification and therefore retain more than $800,000 in state business.  </P> <P> After the newspaper articles on the matter appeared, Haleva and Campbell  amended their disclosure forms to report receiving $761 in "transportation"  from the company.  </P> <P> State records show that Raper has contributed $3,500 to Campbell since 1985 and  that United Packaging gave Campbell a $100,000 campaign loan in October, 1986.  The loan was made on Oct. 7 and repaid two weeks later with $349 in interest,  documents show.  </P></p>

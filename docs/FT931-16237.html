			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / No further nuclear armscuts in view THE VEXED issue of whether British and French nuclear arsenals should be included in the arms control process may not have to be addressed for some years, a senior US official indicated yesterday. Mr Ronald Lehman, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said he did not expect a further round of nuclear arms cuts for the time being. Implementation of this month's Start 2 treaty, designed to reduce US and Soviet strategic stockpiles to 3,000-3,500 warheads each, would 'keep us quite busy'. The priority for the US was to reach agreement on help to Russia so that the Start cuts, not due to be completed until 2003, could be accelerated. On widening nuclear disarmament, he said: 'We have had enough difficulty dealing with the US, the Soviet Union and now Russia. It may be a bit premature talking about the next leap.' The Start 2 pact rested on assuming all strategic weapons held in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan would be gone within the seven-year completion period of the original Start 1 pact of 1991. Speaking on a Worldnet satellite TV link, Mr Lehman was sure Ukraine would join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The US had pledges that all short-range nuclear arms formerly dispersed around the Soviet republics had been accounted for.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Going up with smoke: Tony Jackson asks why tobacco is back in favour at BAT As the shareholders of BAT Industries queue up for their free cigarettes at their annual meeting in London today, they might care to reflect on a curious shift in their company's strategy. BAT is a kind of corporate Jekyll and Hyde: on the one hand, an Anglo-American insurance giant, on the other the free world's second biggest purveyor of the killer weed, tobacco. For years, Jekyll has been in the ascendant: but as last week's Dollars 1bn purchase of American Tobacco suggests, Mr Hyde is not finished yet. The story of his revival is that of world tobacco as a whole. A decade ago, only a third of the world cigarette market was open to BAT. The rest was accounted for either by China - now a third of the world market on its own - or by state monopolies in countries such as Russia, Japan, France and Italy. Denied room to expand, BAT started to pour its surplus cash into financial services, beginning with the near-Pounds 1bn purchase of Eagle Star Insurance at the end of 1983. But in the mid-1980s, the Japanese market started to open up, followed by Thailand and Taiwan. The Chinese market became slightly less hostile. Then came the crucial event: the fall of the Berlin wall, which opened up the whole of eastern Europe. Thus, says Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, in the past decade the available market has tripled, most of it happening in the last five years. 'When we first moved into financial services,' he says, 'it was all in the context of seeing tobacco as a cash generator in long-term decline. We never saw it declining as fast as outside pundits, but we were looking to financial services for growth. Now we have two growth businesses.' The American Tobacco purchase scarcely fits the growth scenario, since the US market, by Broughton's reckoning, has fallen by a steady 2 to 3 per cent a year for many years. More than anything else, the deal amounts to buying cash flow on the cheap. Even so, it is hard to believe that BAT would have contemplated it had its thinking on tobacco not undergone a sea-change in the past few years. The logic for the deal is simple enough. The two giants of US tobacco, Philip Morris and R J R Nabisco, could not have bought American on anti-trust grounds: and given the anti-smoking climate in the US, anyone not already in the market would be crazy to get involved. As the number three US producer, BAT thus found itself in a buyer's market. According to Broughton's sums, he would still break even on the deal if consumption fell by 7 per cent a year from now on. This, he argues, is unlikely on a sustained basis. Even if it did happen, he says, the deal would buy him time. A combined business selling 80bn cigarettes a year in the US takes longer to become non-viable than one selling 50bn, as BAT does at present. Then again, if a 7 per cent fall sounds unthinkable, it is worth considering the case of Brazil. In its first quarter statement this week, BAT said its Brazilian cigarette volume had fallen by 17 per cent year on year, leading to a loss of several million pounds. Since this is partly due to such exotic factors as hyperinflation and cross-border smuggling from Paraguay, the comparison is not exact. But it is sobering to reflect that in Brazil, BAT still sells twice as many cigarettes a year - 100bn - as it does in the US. On a wider front, the Brazilian experience suggests that the brave new world of tobacco may have its awkward aspects. BAT's market share in Brazil is 80 per cent. In Chile it is 97 per cent. In fact, more than half of BAT's cigarette sales worldwide are in the 30 or so countries in which it has more than half the market: countries in which, historically, BAT had the official monopoly. Its big competitors such as Philip Morris have no such cosy tradition. As world markets open up, BAT has plenty to lose as well as to gain. Looking further ahead, some of the big old state monopolies have yet to flex their muscles on the world stage. Japan Tobacco, the former Japanese monopoly company which still holds over 80 per cent of its home market, is starting to make headway internationally. But the really terrifying prospect is that one day its Chinese counterpart, the Chinese National Tobacco Corporation (CNTC), might do the same. At present, Broughton argues, the phenomenal growth of the Chinese market must keep CNTC's hands full. 'They're growing at a rate of 50bn cigarettes a year,' he says. 'That's a pretty damned big factory (each year).' But the potential of a company whose cigarette output is roughly equal to that of Philip Morris, BAT, R J R Nabisco and Rothmans combined is slightly unnerving. 'We've developed good relationships with them over the years,' Broughton says cautiously. 'But we certainly wouldn't suggest we know what they're going to do.' Meanwhile, the battle for the brave new markets continues, particularly against BAT's old adversary Philip Morris. The two make an interesting match. Philip Morris has 12 per cent of the world market, BAT 10.5 per cent. Philip Morris is much bigger in the US, BAT rather bigger in the rest of the world. BAT has a range of weapons, from its vast experience of international markets to its panoply of local brands. Philip Morris has a single weapon, but a very formidable one: Marlboro, one of the strongest brand names in the world. 'Philip Morris is the most aggressive competitor we have,' Broughton says. 'They're very active in eastern and central Europe. They appear to use different financial criteria from ours. We've had three cases recently where we've been competing head to head to buy a factory (in eastern Europe). Even in the third one, where we pushed our numbers up a bit, they put in a package three times as high as ours. Either they're right or we are. We don't know yet.' In any case, the main point is that in tobacco, BAT now has plenty to do. According to Broughton, the outside world was always wrong to see BAT as wanting to get out of tobacco. 'The cash was available in greater quantities than could be invested in tobacco, since the opportunities weren't there,' he says. 'Now we have a number of alternative strategies open to us, each of which is viable and sound in its own right. We may not be able to do it all at once, but having competing opportunities is a position I like.' In other words, BAT's ambitions to buy a European insurance company or a UK building society may or may not come to immediate fruition. At the same time, BAT may or may not buy into the French tobacco monopoly when it is privatised, or grab other such opportunities as they turn up. Hyde and Jekyll, it seems, will have to coexist in the same corporate body for quite a while yet.</p>

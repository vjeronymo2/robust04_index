			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Growth in rented housing to slow The number of homes built by housing associations for rent will fall sharply after cuts in the budget of the Housing Corporation, the quango which distributes government grant to associations. Approvals to start building homes for rent are due to fall from 38,900 this year to 26,800 in 1996-97. Last year associations provided more than 60,000 homes for rent. The corporation has told the government that the cut will mean the loss of 15,000 to 18,000 construction jobs. Sir George Young, the housing minister, yesterday told the Commons that he expected at least 154,000 housing association homes to be completed between 1993-94 and 1995-96. Mr Jim Coulter, director of the National Federation of Housing Associations, said the government was focusing on completions rather than starts in order to disguise the cut. He said: 'Sir George is attempting to conceal the 30 per cent drop in new approvals by emphasising the lettings which will come on stream from homes started in previous years.' New housing plans also include a shift away from building for rent towards increased sales. This was a backdoor change in policy, Mr Coulter said. 'In two years new rented housing will make up only 55 per cent of the housing association programme.' The government is recommending that local authorities raise rents on council homes by 7.5 per cent in the coming year, four times the rate of inflation.</p>

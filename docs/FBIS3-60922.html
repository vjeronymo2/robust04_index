General Jean Cot, the French soldier who commands UNPROFOR  in  the former Yugoslavia, described the incident Wednesday [5  January] as "outrageous" and demanded that the Croatian soldiers  be punished.    The Canadian troops had obtained a routine authorisation to  cross Croatian lines in the Medak enclave in the south of the  country.    Seven Croatian army soldiers approached them and ordered  them  to lay down their weapons before the Canadian soldiers were led  away at gunpoint.    UNPROFOR said the four were released after negotiations with  a local Croatian commander.    Canada has 560 troops in the region based at Gracac. They  were deployed in the Medak area after Croatian troops attacked  Serb villages, massacring dozens of people.</p>

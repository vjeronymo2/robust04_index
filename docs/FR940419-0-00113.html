Therefore all repayment, interest, or other return on investment of the contribution must be deposited in the local account of the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund to be used for eligible HOME activities in accordance with the requirements of this part. A cash contribution to affordable housing that is not assisted with HOME funds must be contributed permanently to the project. Repayments of matching contributions in affordable housing projects, as defined in &sect;92.219(b), that are not HOME-assisted, must be made to the local account of the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund to get match credit for the full loan amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The value, based on customary and reasonable means for establishing value, of State or local taxes, fees, or other charges that are normally and customarily imposed or charged by a State or local government on all transactions or projects in the conduct of State or local government operations but are waived, foregone, or deferred (including State low-income housing tax credits) in a manner that achieves affordability of housing assisted with HOME funds. Fees or charges that are associated with the HOME Program only (rather than normally and customarily imposed or charged on all transactions or projects) are not eligible forms of matching contributions. The amount of any real estate taxes may be based on post-improvement property value, using customary and reasonable means of establishing value. For taxes, fees, or charges that are given for future years, the value is the present discounted cash value, based on a rate equal to the rate for the Treasury security with a maturity closest to the number of years for which the taxes, fees, or charges are waived, foregone, or deferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The value, before the HOME assistance is provided and minus any debt burden, lien, or other encumbrance, of donated land or other real property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

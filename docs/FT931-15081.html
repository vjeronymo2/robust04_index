			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Gulf worries upset investors in the Far East THE Nikkei average resumed its downward trend after Tuesday's brief rally. The continued lack of government support for share prices combined with worries about the Middle East to depress the market, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei slipped 163.14 to close at 16,517.91. It fell from the day's high of 16,688.97 at the opening to hit a low of 16,440.05 in the early afternoon on television reports that the US had decided to retaliate against Iraq. Volume picked up to around 190m shares from the previous day's 150m. Brokers said some of the heaviest trading was in shares being hedged against new equity-linked bond issues. Declining shares outnumbered those advancing by 689 to 209, with 189 stocks ending unchanged. The Topix index of all first section shares shed 10.52 to 1,271.46, after easing 1.95 on Tuesday. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was a slight 0.19 off at 1,029.07. Selling by companies hoping to shore up year-end balance sheets continued to push the stock market down. The Nikkei's brief dip below 16,500 failed to draw much buying from public pension funds, which are believed to have large sums available for the purchase of equities before the end of this financial year. Brokers now say heavy support buying from that quarter is not expected until the Nikkei falls closer to 16,000. Mr Ross Purdie of SG Warburg Securities said longer term factors would also weigh against a significant increase in buying interest. 'We have still got fairly high price/ earnings ratios, and although there are a lot of new funds for investment in equities worldwide, we are seeing much less of those funds coming to Japan,' he said. Pharmaceuticals were sold heavily after reports that the government intends to place time limits on the prescription of the high-priced drug Interferon for individual hepatitis patients. Toray Industries, the diversified textile manufacturer which is one of the main Interferon producers, fell Y18 to Y629, while Sumitomo Chemical dropped Y24 to Y431 and Green Cross relinquished Y60 at Y1,190. The decline of the market ate into gains made by some issues earlier this week, including Victor Co of Japan (JVC) which retreated Y36 to Y854. Canon dipped Y10 to Y1,360 after the announcement that 1992 stepper sales were down 30 per cent from 1991. Sony weakened Y50 to Y4,060 on news that the company is to withdraw from the computer disc drive market. In Osaka the OSE index finished 156.84 down at 18,164.34 in volume of 101m shares. Roundup MIDDLE EAST fears haunted the Pacific Rim yesterday. HONG KONG featured firmly with a 1.9 per cent gain, which some brokers attributed to traditional optimism ahead of the Chinese New Year. The Hang Seng index ended 107.48 higher at 5,778.74, after peaking at 5,796.74 in the morning. Turnover came to HKDollars 3.4bn. SINGAPORE fell as jittery investors turned sellers on a report of a possible US military strike against Iraq. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 12.08 to 1,532.94 in volume of 94.9m shares. AUSTRALIA was driven lower by volatile futures trading. The All Ordinaries index shed 14.3 to 1,495.0, its lowest close since early December. Turnover totalled ADollars 212.5m. Westpac was the most active stock, down 7 cents at ADollars 3.04 on nearly 5m shares traded. SEOUL gained slightly, with buying of small and medium-sized companies offsetting institutional profit-taking in large-capitalisation shares. The composite index put on 2.88 at 705.93 in Won874.6bn turnover. TAIWAN reversed early losses as institutional buying of low-priced stocks emerged just before the close. The weighted index, more than 30 points down initially, closed a net 10.38 up at 3,227.93 in turnover of TDollars 6.9bn. MANILA bounced back from the previous day's profit-taking as investor interest spilled into the mining sector. The composite index climbed 12.59 to 1,320.76 and the mines index gained 8.3 per cent to 3,341.85. Combined turnover grew to 280.2m pesos from 228.9m. KUALA LUMPUR finished lower after investors liquidated positions amid rising tension in the Gulf. The composite index was finally 2.18 off at 614.28 after an early high of 618.04. Volume amounted to 72.2m shares, against 63.2m. BANGKOK recovered most of its earlier losses by the close, after sliding 21.24, or 2.3 per cent, in the morning on Middle East war rumours. The SET index ended 3.33 down at 930.27 in active turnover of Bt14.09bn.</p>

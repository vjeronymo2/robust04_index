			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Japan's employers launch attack on US trade policy THE Japanese employers' federation, Keidanren, has launched an unprecedentedly strong attack on US trade and economic policy. In a report on bilateral relations, the Keidanren accuses the US of dragging its feet over economic reform and warns of the danger of protectionism in moves to establish a North American Free Trade Area. It also expresses concern about the US insistence that its own institutions and practices are to be applicable as norms of the world economic and social system. The report has been published just days before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, is due to leave for the Munich summit of Group of Seven leaders. On his way he will visit Washington for a meeting with President George Bush to discuss bilateral trade and economic imbalances. The Keidanren argues that Japan and its main trading partners must achieve kyosei - symbiosis - which is the organisation's catchword for harmonising institutions and commercial practices. It says Japan and the US have been discussing such harmonisation for three years in talks called the Strategic Impediments Initiative. The Keidanren says Japan has made progress in opening its markets as requested by the US, though more needs to be done. However, it says: 'The SII process is designed to be a two-way street. Unfortunately, the US is lagging in its response to the structural issues raised by the Japanese side.' The Keidanren singles out contradictions in US policy - contrasting US demands for further deregulation in Japan with its requests for intervention by Tokyo to boost imports in specific sectors. The report also makes criticisms of the Japanese economy, including the opaqueness of commercial dealings, a tendency to work over-long hours and an exaggerated emphasis on market share.</p>

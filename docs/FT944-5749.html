			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UN chief urges world-wide mobilisation against Aids Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday called for 'world-wide mobilisation' against Aids at a Paris summit where France invited other rich states to follow its lead in pledging more money to fight the epidemic. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, UK health secretary, expressed her government's support for 'this important event', and said the UK would give an extra Pounds 2m over the next three years to international research into Aids and the HIV virus. Total British HIV/Aids spending will reach Pounds 230m next year. The one-day summit ended with representatives of 42 rich and poor countries, including 13 prime ministers, signing a 'Paris declaration' designed to give higher political profile to an international fight against Aids that is often left to specialists. Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, said the four general goals of the declaration were to 'highlight the degree to which the Aids epidemic threatens all of humanity'; to 'stress the responsibility of states to every man and woman affected by Aids'; to 'commit our states to do everything to treat the sick and guarantee their fundamental rights', and 'undertake to help developing countries improve their campaign against Aids'. Mr Balladur said France, which co-hosted the summit with the UN's World Health Organisation, would contribute an extra FFr132m (Pounds 15.7m) to carry out the declaration's recommendations, such as improved safety of blood transfusions. Some speakers from non-governmental organisations said yesterday's meeting was only 'a tiny step forward', and it was time for politicians 'to start moving from intentions to concrete action'. One, MRAP, called for France to stop expelling HIV-positive people to third world countries, saying such expulsions amounted 'to a death sentence'. Demonstrations by Aids campaigning organisations were held near by. The Eiffel Tower was lit up with red lights, representing the red ribbon symbol of World Aids Day.</p>

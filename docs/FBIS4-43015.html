			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Suffers Setback in </F> Senate Chair Vote"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 2 -- The government of Premier  Silvio Berlusconi suffered further setbacks in the Senate today  as voting for the last chairs of the standing committees saw  three more going to the opposition, for a total of eight, while  those held by the government coalition rose only from three to  five.    Today's vote saw the election for the opposition of Aldo  Corasaniti, Democratic Left, to chair the Constitutional Affairs  Committee, and Giangiacomo Migone, of the Progressives, as head  of the Foreign Affairs Committee, after government candidate  Giovanni Spadolini withdrew his candidacy.    A run-off vote was held for the Chairman of the Defense  Committee, after the first ballot draw, with the opposition  Progressive candidate Raffaele Bertoni edging out Luigi Ramponi  of the National Alliance, the government's candidate.    The government Freedom Alliance took only the Justice  Committee chair with Antonio Guarra of the National Alliance,  while Giorgio Brambilla of the Northern League was elected to  helm the Environment Committee.    The 8-5 defeat of the government in securing the Senate  committee chairs was seen by many observers to be the result of  conflict within the government coalition, especially between  Prime Minister Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the Northern League  of Umberto Bossi, as well as the government's refusal to  politically bargain with some opposition forces, such as the  former Christian Democrats of the People's party, viewed by the  latter as a sign of the government's arrogance.    Forza Italia has been particularly critical of the Northern  League which it has accused of "irresponsible" behavior, just  short of betrayal for having allegedly bargained with the Left.    Tiziana Maiolo, the Forza Italia chairman of the House  Justice Committee, this morning said it was indispensable that  the forces making up the government coalition clear up their  difference and reach an operative consensus.    In reference to the "irresponsible" Northern League, she  said  "I hope this behavior ends after June 12 (European elections),  that bit is just a preelection ploy and not permanent, otherwise  we will have to go to early elections." Any eventual early  elections, she added, would have to involve both House and  Senate because at question would be the government coalition  itself.    According to Maiolo, the government coalition's position to  reject candidates from the opposition was a guarantee for  Berlusconi to keep the government in the center.    Forza Italia House whip Raffaele Della Valle was also in  favor of the coalition summit and observed "It is never negative  that a government coalition meet to examine the performance of  its individual members."    Looking at the government setback in the Senate, Della Valle  said "This result is the consequence of an election which  produced a framework of total uncertainty in the Senate. I  don't think it is yet the case to emphasize or dramatize this  result which is, without a doubt, negative, but which must be  taken for what it is. I don't think it is cause to take a step  as drastic as dissolving the Senate. Certainly, it makes it  harder to work, for the majority."    Della Valle then observed "the commission votes should be  examined carefully for there is something in the coalition which  isn't working. This is what should be subject to an in-depth  examination by the majority and the government."    Michele Sellitti, Senate whip for the Socialist group, said  the chair vote was a "warning to the majority on the need for  dialogue with the opposition.... We recognized its right to  chair the 13 standing committees and asked that the opposition  be given the chair of the Commissions for Control. The  confrontation developed due to the total lack of openness by the  majority to an absolutely reasonable and legitimate hypothesis  as this."    The Senate whip for the National Alliance, Giulio  Maceratini,  had a different view and said "Either the political framework  changes or we go to new elections because this is no way to  govern." He, too, agreed that an eventual early vote would have  to be for both houses of parliament, even though the  Constitution allows for dissolving only the Senate. "The result  (of the Senate vote) was undoubtedly negative, but it was a  battle fought with unequal arms."    After being accused by its allies of not abiding to  coalition  agreements, the National Alliance today issued a statement  claiming it had the right to ask that "Forza Italia and the  National Alliance clarify their positions."    A party communique went on to criticize the hard-line its  coalition partners had adopted in the Senate chair vote and said  that unless differences were resolved, then early election would  be necessary.    According to the Northern League, Forza Italia and the  National Alliance had been amateur in not recognizing the  opposition's right to chair the Bicameral Control Committees and  had "failed to listen to the Northern League's advice."    The results of the election for Senate committee chairmen  saw  the government coalition win the chairs for Justice, Budget,  Public Works, Health and the Environment Committees, while the  opposition will head the Committee for Constitutional Affairs,  Foreign Affairs, Defense, Finance, Education, Agriculture,  Industry and Labor.</p>

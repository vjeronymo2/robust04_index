			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 1% as hopes rise for tax plan Investors were encouraged by Monday's rally on Wall Street and, in addition, by their anticipation of the government's economic package, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Share prices gained ground in spite of active profit-taking by dealers and corporate investors in the afternoon session, the Nikkei average ending 236.83 ahead at 20,251.23 after an opening low for the day of 20,080.51, and high of 20,526.45. Reports that the coalition was poised to agree on a Y6,000bn tax cut for the fiscal year to March 1995 spurred arbitrage buying in the morning, and the rebound in New York equities also helped investor confidence. The record economic stimulus package came after hours and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 7.37 to 1,343.95. In the domestic market, traders were encouraged by buying orders from institutional investors, who had been cautious until now. However, there was profit-taking in the afternoon as dealers adjusted positions ahead of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks on Friday, and the listing of the Nikkei 300 futures contracts on the Osaka stock exchange next Monday. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 15.26 to 1,616.70. Volume totalled 600m shares, against Monday's 310m, as sell orders emerged around the 20,500 Nikkei level. Winners outnumbered losers by 824 to 210, with 140 issues unchanged. Banks, which have been depressed recently on selling by corporate investors, bounced back. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y120 to Y3,220 and Fuji Bank Y10 to Y2,230. Brokers were also stronger, with Nomura Securities ahead Y10 at Y2,270 and Nikko Securities gaining Y30 at Y1,320. Telecommunications-related stocks were higher on the multi-media theme. Fujitsu, the day's most active issue, appreciated Y20 to Y1,070 and NEC put on Y10 at Y1,070. Companies in the mobile phone business were also bought. Itochu, a trading house, moved up Y15 to Y695 and Nitsuko Y120 to Y1,600. Shipping lines, regarded as laggards, were bought. Navix Line improved Y13 to Y342 and Iino Kaiun Y30 to Y650. In Osaka, the OSE average added 320.19 at 22,021.11 in volume of 64.4m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y330 to Y6,880. Roundup Most of the region's equity markets closed either side of a percentage point higher; none of Monday's big fallers came near to recouping their losses. HONG KONG regained just 0.35 per cent after Monday's 6.1 per cent slide, the Hang Seng index finishing 39.89 better at 11,454.16 on late bargain hunting in blue chips. Turnover declined from HKDollars 9.67bn to HKDollars 8.58bn. Properties and banks saw a recovery in sentiment; traders said the cut in the weighting of Hong Kong stocks by Nomura, the Japanese broker, had prompted some early follow-through selling which had subsided by late afternoon. BANGKOK recovered some of Monday's 6.8 per cent fall, helped by activity in the banking sector. The SET index put on 20.92 at 1,365.73 in low turnover of Bt8.3bn, after Monday's Bt10.9bn. However, the market remained some 20 per cent down from its January 4 high of 1,753. Bangkok Bank advanced Bt7 to Bt194, with most of the rise coming in the last few minutes of trading. KUALA LUMPUR retrieved 14.70 of the previous day's 53.30 fall, the composite index ending at 1,108.72. Volume fell from 208m shares to 159.9m. MANILA added a temporary freeze on oil price increases and the government's staving off of a strike threat by local labour groups to Wall Street's strength, and the composite index closed 61.91, or 2.1 per cent, higher at 2,952.85. However, brokers said the rally was not convincing, since the oil price freeze was only a palliative. BOMBAY kept itself in positive territory after Monday's near 6 per cent gain, although some profit-taking crept in towards the close. The BSE index rose 17.6 to 4,162.0. AUSTRALIA gave the credit to New York and Tokyo as the All Ordinaries index recouped almost half of Monday's loss, gaining 24.3 at 2,305.4 in turnover of ADollars 715.11m. Mining house CRA moved ahead 38 cents to ADollars 19.26, with analysts saying the agreement between its Hammersley Iron unit and Japanese Steel Mills for a 7.6 per cent iron ore price cut was around expectations, or a little better. NEW ZEALAND dropped from a midday high of 2,399.02 to finish with the NZSE-40 index a net 8.19 up at 2,373.69. Telecom advanced to NZDollars 4.88 in early trading ahead of its third-quarter results, but ended 9 cents down on balance on the news at NZDollars 4.65.</p>

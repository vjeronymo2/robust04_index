			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RISKS OF UNDERREGULATION  </P> <P> Exxon is the nation's third largest industrial corporation, earning $5.3  billion in profit on sales of nearly $80 billion last year. Despite these  resources, however, this immense corporate empire has failed to come to grips  with its oil spill more than five weeks after the Exxon Valdez ran aground on  Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound.  </P> <P> Exxon's first cleanup plan was found to be inadequate by federal officials. Its  second plan seems to retreat even from the commitment of the first plan,  proposing 3,400 workers compared with 4,000, and calculating 364 miles of  contaminated beach when Alaska officials count double that amount. Coast Guard  Commandant Paul A. Yost characterized the new plan as "quite light, very thin."  Federal approval is pending. Alaskan environmental officials called it  unacceptable.  </P> <P> The new plan, in fact, would abandon the cleanup of 191 miles of "moderately  soiled" beach to natural wave action. This course seems to follow silent  approval of some but not all top federal officials. After a visit to Alaska in  late April, Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. said that washing the  beaches with hoses was not going to do the job. He derided the effort as  make-work for appearance's sake. "What I think will happen is, nature, with the  tide coming in and going out, is what's going to take care of it." That may  prove to be the only alternative in some areas, but any beach that can be  cleaned this summer will reduce the long-term fouling. The cleaner the beaches  now, the less wildlife will be threatened with oil damage and spill-caused  illness.  </P> <P> During a visit to the scene Thursday, Vice President Dan Quayle said that Exxon  must do more, perhaps a signal of a more vigorous response from Washington.  "And the President is not going to let anyone off the hook," he added. "The job  will be done." Quayle sought to defend President Bush against criticism that he  had not responded vigorously enough to the March 24 disaster. Quayle told  Alaskans that one of the reasons for his trip was that "I'm here as his vice  president, because he feels strongly about this."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Exxon seemed to treat the disaster as just one of those things. Yes,  the oil spill was a bad one, the firm said in a recent statement, "but  accidents can happen to anyone." The arrogance of the company seems to be  exceeded only by its insensitivity to the dimensions of the disaster and the  concern of people throughout the country for the Alaskan environment and  wildlife. Yes, accidents can happen anywhere, but there are ways to guard the  wildest, most magnificent landscapes in the world. It was the oil industry  itself that assured Congress and the American people that the oil  transportation link to Alaska was virtually foolproof. And it was the industry  that guaranteed that even if there were an accident, the oil consortium that  runs the Valdez marine terminal had equipment and manpower on hand to deal  promptly with any spill.  </P> <P> Exxon keeps emphasizing that it will pay for the cleanup. But any cost not  covered by insurance will be tax-deductible, the firm has noted.  </P> <P> The Exxon Valdez spill has demonstrated that Americans cannot rely on the good  will of corporations to clean up their own messes adequately, although there  are companies that value their public image so highly they will do the right  thing. The Alaskan tragedy makes the case for strong federal regulations and  controls closely monitored and strongly enforced. There must be stiff penalties  for failure to comply. And whenever a company assumes a less-than-urgent  approach to such a cleanup, the government must not hesitate to take direct  command of the situation.  </P> <P> For the past eight years, the national Administration has complained about the  cost of government regulation of business and worked to reduce the number of  rules. Now, the nation knows the cost of insufficient regulation.  </P></p>

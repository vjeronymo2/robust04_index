			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY?  </P> <P> Why look to the same small set of artists and expect decade after decade of  inspired work? Most now have families and (let's face it) financial empires to  tend to.  </P> <P> There is much vital new blood that is for the most part being kept locked out  by the conservative business orientation of the music industry.  </P> <P> It's no small wonder that we see an endless slew of Led Zeppelin caricature  bands that are more interested in their hairdos and ancillary merchandising  than the songs they write.  </P> <P> The radio and record execs endlessly rehash the same tired formulas, and the  bands (if they know what's good for them) get with the program.  </P> <P> The reason that rap has proven so vital is simply that being a  "non-market-tested genre," there was no old guard standing at the castle door.  </P> <P> STEVE MELOAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

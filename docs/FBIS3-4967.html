In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Ho Chong-man, vice  chairman of Chongnyon's Central Standing Committee, said he met  the younger Kim during a visit to North Korea in late February  and also saw him horse riding. Ho dismissed press reports in  February that Kim had sustained serious injuries.    Ho said he met Kim on the afternoon of February 28. It was  Ho's fifth meeting with Kim.    Kim told him that North Korea highly appreciates its  agreement with the United States over international inspections  of North Korean nuclear sites. Ho said Kim told him North Korea  "honors its promises."    Ho said he met Kim in Pyongyang and later encountered him  outside the capital where he saw him riding a white horse and  accompanied by several high-ranking government officials. He  said Kim stopped and asked him to join him in horse riding. But  Ho said that after he explained he did not know how to ride a  horse, Kim rode away at the head of a group of riders on three  other horses along a seven- to eight-kilometer country track.    Ho said he was fully aware of the reports that Kim had been  injured but said he could see no sign of injury during his  discussions and walks with Kim. He said Kim appeared robust and  slimmer than when they previously met.    At a dinner reception in the evening, Kim said North Korea  "is conducting diplomacy of its own volition on an equal footing  with the United States."    The U.S. and North Korea agreed last Friday at a  working-level meeting in New York that Pyongyang would resume  dialogue with South Korea and fully implement International  Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its seven declared nuclear  plants.</p>

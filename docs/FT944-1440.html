			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Baird expands clothing side with Pounds 11.5m buy William Baird, one of the leading suppliers to Marks and Spencer, yesterday announced the acquisition of Morris Cohen, a privately-owned lingerie and nightwear manufacturer which also supplies M&amp;S, for Pounds 11.5m. The purchase will be financed by the issue of 2m ordinary shares at a price of 215p, plus Pounds 4.4m in loan notes and Pounds 2.8m cash. The move is part of Baird's plan to withdraw from the engineering sector and concentrate on its core clothing and textiles business. Last year it acquired Richard I Racke, a maker of women's wear and casual clothing for M&amp;S. Cohen's forecast turnover for 1994 is Pounds 32m. Baird's contract clothing operations had sales of Pounds 230m last year, most of which came from M&amp;S. The target's production units, located in south Wales, will be merged with Baird's existing contract lingerie operations nearby which will reduce operating costs and management time. 'It's a perfect business for us in terms of its product, location and customer,' said Mr Donald Parr, Baird's chairman. Cohen's net assets are about Pounds 6.5m, before a dividend of Pounds 2m to be paid to the vendors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shiny Li in Beijing] </F>   [Excerpt] A senior Chinese official has warned that an  increase in the number of new political parties in Hong Kong  would cause instability in the territory.    In a candid reference to the growing number of political  groups, director of the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, Zhou  Nan, said: "If three or four persons are able to form a  political party, the number of parties would be more than the  rebellions in the Cultural Revolution.    "Then it will be difficult to maintain stability -- and Hong  Kong cannot be without stability."    Mr Zhou also said he would like a meeting with Governor  Chris  Patten one day -- to discuss poetry, not politics.    Mr Zhou was speaking at a poetry meeting he initiated for  reporters in Beijing.    He said too many political parties meant too many choices  for  Hong Kong people.    China, he stressed, could never fully adopt the Western  style  of parliament.    "China has her own style for democratic development," he  said. "We should not and need not take the Western style for  reference because China is a democratic country and we have got  wider democracy."    Recalling conversations with members of Britain's House of  Lords, Mr Zhou said: "If Britain has taken about 400 years to  develop this style of Parliament, how can Hong Kong take only a  few years to come up to that point?" Mr Zhou also said the  greatest wish of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was to  stand on Hong Kong soil, even if only for a minute, after it was  returned to China in 1997.

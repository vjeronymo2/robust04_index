The ROK Foreign, Finance, Defense,  and Culture and Sports Ministries reached this decision at a  joint meeting on 28 January. They also decided to hold  consultations with the United States on this matter sooner or  later. A ROK Government official said: "The government made  such a decision because the period of prescription for rents  stipulated in the Government Budget Account Law is five years."  He also said: "The government decided to ask the United States  to pay rent without fail if it continues to use the building."    The government made such a decision because the Board of  Audit and Inspection last July pointed out that the "U.S.  Government had not paid rent for the past 13 years with no  justifiable reason."    The ROK and the United States agreed in 1960 that the United  States would use the 6,615 square-meter eight-story building  free of charge as long as the U.S. Operations Mission or its  successor organization stays in the ROK."    However, the United States insists: The Economic Department  of the U.S. Embassy inherited the role of the U.S. Agency for  International Development to Korea, which was inaugurated as a  result of the restructuring of the U.S. Operations Mission in  1968 and which was abolished in 1980. Therefore, the U.S.  Embassy has no reason to pay rent. Also, the 1962 agreement on  the use of the building stipulates that the United States can  use it free of charge as long as the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense  Treaty exists. So, the United States has the right to continue  to use the building free of charge.</p>

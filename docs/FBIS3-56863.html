"I will not take this step  until I judge government policy in the credit and monetary  sphere to have changed so much as to constitute the end of  reforms."    According to Boris Fedorov, one such indicator for him might  be a considerable increase in the ceiling on the issue of credit  in the first quarter of 1994. "If under pressure from all  manner of lobbies the government issues over 10 trillion rubles  in Central Bank credit, there can be no question of any  financial stabilization," the minister believes.    In Fedorov's opinion, what is now being observed on the  money  market is quite natural. "We are on the verge of a change of  economic policy and the money market is responding appropriately  to this."    Boris Fedorov does not believe that he set the prime  minister  "deliberately unacceptable terms" in demanding that Aleksandr  Zaveryukha and Viktor Gerashchenko be removed from government.  "We are talking about the country's future, about what the  government's strategic course will be, and how it will affect  millions of Russian citizens. I can only be accountable for  that which has been entrusted to me if I have a chance of  influencing it."</p>

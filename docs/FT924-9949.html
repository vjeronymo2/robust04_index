			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Grant-aided project calls in receiver A Pounds 20M PROJECT described in 1989 as the largest direct manufacturing investment in Europe by Hong Kong has gone into receivership. The Hartlepool videotape plant set up by Swilynn (HK) was expected to create 500 jobs in a high-unemployment area and was offered Pounds 5m in regional selective assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry. In July last year Swilynn Magnetic Industries, a subsidiary of Swilynn UK which is turn controlled by Swilynn (HK), announced that it was making redundant 215 of the 385 people it then employed at Hartlepool because of the increased automation necessary to compete with Far East manufacturers' prices. It said that the Pounds 2m investment in automation underlined its long-term commitment. But European demand proved lower than expected and plans to make videotape boxes at Hartlepool faltered when it proved cheaper to import them. Receiver Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has been called into Swilynn UK and, while manufacturing of video cassettes has ceased at the Hartlepool plant, sub-contract injection moulding work is continuing. A total of 42 employees remain, plus a skeleton staff at the sales office at West Drayton in London. The assets are likely to be sold in sections. Swilynn (HK) is currently the subject of a rescue package after trading in its shares was suspended. The group's ultimate parent, Bermuda-based Swilynn International, continues to trade. The DTI said that in such cases it invoiced the receiver to try to recover grant paid. Swilynn is understood not to have received the full Pounds 5m offered, as it did not achieve its target of 500 jobs. Mr Miles Middleton, the receiver, said he had yet to hear from the DTI.</p>

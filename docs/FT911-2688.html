			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (13): Telerate prepares to do battle with Reuters - Developments in dealing technology LISTEN to Mr Peter Taylor and you could be forgiven for thinking that war had broken out. Telerate, whose European sales and marketing effort he heads, 'are starting to surround Reuters'. The official outbreak of hostilities comes in June, when an enhancement to Telerate's The Trading Service (TTS) will 'do Reuters an awful lot of damage', according to Mr Taylor. Launched 18 months ago, TTS automates the 'spadework' in a foreign exchange deal and ploughs data down to the back office, allowing managers to monitor costs. It has not been a success, however. TTS version two will offer 'the best of everything', promises Mr Taylor. It will need to, if it is to convince those such as Mr Rob Lowey, senior foreign exchange manager at Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank in London, who were unimpressed by TTS' debut. 'We installed (TTS) on an informal basis, running alongside Quotron &amp; Reuters' Direct Dealing Monitor', recalls Mr Lowey (Quotron rivals Telerate as a technology supplier). The bank's aim was to pick a secondary system to run alongside Reuters. But Telerate had incorporated a remarkable innovation into TTS. Screen-based messages between dealers followed a set format. Intercontinental pleasantries were a thing of the past with TTS, as dealers could not key in greetings to colleagues in New York - the system dictated their words. 'You need comfort in a fast-moving market', says Mr Lowey, and his team did not feel comforted by a product that took the words out of their mouths. Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank's London dealers rejected TTS after a three-month trial. Telerate, which had sunk upwards of Dollars 60m into developing TTS and its associated telecommunications support, were not paid. Mr Taylor describes the upcoming improvements to TTS as 'multi-format trading'. What this means is that dealers will break out of the fixed format at the flick of a 'conversation button'. The new, as yet anonymous product, will be promoted by what Mr Taylor promises will be 'incredibly aggressive pricing'. Any institution installing more than 10 positions will get TTS at one-third less than the price of Reuter's system. Mr Taylor defends TTS with the observation that 3 per cent of foreign exchange deals lead to some error or require further human intervention before the deal can be completed. Erasing the messy notes between dealers was supposed to wipe out these errors and save costs. Reuters, however, are quietly confident. The company has endured years of complaints about its effective monopoly of market data feeds. It argues that its pricing policy is merely to keep in line with inflation. Critics counter that Reuters contracts are pricy and almost impossible to terminate. Subscription to Reuters is estimated at Pounds 14,000 per dealer per year. Reuters' attachment to video feeds has also been a source of criticism. Traditionally, subscribers to Reuters or Telerate bought the service in the form of fixed pages of data. The arrival of digital feeds in the 1980s delivered raw data that in-house computers can rearrange to suit the user's needs. Technically literate dealers praise digital technology, but there remains a substantial demand for simple video feeds. Prism, a colour video switch introduced two years ago by Reuters, has sold well. Phase 2 of Reuter's Dealing 2000, itself an enhancement to the traditional Reuter's Monitor Dealing Service, is imminent. With Phase 2, dealers will have electronic matching - inserting an order for a currency, amount and price. The central computer will match bids and select the best deal; automatic dealing, but on a strictly optional basis and from the one information provider no dealer can afford to be without. A Reuter's spokesman picks choice as a prime attribute of Dealing 2000 - including the option to hold familiar conversations with foreign exchange sparring partners on the other side of the globe. Reuters believe that this is where Telerate's offensive foundered. Of TTS, the Reuters spokesman observes that 'dealers wanted automation, (but) they didn't want to become automatons'. Like Telerate and its decision to incorporate the popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet in its products, Reuters has acknowledged the importance of familiar PC software. Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet now has a formal link to the Reuter's Money 2000 information feed. California-based Quotron also recognises the popularity of the PC. Its FIX Trader runs on a PC using a large Digital Equipment Vax machine as the 'engine'. Since its launch two years ago, FIX Trader has been sold to 90 banks, with between 10 and 20 more signing on every month. 'Our system lets you choose between free and fixed format. We have had the benefit of learning from others' mistakes', says a Quotron spokeswoman. What the banks have learned from recent history is to watch costs. Foreign exchange dealers are expensive, and it helps to know which of them is making money. Dublin-based software house Kindle has been selling applications to major banks since 1979. It recently polled 75 customers and sales prospects to find out what they wanted from foreign exchange technology. Ms Rosemary Bowe, a former foreign exchange spot dealer with the Bank of Ireland who is now Kindle's senior banking consultant, explains that almost all of the 75 banks came up with 'exactly the same requirement' - they wanted to cost the dealers position by position. 'The main thing was to know each position by the end of the day, and the profit and loss by the dealer', she says. This emphasis on costing is hardly surprising. But what preoccupies the suppliers is how to keep up spending on technology when customers are prepared to shed valuable staff. Kindle's answer was to buy in the Strategy Treasury Online Risk Management System (Storm), a decision support system for dealers, from a US company. Kindle decided that since 'we don't have the money or the time to develop our own deal capture and processing system', it made sense to buy in a product that had proved itself in the market. Large information providers find it difficult to admit that an outside program is what the customer wants. But the risks involved in following internal convictions are obvious from the TTS fiasco. War produces fierce propaganda, but it also causes casualties.</p>

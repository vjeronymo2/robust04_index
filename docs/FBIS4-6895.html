			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- Japanese Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii tried again Sunday to convince his U.S.  counterpart about Japan's measures to lift the economy.    Fujii said he told U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen  that  the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package adopted in  February is proceeding "steadily" and "the economy is gradually  showing brightness." He was speaking to reporters after  emerging from a 30-minute talk with Bentsen at the Treasury  Department ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central  bankers from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in  the afternoon.    Fujii said he also explained that a policy accord newly  reached by the coalition parties endorsed the direction for  "comprehensive" tax reform to be decided in June and enacted by  the end of the year.    He did not say whether he told Bentsen about the scale and  other details in continuing the 5.47 trillion yen cut in income  and residential taxes included in the February package for only  fiscal 1994 that started April 1.    Bentsen was unavailable for comment on the talks. But he  previously said the single-year tax plan is not enough for Japan  to boost domestic demand and reduce trade surplus, and has  called on Japan to take further fiscal measures.    Fujii said he heard no particular requests from Bentsen on  the matter during the talks.    While citing improvements in the economy, Fujii said he also  told Bentsen that Japanese economy is "not as weak as" the  projections released last week by the International Monetary  Fund (IMF).    The IMF said in its twice-yearly world economic outlook that  Japan's economic growth in terms of real gross domestic product  (GDP) is expected at 0.7 percent in 1994.    The Japanese Government is projecting a 2.4 percent growth  for fiscal 1994.    Fujii declined to comment on currency exchange rates, saying  the two financial leaders agreed not to make any public comment.  When pressed later by reporters whether exchange rates were  raised at the meeting, a Japanese official said only Fujii made  an overall presentation of the Japanese economy "from various  points."    Japanese officials briefing reporters said Fujii spent most  of the 30-minute session with Bentsen trying to explain the  current condition of the Japanese economy.    They said Fujii assured Bentsen that the new cabinet to be  formed under Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will continue to keep  policy unchanged toward deregulating the Japanese economy and  carrying out economic reform.    Regarding the stalled trade talks with the United States,  Japanese officials said Fujii emphasized the importance of  Japan-U.S. relations in suggesting Japan's desire to resume the  so-called "framework" talks as soon as possible.    Fujii also explained that Japan's trade surplus has started  to decline, noting the Japanese current account surplus shrank  in yen terms last year, the officials said.    Japanese officials said Fujii also pledged Japan's  cooperation with the U.S. in extending aid to Russia.</p>

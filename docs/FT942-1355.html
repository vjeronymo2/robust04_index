			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Patten's job at risk in the wake of apology for 'nutter' slur Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday faced Tory backbench calls for his dismissal after he was faced with paying almost Pounds 100,000 in settlement and costs for calling Professor Tim Brighouse, Birmingham's chief education officer, a 'nutter'. Many Conservative MPs privately urged the minister to resign before the prime minister's forthcoming cabinet reshuffle, describing his remarks as 'deeply embarrassing' and lacking judgment. While the Department for Education said Mr Patten had no intention of going voluntarily, he is now expected to be a casualty of the ministerial reshuffle. Mr Patten must pay the legal costs and damages - which were not revealed but were estimated by those close to Prof Brighouse at Pounds 100,000 - out of his personal resources. Neither the department nor the Conservative party will pay the damages, as he made his original comments while speaking in a personal capacity. The department said it did not know whether Mr Patten had any insurance to help meet the claim. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, described the incident as 'a private matter'. The remarks came in a fringe meeting at last year's Conservative party conference. In answer to questions from the floor, Mr Patten described Mr Brighouse as a nutter and a madman who threatened to cause damage to education in Birmingham as he already had in Oxfordshire. Mr Patten was yesterday left with few friends in the Commons. An officer of the 1922 committee summed up the mood of many Conservative MPs when he described the incident 'as the final nail in Mr Patten's coffin'. He added: 'He should go now; but if he does not the Whips have been told in no uncertain terms that he has lost all support from the backbenchers.' The apology is unreserved, and with few, if any, recent precedents for a secretary of state. The statement read in court said: 'Mr Patten now recognises that his remarks were false and without any justification whatsoever', and that he recognised Mr Brighouse's competence, integrity and dedication.

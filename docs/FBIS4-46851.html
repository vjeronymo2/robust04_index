			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Daniklin: "Profession? Killer. </F> First They Are Hired for `Hit Jobs'; Then They Are Invariably  `Eliminated' as Undesirable Witnesses"]    [Text] About seven years ago journalists using the English  word "killer" had to explain what it meant in Russian. These  days it is one of the most popular words in our newspapers. And  here is why. According to the information of the MVD [Ministry  of Internal Affairs], last year almost 30,000 people died at the  hands of their own criminal compatriots. Among them were a  large number who were murdered by contract. However, it is  virtually impossible to cite the exact number of contract  killings: Investigations into such crimes are difficult, and,  indeed, no such concept yet exists in the criminal code.    A contract killing costs money, and a lot of it. It is rare  for one vagrant to hire another to kill a third. More often it  is business rivals who are killed. Or businessmen refusing to  pay their dues. Or criminal kingpins from rival gangs.    According to the preliminary data of the Russian MVD Main  Administration for Combating Organized Crime, last year a  contract character was officially established to 237 murder  cases. True, as far as exposing the criminals and bringing them  to justice is concerned, results were more modest -- only 65  murder cases were thus solved. In effect, Dmitriy Medvedev,  chief of a department of this administration says, there are  significantly more contract killings, but it is sometimes simply  impossible to prove it.    Often a murder has all the hallmarks of a "contract job,"  but  there were apparently no reasons for such a grave outcome for  the victim. Professionals involved in investigating these  terrible crimes confidently state that around 80 percent of  those who fall within a killer's sights either themselves  belonged to the criminal world formerly, or were in close  contact with it. The remaining 20 percent were victims of their  own intractability and refusal to pay their dues.... As a rule,  the whole thing revolves around very large sums of money.    The tradition has arisen among respectable businessmen of  surrounding themselves with bodyguards. As practice shows, this  is no obstacle for a professional killer. All that happens is  that collateral victims are added to the main target. The  murder of the well-known St. Petersburg businessmen Vagin may  serve as an illustration of this conclusion: In addition to  Vagin himself, the militia found a further three corpses at the  scene of the crime. Bodyguards.    The most sensational contract killing of recent times in  Moscow was the murder of Otari Kvantrishvili. Neither a host of  bodyguards, nor a colossal network of connections saved him from  the fateful shot. The murderer has not been found to this day,  and no serious breakthroughs in the investigation are evidently  to be expected in the near future. Initially, one version was  that the killer was not a professional -- the bullet was fired  from a small caliber rifle ("Couldn't they get hold of a more  reputable weapon?") Experienced officers from the Main  Administration for Combating Organized Crime hold the opposite  opinion: A small caliber rifle is the idle murder weapon, but  only in the hands of a professional. When a shot is fired to  the head, the bullet pierces one wall of the skull; it does not  have the velocity to pierce the second, and begins to richochet  wildly in the head, turning the brains to jelly. The success  rate is 100 percent.    The investigations into the deaths of Nikolay Likhachev,  chairman of the board of "Rosselkhozbank," Sergey Dubov,  president of the "Novoye Vremya" publishing house, Valeriy  Vlasov, director of "Valeriy's" casino, and many others, have  all fallen flat.    In recent times (and extremely unexpectedly) yet another  category of victims has emerged -- major gangland kingpins and  godfathers. There is even talk that the MVD has set up a  special hit squad. Colonel Medvedev's comment on these rumors  was categorical: Rubbish!    As a class of professionals, hitmen have appeared in our  society comparatively recently: Supply has arisen to meet the  demand. Former heroes of the Afghan campaign, special purpose  troops, separated KGB officers -- they have already been taught  to kill professionally. Or to defend: A killer with the  sobriquet Andron somehow fell into the hands of operatives. It  turned out that he had previously served as a personal bodyguard  to Boris Pugo, the former USSR interior minister.    Dmitriy Medvedev relates that the departments engaged in the  battle with organized crime have not only tried to set up a data  bank on "working" killers, but have even begun preventive work  with those inclined to choose this profession. The Main  Administration for Combating Organized Crime has already  gathered information on 37 hitmen. This already represents a  great deal of work -- after all, it takes the work of hundreds  of officers to expose each one of these "figures."    Certain conclusions and generalizations have also been made.  There are two categories in the professional hitmen's "guild" --  lone gunmen and squads. Neither are long-lived. A lone gunman  who gives a poor account of himself is "rubbed out" by the  contractors themselves after two or three jobs. In the squads,  if the gunmen see one of their comrades on the brink of getting  busted (if he lands up in the station, he will drop everyone in  it), he is also "rubbed out" -- the collective survival instinct  operates.    Sometimes you meet with "specialists" with several dozen  corpses to their name -- they are highly valued and well paid in  the criminal world; they even manage to occupy a certain niche  in the criminal hierarchy. But in the end, even these are  rubbed out: They know too much about too many people, and become  dangerous. The case of one Bakulev from Izhevsk is extremely  typical. He had more than 30 murders to his name. The militia  followed his trail (more accurately, followed the corpses in his  trail), but at the last moment, he mysteriously vanished.  Finally Bakulev was found. Murdered. His own kind settled  accounts with him.    Squads of hitmen are more of a problem -- you cannot wipe  out  the whole gang overnight. And if they fall into the hands of  the militia, their friends on the outside do not spare money in  hiring the best lawyers.    The "activity" of the squads usually has an itinerant  character -- "first aid" in reverse. One such squad is now in a  detention center; more detailed information about it cannot be  given at the present time.    Everyone is always interested to know how much it costs to  have somebody murdered. There are no hard-and-fast tariffs  here. For instance, a gang of five hitmen in Kandalashka asked  the extortionate price of 20 "lemons" [million rubles] for the  murder of a prestigious person. And in Moscow there is  information that hitmen get hundreds of thousands of dollars for  prominent personalities. For conspiratorial reasons hitmen are  frequently hired through third, fourth, and fifth persons, and  these "contractors" and "subcontractors," as in any normal deal,  also add on their "trade surcharge" -- as a result the price for  fulfilling the contract increases appreciably.    Operatives who regularly take part in the investigation of  such crimes note one detail: Today any weapon is put in the  hand of the hired killer, even including weapons of which the  American and European special services, for instance, have  themselves only a single example in their arsenals. Neither  cost nor transport across any borders is any object.    And although there are reports of contract killings almost  every day, as far as is known, not one criminal case has been  brought to court in which a well-known hitman has been in the  dock. It just so happens that he does not live to face trial,  even given robust health. And this is understandable: Who  needs sensational exposures? Only the press.    This is how the analysts in militia uniform are inclined to  assess the situation as regards contract killers today. But  what about the state? What new rights has it given to the  militia so that it can react properly to an attack by hired  killers? Just imagine, the operational workers say: Is it  possible to solve a murder and collect sufficient irrefutable  evidence on a suspect within 72 hours of initial detention?  What planet do our legislators live on, if they stubbornly  refuse to recognize even the following fact: In just six years,  murders have become eight times more frequent in our capital.    Anatoliy Yashkin, deputy chief of the Russian MVD Main  Administration for Combating Organized Crime, admitted that  law-enforcement organs have themselves probably been  insufficiently forceful in their demands on legislators. And  indeed: It is possible to institute criminal proceedings  against a suspected hired killer, and even gather the necessary  evidence. But as for getting to the client who hired his  services... The practice of the best foreign law-enforcement  systems testifies that it is possible to get somewhere only when  the organizer of the murder receives a sterner penalty than the  actual killer. There is no other way of fighting the mafia.  But here people believe that there is and say: Hey, guys,  don't be yellow.    But the guys are not yellow. They become hitmen -- the pay  is good, and they are in the news every day.</p>

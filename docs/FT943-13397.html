			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Kim Il-sung funeral 'draws 2m' North Korea claimed 2m people, almost a tenth of the country's population, attended funeral services yesterday in Pyongyang for President Kim Il-sung. The ceremony reflected the huge cult of personality Mr Kim created during his 46 years of autocratic rule as Great Leader. A hearse carrying his black coffin, partially covered by the red flag of the ruling Korean Workers' party, paraded through the normally empty boulevards of the capital during a 40km, five-hour journey as mourners paid their last respects. A funeral rite was held in front of the palace, attended by a sombre Mr Kim Jong-il, the eldest son and designated successor of the president, and other members of the political elite. Mr Kim junior may officially succeed his father during another memorial ceremony scheduled for today. But it is unclear whether he will assume both positions of party general secretary and president left vacant by his father's death, in addition to head of the armed forces.</p>

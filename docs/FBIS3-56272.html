			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by Dmitriy </F> Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has expressed satisfaction  with the start of a Russian-American summit in Moscow. "All  goes well," he told an Interfax correspondent after the first  round of talks on Thursday morning [13 January], lasting 20  minutes longer than scheduled.    President Bill Clinton arrived in Moscow at about 01:00 on  Thursday en route from Kiev, where he held two hours of talks  with Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk during a brief stopover at  the local airport.    In a welcoming speech at the formal ceremony at the Kremlin,  to which Clinton was ten minutes late, Yeltsin stressed that  their previous summit in Vancouver laid down the groundwork of  U.S.- Russian partnership and marked the start of their personal  friendship.    The Russian leader expressed the hope that current summit  talks would be far-reaching, practical and comprehensive.    In a reply speech, Clinton said this summit was taking place  at an historic moment marking the start of bilateral cooperation  for the sake of the future of Europe and the world at large. He  pledged cooperation in creating a new security structure in  Europe, advocating democratic values and a free economic system  to help towards the advancement of all countries.    Clinton said the two sides, meeting in full strength, would  discuss concrete economic reforms that would help the Russian  people reap real benefits from the ongoing transformations.    "Russia will continue reforms and there is no question of  their slow down." This remark, made by Yeltsin when he met with  Clinton at the head of a larger delegation, became the theme of  the second hour-long meeting of the two presidents in the  Kremlin Thursday.    Following the end of this round of talks Oleg Lobov,  secretary of the National Security Council, told Interfax that  the meeting had demonstrated "America's willingness to provide  effective support for Russian reform by paying some of its  social costs."    In particular, Clinton assured the Russian president that he  had succeeded in having Congress appropriate $900 Mn [million]  for aid to Russia in 1995.    Furthermore, numerous funds, especially one supporting small  business, would be launched. The U.S. is prepared to allocate  $300 Mn for that purpose. The Clinton Administration is making  $100 Mn available for a recently established American-Russian  reconstruction of large factories fund.    "Solid support" has also been pledged for Russia's joining  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Duties will be  lifted from 4,400 Russian products in the U.S. market. The U.S.  secretary of Commerce will arrive in Russia in March with a team  of experts to study the possibility of closer contacts between  U.S. businessmen and Russian state- and privately owned  businesses, Lobov said. In his words, Clinton asked Yeltsin to  help in finding partners for U.S. businesses.    Russia sees the NATO-approved Partnership for Peace program  as an important step forward and a serious test of the existing  partnership between Russia, the U.S. and other NATO states,  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Interfax.    Speaking after a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister of  Moldova Ion Botnaru, he said the expansion of NATO to include  new members would be a simplistic solution. Kozyrev did not  contest the right of other countries to join the alliance but  "this could lead to the creation of new barriers in Europe if  implemented."    In his words, Russia's voice was heeded by NATO, Eastern and  Central Europe. This is a case illustrating that a short cut is  not always optimal, leading nowhere and to wrong decisions,  Kozyrev said. By contrast, he added, a longer road can lead to  the right destination.    The minister said the Partnership for Peace proposal had  been  discussed by Yeltsin and Clinton on Thursday and that both of  them were satisfied it implied partnership rather than  membership.    Kozyrev spoke of having discussed the problem with U.S.  secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier in the day. "It is  too early yet to say how the period of partnership will end,"  the minister said. "One option is to expand NATO by accepting  new members, including Russia, something we do not rule out," he  said. Other options are also possible, he said, including the  creation of broader security systems and the consolidation of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The minister called for  efforts to be taken in parallel in all those directions but all  of these must end up in greater stability and cooperation in  Europe.    For his part, Botnaru spoke of seeing his talks with the  Russian foreign minister as a step on the road to implementing  the Partnership for Peace plan.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, who held discussions while Yeltsin and  Clinton conferred elsewhere in the Kremlin, finalized four  documents that have to be signed "at the ministerial level," in  particular agreements on air traffic, on cooperation in health  care and biomedical research, on cooperation in research in  radiation impact on human health and the environment, and a  memorandum of intent on cooperation in expert control, Galina  Sidorova, the political adviser of the Russian foreign minister,  told Interfax.    She noted that Kozyrev and Christopher will also make a  joint  statement on the Middle East. "The presidents will issue a joint  Moscow Declaration and make two statements, on human rights and  on nuclear nonproliferation," she said.    According to Sidorova, Kozyrev and Christopher also  discussed  the January 14 meeting of the Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian  presidents. "We are confident that this meeting will culminate  in signing documents on the nuclear weapons stationed in  Ukraine. Kozyrev observed, however, that making sure that the  documents are implemented was even more important," Sidorova  said.    She also told Interfax that Kozyrev and Christopher had a  thorough talk on the results of the Brussels NATO summit. "The  Russian foreign minister emphasized that Moscow regarded the  Partnership for Peace program as an invitation for partnership  and tangible cooperation with that organization rather than  staying in its ante-room," Sidorova said.    In her words, the most important item in that program for  Russia was actual cooperation in military exercises and  adjustment of military doctrines. "It would be premature to say  now where this will lead to, whether Russia and other East  European countries will join NATO or NATO and all of us will  become a broader European security organization," the foreign  minister's adviser said.</p>

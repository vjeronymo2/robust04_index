			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Unions broaden scope of lobbying THIS year's Conservative party conference is providing further evidence that unions are serious about broadening the scope of their political lobbying. After Labour's fourth consecutive election defeat, the traditional demonstration outside the conference is being replaced with a more professional lobbying of government and Tory MPs. The UCW postal workers' union is leading the way with a reception today to which it has invited 200 MPs to discuss the privatisation of the Parcelforce subsidiary of the Post Office. Delegates from Swan Hunter, the troubled Tyneside ship builder, are also expected in Brighton. Inspired by the government's reduced majority, unions believe it is worth lobbying Tory MPs on the forthcoming Employment Bill, especially on points that enjoy only lukewarm support from employers. Leaders of the Trades Union Congress were in Brighton yesterday to lobby against the abolition of the wages councils, which set minimum pay rates in several service industries. Abolition is expected in the Employment Bill although, contrary to the TUC's literature, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, is unlikely to mention abolition in her speech on Thursday. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said that the abolition of wages councils would be a signal for employers to cut wages for many more workers than the 2.4m covered by the councils. He also said that abolition would have a disproportionate effect on women's pay. Mr David McCrossen, a Brighton-based official of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said that since wages councils rulings had stopped being applicable to people under 21, he knew of 18-year-old hairdressing assistants earning Pounds 1 an hour. He also cited a local 16-year-old kitchen worker on 61.5p an hour, Pounds 24 for a 39-hour week.</p>

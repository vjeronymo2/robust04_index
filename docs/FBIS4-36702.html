			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the international coordination  committee of donor states, by Sa'id Mu'addi on 12 June; place  not given; from the "With the Events" program--recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Now that funds from the donor nations  have been delivered, is the road open for 'Arafat to come to the  self-rule area?    [Sha'th] Without a doubt. President 'Arafat is returning to  his homeland, in any case. But armed with support, he stands a  better chance of doing something for his people and, at the same  time, building the Palestinian authority.    [Mu'addi] There are conflicting reports about the date for  Mr. Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area. Do you know  when he will arrive?    [Sha'th] I am afraid I do not know for sure. President  'Arafat has his own schedule and plans. He is now preparing for  the African summit in Tunis. He has to tie up some loose ends  before he leaves Tunis. He cannot leave anyone behind without a  plan of action. He cannot leave and close PLO offices in Tunis  just like that. He does not want to leave the impression that  he is letting anyone down. There are a few things that he must  attend to before he moves out from Tunis. I was in touch with  him yesterday, and today in the morning, and just a few minutes  ago. I can tell you that he is coming before the end of the  month, God willing.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, you have attended the recent conference  of the donor nations in Paris, where a decision was made to  extend at $42 million grant to the Palestinians. How will the  money be spent?    [Sha'th] This is part of the $77 million that represent the  deficit in the current budget. The money will also cover vital  projects to help those Palestinians who have been hurt the most.  The money will not cover the long-term projects toward which the  donor nations pledged $720 million for this year. Work on some  of these projects is already in progress with the participation  of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the Palestinian  Housing Authority, and the UN Development Fund. These are  separate projects. The Paris meeting considered only how to  plug the deficit in the current expenses, in other words the  finances required for running the Palestinian government and the  upkeep of the Palestinian police force. The money will also go  toward reducing unemployment in Gaza and rehabilitating freed  detainees and the disabled and wounded and those who have  suffered the most as a result of the protracted struggle.    [Mu'addi] There have recently been some complications  regarding the Palestinian detainees and collaborators. How did  the agreement between Israel and the PLO address these two  points?    [Sha'th] As far as the detainees are concerned, the  agreement is very clear. By the fifth week of the signing of  the agreement, 5,000 detainees are supposed to have been freed.  Israel is supposed to have freed 5,000 detainees as of today.  Other than that to which the PLO committed itself, they will  not be obligated to anything. In my opinion, this is a fair  condition. The Palestinian government and opposition should not  differ about the general conditions under which the detainees  are released; namely a commitment to the peace process and the  terms agreed upon between the PLO and Israel.    Regarding the presence of these freed prisoners in Jericho  or  elsewhere, the agreement calls for those who were imprisoned for  common rather than political crimes -- there are those who were  guilty of theft, smuggling, and murder that have nothing to do  with resistance and the struggle in which we were involved -- to  be handed over to the Palestinian authority either to be  incarcerated or put on parole. Since the Palestinian authority  will be active only in Gaza and Jericho in the coming three  months, these should remain in the self-rule area until the  Palestinian authority extends to the entire West Bank. As for  the political prisoners who were convicted on political counts  and for their engagement in acts of resistance, they must be  freed to return to their homes in Gaza, Jericho, the West Bank,  and Jerusalem. These are the conditions laid out in the  agreement which we have to implement, and we must see to it that  these detainees lead free lives in their homes with their  families so that the peace begins in earnest and so we may leave  the past conflict behind us. With the release of the 5,000  detainees, negotiations should have begun without delay to draw  up a timetable for freeing the rest of the detainees and  prisoners along the same lines and principles which we agreed  should govern the freeing of the first 5,000.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, when do you expect to arrive with your  family in the self-rule area?    [Sha'th] Tuesday, the day after tomorrow, God willing.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you so much.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

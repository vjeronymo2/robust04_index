A principal investigator who has conducted research, published the findings, and has specific authority and responsibility to carry out the proposed project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Demonstrated experience in conducting, evaluating, and publishing injury control research (as previously defined) on the applicant's project team.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Effective and well-defined working relationships within the performing organization and with outside entities which will ensure implementation of the proposed activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. An explanation of how research findings could lead to the development of injury control interventions within 3&hyph;5 years of project start-up. Furthermore, how the research findings might be disseminated and implemented through organizations (such as public health agencies) or systems, both public and private.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. The ability to carry out an injury control research project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. The overall match between the applicant's proposed theme and research objectives, and the program priorities as described under the heading ``Programmatic Interests'' and Injury Control in the 1990s: A National Plan for Action and Healthy People 2000.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Grant funds will not be made available to support the provision of direct care services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia agreements (as set forth in the PHS Grants Policy Statement) as necessary to meet the requirements of the program and strengthen the overall application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Programmatic Interests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant applications for unintentional injury prevention and control research are sought. The focus of grants should reflect the broad-based need to control injury morbidity, mortality, disability, and costs. Special consideration may be given to applications requesting one or two years of funding. One-year pilot projects are encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In prevention, there is special programmatic interest in research which evaluates the effectiveness of interventions in preventing injuries or reducing their impact and develops the basic sciences of injury (i.e., biomechanics and epidemiology). This research might evaluate one or more different approaches to implementing a specific intervention strategy for which there is already existing evidence of effectiveness (e.g., protective helmets for bicycle riders, energy-absorbing playground surfaces, lowered tap water temperatures, etc.). In addition, there is a need to develop new intervention strategies or examine intervention strategies for which evidence of effectiveness is either sparse or totally lacking (e.g., public education and information campaigns, teaching infants to swim, interior design innovations to prevent falls among older persons, etc.). Interventions chosen for evaluation should have a significant potential for reduction in injury morbidity, mortality, disability, or cost. Special consideration will be given to grant applications which target populations at high risk for injuries and their consequences, including adolescents, children, racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, farm families, and people with low incomes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In acute care, there is special programmatic interest in intensifying the role of the emergency department and in-patient hospital trauma services in regard to public health surveillance and prevention of traumatic injuries. In acute care settings, identifying underlying risk factors for injury and intervening to reduce or eliminate them can help minimize the impact of violence, substance abuse, and other factors associated with injury recidivism. There is also a need to assess the impact of national and State health care reforms on prehospital emergency medical services, emergency department care of the injured, in-patient trauma care, and rehabilitation services. There is interest in the identification of optimal methods for diagnosing and treating patients who have sustained major trauma, including central nervous system injuries, burns, and multiple organ system injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

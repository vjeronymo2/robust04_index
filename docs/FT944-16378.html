			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: CBS holds dividend in spite of slide Net income at CBS, the US television broadcasting network, slumped 51 per cent in the third quarter. The company, which is regarded as a takeover candidate after the failure of its proposed merger with the QVC home shopping group in June, blamed the fall mainly on a higher tax charge and the absence of one-off gains. However, sales were down because of the absence of professional football and baseball coverage this year. CBS lost the rights to both last year, being outbid for professional football by Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox network. The major league baseball season was cancelled this year by a players' strike. Results were affected by higher costs for prime-time film showings, lower ratings for day-time programmes and lower syndication sales, the company said. However, Mr Lawrence Tisch, chairman, said operating results from the company's own TV and radio stations were higher as a result of strong local advertising expenditure. Sales fell 4 per cent for the quarter to Dollars 726m while pre-tax profit was down 44 per cent at Dollars 82.3m. Adjusting for a one-off legal settlement from Viacom last year, the underlying fall was 30 per cent. After a tax charge of 29 per cent compared to 19 per cent, net income was Dollars 58.4m against Dollars 118.2m, or 77 cents a share compared with Dollars 1.48. The quarterly dividend was held at 10 cents. CBS shares closed Dollars 9 lower at Dollars 330.</p>

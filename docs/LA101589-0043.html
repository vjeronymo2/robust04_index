			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE;  </P> <P> JAMES C. CORMAN;  </P> <P> LOBBYIST SAVORS LIFE WITH FAMILY BUT MISSES CONGRESSIONAL CAREER  </P> <P> Even now, nearly a decade after voters in his San Fernando Valley district  abruptly ended his 20-year congressional career, James C. Corman still wears  his regret on his well-tailored sleeve.  </P> <P> "It's just awful to be doing something you love and you think you do reasonably  well, and it's all gone in one election and you can't do anything about it,"  Corman recalled recently over breakfast amid the leather furnishings and cherry  walls of the sumptuous office where he works as a Washington lobbyist. "It's  gone."  </P> <P> He would mount an autumnal comeback in a minute if he could regain the coveted  seniority that made him a leading Democratic advocate for the poor and  disadvantaged on the influential House Ways and Means Committee, which crafts  national tax legislation.  </P> <P> "He's probably one of the few people I know who isn't happier in private life  than he was in public life," said Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr. (D-Ind.), a former  colleague and close friend of Corman's. "He's a bleeding heart; he's an  idealist."  </P> <P> But make no mistake: Corman, 68, has found there is life after Congress since  Republican Bobbi Fiedler rode the crest of the Valley's anti-school-busing  movement in 1980 to oust him by a mere 752 votes out of 153,770 cast.  </P> <P> The past 8 1/2 years as a successful Capitol Hill lobbyist have provided the  courtly lawyer with the income and time to do things with his youthful second  family that a congressional schedule and salary would have vetoed.  </P> <P> "You ask Jim what time it is and he'll say, 'Let me tell you about Adam and  Brian,' " Jacobs said, referring to Corman's sons, ages 10 and 9. "I've never  seen a more devoted father."  </P> <P> Bereft of the power to shape public policy, Corman has been blessed with a new  life of private prerogatives as his prime focus moved from the House to the  home. But, dapper in monogrammed shirts, leather suspenders and wing-tipped  shoes, the white-haired former resident of Van Nuys still frequents the  Capitol's marble halls.  </P> <P> Like more than 80 former House members, Corman has cashed in on his contacts  and knowledge of the institution and its issues, particularly often arcane tax  matters handled by the Ways and Means Committee, on which he was the  fourth-ranking member. He has made as much as $300,000 a year, five times his  highest salary as a lawmaker (House pay is now $89,500 a year).  </P> <P> His lobbying business, Corman Law Offices, includes such clients as MCA;  Tropicana Energy, a Texas-based ethanol manufacturer; shopping center magnate  Guilford Glazer; the U. S. League of Savings Institutions, and the American  Newspaper Publishers Assn. He has one partner, William Kirk, a Georgetown Law  School graduate and ex-counsel to the Ways and Means public assistance and  unemployment subcommittee that Corman headed.  </P> <P> Their top-paying client is the National Structured Settlements Trade Assn.,  whose members negotiate with plaintiffs and defendants in personal-injury cases  to stretch out payments through tax-free annuities or government bonds. They  support laws permitting legal cases to be settled this way rather than  requiring a lump-sum settlement.  </P> <P> Corman maintains that it is good public policy because victims are prevented  from dissipating huge one-shot payments and then turning to the government for  public assistance. But periodically he must beat back efforts by the Department  of the Treasury, which is displeased about the loss of tax revenue from  lump-sum payments, to change the law.  </P> <P> Corman and Kirk recently agreed to merge Jan. 1 with Silverstein &amp; Mullens,  a prominent Washington tax law firm. This will give the two partners additional  support services and potentially higher income. Otherwise, Corman said, "it  will not change the nature of what I do."  </P> <P> Just as he was respected for his integrity, intelligence and diligence as a  legislator, Corman is widely regarded as a savvy, well-prepared and unfailingly  gracious lobbyist.  </P> <P> "I don't think he's done anything to call that earlier reputation into  question," said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute  in Washington. "I have never heard anyone say, 'Look what this hypocrite's  doing' or that he's sold his soul for something or traded his access for  something that someone thought was appalling."  </P> <P> Such actions by others have prompted controversy on Capitol Hill over the  so-called alumni lobby. House ethics rules impose virtually no restrictions on  lobbying by former members (the Senate prohibits its ex-members from lobbying  senators and aides for one year). Executive branch employees face much tougher  revolving-door restrictions.  </P> <P> Ex-members have access that other lobbyists do not enjoy. They can roam the  House floor, although they are forbidden from lobbying there, and can work out  in the House gym.  </P> <P> "I never go on the House floor," Corman said, to avoid creating the appearance  that he might be violating the rule even if he were there for other reasons. As  for the gym, which he uses frequently, Corman said he often learns useful  things there, but he maintains that the information is also available in many  other places.  </P> <P> Other former members have drawn criticism by lobbying for interests they had  opposed while in office. Corman has generally avoided that reputation, although  he raised some eyebrows when he represented Texas Air Corp. President Frank C.  Lorenzo in his hotly contested takeover of Continental Airlines.  </P> <P> Corman points out that some of his paying clients are fighting for socially  responsible, if financially self-serving, goals. And many of his corporate  patrons are merely battling other private interests without a public interest  at stake. He's also done pro bono work for individuals who he feels have gotten  a raw deal from the system.  </P> <P> Moreover, Corman has turned down or dropped clients when he was uneasy with  their approach, possible conflicts of interest or their expectations about what  he could do for them, said Ken Bowler, vice president of Pfizer and a former  Corman associate. An example was the National Committee to Preserve Social  Security and Medicare, which Corman stopped representing amid criticism of its  high-pressure fund-raising methods and alarmist pronouncements.  </P> <P> Corman's success as an advocate starts with the expertise he acquired in the  House on tax, health and welfare issues. It also includes long hours -- he's  often in the office by 6:30 a.m. -- and the thoroughness and persuasive skills  honed during two decades in Congress. Then there is his knowledge of Ways and  Means Committee members, staff and process.  </P> <P> "You know the idiosyncrasies of various members," said Fiedler, who left  Congress in 1987 after an unsuccessful U. S. Senate bid and returned to  Northridge, where she does consulting and lobbying. "You know how to push their  hot buttons by couching an issue in a way that they would be sympathetic."  </P> <P> Corman's relationship with Bowler illustrates one advantage of his previous  position. Bowler, who was staff director of Corman's public assistance  subcommittee, joined him when he started his own lobbying firm. Later, he  returned to the Ways and Means Committee as deputy director and, eventually,  director, where he was a valuable contact for Corman.  </P> <P> "Jim combines the personal contacts that he had as a congressman, as a  well-known political figure in California, with the work habits of a new guy on  the block: the extra effort, the tremendous consideration to people in an  office, the kinds of things that make everyone have a very warm feeling toward  him," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who campaigned door-to-door  for Corman as a UCLA law student and now represents much of Corman's former  district.  </P> <P> "He's not caught up in his status as a distinguished 20-year veteran of  Congress," he said.  </P> <P> Indeed. Less than a year after Fiedler had waged a tough, often personal  campaign to oust him, Corman visited her on behalf of MCA.  </P> <P> "It was obviously very difficult for him," Fiedler recalled. "He was sweating  very profusely and was extremely tense. I understood that and did everything I  could to make it as comfortable for him as possible."  </P> <P> Corman, who refuses to say anything negative about Fiedler, had a trace of  bitterness in his voice when he recalled the aftermath of their meeting. "She  called my client," he said, "and told them that was a stupid thing for them to  do."  </P> <P> Corman also participates in the campaign contribution game, considered by many  a prerequisite of gaining access. He and 10 to 15 colleagues hold 10 breakfasts  a year with various members of Congress. Each lobbyist contributes $500 to the  visiting lawmaker's campaign.  </P> <P> "There's nobody I would invite in here or any of the guests would invite that  we couldn't get an appointment with," Corman said, downplaying the significance  of the contributions. "People we invite are people we want to see get  reelected."  </P> <P> Corman said he also makes personal contributions, but strictly to liberal  Democrats, and he remains committed to that political agenda. As a member of  the House Judiciary Committee, Corman helped pass landmark civil rights  legislation in the mid-1960s. He served on the National Advisory Commission on  Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, after the urban riots of the  late '60s.  </P> <P> It was the volatile race issue that proved his undoing in 1980, when Fiedler  mobilized increasingly conservative Valley voters behind the effort to end  court-ordered busing to integrate the Los Angeles school system. Corman backed  busing as a temporary, last-resort measure.  </P> <P> "Dear friends told him he should trim his sails," Jacobs said. "He thought it  would be habit-forming."  </P> <P> Jacobs is among those allies who angrily say that then-President Jimmy Carter  sealed Corman's doom when he conceded defeat to Ronald Reagan before the polls  had closed in California, causing some disheartened West Coast Democrats to  simply stay home. Corman refuses to blame Carter.  </P> <P> "I stood and yelled at the television, 'No, you can't do this!' " recalled  Nancy Malone, Corman's wife. "I knew that early concession meant a lot of  people wouldn't vote."  </P> <P> What made the defeat particularly painful was that, in the calculus of  congressional power, Corman had really arrived only a few years before he was  ousted. Only four years earlier, he had gained a much-desired spot on a  conference committee that make critical decisions reconciling the differences  in House and Senate versions of major bills.  </P> <P> For Corman, this calculus also ruled out a comeback in 1982 when redistricting  created a new Valley district that included most of Corman's former East Valley  constituents and moved Fiedler into solidly Republican territory. A return  would have left Corman at the bottom of the seniority ladder.  </P> <P> So, this son of a Kansas miner, who had known poverty as a Depression-era youth  and worked his way through UCLA and the USC School of Law, turned his energies  to making money and enjoying a new family.  </P> <P> "When I went to Congress, I was driving a 5-year-old car, I owed $25,000 on my  house and my kids were 7 and 12," Corman said. "When I left Congress 20 years  later, I owed $50,000 on my house, I was driving a 14-year-old car, my kid was  1 and my wife was pregnant."  </P> <P> Today, Corman drives a 1986 Cadillac Cimarron, and home is a majestic French  Colonial on three grandly wooded acres in affluent suburban McLean in northern  Virginia. Life is filled with the hurly-burly of his boys' hockey and football  practices, back-yard camping and family hikes, and museum outings.  </P> <P> Malone, an attractive, vivacious accountant who in 1978 became Corman's fourth  wife, is 24 years his junior. She was married once previously.  </P> <P> Corman also has two children, Mary Anne, 41, and James C. (Chuck) Jr., 36, from  his first marriage to Virginia Little, who died of cancer in 1966. His second  and third marriages ended in divorce.  </P> <P> Corman delights in round two of fatherhood. He drives the early-morning car  pool. He and Adam are surveying the world's scariest roller coasters (so far,  Knott's Berry Farm is No. 1). The family throws a renowned annual Christmas  party for 250 to 300 friends and acquaintances.  </P> <P> "I think it's been a tremendous compensation for the loss of his job," Bowler  said of Corman's second family.  </P> <P> "Life is very complex, and he can say very honestly that he thoroughly enjoys  having the time and the money to do the things with Nancy and the children that  his current job allows him to do. And he can still say, 'I want my job back on  the Ways and Means Committee.' "  </P></p>

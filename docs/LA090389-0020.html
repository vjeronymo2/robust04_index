			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOTH SIDES IN AFRICA'S LONGEST WAR LOOK FOR PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN ATLANTA  </P> <P> In what must be one of the more unlikely locales for such a meeting,  representatives of the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean People's  Liberation Front (EPLF) will come to America's Deep South this week to begin  preliminary negotiations toward the settlement of Africa's longest war.  </P> <P> This has been a 28-year struggle. The Eritreans seek independence for their  former Italian colony on the Red Sea coast; the Ethiopian government, among  many considerations, is intent on preserving its access to the sea. Conflict  has exacerbated the effects of recurrentfamines in northern Ethiopia and  produced an estimated 700,000 Eritrean refugees and killed half a million  people since 1961.  </P> <P> Until this summer, all attempts to bring the two sides into direct negotiations  had failed because of their intransigent positions. The negotiations starting  Thursday in Atlanta are the result of a drastically altered military situation  in Eritrea and the tireless shuttle diplomacy of former President Jimmy Carter,  whose International Negotiation Network, based in the Carter Center at Emory  University, will provide the forum for the first round of peace negotiations.  </P> <P> Starting last January, Carter talked repeatedly with Ethiopia's President  Mengistu Haile Mariam and Isseyas Aferworki, general secretary of the EPLF.  Aferworki, visiting the United States in May, stressed the EPLF's desire to  seek a political settlement overseen by a third party. Carter returned to  Ethiopia in late July and obtained Mengistu's approval for the Atlanta  negotiations.  </P> <P> "The parties cannot win through continued war, but both sides can win a  negotiated settlement," the former President said.  </P> <P> For several years the EPLF has sought a negotiated settlement to the war  through an internationally supervised referendum on Eritrea's political future.  One model they cite is a Zimbabwe plebiscite, organized in large part by the  Carter Administration during the late 1970s. But until this summer, Mengistu  was unwilling to negotiate publicly with the rebel organization. He has been  shoved to the bargaining table by a series of events that began in March, 1988,  when the EPLF destroyed a third of the Ethiopian army in Eritrea at the battle  of Afabet, capturing massive quantities of Soviet-supplied weaponry and forcing  the Ethiopians to abandon the western half of Eritrea.  </P> <P> The debacle at Afabet was followed by further Ethiopian defeats in Eritrea and  neighboring Tigre province, where the Tigre People's Liberation Front (TPLF) by  this March had driven Mengistu's armies from the entire province, including the  crucial Soviet-built air base at Mekeller. These military disasters produced a  coup attempt against Mengistu in mid-May, organized by the commanding generals  of the Ethiopian army.  </P> <P> Though the coup was foiled after heavy fighting in the Eritrean capital of  Asmara, the attempt demonstrated the army's disillusionment with Mengistu's  policy of "Everything to the War Front." In their radio broadcasts, coup  leaders called for a "peace dialogue" toward a negotiated settlement of the  war. Then, in the aftermath of the coup, the call for negotiations was taken up  by the Ethiopian Shengo -- the national Parliament that in the past served as a  rubber stamp for Mengistu's decisions.  </P> <P> The Shengo call for unconditional talks, accepting the EPLF demand for public  negotiations, reflected Mengistu's weak position following the failed coup.  That action decimated the Ethiopian officer corps -- more than 200 high-ranking  officers were arrested and eight leading generals executed. Perhaps the crucial  point is that Mengistu has been subjected to mounting pressure from the Soviet  Union to negotiate with the EPLF.  </P> <P> Since 1978 the Soviets, with their Cuban and East German allies, have been the  principal supplier of arms and military advisers to the Ethiopians. In return,  they were allowed to build a naval base in Eritrea's Dahlak archipelago. Today,  however, as Mikhail S. Gorbachev leads a reappraisal of Soviet military  commitments around the world, the level of support demanded by Mengistu has  begun to look increasingly like an anachronism from the discredited Brezhnev  era -- particularly in view of the disastrous failures of Mengistu's military  and economic programs during the last two years.  </P> <P> During Mengistu's visit to Moscow in July, 1988, Gorbachev reportedly told the  Ethiopian leader that "our unqualified military and economic commitment cannot  continue much further." As settlements to the conflicts in Afghanistan and  Angola have moved forward during the past year, Mengistu's intransigent  attitude placed him increasingly at odds with Gorbachev's foreign policy.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the Soviets did resupply the Ethiopian army with the large  quantities of heavy weapons lost at Afabet, and the EPLF reports that in recent  months the Ethiopians have received new shipments. Soviet arms supply both  sides in the Eritrean war, for the EPLF relies almost entirely on captured  Ethiopian weapons. The Soviets are consequently in a position to apply a great  deal of pressure on both sides to negotiate a political settlement but --  perhaps because of their involvement -- they have been unable or unwilling to  arrange peace negotiations themselves. An invisible Soviet hand must, however,  be recognized in the success of Carter's shuttle diplomacy.  </P> <P> It is ironic that Jimmy Carter should bring the warring sides to the  negotiating table, for it was Carter who decided to cut U.S. military aid to  Mengistu following the Ethiopian revolution. That decision paved the way for  Soviet intervention in support of Mengistu's avowedly Marxist government during  1978. The Eritreans argue that had it not been for this Soviet intervention,  they might have established an independent government in Eritrea during 1978,  because the withdrawal of U.S. military aid -- provided largely as "rent" for  the use of a military communications base in the Eritrean capital -- left the  Ethiopian army powerless to stop the Eritrean guerrillas' advance.  </P> <P> The true situation, however, was far more complicated. During the 1970s the  Eritreans were divided into a number of rival political organizations, each  with its own guerrilla army. Their disunity left them isolated internationally  and weakened militarily. Only in the early 1980s, after a bitter civil war  fought simultaneously with a series of massive Ethiopian offensives, was the  EPLF able to drive its rivals into the Sudan and assume complete leadership of  the independence struggle inside Eritrea.  </P> <P> In the West, and particularly in the United States, Ethiopia is no longer  regarded merely as another domino in an overarching East-West conflict. Now  Ethiopia is viewed as the scene of an immense human tragedy, exacerbated by the  continuation of the Eritrean war. The stage is thus set for a possible solution  to the conflict and, with it, a possible end to the cyclic war-famine in  northern Ethiopia.  </P> <P> But while the superpowers may hope for a peaceful resolution, specific regional  considerations that have fueled this bitter war for almost three decades still  remain. For example, if Eritrea were to become independent, how would Ethiopia  be guaranteed access to the sea? In particular, what would be the status of  Assab -- Addis Ababa's main port, the site of Ethiopia's only oil refinery and  a city separated from the rest of Eritrea by 200 miles of the hottest desert in  the world? And if Eritrea were to return to the autonomous status granted by  the United Nations in 1952, what would guarantee that it would not once again  be annexed by the far larger Ethiopian state, as happened in 1962?  </P> <P> With so much blood spilled between them, will the Eritrean and Ethiopian  leaders finally be able to face the compromises necessary to settle their  conflict? So many questions. Perhaps some answers will emerge this week in  Atlanta. One thing is certain: The people of Eritrea and Ethiopia desperately  need and desire peace.  </P></p>

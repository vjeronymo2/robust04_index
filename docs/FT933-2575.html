			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Interactive cable-TV music channel planned TELECOMMUNICATIONS Inc, the largest cable television systems operator in the US, and Germany's Bertelsmann music and entertainment group yesterday announced plans for a new interactive cable channel which will allow viewers to choose the pop videos they want to watch, as well as buying music-related products from home. The new channel, claimed to be the first of its kind, is an early example of the kind of service which US media companies hope will lead to a boom in inter-active, multi-media entertainment in the home. The two companies are forming a 50-50 joint venture to develop the channel, which they hope to roll out across the US over the next 12 months. TCI said that initially customers would have to use a telephone to order selections but that in two to three years' time new technology should allow them to do so using a remote control device. Bertelsmann is one of the world's leading record companies, with labels which include Arista Records and RCA Records. However, it said yesterday it hoped that the channel would also involve labels owned by other record companies. The channel will be offered to leading US cable operators in addition to TCI. Bertelsmann said the channel would be supported by advertising and would include home shopping. Some of the most successful US cable television channels focus on pop music. They include MTV, which mainly broadcasts pop videos and is rapidly spreading around the globe, and Country Music Television, which concentrates on country music videos and is one of the fastest-growing channels in America. However, the existing channels are not inter-active. Mr Fred Vierra, head of worldwide programming for TCI, said the new network marked 'the beginning of music made popular by consumer choice'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 17 May, the Administration Reform Promotion  Headquarters (chaired by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata) disclosed  a rough draft of an advisory report on deregulation proposals  for real estate policies. The report is expected to be  finalized by the headquarters' Housing and Real Estate Policies  Subcommittee before the end of this month.    The advisory report calls for relaxation of industrial  standards so that the Japanese construction market can accept  building materials approved by foreign standards. Regarding  real estate development, the advisory panel takes a prudent  stance toward a sweeping relaxation of regulations on building  volumes. On the other hand, the report advocates a review of  local government authorities for controlling land development  projects, noting local government bodies are excessively strict  to developers.    The Housing and Real Estate Policies Subcommittee has  already  submitted the draft report to the headquarters. Hereafter, the  draft will be finalized by cabinet ministers composing the  Administration Reform Promotion Headquarters, and the final  draft will be incorporated in the outline of external economic  measures which will be released in the end of June.    The subcommittee's draft report is calling for "deregulation  measures focused on urban areas," and, in tangible measures,  deregulation requests are made in 39 fields.    With respect to housing construction policies, the report  proposes the following deregulation measures: 1) international  standards and inspection data from foreign countries should be  broadly approved for accepting foreign-made building materials;  2) Japanese standards, such as the Japan Industrial Standards  (JIS) and Japan Agricultural Standards (JAS), should be relaxed;  and 3) water service departments and energy supply companies  should review their contractor systems to break certain local  contractors' monopoly for service work.    The advisory report is likely to arouse controversy on its  note that local government bodies' development guidance policies  have "some excessive restrictions." On that ground, the report  says local governments "must stop" allotting sewerage work  charges to developers. Local governments are likely to react  strongly to the proposal considered "lenient to developers."</p>

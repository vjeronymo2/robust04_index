			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> POSSIBLE CONFLICT IN NUCLEAR PLANT AUDITS  </P> <P> At least two firms hired by the Energy Department as independent investigators  of environmental and safety conditions at nuclear weapons plants are on the  payroll at facilities they investigated, government records show.  </P> <P> Others participating in the audits had bid for Energy Department contracts at  sites they studied, although they were not yet working there. Still others,  while not associated with the plants they audited, are prime contractors at  other nuclear bomb factories. Department guidelines for carrying out the  "independent tiger team" investigations include a provision aimed at avoiding  organizational conflicts of interest.  </P></p>

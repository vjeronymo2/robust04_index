			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francesco Verderami: "Elections: PDS Is Already </F> Coming Up With Its First Candidates"]    [Text] In PDS headquarters at Botteghe Oscure, they  anticipate sacrifices, exclusions, and shifts.    Rodota: Everyone is looking for a safe electoral  colleges and sometimes shamelessly. Iotti in Rome, Napolitano in  Naples, Occhetto in Emilia, D'Alema in Taranto. And AD  [Democratic Alliance] approaches Maurizio Costanzo.    Rome--Behind the very minor point of not knowing when the  next elections will be held hides the last big organizational  structure to survive the collapse of the First Republic. It is  the PDS, which has not awaited the decision of the Quirinale  [presidency of the Republic] to start selecting its candidates.  At PDS headquarters, a committee has been established that  includes secretariat coordinator Davide Visani; group leaders  D'Alema and Chiaranti; party president, Giglia Tedesco, and the  reform senator, Ranieri. The job of preparing the slate of  candidates is a difficult one, made even worse by the new  electoral system. It is new territory, as challenging as a  wager, both technically and politically because the commission  has already started running while the progressive alliance has  not yet left the starting gate. At party headquarters--where  several deputies who are reluctant to be nominated have been  summoned--they have discussed the criteria for selecting the  candidates. D'Alema explained that "to win, we have to have  credibility, not just in our platform but in the choice of the  new political class as well. The existing people will remain in  the race where they have a chance to win, otherwise they will  find themselves on the proportional lists. These words signal an  out and out revolution. Up until the last elections the big wigs  were able to ride to victory on the coattails of the party under  the protection of the proportional vote. This time they will  have to work to win all on their own, and anyone who cannot make  it...."    It is certain that some members of the old guard will no  longer be around this time. Chiarante sent a letter to Occhetto  saying that he had decided that "the time had come for him to  step aside. A while ago even Tortorella had said that that was  his intention as well, but now I am not sure," revealed former  party President Stefano Rodota, who himself is no longer willing  to run: "Also because no one has asked me to." The reformist  Pellicani, PDS deputy group leader in the Chamber of Deputies,  is also in doubt about what to do. But in comparison with this  small group of parliamentarians who want to sit this one out, we  have a huge throng of PDS leaders on the national level and a  host of obscure local dignitaries who want to sit in the next  Parliament.    The problem becomes a really difficult puzzle to solve when  you consider that the new electoral system holds few hopes of  success for the party's "bosses" in Lega areas and that the  future alliance will call for many sacrifices. In Ravenna, the  PDS will have to support the Republican La Malfa; in Umbria, it  will have to find some way to say no to the Socialist Manca. And  then there are the alliances with the Refoundation, the AD, the  Greens, and the Rete. "We are all looking for a safe electoral  college," says Rodota, "and in some cases shamelessly." Faraguti  of the DC was heard saying day before yesterday in the  Transatlantico [deputies' lounge]: "Why don't you try asking the  deputies currently in office how upset they are? We may have  Imposimato's declaration that he is in favor of a government  shakeup, but there are lots of people in the PDS who do not want  to give up their seat to Adornato."    While they are waiting to finalize the progressive lineup,  the PDS is beginning to fill in its own slots. At PDS  headquarters, they anticipate sacrifices, some exclusions, and  shifts.    For example, Nilde Iotti, who has always run in her own  region of Reggio Emilia, would be "transferred" to the  majoritarian and the proportional slates in Rome. The same fate  will befall Reichlin who would have to leave his own electorate  in Apulia to run on the proportional slate. Instead, prominent  positions have been reserved for the party bigwigs: Occhetto  will be the candidate on the majoritarian list in the heart of  communist Emilia and will also be "used"--as the new electoral  law allows--on three proportional slates. D'Alema will go to  Taranto, and Napolitano will run in Naples on the majoritarian  and proportional slates. The problem will be keeping the  candidacies secret. At PDS headquarters they explain: "With this  system, you have to avoid giving your opponents the `advantage'  of knowing your moves because they could plan their  countermoves." On the left, they are moving toward an alliance.  The Greens and the Rete intend to run together in the  proportional. Del Turco is proposing the same thing to the PRI  [Italian Republican Party], to the remains of the PSDI [Italian  Socialist Democratic Party] and to the social Christians. And  Bordon invites everyone to join together under the banner of the  Democratic Alliance, which is looking for prominent candidates  for the upcoming elections. It has a semi-commitment with  television commentator Maurizio Costanzo who has asked for some  time to think about it.</p>

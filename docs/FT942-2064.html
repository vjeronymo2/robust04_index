			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Redrow and A McAlpine combine A plan to build a Pounds 145m housing development south of Northwich, Cheshire, was announced jointly yesterday by Alfred McAlpine, the construction group, and Redrow, the housebuilder which came to the market earlier this year. The companies have combined to acquire 220 acres of land, payment for which is to be phased until 2001. The total cost of the land purchases, including acquiring certain properties and constructing a spine road, is thought to be in the region of Pounds 18m. This would be equivalent to 13 per cent of the expected total value of the development. Planning permission for the development of about 1,800 homes over 10 years has been granted by Vale Royal Borough Council. The development, to be known as Kingsmead, will provide shopping and community facilities and more than 40 acres of open space and a new access road to Northwich town centre. Construction is planned to start this autumn and will provide a range of homes from social housing to low density executive homes. Redrow raised Pounds 55.4m earlier this year to fund expansion. This formed part of a Pounds 117m flotation with Mr Steve Morgan, the founder, raising Pounds 62m on his own account. The shares, priced then at 135p, closed at 118p yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CZECH REGIME FORCED OUT BY PROTESTS;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: THE ENTIRE COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP RESIGNED. PARTY CHIEF MILOS  JAKES BECOMES THE THIRD LEADER TO BE SWEPT FROM OFFICE IN THE RECENT WAVE OF  PRO-DEMOCRACY UPHEAVALS. A TRIUMPHANT ALEXANDER DUBCEK CHEERS THE NEWS AND  SPEAKS TO A CROWD OF 300,000 PEOPLE.  </P> <P> The entire hard-line Communist Party leadership resigned Friday, forced from  power by a week of massive pro-democracy protests that surpassed even the  "Prague Spring" of 1968.  </P> <P> Party chief Milos Jakes became the third East Bloc leader to be swept out of  office in a stunning five-week wave of political upheaval that has washed over  the Communist world in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Little-known Karel Urbanek, a Politburo member only since October, 1988, was  elected by the party Central Committee in a secret ballot to replace Jakes, who  resigned along with the rest of the 13-man ruling Politburo and Secretariat.  </P> <P> Thousands of people poured into Wenceslas Square late Friday night, dancing and  singing at the news. The joyous celebration capped a day in which 300,000  people jammed the square for the triumphant return of Alexander Dubcek, the  bold reformer ousted in 1968.  </P> <P> "An old wise man said, 'If there once was light, why should there be darkness  again?' Let us act in such a way to bring the light back again," Dubcek had  earlier told the jubilant crowd.  </P> <P> Later, when he heard the news of the resignations, Dubcek and top dissidents at  a news conference jumped to their feet, shouted, "Hooray!" and hugged each  other joyously.  </P> <P> Urbanek, 48, is the former party leader of the Czech republic. He was a  surprise choice to replace Jakes and represented a break with the rigid  policies in place since Warsaw Pact tanks crushed Czechoslovakia's reforms in  1968. His selection seemed designed to boost the party's flagging standing  after a week of nationwide calls for its reform-resistant leaders to resign.  </P> <P> The resignations were offered at a closed-door session of the Central  Committee, which was expected to approve them without delay.  </P> <P> Jakes said the party had not instituted reforms quickly enough and had  underestimated the effect of the pro-democracy movement sweeping Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> In a terse dispatch, the official news agency CTK announced:  </P> <P> "The general secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Milos Jakes, and  all other members of the (ruling) Politburo and Secretariat submitted their  resignations so that a new leadership of the party could be elected. Jakes said  he hoped the newly elected organs of the party will contribute to a more  resolute implementation of the process of restructuring and democratization."  </P> <P> Restructuring and democratization have been key terms used by Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has inspired the reforms that have swept through his  own nation, Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Bulgaria.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia's leaders, who were in stalled after Warsaw Pact tanks crushed  Dubcek's "Prague Spring" reform movement in 1968, had resisted most of the  reforms adopted by their formerly hard-line Communist allies.  </P> <P> Since Nov. 17, hundreds of thousands of people have filled the streets of  Prague and other cities demanding democratic reforms and the end of the  Communists' monopoly on power. They have been the largest demonstrations in the  nation's history.  </P> <P> "For a week, our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere accompanied by large  demonstrations," CTK quoted Jakes as saying. "The tension is gradually  spreading to other places in the republic. We must openly say that our country  is at a fateful crossroads."  </P> <P> "We have underestimated completely the processes taking place in Poland,  Hungary and especially recently in East Germany and their effect and influence  on our society," said Jakes, who was responsible for the expulsion from the  party of half a million Communists, including Dubcek.  </P> <P> In December, 1987, Jakes was named Communist Party chief to succeed Gustav  Husak, who came to power in April, 1969, eight months after the Soviet-led  invasion. Jakes, 67, was seen as a bureaucrat and party functionary whose  speeches and personality have made little or no public impact despite his long  years in high office.  </P> <P> Dubcek, 67, made his first public appearance in Prague since the party purge in  June, 1970. Since his ouster, he has worked as a low-level employee of the  state forestry services and has lived in virtual seclusion.  </P> <P> "Dubcek, Dubcek!" and "Long live Dubcek!" the flag-waving crowd yelled as he  appeared in Wenceslas Square, the site of repeated pro-democracy  demonstrations. He urged them to unite to improve the country.  </P> <P> "The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the conditions of a new  generation," Dubcek said. "We must unify to raise our country to a higher  level."  </P> <P> Pro-democracy demonstrations also were held in the cities of Bratislava, Brno,  Kosice, Ostrava and Usti nad Labem, according to state-run media.  </P> <P> Dubcek threw his support behind the Civil Forum, an opposition group formed  Sunday to guide Czechoslovakia's burgeoning pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> He appealed to police, militia and the army "to stand by the people's side,"  and not to destroy the search for democracy.  </P> <P> "Do not act against the people. Remember, you are from the people," Dubcek  said. He also warned demonstrators to "avoid extremist trends."  </P> <P> Riot police beat hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in the square on Nov. 17,  sparking a week of growing protests. Police have kept a generally low profile  since then.  </P> <P> Playwright Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissident, then spoke  to the crowd and told them that Civic Forum "is ready to negotiate with the  authorities elsewhere than on the streets."  </P> <P> "But it's not up to us, but to them, whether democracy will arise from the  excited atmosphere on the square. It is their turn to move, not ours," Havel  said.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Havel received the Olof Palme award for human rights at the  Swedish Embassy.  </P></p>

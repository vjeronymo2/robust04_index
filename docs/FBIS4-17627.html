			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Mikhail </F> Kalmykov and special ITAR-TASS correspondent Vilor Niyazmatov]    [Text] Tashkent, 25 Apr -- French President Francois  Mitterrand arrived this evening in the capital of Uzbekistan on  a three-day state visit. At Tashkent Airport, which was  decorated with the flags of the two countries, he was greeted at  the steps of the presidential Concord by Uzbekistan's President  Islam Karimov.    The two heads of state had a private meeting at the country  residence "Durmen," where the guest is staying. Later the Uzbek  president hosted a banquet in Francois Mitterrand's honor.    Official talks with the participation of the delegations  from  both countries will continue tomorrow. It is expected that the  agenda will include a wide range of topics on international  politics and bilateral relations. It seems that the parties  will also talk about the situation in the region, in particular  about the situation in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, as well as  security problems and stability in the Central Asia, and  relations between CIS countries. A large group of bankers and  heads of major companies is accompanying the president. They  are hoping to establish positive contacts with their Uzbek  counterparts.    The tense situation in Bosnia has had an interesting effect  on the protocol of the visit. Paris, apparently unwilling to  leave unattended the Balkan side of its international policy,  announced at the last minute that the composition of the  delegation would be changed. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has  been replaced by Minister of European Affairs Alain Lamassoure  on the list of officials accompanying the president.</p>

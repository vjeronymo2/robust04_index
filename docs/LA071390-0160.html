			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> QUAYLE SAYS HE WON'T APOLOGIZE FOR GUARD SERVICE  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle told families of missing servicemen today that he'll  never apologize for his Vietnam-era service in the National Guard, but that  those who fought made a "far, far greater" sacrifice than he.  </P> <P> Quayle noted his National Guard service, which became an issue in the 1988  presidential campaign, in a speech opening the 21st annual meeting of the  3,650-member National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in  Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> "As you know, during the Vietnam era, I served in the Indiana National Guard,"  he said. "And while I have not apologized, and never will, for my National  Guard service, I recognize that the members of my generation who served in  Vietnam made a sacrifice for their country that was far, far greater than mine.  </P> <P> "The men and women who served in Vietnam were heroes -- not just because of  their deeds of valor -- but because they served at a time when words like duty,  honor and country had lost their meaning for many," Quayle said. "For the rest  of my life, I will live in admiration of their courage."  </P> <P> As George Bush's running mate, Quayle was dogged by accusations that he avoided  combat duty by joining the National Guard.  </P> <P> The issue surfaced again May 9 when some members of the American Legion of  Paris boycotted a ceremony at which Quayle spoke.  </P></p>

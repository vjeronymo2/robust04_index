			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (2): Peace process enters its final stage - Politics / Examining the background ADJACENT election posters in the heart of Luanda extol the virtues of war-time rivals Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi. Nearby, a newspaper vendor is doing brisk business: headlines announce the arrival of a South African military team to help clear minefields in southern Angola laid by their compatriots. The scene provided a striking image of the dramatic political changes now under way in Angola. The regional peace process which began in 1988, when South Africa prepared to concede independence to Namibia in return for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, is entering its final, delicate stage. Deprived of external military support, enervated by 16 years of conflict, and prodded by Washington and Moscow, President dos Santos and Mr Savimbi signed a ceasefire last May. If all goes to plan, Angola will hold its first multi-party elections at the end of September, monitored by the United Nations. Although more than 20 parties are planning to contest the poll, most observers agree that the only substantial contenders for power are the two protagonists in the war: the ruling Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) and Mr Savimbi's Uniao Nacional para a Indepencia Total de Angola (Unita). Hopes that a third political force might emerge, capable of preventing the MPLA or Unita from securing outright victory, were probably dashed late last month. Mr Joaquim Pinto de Andrade, former honorary president of the Democratic Renewal Party (PRD), and widely respected for his stand on human rights, resigned after alleged vote rigging for a new executive at the party's national convention. The PRD had emerged as probably the best organised and most credible of the parties formed since Angola introduced a multi-party system as part of the peace package. Unless the party recovers its unity, the prospect of a substantial challenge to the big two shifts from the slim to the negligible. The only election assessment advanced with any confidence is that Unita will retain the loyalty of what has been its strongest ethnic constituency, the Ovimbundu, about 35-40 per cent of Angola's population, while the MPLA will get strong backing from the Mbundu, who make up about a quarter. Voters not influenced by ethnic considerations face an invidious choice. The bitter shanty town graffiti 'MPLA robs, Unita kills' pungently summarises popular concern over two issues: growing official corruption, amid allegations involving improper contracts and sales in the oil and diamond sectors; and revelations about the murder of two senior Unita officials at the instigation of some their colleagues. Mr Tito Chingunji, Unita's former secretary for foreign affairs, and another leading member, Mr Wilson dos Santos, were murdered towards the end of last year in Jamba, the party's base in southern Angola. The reasons remain unclear. But the disclosures, accompanied by other accounts of human rights abuses, have done lasting damage to the reputation of Mr Savimbi. They have also deeply embarrassed the US which provided military and other support to Unita during the war, as well as financial backing subsequently. So overwhelming is Mr Savimbi's domination of the party that many observers find it hard to believe that he was not in some way responsible for the killings. The MPLA does not have clean hands. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of alleged supporters of an abortive coup attempt in 1977 were rounded up at the time. Many were arbitrarily and secretly executed; to this day relatives are still trying to determine their exact fate. Little divides the two parties on economic policy. Both parties subscribe to the structural adjustment principles set out by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank - although Unita can point to a long-standing commitment to capitalism in contrast to the MPLA's relatively recent conversion from Marxism. Any voter hoping to select a party on the basis of its foreign policy will still have a difficult choice to make. Trade and pragmatism are forging links, once inconceivable, between the erstwhile Marxist MPLA government in Luanda and a white-led government in Pretoria. The MPLA has made it clear that it will not repay an xbn arms debt to the former Soviet Union, its war-time ally. For many Angolans, the greatest worry, however, is not who to vote for, but whether the exercise can reach a successful conclusion. Ms Margaret Anstee, the UN Secretary-General's representative in Angola and head of the team monitoring the process, makes clear that what she describes as 'the world's cheapest peace-keeping operation' could do with more help. One western diplomat put it bluntly: 'It has the makings of a nightmare.' Unita was preventing government access to some of the areas under guerrilla control; the government seemed to be dragging its heels, failing to appoint key election organisers; rudimentary communications; an acute shortage of transport; and a late start to the registration of voters. But one of the greatest concerns involves the future of some 150,000 members of the MPLA and Unita armies, facing either demobilisation or a career in an integrated force. The settlement agreement called for demobilisation by August 1, and a 50,000-strong national army in the barracks by election day. By the end of April, only 6,000 had been demobilised. Military officials say that thousands of men have failed to report to the 45 designated assembly points where their weapons should be collected. They reckon it unlikely that more 20,000 men could trained and registered in the new army by September. If political tensions rise, the potential for violence seems formidable. To add to these headaches, there are disquieting developments in Cabinda. The faction-ridden Frente de Libertacao do Enclave de Cabinda (Flec) has recently stepped up a campaign for independence, or possibly autonomy, with attacks on traffic between Cabinda town and Mulongo, base for the offshore operations of Angola's leading oil producer, Cabinda Gulf Oil Company. Ms Anstee acknowledges that there may be trying times ahead. In a jocular reference to UN Security Council Resolution 747, the mandate for the Angola operation, she makes a serious point: 'I have been asked to fly a 747 and I've got only enough fuel for a Boeing.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under &sect;31.6051&hyph;1(d)(1) of the existing regulations, applicable to both quarterly and monthly Form 941 filers, if an individual's employment is terminated before the end of a calendar year, the employer may furnish Form W&hyph;2 to the employee at any time after termination but no later than January 31 of the next year. If the terminated employee requests a Form W&hyph;2, and if there is no reasonable expectation on the part of either the employer or the employee of further employment during the calendar year, the employer must furnish Form W&hyph;2 to the employee by the later of 30 days after the employee made the request or 30 days after the last payment of wages. The proposed regulation has no effect on the rights of terminated employees to require the employer to furnish Form W&hyph;2 within this time frame.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Revenue Procedure 84&hyph;77, 1984&hyph;2 C.B. 753, the IRS provided procedures for preparing and filing certain forms, including Form 941, Form W&hyph;2 and Form W&hyph;3, when a successor employer acquires substantially all of the property (1) used in a trade or business of a predecessor employer, or (2) used in a separate unit of a trade or business of a predecessor, and in connection with, or immediately after the acquisition (but during the same calendar year) the successor employs individuals who were employed in the trade or business of the predecessor immediately prior to the acquisition. This proposed regulation would have the effect of modifying the time frame for the standard procedure in section 4.01 of the Revenue Procedure. Except for this change, the proposed regulation would not affect the continuing validity of the Revenue Procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation applies to employers who file Form 941 on a monthly or quarterly basis, including railroad employers. It does not apply to employers with respect to their agricultural employees (in those cases, employers file on an annual basis on Form 943). Nor does it apply to employers with respect to their domestic employees (in those cases, employers file on an annual basis beginning in 1995).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations are effective upon the date of publication of these regulations in final form in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . However, these regulations shall apply only to employers that cease the payment of wages after the close of the calendar quarter in which the date of publication occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and Public Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person who timely submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of these regulations is Jean Whalen Casey, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Arts: London theatre ONE of the best productions I have seen in the past few weeks is The Heiress at the Richmond Theatre. The stage adaptation of Henry James's masterpiece of a novel Washington Square, it has an excellent plot and is beautifully staged. I look forward to seeing it in the West End. Meanwhile, in Holland Park, Oracle Productions is playing Wycherley's The Country Wife until the end of next week. This restoration comedy has never seemed quite as outrageously bawdy as is sometimes claimed, but it has some very good scenes. On Tuesday, director Peter Benedict was obliged to step in and play the key part of Pinchwife himself in the absence of Darryle Forbes-Dawson. He has a wonderfully disgusting leer. Mrs Pinchwife is played by Nicola Duffet who gets steadily better as the play goes on. The Holland Park season has grown in stature over the years. Something there  -whether opera or play - ought to be caught before the season ends on August 22. At the Young Vic there is a reminder that Guys and Dolls must be among the half dozen or so best musicals of all time. It has dialogue, plot and wit as well as tunes. Precisely because it is so good, it is extremely difficult to do well and is therefore a little over-ambitious for the Youth Theatre. Nevertheless, this is a game attempt and worth seeing. There is a fine Sky Masterson in Ben Caplan. The production, directed by Karen Stephens and Chris White, runs until August 1.</p>

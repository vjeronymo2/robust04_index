			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Bonn group's tiller loses its steady hand The announcement that Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, was to step down two years early came as a surprise for employees of the German state-owned monopoly. His steady style had been reassuring as the company prepared for transition from a leviathan, employing 230,000 people, to an agile, private telecoms operator. His departure, made public last Friday, is not likely immediately to affect the planned privatisation but his knowledge of the Bonn-based company and his part in its restructuring will be sorely missed. 'He leaves behind a mess in which only he knew his way around,' one observer remarked. There had been complaints about his indecisiveness and suggestions he lacked the vision to run one of the world's largest telecoms operators. But Mr Ricke, who had taken over the helm of the company in 1990, was supposed to have stayed until the end of 1996 to tie up the loose ends after Deutsche Telekom becomes a joint stock company - in three weeks' time - and oversee the partial privatisation through a DM15bn (Pounds 6.1bn) equity issue, one of the largest in the world. However, at the beginning of December Mr Ricke told Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post minister, that he wanted to leave and the latter did not try to persuade him to stay. Mr Wilhelm Pallmann, a fellow board member, will take over temporarily when Mr Ricke leaves at the beginning of January. Mr Pallmann managed Deutsche Telekom's expansion into former East Germany, a venture regarded as successful, but he is not expected to stay long, if only because he is already 62. That leaves the company searching for a new chief executive. Mr Joachim Kroske, the finance director, and Mr Gerd Tenzer, who runs the company's networks, are the favourites on the inside. However, Mr Ricke was brought in from outside and it seems equally likely that the new chief will come from private industry. The decision to leave came after a period when little had been going right for Deutsche Telekom. The last straw for Mr Ricke was when he discovered that the new 10-man supervisory board included five political appointees. But other things have gone wrong. The joint venture with France Telecom, embarked upon last year and regarded as the cornerstone of Mr Ricke's drive to internationalise the company, has not yet been approved by the European Commission and there are signs that it may be blocked because Europe's two largest operators would have a dominant position. There are also fears about the joint venture with Sprint, the US long-distance carrier with which Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this year. The two sides were supposed to have completed initial negotiations recently but the deadline has been extended into early next year, insiders say, suggesting agreement may be impossible. Mr Ricke has also been fighting to control the damage from press reports alleging that thousands of Deutsche Telekom employees were working with organised criminals and pocketing the money from overseas phone calls. But Mr Ricke's departure also presents Deutsche Telekom with new opportunities. Several other members of the nine-man management board are due to retire or leave early next year, giving Mr Botsch a chance to make an almost clean sweep. Mr Botsch is a member of the Christian Social Union - the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union - which preaches the gospel of privatisation louder than any other party in Germany. He may give Deutsche Telekom a stronger dose of that gospel.</p>

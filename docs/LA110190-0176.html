			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWNING TO TALK TO RADER BEFORE MAKING A DECISION  </P> <P> Brian Downing said Wednesday he will postpone filing for free agency until he  speaks with Angel Manager Doug Rader, but added that if he hears "the same  garbage" he heard from club executives, he will file before the Sunday  deadline.  </P> <P> Downing, who hit .273 in his club-record 13th season after playing sparingly  until July, was told last week that the Angels won't go to arbitration with  him. Although he called a return in 1991 "possible but remote," he wants to be  sure all possibilities have been exhausted before severing ties to a team with  which he has set nine career offensive records.  </P> <P> Rader has been on a scouting trip in Latin America and is expected back at his  Florida home this weekend. Downing plans to speak with him by phone Saturday.  </P> <P> "Through my years of seeing guys disappear, I've heard the theme, 'If they'd  just talked to (the manager), he wouldn't have had to leave,' " said Downing,  who hit .371 (49 for 132) from June 24 to Aug. 17, when he peaked at .303.  "Before I run off and sign somewhere else, I want to talk to Doug so he doesn't  end up saying, 'He should have talked to me.'  </P> <P> "I'm looked upon by them as a last resort, and that's not right. It's their  loss. Somebody's going to get a hell of a big league player. I know I've said I  never could play for somebody else, but they dumped me. It hurts like heck.  This is my home and always has been. I'm going to have to move away and leave  my family behind. But I've always been a fighter. That's what's kept me in the  big leagues 18 years."  </P> <P> Downing, who earned $1.25 million last season, has been plagued by a muscle  problem in his back the past three seasons and considered retirement when he  was unable to find a remedy. But since beginning thrice-weekly treatment  supervised by physical therapist Valerie Sinkus of Whittier, Downing said he is  optimistic about regaining his form at 40.  </P> <P> "I always knew this was a business, but you never think it's going to happen to  you," Downing said. "I have no second thoughts about anything that's happened  here. Hopefully I'll get a chance to win somewhere else."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY REJECTS MOVE TO KEEP CAR INSURERS IN STATE  </P> <P> Legislative efforts to strengthen enforcement of the insurance initiative,  Proposition 103, suffered a major setback Thursday as the Assembly rejected a  bill aimed at preventing auto insurers from pulling out of the California  market.  </P> <P> The bill, which would have severely penalized companies that arbitrarily cancel  auto policies, fell seven votes short of the two-thirds needed for passage.  </P> <P> The defeat, on a vote of 47 to 23, came after the legislation had already  passed the Senate. It was the only one of several strong enforcement measures  introduced in the wake of the ballot measure's narrow approval that had been  considered likely to reach the governor's desk.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effort Sidetracked  </P> <P> Like those earlier efforts, this one was sidetracked by a nearly solid bloc of  Republicans amid intense lobbying by the insurance industry.  </P> <P> After the vote, the bill's author, Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), and other  supporters vowed to have the measure reconsidered. But they conceded that it  would take a massive lobbying effort by voters and business groups to gather  the additional votes needed for passage.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to wave the white flag today," said Assemblyman Patrick Johnston  (D-Stockton), chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee, who  carried the bill on the Assembly floor.  </P> <P> Noting that the legislation is backed by local chambers of commerce, retailers  and independent insurance agents, Robbins added: "We will rally our support. .  . . We will go to those business constituents and get them to lobby a few of  the Republicans and ask them if they want to stand with the insurance companies  or every other business in California."  </P> <P> The Ralph Nader-backed initiative seeks to roll back insurance rates and impose  stringent controls on future premium increases. As passed by the voters, it  prohibits insurers from arbitrarily canceling policies or refusing to write new  ones. But the proposition's $250,000 maximum penalty for "willful violations"  has been criticized as far too lenient.  </P> <P> The Robbins bill, by contrast, would assess companies that violate the  provision up to 50% of the premiums collected on all the affected policies.  That could run into millions of dollars for the largest insurers.  </P> <P> Initially, the measure was aimed at Travelers Insurance and several other firms  that began canceling policies after the Nov. 8 election. But these firms  relented under pressure from Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. Now,  supporters say they are convinced that without the bill, insurers may attempt  to leave California if the Supreme Court upholds substantial portions of the  initiative.  </P> <P> Penalties imposed under Proposition 103 amount to no more than "traffic  tickets," said Johnston, who predicted that many insurers will simply "pay the  fine and skip. . . . Our constituents will be left high and dry with the legal  responsibility to purchase insurance and no ability to do so."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposition Argument  </P> <P> The bill's Republican opponents, however, argued that legislation cannot change  the laws of economics and if there is no profit to be made under Proposition  103, companies will simply go out of business.  </P> <P> "If we look at this bill alone we can come up with logical arguments to support  it," said Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona), who argued that Robbins' bill  would drive insurance companies out of business, leaving the state to fill the  void with a government-run insurance program.  </P> <P> Bader predicted that passage of the Robbins bill would result in a system like  that in New Jersey, where premiums are among the highest in the nation and the  state-run system faces huge deficits.  </P> <P> The Robbins bill was one of several introduced with great fanfare shortly after  the passage of Proposition 103 and amid predictions that even lawmakers who  opposed the initiative would push for strong enforcement. Supporters likened  the success of the insurance measure to the landmark Proposition 13 of 1978,  which cut property taxes and spawned an anti-tax fervor within the Legislature.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rejected or Moribund  </P> <P> However, all of these bills have either been rejected or are considered  moribund. Among them is a major bill by Johnston to freeze insurance premiums  until the Supreme Court acts or the initiative's rate regulation provisions  take effect in November. The Johnston bill was rejected on the Assembly floor  last month, falling eight votes short of passage.  </P> <P> Johnston, who was among those who predicted early on that there would be strong  support for these bills, conceded after Thursday's vote that the political  dynamics of the Legislature have changed very little.  </P> <P> "Part of it is that many members actively opposed Proposition 103 or didn't  support it," Johnston said. "It sounds like their logic was that if 103 doesn't  make sense, I don't want to do anything to enforce it."  </P> <P> But Robbins placed the blame for rejection of his bill and the others squarely  on the insurance industry.  </P> <P> "The insurance companies are looking for legislative friends and have found on  the floor of this house a group of legislators to defend them," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult to Resurrect  </P> <P> Although it may be difficult to resurrect his bill, Robbins has a track record  of reviving measures once considered politically doomed. The same bill rejected  by the Assembly on Thursday was once defeated in the Senate as well. But  Robbins was able to bring sufficient pressure to reverse the votes of several  Republicans.  </P> <P> Robbins was supported Thursday by a solid majority of Democrats but received  only two Republican votes. The two came from Curt Pringle, newly elected  assemblyman from Garden Grove, and Bev Hansen of Santa Rosa.  </P> <P> Asked why he called for the vote when it was clear that his bill lacked  sufficient support, Robbins supplied a glimpse of his political strategy:  "You've got to pin down the votes that you have by putting them on the record  and pin down the (opposing) votes so you can go after them as well."  </P></p>

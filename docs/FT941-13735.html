			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Trizec makes further provisions of CDollars 287m Trizec, the Calgary-based property development group which is in the throes of a debt restructuring exercise, has taken further write-downs to reflect the slump in the North American commercial real estate market. As a result of provisions of CDollars 287m, Trizec suffered a 1993 loss of CDollars 312m (USDollars 238m), or CDollars 1.57 per share, despite a 13 per cent rise in rental income. The loss in 1992 was CDollars 544m, or CDollars 3.28, due largely to the write-down of Trizec's investment in Bramalea, another financially stretched developer which was restructured last year. Trizec, controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, submitted a debt-restructuring proposal to securities holders last August. It is expecting a response from a crucial group of senior debenture holders in the near future. In the meantime, it has suspended all principal and interest payments. Trizec has total debt of CDollars 4.8bn, but about two-thirds is held by operating subsidiaries and is not included in the recapitalisation talks. Moore Corp, the business forms maker, will eliminate 3,000 jobs worldwide as it restructures and expands into information services, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal . The USDollars 210m restructuring will result in a USDollars 155m after-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings, which will result in Moore reporting a loss for 1993. Moore, with annual sales of USDollars 2.5bn, has 150 plants in 57 countries and 23,000 employees. Its biggest market is the US. The paper forms business has been hit by the electronic revolution. Plants will be closed in several countries, though the company would not be specific. One-quarter of the restructuring will affect the European subsidiaries but the first major impact will come in the US where the order management system will be revamped to cut overheads. Canada's Labatt Breweries has capitalised on the domestic success of its innovative ice-brewed beer by licensing the process to Coors, the third-biggest US brewer. Coors said it will use the ice-brewing process to produce a new brand, known as Coors Arctic Ice, to be launched in nine US states in mid-February.</p>

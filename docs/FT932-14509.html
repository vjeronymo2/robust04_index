			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Egyptian minister sacked PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt yesterday sacked his minister of the interior, following rising criticism of the violent response by the security forces to the recent wave of attacks by Islamic extremists. Mr Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa had ordered large-scale police assaults against suspected extremist hideouts in upper Egypt, and in the Cairo district of Imbaba, during which dozens of people were killed or injured. He is replaced by another former governor of Asyut, Mr Hussein Mohammed al-Alfi. The new minister immediately vowed a 'decisive and comprehensive confrontation with the outlaws,' suggesting his predecessor had been sacked for lack of success rather than harshness of approach. Mr Mubarak has repeatedly blamed Iran for the terrorist attacks, which have cost Egypt hundreds of millions of dollars in lost tourism revenue. He said recently that the authorities knew the identities of the extremists and that they would eradicate the problem within a few months. The Egyptian leader also defended the tactics of the security forces and denied that detainees had been ill-treated. Groups of liberal, secular professionals have warned the president that his policies were forcing Egyptians into an intolerable choice between an incompetent government and a radical Islamic alternative. In another appointment, Mr Youssef Boutros Ghali, an economist and a relative of the UN secretary-general, has been appointed a minister of state  -recognition of his key role in talks with the IMF.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Caution on scope for further gilts rally  -Capital &amp; Credit Given the staggering rally in the UK government bond market last year, fixed income investors can be forgiven for wondering whether the party in the gilt market is well and truly over, or whether there are further gains to be made. Last year was a bumper year for the gilt market: investors saw returns of about 20 per cent in what turned out to be one of the top performing government bond markets of the year. The redemption yield on the UK medium-term benchmark bond - which was 10 per cent in April 1992 - started 1993 at 8.33 per cent and ended the year at 6.1 per cent. The gilt market rally was driven by expectations of a much improved inflation background and the prospect of cuts in the base rate, and took place despite initial concerns about the huge volume of gilts that the Bank of England would have to sell in order to fund the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. The November 30 Budget provided a further boost for the UK government bond market, as it emerged that net sales of gilts would be lower than expected in the next financial year. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, forecast a diminishing PSBR over the next few years, implying a decline in supply in the gilt market. The Budget announcements, coupled with more good news on the inflation front, helped to spur another burst of activity in the gilt market in December. Mr Jonathan Francis, head of global strategy at Putnam Investments of the US, says he has been enthusiastic about the prospects for gilts for several reasons: 'After the Budget, we felt greatly encouraged by the funding requirement being lower. We also like the inflation outlook, which has turned around quite substantially in the last quarter.' Added to this, Mr Francis believes the UK looks attractive in 'the pan-European context, as Europe could see some widespread political uncertainty, with elections in Germany and a general election in Italy (in 1994), which means that we see the UK as a relatively benign political environment.' However, while some UK and overseas investors see limited scope for further gains in the gilt market, others believe the market is now over-valued. One leading European fund manager, who preferred not to be named, said: 'The Budget, if you believe it, was good for gilts - it makes inroads into the PSBR. But there is a serious questionmark over whether tax increases and spending cuts can go through unamended in the years to come, given the nature of politics. A lot of the proposals are to be drawn over time so the question is whether the government will come up with other compensatory measures nearer the time.' Many fund managers admit that the gilt market has already surpassed their forecasts and targets. Ten-year gilts were yielding 110 - 120 basis points over comparable German government paper at the start of 1993: towards the end of December 1993, the yield spread had narrowed to around 50 basis points, defying earlier forecasts and expectations in the market. Says one UK fund manager 'As a house, we've been bullish on the gilt market all year, and the market has already hit our target, going through our forecast of 10-year yields at 6.5 per cent. But we are still very positive on the inflation front and that should give the market some support even if it goes sideways for a bit. We think the spread over other European bonds should continue to decline.' Mr John Hynes, global bond analyst at Fidelity, the big US fund manager, remains bullish on the gilt market for several reasons, and maintains that 'even though there has been a rally since the Budget, there is still further to go and we feel there is value in the curve in the five to 10-year area.' He points out that the positive shape of the yield curve means that investors can borrow cheaply at the short end to fund their longer positions: 'The hedge cost is low because you can borrow at the short end and invest at the long end, whereas with Germany, the shape of the yield curve means it is more expensive to hedge. There are a lot of good stories out there in Europe, and we'll see a lot more rate cuts in Europe (in 1994) but the gilt market is the cheapest one in which to participate.' Mr Hynes adds: 'In the UK, we expect to see a US-type situation of slow growth and low inflationary pressures which is good for the long end.' Mr Larry Teitelbaum, portfolio manager for global and international bonds at Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, points out that 'gilts are attractive versus the US and other Europeans, but we're not inclined to think the market will run away from the other Europeans as it has already outperformed'. In other words, even the more optimistic are cautious about just how much further the gilt market can rally. 'There's been an enormous rally in gilts: the party is nearly over, but the punch hasn't quite run out yet,' says Mr Ceris Williams, director of fixed income investments at Rothschild Asset Management.</p>

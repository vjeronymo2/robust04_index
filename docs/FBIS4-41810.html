			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Shuvaynikov, chairman of the Russian Party of </F> Crimea (RPC), under the rubric "Party Leader's Tribune": "Why  the Russian Party Did Not Join the Russia Bloc"]    [Text] The article "Past Idols, Future Idols...." by V.  Polyakov, a deputy from Simferopol, has prompted me to write  these notes. In analyzing the course of the presidential and  parliamentary elections, as well as the events that followed,  the author attributed a subjective motivation to the actions and  deeds of individual political leaders. Thus, in particular,  having mentioned my name, he stated: "We can consider  tribulations involved in nominations for the post of president a  prelude for the forthcoming storm. What Mezhak understood on  time, Shuvaynikov did not, and for this reason he paid for it  dearly. The recent `Hyde-Park' idol turned out to be an outsider  in the camp of the victors."    Having read this paragraph, a poorly informed voter may  indeed think that Shuvaynikov "made a mistake" when he failed to  withdraw as a candidate in favor of Meshkov and did not join the  Russia bloc together with his party. Since they are trying to  convince the 200,000 voters who voted in the first round for the  candidate of the Russian Party of this, I am compelled to  discuss the situation that preceded the presidential election  and emerged on the eve of the creation of the Russia bloc.    As the residents of the Crimea may remember, a struggle for  the institution of presidency began about one year ago. The  Russian Party unambiguously determined its position as early as  July: A president was necessary in the environment of a mounting  political and economic crisis, and it was desirable for this  post to go to a politician firmly advocating the position of the  return of the Crimea to Russia, and then in a peaceful, legal  manner. Unlike the Russian Party, the RPK [Republican Party of  the Crimea] (the RDK [Republican Movement of the Crimea] party),  together with its leader Yu. Meshkov, rejected the institution  of presidency in the belief that it was being prepared solely  for one well-known candidate. Moreover, Yu. Meshkov himself had  doubts for a long time about whether to run for this position or  not. Later, such doubts also overcame the RPK (RDK) leadership.  The decision to nominate him was made as late as in the course  of the campaign which had already begun.    Still before the beginning of candidate registration,  several  meetings were held between the representatives of the RNP  [Republican People's Party] and the Russian Party at which  scenarios for the nomination of a common candidate to counter N.  Bagrov were discussed. Yu. Meshkov did not personally attend  these meetings. Moreover, the last meeting before the beginning  date of nomination was frustrated: Only I and S. Tsekov, the  current speaker of the Crimean Supreme Soviet and leader of the  RPK (RDK), met in front of the closed doors of the Bagram cafe.  This is why the Russian Party, in carrying out previous  decisions, was the first one to register its candidate and to  begin the propaganda effort. Nonetheless, the problem of a  common candidate remained because the danger of splitting the  vote existed which gave N. Bagrov a certain advantage.    On the initiative of V. Klychnikov, the NPK [People's Party  of the Crimea] executive committee chairman, three registered  candidates--Yu. Meshkov, V. Mezhak, and I--met at the Bagram  cafe on 9 December in order to specify positions and determine  the principles for selecting a common candidate. There was no  discussion of the Russia bloc yet; it was not even at the draft  stage. I proposed the following scenario for our actions to my  colleagues: 1) In view of the fact that the mass media tried to  pit us against each other thus sowing discord in the ranks of  our supporters, to make a statement in the press about the  commonality of our purpose and the aspiration to designate a  common candidate; 2) To hold as soon as possible a rating survey  of voters in order to obtain objective data on the real chances  of each one of us; 3) To give me, the candidate of the Russian  Party, one week to coordinate all issues with the political  council which had nominated me as a candidate.    After a certain period of doubt, V. Mezhak announced that he  was prepared to withdraw as a candidate that very day, but only  in favor of Yu. Meshkov. Ultimately, both candidates agreed to  my proposal concerning the statement, charged me with preparing  its text by Monday, and had no objections to the one-week  deadline.    However, the events that followed indicated that the  agreements reached were merely a tactical move; the RPK (RDK)  and NPK leaders did not intend to comply with them. One day  later, a meeting between Yu. Meshkov and V. Mezhak, and the  contender for candidate, A. Kruglov, and activists of  pro-Russian organizations was held in Sevastopol. Incidentally,  A. Kruglov, while in the ranks of the Russian Party, voted in  favor of my candidacy. Later, without adducing convincing  arguments, Aleksandr Georgiyevich resolved to independently  nominate himself for president and announced his departure from  the Russian Party. I would not like to analyze the motives for  his actions because Kruglov is a person who is sincerely devoted  to the Russian idea. However, at that time he noticeably harmed  the Russian cause, perhaps not being aware of this himself. As a  matter of fact, a treaty on the common candidate Yu. Meshkov and  the creation of the informal Russia bloc was concluded at this  meeting to which I was not invited. On the same day, it was  heard from the lips of Yu. Meshkov's supporters at an RPK (RDK)  rally that Shuvaynikov was withdrawing as a candidate in favor  of the Republican leader.    Someone might say that in politics all means are good if  they  justify the end. Alas, I do not think so; to put it mildly, the  haste, impropriety, and unreliability of the two party  candidates who had so rapidly "laid to rest" the achieved  "gentlemen's" agreement put me on my guard.    When I brought the text of the statement on Monday it  turned out that nobody needed it. NPK Chairman V. Mezhak  demanded, in a form bordering on an ultimatum (according to him,  suggested) that I withdraw as a candidate in favor of Yu.  Meshkov and join the Russia bloc that was being created. I  refused because there were serious arguments in favor of it that  had great significance for the future political events in the  Crimea. I outlined them to my comrades in the Russian Party,  asking one question first: If the two leaders do not give much  thought to choosing their means, what goal do they set for  themselves? Why was a bloc with the attractive name Russia being  so hastily created?    Long before the presidential election, the RPK (RDK) made a  vigorous effort to create the People's Unity bloc in which the  issue of Russia as a specific objective of Crimea's political  movement would not figure and would be carefully avoided with  references to the fact that this could give the Ukrainian  authorities a pretext to accuse the Republicans of "violating  Ukrainian legislation."    Therefore, only the Russian Party, which was labeled  "chauvinist" and "Fascist," talked about Russia.    The People's Unity bloc was not to be, but the RPK (RDK)  program to this day talks about an independent Crimea in some  kind of an alliance with the countries of the artificially  created CIS. The program of the People's Party which emerged  later out of the RDK splinters sees the future of the Crimea in  a confederation with Ukraine. I recall this deliberately because  these two particular parties acted as the foundation of the  Russia bloc abandoning for the election period their  programmatic documents and adopting the slogans of Russian  orientation which even the day before they considered "poorly  timed politically" and even "instigative."    At a meeting of the Russian Party political council, the  views concerning the Russia bloc and the common candidate Yu.  Meshkov were also mixed. A majority agreed that the name  "Russia" was being used by the Republicans for purely propaganda  purposes, in order to attract a greater number of voters. In  reality, the RPK (RDK) does not intend to give up the idea of  building an "independent" [preceding word published in  Ukrainian] Crimea. This does not suit the Russian Party because  it views the independence of the Crimea merely as a stage on the  way to the peninsula's return to Russia. For the Republicans,  independence turns into some kind of an end unto itself which  may entail unpredictable political and economic consequences, up  to an armed confrontation and economic blockade.    A few members of the political council did not agree with  the  majority opinion and went over to the camp of Russia block  supporters, accusing me of [bringing about] a split.    I am narrating this in detail because the time has shown  that  the majority of the Russian Party political council members were  right. When I hear now from the lips of one of the Russia bloc  leaders that the Crimean parliament never raised, does not  raise, nor will ever raise the issue of the Crimea's secession  from Ukraine, I ask myself this question: Was there such a thing  as the Russia bloc? And if there was, what and who are the  Crimean voters to believe now?    We did not join the Russia bloc precisely because as early  as  in winter the leadership of the Russian Party had predicted the  current political events whereby the Crimean-Russian idea would  begin to be forgotten or ignored. We did not join deliberately  because we do not wish to bear the responsibility for a  political course, which hinges solely on the idea of "an  independent Crimea in an alliance with the CIS," rather than the  idea of "political and economic integration with Russia with the  subsequent return of the Crimea to it." Moreover, we have real  apprehensions that the geopolitical factor of Turkey in the  Crimea will be enlarged against the background of the  Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which is being played out as if in a  bad dream. There is a real foundation for this--the Crimean  Tatar population that has returned from exile and has been  granted special political privileges as a deported nation. All  of this may only make more distant the programmatic goals of the  Russian Party--the recreation of a unified Slavic state and the  restoration of historical justice, the return of the Crimea to  Russia.    For the Russian Party, and for me, its leader, power is not  an end unto itself. All "pro" and "contra" notwithstanding, we  supported the candidacy of Yu. Meshkov after the first round of  the presidential election; we believe that at present the first  president needs constructive assistance and confidence of the  parliament rather than a search for his miscalculations or the  mistakes made. Let us not forget that the residents of the  Crimea now believe Yu. Meshkov and his pre-election promises,  and we should not interfere with his keeping the promises. After  all, all authorities are responsible to the people, and some  time later the people will be entitled to hold them accountable  for everything that has been bad or good, including the Crimean  parliament which is learning the ABC's of legislative work with  difficulty. As far as the Russian Party is concerned, we remain  an association of citizens who are faithful to their  programmatic objectives and tasks. We do not make our failures  into a tragedy.</p>

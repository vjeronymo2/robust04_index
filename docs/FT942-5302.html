			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Ethiopians vote for assembly to draw up constitution Ethiopians began voting early yesterday in a national poll for an assembly which is to draw up a democratic constitution, agencies report from Addis Ababa. The election is Ethiopia's first national democratic poll for decades, with about 15m registered voters from a population of more than 50m choosing a 547-member assembly. About 60 per cent of the candidates say they are independent and not allied to any political party. Some opposition parties, which draw their main support from the Amhara ethnic group in the capital, are boycotting the poll. They argue that a draft constitution likely to be approved by the new elected body could lead to the disintegration of the country by granting the right of secession to its many ethnic groups.

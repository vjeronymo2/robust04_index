			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Property costs cut BNB to Pounds 53,000 BNB RESOURCES, the recruit-ment, training and advertising group, suffered a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.26m to just Pounds 53,000 in the first half of 1992. The human resources side lifted its profits from Pounds 828,000 to Pounds 1.37m in the face of 'intense downward pressure' in UK recruitment markets, said Mr David Norman, chairman. But property costs climbed to Pounds 827,000 (Pounds 341,000) because of a rent review in December 1991 and also because the company had about 40 per cent of its building vacant for a time. This space is now refurbished and used by ATC. ATC, the chartered accountancy training company acquired at the end of 1991 for a total Pounds 5.25m, was the other main cause of the downturn. Mr Norman said that although modest profits had been expected in ATC's first year, revenues had declined by about 15 per cent. He expected the training division would break even over the full year. The group had cash balances of Pounds 3m. Earnings fell to 0.1p (3.9p) per share and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.6p.</p>

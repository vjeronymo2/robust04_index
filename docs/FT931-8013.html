			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Rocard wins support for left alliance AN overwhelming majority of French Socialists and ecologists support the proposals of Mr Michel Rocard, former French prime minister and a future presidential candidate, for a 'political big bang' to create a new centre-left alliance after next month's elections, according to the latest opinion poll. The BVA poll, published in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper, suggests that 73 per cent of Socialist sympathisers and 62 per cent of ecologists back Mr Rocard's idea of abandoning the Socialist party in favour of a coalition of socialists, environmentalists and human rights activists. It also indicates a high level of support among the public, with 45 per cent approving of his plan and 40 per cent against. Mr Rocard said on French television last night that the political establishment was increasingly out of touch with the daily reality of people's lives. It was necessary to create a political platform in which different interest groups could come together to redefine objectives for France. The Rocard plan has caused turmoil among the Socialists, who, after a decade in power, are heading for humiliating defeat by the conservatives in next month's parliamentary elections, and may be robbed of second place by ecologists. President Francois Mitterrand has tried to brush aside the Rocard proposals by stressing that the left's first priority should be to strengthen the existing Socialist party. The president's own standing is under attack, however. More than half of French viewers (54 per cent) were unimpressed by his television appearances last week, according to an IFOP poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche. Similarly, his approval rating in yesterday's poll stood at a dispiriting 26 per cent, the same as last month. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

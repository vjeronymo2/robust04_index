			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Portnikov: "Andrey Kozyrev Defines </F> Priorities; Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the  Russian Federation With Ambassadors to CIS and Baltic Countries"]    [Text]  <H5>  Opinion </H5>   The speech of the minister of foreign affairs of Russia at a  conference of the leaders of diplomatic missions in Commonwealth  and Baltic countries hardly struck observers with its novelty  and sensationalism. A majority of the theses expounded by Andrey  Kozyrev have already been heard--during both the recent visit of  the minister in the countries of Central Asia, which complicated  the mutual understanding of the Kremlin and Almaty even more,  and during the preelection speech of one of the leaders of  Russia's Choice bloc in Murmansk. However, at that time, such  rhetoric was explained by the impending elections, and the  necessity to seize the "patriotic initiative" from such  politicians as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. And although the results  of the elections convincingly demonstrated that on the field of  "patriotic initiative," there is no way at all for democratic  politicians to beat Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Sergey Baburin,  the minister of foreign affairs of Russia considered it  necessary again to repeat his preelection program. Obviously, it  is now becoming the concept of Russian foreign policy, and the  ambassadors of Russia in CIS and Baltic countries will have to  accept the directives of the minister for implementation.    The main priority of Russian foreign policy remains as  before  the protection of the Russian-speaking population in the  countries of the "near abroad." This is a well-considered  policy, arrived at by the minister with much agonizing. A large  if not an absolute part of the citizens of Russia living in the  former Union republics already gave their votes to Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy in the elections. The energetic protection of the  rights of noncitizens, in the final analysis, could lead to the  introduction of the institution of dual citizenship in a number  of republics, the emergence of new Russian citizens, and an  increase in the voting electorate in Russia by more than a  third. The minister probably expects that the position of the  MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] will lead to the popularity of  the bloc that is being supported by Andrey Kozyrev among these  potential voters. The game on the field of "patriotic  initiative" is continuing. The winner is already known.    The whole Commonwealth has been declared a zone of vital  interests of Russia and, as a consequence of this, a zone of  potential threat for it. However, in contrast to the  representatives of the military department, which sometimes  comes out with poorly reasoned initiatives of a force nature,  the leader of the Russian diplomats advised supporting a  balance, having called extremists both those who want to  introduce new tanks into the republics and those who want to  withdraw the old ones. Andrey Kozyrev associated this concept of  his with the possibility of military cooperation between Russia  and the CIS and Baltic countries (!), which, probably, will  especially touch the Baltic politicians, who have not yet  forgotten the recent assurances of Boris Yeltsin at a press  conference with Bill Clinton on the need to withdraw Russian  troops from the Baltic countries. But as Grigoriy Yavlinskiy  observed, true, in another connection, "Clinton has departed--we  can change the decor." A large portrait of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  in a gilded frame could occupy its own place in the new decor of  Russian foreign policy. If it were not for this remarkable  person, how difficult it would be for many Russian politicians  to preserve the reputation of a "dove." But everyone is against  a background of a moving portrait of a "dove," gushing power  energy. Including Andranik Migranyan, the political scientist  from the president's circle, who appeared in the pages of  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA with a variety number on the subject of the  Monroe Doctrine for the former Union. And Galina Sidorova,  political adviser to the Russian minister of foreign affairs,  who responded to the medieval ideas of Migranyan in the spirit  of new political thinking of 1980's, with a selection of  quotations from Andrey Kozyrev. Concerning the CIS as "the only  possible form of a revived Union," and concerning "the tough,  including forceful, methods of defending Russian policy." Andrey  Kozyrev, under the Damocles' sword of resignation, appeared with  these ideas at the Russian deputy congress, and they were  perceived as a compromise with the "irreconcilable"--if only to  retain the liberal minister! But now they were useful for  something else--to justify the perennial dominion of the Russian  MFA....    Andrey Kozyrev himself looks like a dove--and he will  continue to look like one no matter what. But let us recall his  famous "hilarious" speech in Strasbourg and compare it with  current speeches in order to be convinced: Andrey Kozyrev at  that time was not expounding a program of irreconcilable  opposition, but a variant of his future program. And if the  Zhirinovskiy factor made it possible for Russian diplomacy to  easily change the cherished policy of equality of rights in  relations with the former Soviet republics, then changes with  the very same flavoring can also be predicted on other flanks:  Not to let Vladimir Volfovich get into a position of power. This  is the way Zhirinovskiy's regime is being formed without  Zhirinovskiy. Or: If Vladimir Volfovich comes to power, he will  not have to change a thing.    Including the minister of foreign affairs as well.</p>

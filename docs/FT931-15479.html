			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: 'Good housekeeping' behind advance at Nobo NOBO GROUP, the visual aids and office products supplier, announced a tenfold increase in pre-tax profits in the half-year to October 31 in spite of losses from its office furniture operation which has been sold. Pre-tax profits came to Pounds 622,000; they compared with Pounds 62,000 which was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 227,000 as compensation for a senior director who left the group. Turnover increased marginally from Pounds 9.92m to Pounds 10.2m, but Mr Roger Colvin, chief executive, said sales at Nobo's continuing operations improved 6.5 per cent. Mr Colvin said 'good housekeeping' and lower interest rates, which saw interest charges fall to Pounds 281,000 (Pounds 369,000) were the key factors behind the improved profitability. Sales of its overhead projectors, white boards and notice boards were strong in the first quarter. In contrast, operating losses at Budgie, the furniture-making subsidiary sold in October, rose from Pounds 137,000 to Pounds 371,000. Earnings per share improved to 3.92p (0.06p). The directors have declared an increase from 1p to 1.5p in the interim dividend.</p>

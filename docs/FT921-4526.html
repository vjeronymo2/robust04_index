			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Scepticism reported on redress payments CUSTOMERS of government agencies appear to be unconvinced of the merits of compensation payments when service falls below standard, John Willman writes. Such redress systems are at the centre of the government's Citizen's Charter, but people would prefer agencies to 'get it right first time', says a report published by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm. Response speed and reliability were rated as the most important priorities in the surveys by which many agencies measure customer satisfaction. Methods of redress were rated least important behind staff courtesy and the condition of public areas. The report was based on interviews with chief executives of 42 of the 57 agencies established to improve government services. Unsuitable staff and shortage of financial resources were cited as the most common obstacles to providing better service. Executive agencies: Facts and Trends.

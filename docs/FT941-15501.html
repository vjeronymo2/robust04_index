			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Metals group gives ground Metallgesellschaft, the stricken German metals, mining and industrial group, gave ground to creditor banks yesterday, relaxing its uncompromising stance on the DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) refinancing proposals. Amid frantic negotiations on both sides of the Atlantic, Metallgesellschaft reached an agreement with Norddeutsche Landesbank, the German public sector bank which had denounced the terms. But although the concessions wrung from the Frankfurt-based conglomerate are to be offered to all banks, the modified proposals were not enough to win over French banks who formed a new centre of resistance. Officials from Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks and shareholders in Metallgesellschaft, flew to Paris yesterday afternoon to hold talks with French creditors, including Societe Generale, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Paribas. Representatives of French banks gathered at Societe Generale's Paris headquarters to outline their objections. French banks are believed to be owed about one fifth of the near DM5bn lent by 120 banks. Metallgesellschaft, whose shares were suspended yesterday, said it would not be able to make a statement on the response to the refinancing plans before Saturday. Neither the company nor Deutsche Bank would comment on details of the concessions won by Nord LB. The original proposals envisaged a DM1.4bn rights issue, the conversion of DM1.3bn of bank debt into junior convertible stock and DM700m of new credit lines. The company's willingness to make concessions represents a big shift in its position. It had threatened to declare itself insolvent if the proposals were not accepted in their entirety. But the Wednesday deadline slipped by and many banks simply regarded the statement as a tough negotiating position. Protests focused on the terms of the debt conversion and the requirement for bank creditors to contribute to the rights issue. Societe Generale argued that the main shareholders, including Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and the Allianz insurance group, should 'play a larger part'.

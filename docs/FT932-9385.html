			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Russian cabinet fails to agree industrial policy THE RUSSIAN government yesterday failed to agree a long-promised industrial policy because of divisions over how generous the cash-strapped state can be as it tries to tackle inflation. Yesterday's cabinet meeting was remarkable for splitting along unexpected fault lines, with older conservatives disagreeing among each other rather than clashing with young monetarist-minded radicals. The cabinet ordered the redrafting of a plan which was supposed to provide selective support for industry after Mr Oleg Lobov - recently appointed first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy by President Boris Yeltsin - widened it to support virtually all economic sectors. Supported by radicals like Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, said the plan had to focus on priority sectors because the state had to avoid fuelling inflation by printing money. Mr Ivan Materov, the deputy economic minister, who presented the plan to the cabinet, told a news conference its intention was to support areas which did not enjoy demand now but would do so once the economy pulled out of its 'deep depression'. Although the government's priorities have already been defined as energy, food processing, conversion of defence plans to civilian output, transport and telecommunications, Mr Materov said 'virtually all sectors, for instance television set production,' were worthy of support. President Yeltsin, has signed a decree providing specific measures to speed implementation of the government's mass privatisation, his office said yesterday.</p>

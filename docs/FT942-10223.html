			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Regional outlook brightens in the afternoon session Increasing hopes of a rise in the dollar against the yen supported confidence, and shares gained ground in spite of the overnight fall on US stock and bond markets, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average was ahead 130.82 at 19,917.78 after a day's low of 19,753.05 in the morning and a high of 19,962.69 in the afternoon session. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 6.99 at 1,617.83. Arbitrage buying linked to the Topix index supported shares, while institutional and overseas investors picked up high technology stocks. Volume was 230m shares, rising above the 200m level for the first time in four trading days. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 4.12 to 1,320.29. The yen declined against the dollar on expectations of a US discount rate rise: 'Stabilised US financial markets will help Japanese stocks,' commented Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. High technology issues moved forward on the weaker yen, with NEC, the day's most active issue, rising Y20 to Y1,150 and Hitachi Y3 to Y958. Some large-capital stocks were also higher, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rising Y7 to Y690. Ube Industries, a chemicals and machinery group, advanced Y14 to Y392 on favourable earnings prospects. Real estate companies were higher on reports of increasing liquidity in the property markets. Mitsui Fudosan added Y10 at Y1,240 and Mitsubishi Estate Y20 at Y1,210. Banks were supported by arbitrage linked buying. Industrial Bank of Japan strengthened Y40 to Y3,240 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,950. Battery makers attracted buying on hopes of higher profits due to increased demand from the rapidly growing mobile telephone sector. Furukawa Battery climbed Y55 to Y700 and Japan Storage Battery Y15 to Y793. Stocks which had been sought recently by short-term speculators fell back as profits were taken. Brother Industries, the sewing machine and typewriter maker, receded Y14 to Y661 and Wakachiku Construction Y15 to Y652. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 51.24 to 22,078.57 in volume of 21m shares. Roundup A number of markets in the region picked up, some staging recoveries in the afternoon. HONG KONG drew US funds into the index futures market, May index futures climbing 260 to 8,635, and the cash market responded with the Hang Seng index rising 118.39, or 1.4 per cent, to 8,540.09 after an earlier fall of 132 points. Selected blue chips benefited from the buying, with Cheung Kong topping the active list and firming 75 cents to HKDollars 35. HSBC gained HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 82.50 after slipping to HKDollars 80.50. Hutchison went ex-dividend and rose an adjusted 59 cents to HKDollars 28.50. Among China stocks, however, Tsingtao Brewery slid 35 cents, or 5.4 per cent, to HKDollars 6.10 in line with a downtrend for H-shares issued by Chinese enterprises. SINGAPORE, too, bounced from a low, the Straits Times Industrial index closing 12.30 up at 2,234.70, having bottomed earlier at 2,208.03. Resurgent rumours of an early Malaysian general election led to a strong showing by speculative Malaysian shares. KUALA LUMPUR itself saw bargain hunting in the afternoon and the KLSE composite index improved 8.85 to 999.48. SEOUL rose for the fifth consecutive session on renewed institutional buying of primary blue chips. The composite stock index added 7.25 at 947.40 after the Korea Investment Trust said it had a new, Dollars 60m fund which would begin buying stocks next week. Among major gainers, the heavily weighted Kepco went the day's limit up, advancing Won1,000 to Won28,800. Samsung Display Devices also hit its upper limit, gaining Won2,500 at Won94,500. But medium-priced blue chips lost momentum. Most financial and construction counters retreated. TAIPEI ended lower in slow trade as sentiment turned cautious, the weighted index losing 59.43 at 5,937.37 in turnover of TDollars 57.05bn (TDollars 66.54bn). However, selected electronics still saw strong gains on continued expectations of sound profits. ASE rose by its daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 112.50. MANILA was hit by US interest rate worries and a weakening in domestic blue chips. The composite index dropped 46.78, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,913.45, with turnover declining from 947.7m pesos to 900.8m pesos. The US-influenced PLDT tumbled 1.6 per cent to 1,830 pesos, but other blue chips such as Philippine National Bank and San Miguel more than matched this with falls of 4.5 per cent to 530 pesos and 1.7 per cent to 175 pesos. SYDNEY was flat in advance of the federal budget, which came after hours, the All Ordinaries index ending 1.1 off at 2,008.2. News Corp fell 24 cents to ADollars 8.80, influenced by New York, London and its third-quarter results. CRA put on 32 cents at ADollars 16.62 on a strong copper price rise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The book "21st Century  and Leader" is now being widely read by people in Seoul and  Kyonggi Province, South Korea, according to radio Voice of  National Salvation from Seoul.    The book deals with the greatness and leadership feats of  the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    A professor Kim of Seoul National University said General  Kim  Chong-il is the leader of the 21st century. The earth moves  around the dear leader Kim Chong-il who is the conning-tower of  the era of independence and the world is advancing along the  road indicated by him, the professor added.    Choe Sun-nam, a company clerk residing in Songdong district,  Seoul, said he could hardly repress the national pride of  holding General Kim Chong-il in esteem as the leader of the 21st  century. National concord, the future of the reunified country  and world peace lie in holding in high esteem the dear leader  Kim Chong-il who is possessed of such leadership ability as  universal gravitation with which he unites all the people into  one with his magnanimous politics of love for and trust in the  people, he said.    A writer Yi residing in Uijongbu city, Kyonggi Province, had  this to say:    The dear leader Kim Chong-il is not only a great master of  independent politics who has brilliantly carried into practice  the anthropocentric chuche idea fathered by President Kim  Il-song in the land of the northern half of Korea and built a  paradise of the people, but also a peerless great man who is  possessed of literary and military accomplishments, versatile  talents and profound knowledge and popular virtues.    He wished the dear leader Kim Chong-il good health and a  long  life for the prospering 21st century.</p>

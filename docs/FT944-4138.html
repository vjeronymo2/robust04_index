			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hill Hire finally floats at 94p per share It was third time lucky yesterday for Hill Hire, the commercial vehicle rental business as it finally announced its placing price of 94p per share, for a value of Pounds 25.5m, which is 2 per cent less than original estimates. The company, being floated by Birkby, the business property manager, had suffered two successive days of delay primarily because of market fluctuations. Birkby is to retain a 44 per cent holding worth Pounds 11.2m. It is also selling Ember Rental, its other vehicle hire arm, to Hill Hire for Pounds 2.7m. The two operations had net assets of about Pounds 5.3m at the end of September. Despite the delay Birkby is pleased with the float, surpassing the group's initial predictions of a placing in 1997. Mr Bill Cran, Birkby chief executive, said: 'It's a sign of (Hill Hire's) strength that it has gone in a market that's not particularly brilliant.' The placing will raise about Pounds 6.4m net for Hill Hire which will be used to repay an estimated Pounds 2.1m owed by Hill and Ember to Birkby and finance expansion. Birkby will gain estimated cash proceeds of Pounds 8.7m net from the transaction, before a payment relating to the variation of the original acquisition deal for Hill Hire. Hill Hire was founded in 1990 by its current executive team and acquired by Birkby last year for Pounds 6.5m. For the year to March 31 1994 Hill Hire made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 750,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 5.1m) and Ember made pre-tax profits Pounds 189,000, against losses of Pounds 100,000 for the previous 14 months, on turnover of Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.9m). Hill Hire will have some 2,050 vehicles within its newly formed operation and seven sites, prior to the new development, neatly sitting around the M62 corridor.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVATIONS ON 'THE CIVIL WAR'  </P> <P> In Bernstein's article, there's so much bitterness in the reactions of blacks.  </P> <P> In order for racism to die, both parties must forgive.  </P> <P> Sadly, some whites treated some blacks like dirt. But it is a new day.  </P> <P> Being 21 years old, I was not alive during the Civil War or even the civil  rights movement. I hope any Negroes still bitter can forgive me for being  white.  </P> <P> BRIAN ANDREW EBINER  </P> <P> West Covina  </P></p>

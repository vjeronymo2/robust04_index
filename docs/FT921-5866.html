			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Giant strides for the French Elf: The oil company is running against the tide of global retrenchment Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, attracted envious stares from its competitors last month when it became the first big western oil company to sign production-sharing deals in the former Soviet Union. The agreements, in Kazakhstan and Russia, are the fruit of nearly three years of painstaking negotiation with the chaotically changing bureaucracies involved, by Mr Lok Le Floch-Prigent, the bearded Breton who is Elf's chairman. They give Elf a share in what some observers believe may be the equivalent of a new Kuwait - or what could equally be a costly folly. 'Just tell me where in the world the oil business is not risky. Tell me which nation in the world knows what its energy policy will be 10 years from now,' ripostes Mr Le Floch-Prigent. If all goes to plan, Russia and Kazakhstan will provide 20 per cent of Elf's reserves by 2000. Elf's ambition in the east is the most startling illustration yet of why the state-controlled company has become such a puzzle to the world oil industry. At a time when bigger competitors have been retrenching, the formerly cautious Elf has been doing the opposite. It has spent a record FFr35.7bn (Pounds 3.6bn) on international acquisitions since President Francois Mitterrand hand-picked Mr Le Floch-Prigent to shake up France's largest company, and the world's seventh biggest oil group, in mid-1989. What has he achieved? The suspicion is that Elf has just been another victim of the takeover fever which has prompted some of France's biggest businesses to seek foreign expansion with little thought and at any cost in recent years, only to regret it when the economic downturn began to hurt. Yet nothing could be further from the truth, argues Mr Le Floch-Prigent, as he reflects on his progress and plans in a sun-filled office high up in Elf's mirror-clad Parisian tower block. Certainly, Elf has been hit by the downturn like everyone else in the industry, with a 7.5 per cent fall in net profits last year. But, unlike British Petroleum, it is not facing a serious shortage of funds. Three years ago, Mr Le Floch-Prigent found Elf to be mainly an oil-producing company with weak refining interests, plus chemicals and pharmaceuticals businesses - Atochem and Sanofi. Traditionally, the group's job had been to find oil and gas for France, which explains why it is one of the few oil groups today able to produce as much as - in fact, a bit more than - it refines. Historically, the government has taken an active role in Elf's strategy. For example, it leant on the company twice, in the early 1980s and towards the end of the decade, to help prop up parts of the then troubled state chemicals industry. Today, Mr Le Floch-Prigent has been given a freer hand in setting and carrying out objectives than his predecessors. This is an important element in the changes at Elf, and in line with the gradual withdrawal of French state influence from trouble-free areas of the public sector. He welcomes the government's plans to sell 2 per cent of Elf's equity. It currently owns 53.8 per cent. It is a mark of his new degree of independence that Mr Le Floch-Prigent successfully resisted government pressure, soon after his arrival, to sell Texasgulf, a loss-making US mineral chemicals group acquired by a predecessor in 1981. Instead, he kept the business and wrote down Dollars 600m of Texasgulf's assets. Mr Le Floch-Prigent's business plan, which he says is not quite complete, has been to turn the loose French-oriented conglomerate of oil-related businesses that he inherited into an international integrated oil group. That means getting a balance between upstream, or production and exploration, and downstream activities - refining, marketing, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - as well as broadening international coverage in all sectors. The thinking behind this is to use the downstream businesses to produce the cash needed by the capital-hungry and volatile upstream divisions, he explains. Last year, upstream and downstream businesses accounted for an equal share of operating earnings for the first time, a sign that Elf really is getting its businesses to balance. Upstream, Elf has over the past three years bought acreage in the North Sea and west Africa, so lifting production by more than 40 per cent - an unusually big jump for the industry - to 760,000 barrels per day. Mr Le Floch-Prigent sees Russia and Kazakhstan as the natural next area for development because they are in his own backyard. 'Just as a New York oil company would look at Los Angeles, so we look at the ex-Soviet Union. It's only three and a half hours on the plane,' he says. Downstream, he has been more active, if only because this side of Elf's business used to be undersized, representing a third of operating earnings three years ago. There are the acquisitions of Amoco's refinery and filling stations in the UK - incidentally Elf's first big refinery outside France; nearly all the Heron petrol station network; a big minority stake in Cepsa, Spain's second-largest oil refiner; and Minol, the former east German filling station monopoly. In chemicals, there is the takeover of Pennwalt in the US, and in pharmaceuticals, the alliance between Sanofi and Sterling Drug, the medium-sized US drug maker. Contrary to popular myth, Elf has not financed its ambitions with state subsidies, nor with excessive debt. Most of the cash has come from Elf's FFr27bn per year cashflow, while the group has also allowed itself a moderate increase in debt, from 12 per cent of shareholders' capital three years ago to 30 per cent now. At that level, its gearing is still medium to low for the industry, between BP's 69 per cent and Shell's 11 per cent. Elf has also sought to reduce the cost of acquisitions by paying with shares  -by, for example, putting part of its stake in Enterprise Oil, the UK exploration and production company, towards the acquisition of Occidental Petroleum's North Sea interests. Nor did any cash change hands in the Sterling Drug alliance, set up as a straight merger - a model that Mr Le Floch-Prigent aims to use again in future link-ups. If his three-year mandate is renewed, as seems likely, in June, he reckons his work at Elf is far from over. He wants to reduce the company's dependence on oil production in Europe and Africa - 96 per cent of the total  -by striking new agreements in the Middle East before the Russian fields come on stream. The chemicals and pharmaceuticals businesses need a big partner in Japan, he adds. Elf's stubbornly low share price is a perennial disappointment to Mr Le Floch-Prigent, and a consequence of the state's ownership, according to some of his executives. 'I don't criticise the market, but I point out that it is disappointing that the market values us as if we were just an oil business, with no chemicals or pharmaceuticals and all the cashflow they produce,' he complains. On this basis, he thinks the price/earnings ratio should be more than 12, in line with the bigger oil companies, rather than its current level of nearly 10 times historic earnings. Elf tried to improve the marketability of its shares by realising a long-held dream of getting a New York listing last June, since when Mr Le Floch-Prigent has made frequent trips to New York to try to persuade analysts that Elf is undervalued. As for whether being state-owned is an advantage or a handicap, Mr Le Floch-Prigent refuses to be drawn, as well anyone might whose job lies in the lap of God, as Mr Mitterrand is jokingly called in the civil service. All the Elf chairman will says is: 'I am satisfied with my shareholder because it has allowed me to carry out a good strategy for Elf.' Being French might have been an advantage in the early stages of the Russian contracts, when Mikhail Gorbachev was in power, on the ground that the Soviet Union felt happy dealing with a Socialist government. But state ownership was irrelevant, says an industry official. 'Exxon is always seen as the Bush oil group and we are always seen as the Mitterrand oil group in international negotiations. The oil business is political the world over,' he says. Whatever the reason, Elf's transformation over the past three years provides a rare case study of how a nationally based oil conglomerate is trying to turn itself into a coherent international group. The risks are enormous, but then Elf is in a risky business.'</p>

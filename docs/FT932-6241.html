			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Major promises unchanged economic policies MR JOHN MAJOR battled to restore stability to his administration yesterday, saying British economic policy would not change after this week's acrimonious departure of Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor. With an embittered Mr Lamont expected to become a rallying point for Conservative dissidents, the prime minister said the former chancellor's caution about British re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism, and his March budget, would remain government policy. In spite of Mr Major's attempts to portray Mr Lamont's resignation as a personal act, cabinet ministers acknowledged that the chancellor's forced resignation was a symptom of wider disquiet over Mr Major's leadership. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said: 'The body politic wanted a scapegoat.' Downing Street officials suggested that this week's reshuffle was deliberately limited in scope so as to leave maximum room for a more extensive cabinet shake-up nearer the next general election. They played down suggestions that Mr Major was worried that Mr Lamont might seek revenge. Mr Michael Howard, the new home secretary, predicted that the reshuffle would be seen as 'a turning point in the government'. But Mr Edward Leigh - a Euro-sceptic sacked as a junior industry minister on Thursday - predicted that Mr Lamont might 'argue his corner very forcefully from the back benches'. For Labour, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said voters wanted 'not just new personalities but a clear rejection of past mistakes and an embrace of an entirely new economic agenda'. In Paris, the reshuffle's aftermath overshadowed Mr Major's talks with French ministers. The prime minister seemed relatively relaxed, though, as he said Britain's policy on the European exchange rate mechanism would not be affected by the pro-European Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment as chancellor. With rightwing Conservative MPs fearing that Mr Clarke will lobby hard for early British membership, Mr Major emphasised: 'The circumstances for Britain to re-enter the ERM do not exist at the moment . . . and are unlikely to do so in the near future.' Echoing the public sympathy for Mr Lamont of cabinet ministers - many of whom had been privately urging his replacement as chancellor - the prime minister paid tribute to his former colleague and campaign manager in the Tory leadership election. 'We've always worked closely together. We've shared the same policies, the same hopes, the same dreams about getting inflation down,' Mr Major said. The former chancellor, he said, had taken much criticism and had borne it bravely. Mr Major understood the hurt Mr Lamont felt. 'Even politicians are human,' he commented. The reshuffle had been needed, he insisted, to bring new talent into the government and to enable existing ministers to broaden their experience. It had been right to make the changes now so that the new chancellor could begin work on the next Budget, the first to combine tax and spending proposals.

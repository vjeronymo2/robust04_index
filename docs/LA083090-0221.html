			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUT AWAY THE GRILL -- THESE PAMPERED PORKERS ARE PETS  </P> <P> They're short and black, weigh less than 100 pounds, and they've got round  little bellies that hang almost to the ground.  </P> <P> They're Vietnamese potbellied pigs, and they're about to be granted legal  status in Monterey Park.  </P> <P> Like most cities, Monterey Park bans all types of swine, as well as cows, sheep  and other farm animals.  </P> <P> But city officials have decided the law is hogwash when it comes to potbellied  pigs, which are smaller and more unobtrusive than their pink, much-larger  cousins.  </P> <P> So, the City Council on Monday unanimously gave preliminary approval for  residents to keep the miniature pigs as pets, one per household. The council is  scheduled to take a final vote on the proposed law Sept. 10.  </P> <P> Council members were adamant about keeping the door closed to all other  livestock.  </P> <P> "Hogs will not be permitted," Councilwoman Marie Purvis said. "Please don't run  out and buy a hog."  </P> <P> Known scientifically as Sus scrofa bittatus, the Vietnamese potbellied pig  ranges from 30 to 90 pounds -- about as big as a medium- or large-sized dog --  and can be housebroken, Monterey Park Police Capt. Jim Strait said.  </P> <P> Strait consulted with local animal control officials before recommending that  the law be changed.  </P> <P> "It's a new fad to have miniature pigs as pets," Strait said. "They're very  cute. You can keep them in the yard like a dog, train them just like a dog. You  can teach them to come. They're supposed to be smarter than dogs."  </P> <P> They're also very expensive: $1,500 for a male, $5,000 for a female, Strait  said. "It's not the kind of thing you'd just barbecue and eat," he added.  </P> <P> Consider Arnold, a 1-year-old potbellied porker who lives at the Monterey Park  home of Sally McComb, sister of Fire Chief Allen E. McComb.  </P> <P> Arnold's favorite pastimes are splashing in a portable pool on a hot summer  day, snuggling under his electric blanket when it's cold, and eating grapes and  dog food, Fire Chief McComb said.  </P> <P> He even shares a doggy door with the McCombs' German shepherd, Gretchen.  </P> <P> "Arnold has become attached to me," he said. "The pig, my nephew and myself  celebrated our birthdays together."  </P></p>

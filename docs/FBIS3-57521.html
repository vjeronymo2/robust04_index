People's deputy Leopold Taburyanskyy proposed to do  everything possible to prevent the parliamentary and  presidential elections from being held.    The issue of verifying the activities of the "Blasko"  concern  was put on the agenda. A draft resolution on this issue  consisting of 10 points was distributed to deputies. According  to Point 5 of the resolution, the Ministry of Finance and the  Ministry of Justice have been instructed to draw up an inventory  of all accounts, stocks of materials and capital equipment, and  "Blasko's" credit and commercial agreements by 1 May. Point 7  recommends that the Ukrainian president examine the issue of  removing Transport Minister Klympush and "Blasko" chairman  Kudyukin from their posts.    Eighty-one deputies voted in favor of holding an  all-Ukrainian referendum. The Supreme Council resolved to  instruct the standing commission for issues of legislation and  legality and the commission for issues of the activity of local  councils and local self-government, along with the participation  of members of the constitutional commission, to prepare a draft  document on the constitutional principles of organizing power in  Ukraine and to submit it for the Supreme Council's consideration  within two days.    Deputies examined a draft resolution on the state  privatization program submitted by the commission for issues of  economic reform and management of the national economy. No  decision was taken on this draft. Deputies passed a Ukrainian  law on introducing changes and additions to some legislative  acts on questions of leasing relations:    1. to recognize that Articles 2 and 4 of the Cabinet of  Ministers decree dated 15 January 1992 No. 9-92 "on the  additional regulation of leasing relations" and Subclause "D" of  Article 9 of the Cabinet of Ministers decree dated 20 May 1993  "on privatizing whole property complexes of state enterprises  and their structural subsections that are being leased, are not  longer valid.    2. to supplement Article 21, Point 6, of the Ukrainian law  on privatizing the property of state enterprises with the  following: "part of the property that is being privatized at the  expense of citizens' privatized funds cannot be less than 70  percent of the value for any facility, regardless of the method  of privatization, apart from facilities that are being  privatized according to the established procedure for freely  convertible currency. 3. The law comes into force from the  date of publication.    Commenting on the adopted law, Viktor Pynzenyk said that  this  law in actual fact entails introduction of the collective farm  system into Ukraine's economy and deputy Volodymyr Pylypchuk  mentioned that the law creates both the financial and economic  preconditions for the development of separatism in Ukraine.</p>

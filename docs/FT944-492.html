			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Taiwan bank buys in California Chinatrust Commercial Bank, controlled by Taiwan's Koo family, plans to buy a Californian bank in a first step toward establishing a US banking network targeting Asian, especially ethnic Chinese, communities. Mr Jeffrey Koo, chairman, said the US government deliberated for four years before approving the purchase of Trans National Bank, which has five branches and total assets of Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m). The Dollars 30m deal will be the first takeover of a US bank by a Taiwanese company. The Koo family is one of Taiwan's wealthiest and most influential families, and Chinatrust is the island's biggest privately owned bank. Mr C F Koo, the patriarch and head of the family's diverse business interests, is a senior figure in the Taiwan ruling Nationalist party. The bank will be renamed China Trust Bank of California. The purchase is part of Chinatrust's broader expansion strategy of serving Chinese communities in Asia and elsewhere. Chinatrust Commercial Bank posted net profits of TDollars 2.4bn (Pounds 59m) on sales of TDollars 25bn for the first eleven months of 1994, against TDollars 1.3bn on sales of TDollars 23bn in 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas Threatens To Step Up Its </F> Military Operations"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Hamas has said that the  "Palestinian agents' voice was silent throughout the occupation  period in the Gaza Strip and should not rise now under  Palestinian self-administration."    Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas,  added in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the movement is  very keen "not to cause the agents issue to explode conditions  in the self-rule areas. Thus the Palestinian Authority must  arrest those who murdered a Hamas member as soon as possible,  bring them to trial, and publish the files for the Palestinian  people." Ghawshah was commenting on the incident in which Zahir  Salluhah, an element from the military wing of the 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam Battalions in Gaza, was killed. He described it as "a  serious incident, and Hamas puts the entire responsibility on  the Palestinian Authority's shoulder."    He added that "any laxity in pursuing the murderers will  mean  that Hamas has to return to defending itself." He pointed out  that "it has been proved to anyone who cast doubt on Hamas'  strength that the huge mass funeral in the Strip last Friday,  which Palestinian police commanders had to join, proves that  Hamas is very popular among Palestinians."    Ghawshah pointed out that "Hamas' strength elements are used  against the Zionist occupation, not against the Palestinian  people, to which Hamas belongs."    Ghawshah revealed the reasons for the decline in armed  operations against the occupation forces last month. He said  that "Hamas' jihad and resistance plans have decreased since the  Palestinian Authority assumed its duties -- which is expected,  the aim being to reengage the occupation [forces] through jihad  and resistance, taking account of the changes that have taken  place on the ground."    The official spokesman promised to "step up the jihad and  armed operations against occupation forces in a manner that will  certainly dash the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's hopes."</p>

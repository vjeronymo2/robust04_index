			<p>BFN     [Text] During today's open session of the Islamic Majles an  urgent draft bill on controlling commodity and service prices  was submitted to the Majles. The Majles approved the urgency of  this draft bill.    The introduction part of this draft bill says: The task of  fixing prices is taken away from the Economic Council and is  transferred to the Islamic Majles. The deputies, who have  signed the only article of this draft bill, have demanded that  every price change of commodities and services should be  proposed and approved by the Islamic Majles before  implementation. The draft bill has also proposed that all such  price rises announced by the Economic Council or other  authorities, which came into effect from the beginning of  Farvardin this year [since 21 March], should be declared null  and void.    During today's open session of the Islamic Majles, the  speaker Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri announced: The call for  impeachment of the education minister [Mohammad 'Ali Najafi],  which was submitted to the Majles by 29 deputies, is contrary to  Article 151 of the Majles internal regulations and is therefore  turned down because the cases raised are general and a number of  the signatories have retracted. The speaker of the Islamic  Majles stressed: If the deputies wish to go ahead with the  impeachment, they can resubmit the impeachment request by giving  a detailed and precise account of the cases.    I would like to point out that the call for impeachment of  the education minister has been signed and submitted to the  Majles presidium. Among the instances of criticism raised are a  drop in the level of academic progress of students, the granting  of licences to managers of the Ministry to set up  non-profit-making schools, ignoring the wishes of hezbollahi  heads of schools, and squandering the national wealth.    Also during today's open session of the Majles, results of  the votes cast to elect a number of deputies proposed in some  notes of the country's budget bill for the year 1373 were  announced. During this session, there was a debate on the first  reading of a bill to establish rural development centers. After  hearing the remarks made by a number of deputies for and against  this bill, it was rejected without being approved.</p>

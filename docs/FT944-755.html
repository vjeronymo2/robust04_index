			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Investors build on Wednesday rally in Dow Wall Street In spite of further turmoil on Latin American debt and equity markets and declines in Treasury prices, leading US stocks firmed yesterday as investors looked to build on Wednesday's strong rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.12 at 3,814.92. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 performed less well, ending only 0.06 higher at 459.67, while the American SE composite slipped 0.41 to 427.52 and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.22 to 739.34. New York SE volume was 340.3m shares. The market opened in an upbeat mood following the previous day's 35-point gain which pushed the Dow above the 3,800 level for the first time since mid-November. The day's main economic news - an upward revision in third-quarter gross domestic product growth from 3.9 per cent to 4.0 per cent - had little impact on stocks. Although bond prices declined, this too had little effect on the market, which appeared to be in the middle of establishing a solid late-December rally. The positive mood, however, was dampened by events in Latin America, where most bond and stock markets were rocked by the news that the Mexican government had abandoned plans to try and keep the value of the peso within a particular trading range. From now on, it will let the currency float freely against the dollar. The announcement prompted heavy selling of Mexican ADRs (American Depositary Receipts). Telefonos de Mexico fell Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 in volume of 17m shares, the construction giant Grupo Tribasa by Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 19 5/8 , the media conglomerate Grupo Televisa by Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 32 1/8 and the bank Grupo Financiero by Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 8 7/8 . Selling spread to other Latin American ADRs, with Telecom Argentina falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 . The Latin American turmoil upset US banks which do a lot of business in the region. Citicorp fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 41 1/4 , Bank of Boston Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 26 3/4 and JP Morgan Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 55 1/4 . In contrast, Bankers Trust rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 56 5/8 after the bank agreed to pay a relatively modest fine of Dollars 10m to government regulators to settle charges relating to its sale of derivatives to the Gibson Greetings company. On the Nasdaq market, Borland International declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 6 5/8 after the technology group said revenues in the current quarter would be substantially lower than a year ago. Canada Toronto finished slightly higher as markets showed signs of winding down for the holiday season. The TSE 300 composite index added 7.10 at 4,182.72 and advances outscored falls by 399 to 321 after volume of 48.1m shares valued at CDollars 527m. Ten of the 14 sub-indices rose, including golds.</p>

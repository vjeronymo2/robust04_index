			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] "Rumors that the Tajik leadership is disinterested  in finding a peaceful solution to the internal political strife  and wants to increase Russian military presence to crush the  opposition are groundless," Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov told  INTERFAX. He said that Dushanbe had "sufficient good will to  continue the dialog."    Alimov believes that the "current state of the internal  dialog gives inspires a cautious optimism." He said the main  thing was that the "negotiations process has been launched and  the parties involved have agreed to further peace talks."    "We want to elevate the talks to a constructive plane and  put  an end to confrontation," Alimov stressed. He said the next  round of talks between the Tajik and opposition leaders might  even take place in Dushanbe in the first 10 days of June. UN  representatives, he added, would decide on the final date and  venue.  IF Note: The UN secretary general's special representative for  Tajikistan Ramires Piriz-Bollon is currently in Teheran, from  where he will travel to Islamabad and then Dushanbe on 25-27  May. He will be accompanied to the Tajik capital by the UN  deputy general secretary for political affairs, Marek Goulding.  The date and venue of the next round of Tajik internal talks is  for those officials to decide.    Meanwhile, the Tajik Islamic Renaissance Movement issued a  statement a few days ago on its readiness to consider a draft  cease-fire agreement for the Tajik-Afghan border and observe its  terms, if signed. The people behind the document recall that  the opposition delegation at the peace talks in Moscow in April  had proposed a cease-fire draft but that "the other side refused  even to discuss its contents, demonstrating the Dushanbe  regime's destructive position."  IF Note: A joint communique on the talks between Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and Tajik leader Emomali Rahmonov  contained support for the Tajik leadership's stance regarding  the continuation of dialog with the aim of building a democratic  Tajikistan. For that, firm commitment to the mutual cessation  of hostilities, measures to restore and fortify mutual trust and  the unhindered and safe return of refugees and forced migrants  to the Republic were needed, the communique stated.    The statement mentioned that the Tajik opposition posed no  threat to Tajikistan itself, Russia or other CIS states. "We are  citizens of Tajikistan finding ourselves temporarily outside the  Republic's frontiers and want to return to our homeland and live  in our own homes," it read.    "Those forces which would obstruct the peaceful settlement  of  the conflict pose the real threat to the security of Tajikistan  and other countries," the statement's authors said. The  document also pointed out that the opposition was looking for a  political way to end the conflict: "We have no objection to the  presence of CIS Collective Peace-Keeping forces in Tajikistan to  protect the country from inroads from outside."  IF Note: In their communique, Yeltsin and Rahmonov highlighted  the stabilizing role of the CIS forces in Tajikistan. "The joint  efforts to provide reliable protection and defense for the  southern borders, especially the Tajik-Afghan section, meet the  interests of all CIS countries," the communique read.    "Our campaign is not directed against any state and in no  way  does it threaten the security interests of Russia or any other  CIS country. This is a conflict between the Tajik opposition  and a close circle of individuals who forced us to leave our  homeland," the Islamic Renaissance Movement's statement stressed.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FAST-MOVING BRUSH FIRE CHARS 119 ACRES BUT LEAVES HOUSES UNTOUCHED;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: NO INJURIES ARE REPORTED IN A BLAZE THAT BURNED FOR FOUR HOURS  AND COULD BE SEEN FOR MILES. THE CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.  </P> <P> A fast-moving brush fire swept across a steep hillside in Thousand Oaks on  Thursday, threatening neighborhoods of new and old houses and causing a small  power outage before firefighters were able to bring it under control.  </P> <P> The fire, which sent plumes of black smoke hundreds of feet into the air and  could be seen from as far away as Chatsworth, charred 119 acres within a  four-hour period, fire officials said. No injuries were reported and no  structures were damaged in the blaze, authorities said.  </P> <P> Arson investigators said the fire was of suspicious origin but had not  determined its cause by late Thursday.  </P> <P> The fire erupted about 2:15 p.m. in a brushy area in the 1500 block of Erbes  Road, across the street from a residential neighborhood where many houses have  wood-shake roofs.  </P> <P> Fire officials did not call for an evacuation, and many residents hosed down  their roofs and the sides of their houses to fend off the intense heat from the  blaze. A section of Erbes Road, between El Monte and La Granada drives, was  closed to traffic for about three hours as firefighters fought to control the  blaze.  </P> <P> "We heard sirens and helicopters," said Sari Wade, who lives two blocks from  where the fire is believed to have started. "My son went outside and he said,  'Mom, I can see smoke.' I thought he was putting me on. We walked out on our  front lawn, and we saw an immense amount of flames."  </P> <P> Residents along nearby Sapra Street said they feared their houses would be lost  when a wall of flames came within 100 feet.  </P> <P> "I was mowing the lawn, and I looked across the hill and I saw this flame,"  said Shane McCarthy, 16. "Then it just spread."  </P> <P> McCarthy said he ran into the house and alerted his family. He said he climbed  onto the roof and began hosing it down.  </P> <P> "We just panicked," said Betty Adolph, McCarthy's mother. "We've just seen all  that destruction in the Santa Barbara fire, and we were afraid we'd lose our  home."  </P> <P> Westerly winds eventually pushed the blaze up a steep hillside toward the  exclusive community of North Ranch. However, about 200 Ventura and Los Angeles  county firefighters, assisted by a number of hand crews and three  water-dropping helicopters, managed to keep the blaze away from the houses in  the area.  </P> <P> Capt. Tom Law of the Ventura County Fire Department said the city's strict  weed-abatement ordinance was largely responsible for keeping the fire at a  distance. The law requires that residents keep a clearance area of 100 feet  around their houses and other structures.  </P> <P> "It's definitely working today," Law said of the ordinance. "It's saved our  bacon many times."  </P> <P> Carol Larson, area manager for Southern California Edison, said about 50  customers in the area were without power for several hours because a single  utility pole had been damaged in the blaze.  </P> <P> "We initially turned off power to approximately 2,000 homes for 60 seconds in  order to isolate the equipment that was damaged," she said. There are a large  number of power poles in the charred brush area, but the poles are treated with  a special fire retardant, Larson said.  </P> <P> Debbie Beaumont, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman, said fire  officials were pleased that they were able to get a handle on the fire as  quickly as they did.  </P> <P> "Everybody was really nervous after the Santa Barbara fire," Beaumont said.  "But everything went really smoothly."  </P> <P> Brush fires in Santa Barbara and Glendale last week destroyed 637 houses,  injured dozens of people and caused more than $200 million in damage. A brush  fire also charred 585 acres and threatened high-priced houses on the northern  edge of Ojai last week.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Carol Watson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ferranti loss reduced to Pounds 40m FERRANTI International's disposals and cost cutting helped generate a small cash inflow of Pounds 20.2m in the year to March 31, compared with an outflow of Pounds 161.6m in the previous period. Interest charges for the electronics group, which supplies advanced systems for business, defence and the community, fell from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds 13.5m and exceptional charges, due to restructuring, were also lower at Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 65.4m). The pre-tax loss was therefore contained at Pounds 39.6m (Pounds 98.1m) although turnover fell to Pounds 362.6m (Pounds 458m). This followed an interim loss of Pounds 28.8m on sales of Pounds 212.4m. There was a loss per share of 4p (11.5p) and no dividend is proposed. Mr Eugene Anderson, the chairman and chief executive, said the rationalisation programme had progressed satisfactorily, and by the year end the workforce had been reduced by 41 per cent to 5,374. The Pounds 41.1m recovered in relation to the International Signal and Control fraud, which can be paid to special shareholders, will not be distributed until Ferranti restores distributable reserves. The year's losses required a Pounds 44.1m transfer from reserves, and shareholders' funds fell to Pounds 71.9m (Pounds 112.5m). COMMENT Judging by yesterday's 17 per cent rise in the share price to 10 1/4 p, Ferranti has just been promoted from write-off to recovery play. Although Pounds 44.1m of attributable losses are hardly inspiring, the City seemed prepared to breathe a sigh of relief at what might have been. But while the company's survival now seems more secure, it remains reliant on an unfashionable defence sector for more than half its earnings. And the main problem for investors is how to value a company which has been forced to sell its family silver. Nevertheless, the company is forecast to break even this year, perhaps rising to Pounds 10m profits in 1994. On the basis of turnover and longer-term earnings, the shares can go higher. But on the basis of assets, they look about right.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> REGIONAL REPORT;  </P> <P> A TRAFFIC JAM UP THERE TOO;  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND AIRPORTS ARE THREATENED WITH GRIDLOCK. AND, WITH NO CENTRALIZED  PLANNING, IT'S LIKELY TO GET WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.  </P> <P> Southern California -- land of the jet set and the frequent flier -- is edging  dangerously close to airport gridlock.  </P> <P> Without new airfields or dramatic expansion of existing ones, flying to and  from the Southland could become an intolerably expensive and punishing  challenge by the turn of the century. Already, experts say, the region's  airport capacity shortage is the country's third worst, trailing only Chicago  and New York.  </P> <P> While alarming, the situation should come as no surprise to Southern  California. Countless studies by planners and consultants have for years  forecast mushrooming passenger and cargo demand -- and warned that the air  transportation system was simply not keeping pace.  </P> <P> But local officials -- aware that airports, like trash dumps, can be  treacherous political land mines -- have not given the problem its proper place  on the civic agenda, critics say.  </P> <P> Moreover, planning to expand and improve the regional airport network has  mostly been a piecemeal effort, bedeviled by the independent nature and  individual whims of each airfield's operator.  </P> <P> Airport woes are not unique to Southern California. Indeed, national experts  are hard-pressed to name more than a few major cities that have done a credible  job on long-range airport planning.  </P> <P> But with its vibrant economy, rapid population growth and tourist attractions,  the Southland's situation is particularly precarious.  </P> <P> "We give talks about this (airport) capacity problem around the country, and  one of our favorite examples is Southern California," said Drew Steketee,  executive director of the Washington-based Partnership for Improved Air Travel,  a coalition of airlines, frequent fliers and shippers pushing for improvements  in the nation's air transportation system. "You're in a real jam out there, and  the consequences could be dramatic."  </P> <P> Projections by the Southern California Assn. of Governments tell a large part  of the story:  </P> <P> Without major expansion and improvement projects, Los Angeles International,  Ontario, Burbank, John Wayne and Long Beach airports will be able to serve a  combined total of about 63 million passengers annually by the year 2000.  </P> <P> But by then, public demand for airplane seats at those five airports will have  surged to 93 million, leaving 30 million would-be travelers essentially out of  luck.  </P> <P> In San Diego, where officials have been hunting for a new airport site for four  decades, officials say pint-size Lindbergh Field will be at capacity within 10  years. Parking lots and roads leading to the landlocked airport already are  jammed beyond the point planners consider tolerable.  </P> <P> "Ultimately, demand will so exceed supply that fares will skyrocket and people  simply won't be able to catch a flight whenever they want to," predicts Michael  Armstrong, an aviation planner with SCAG.  </P> <P> "We'll be back to serving the flying elite," Armstrong said. "The victim will  be the middle-income guy who wants to spend a long weekend in San Francisco.  He's going to look at that $500 fare and say, 'Forget it, I'm staying home.' "  </P> <P> Aside from the hassles awaiting travelers, manufacturers and other businesses  that rely on aviation will suffer as cargo flights compete with passenger runs  for available space. The regional economy could flag as tourists and industry  -- discouraged by restricted air access -- go elsewhere.  </P> <P> "There are very few facilities in California, and especially Southern  California, that generate more economic benefits and more jobs than do our  airports," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), a ranking member of the House  subcommittee on aviation. "When they get behind -- when growth moves faster  than the development of airports to accommodate that increased travel -- we are  losing that economic benefit."  </P> <P> At the Federal Aviation Administration, Jim Wiggins agrees, calling the  situation critical.  </P> <P> "If we don't do something soon, we will have extensive delay problems," said  Wiggins, manager of planning and programming for the FAA's Western Pacific  Region.  </P> <P> The Southland, of course, is not facing this fate alone. Chicago, New York,  Washington, Seattle, Atlanta -- these and many other metropolitan areas are or  soon will be plagued with airport capacity shortages that threaten to reduce  service, drive up fares and make convenient flying all but obsolete.  </P> <P> Already, the FAA reports, at least 11 airports experience chronic delays  because of traffic congestion. Absent any improvements, aerial gridlock will  tie up 32 airports by 1996, causing a total of about 20,000 hours of delay. The  cost of these holdups to passengers and shippers already totals about $3  billion a year.  </P> <P> The source of the crunch is clear: more people are flying, and many are flying  more often. In 1977, the year before deregulation, 243 million people flew on  commercial aircraft in the United States. A decade later, that number had  almost doubled, reaching 468 million. And by the year 2000, the FAA predicts it  will almost double again, climbing to 800 million.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, only one major airport (Dallas-Ft. Worth) has been built in the last  two decades. And only Austin, Tex., and Denver have firm plans for new  airfields.  </P> <P> "We've seen a doubling of passengers, a doubling of demand, and the  infrastructure has just remained static," said Southwest Airlines Chairman Herb  Kelleher. "Isn't it astounding that the United States, whose essential method  for moving people is by air, has not built a new airport for 16 years? We must  be mad."  </P> <P> It doesn't take an aeronautical genius to figure out how Southern California  wound up in its particular mess. For starters, most residents don't want new  airports in their neighborhood, and many people living near existing airports  would throw their bodies on the Tarmac -- or, like Newport Beach homeowners  upset by jet noise at John Wayne, sue -- to ensure that those facilities do not  grow.  </P> <P> Although airports can be lucrative for communities, many residents believe any  payoffs in dollars or jobs are eclipsed by the noise, air pollution and surface  traffic the facilities generate. These foes frequently win the ear of  politicians, despite pressure for expansion from passengers, airlines and even  the federal government, which requires airports to make reasonable efforts to  accommodate airborne interstate commerce.  </P> <P> "Airports are NIMBYs (Not-In-My-Back-Yard), just like jails," said Jerry  Epstein, president of the Los Angeles Airport Commission.  </P> <P> In addition, although Southland planning agencies have completed enough airport  studies to fill a jumbo jet, critics complain that a lack of unity has plagued  efforts to attack the looming crisis.  </P> <P> The result, some say, has been a sort of political sclerosis.  </P> <P> "We've been working on this problem for 12 years and we're no further ahead  than we were when we started," said Hank Wedaa, a Yorba Linda city councilman  and chairman of SCAG's aviation committee. "We've got tremendous knowledge,  piles of reports . . . but we don't have anyone with the (guts) to stand up and  make a decision."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the pressure to find solutions to the congestion problems are  mounting:  </P> <P> * At Los Angeles International Airport, the nation's third-busiest, the  passenger load is expected to grow to more than 60 million passengers annually  by the year 2000. That's 10 million to 15 million passengers more than the  existing terminals can handle.  </P> <P> Plans are afoot for new passenger and freight terminals, as well as a rail  "people-mover" system to ferry travelers around. But environmental reviews and  community anxiety about such growth could stall construction for years.  Moreover, the cost of expansion -- along with the road and freeway improvements  needed before all these people can get to the airport -- would run into the  billions.  </P> <P> * More than 5 million passengers opted for Ontario International Airport, owned  by the Los Angeles Department of Airports, during 1989 -- twice the number that  the facility was designed to handle. SCAG says that figure will more than  double again during the next decade.  </P> <P> To handle the crush, officials are pushing for a $350-million terminal complex  at Ontario, scheduled to open in 1995. But financing and environmental  clearances have yet to be obtained. With its twin, 2-mile-long runways, Ontario  probably could be redesigned to handle far more than 12 million passengers a  year. But that's the limit set by the California Air Resources Board, which  says a greater level of operations would degrade air quality.  </P> <P> * Restricted by a court settlement to serving 4.5 million passengers annually,  Orange County's John Wayne Airport is already what manager George Rebella calls  "maxed out." Some relief will come next month when a new terminal -- part of a  $310-million expansion -- opens and the allowable passenger ceiling climbs to  8.4 million. But Rebella said that by 2005, demand will have surged to 22  million passengers a year -- almost three times the airport's capacity.  </P> <P> Physical constraints and the threat of lawsuits make any further expansion of  John Wayne unlikely, and the Board of Supervisors recently rejected potential  sites for a new airport in Orange County. Instead, the politicians are looking  for a solution 75 miles away and on someone else's turf -- the  soon-to-be-closed George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, which some  hope will be converted to a commercial airfield.  </P> <P> * San Diego -- the nation's sixth-largest city -- has outgrown Lindbergh Field,  its tiny, landlocked airport on the edge of downtown. Aside from crowding  problems, the field's single runway is so short that a 747 cannot take off with  a full load of fuel. A package of improvements totaling $350 million are on the  table, but the new terminal gates, parking structures and people-movers would  at most squeeze 20 more years of life out of the airport.  </P> <P> San Diego, once hopeful that the Pentagon might permit commercial air service  at Miramar Naval Air Station, is now contemplating a binational airport on the  U.S.-Mexico border. Boosters, who envision shared runways and linked terminals  on opposite sides of the border, say the joint facility could fly easily by  building upon Tijuana's existing Rodriguez Airport. But skeptics say that  hammering out the international agreements needed for such a venture could take  decades.  </P> <P> * Burbank Airport stands as the only Southland field to record a decline in  passengers in recent years, dropping from 3.2 million in 1987 to 2.7 million in  1989. The dip, however, probably has less to do with reduced demand than with  airline mergers -- which have led to cutbacks in the regional flights to which  Burbank is restricted because of its short runways -- and a policy allowing  airport access only to "Stage III" aircraft.  </P> <P> These late-model jetliners -- quieter than their predecessors -- make up only  half the nation's commercial fleet, and airlines with many older planes find it  inconvenient to use Burbank. The older craft, however, gradually are being  replaced, and Burbank officials predict that demand will surge to 7 million  passengers annually by 2000. Plans for new facilities to accommodate that load  are meeting resistance from homeowners' groups -- especially Los Angeles  residents on the airport's west side, land over which most planes departing  Burbank fly.  </P> <P> * Nowhere is the power of neighborhood concern over airport noise more evident  than in Long Beach. In response to damage claims from residents, the spacious,  municipal airport allows just 41 flights a day by Stage III aircraft and limits  hours of service to between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m.  </P> <P> The air carriers want more, arguing that the 1,166-acre field -- convenient to  the Long Beach, San Diego and San Gabriel River freeways -- could play a vital  role in solving Southern California's air travel crunch. But the Long Beach  City Council has shown no sign of weakening in its resolve to keep a lid on  operations.  </P> <P> There are reasons that the construction of a coordinated, up-to-date system of  facilities to serve the flying public is lagging, especially in a large and  diverse region like Southern California.  </P> <P> Except for LAX and Ontario, both of which function under the authority of the  Los Angeles Department of Airports, the Southland's airports are a pretty  independent lot.  </P> <P> "What you have are all these different groups going off and doing their own  studies, rather than putting their heads together and cooperating," said  Barbara Lichman, a Newport Beach attorney who served on a panel that searched  for a new airport site in Orange County. "It's very shortsighted and stupid."  </P> <P> San Diego City Councilman Bruce Henderson echoes that view, saying that "there  has been a lack of forward thinking" on the airport problem.  </P> <P> "How do we coordinate all the Southern California airports and make the most  efficient use of our runway space? That's a question no one is asking,"  Henderson said.  </P> <P> Rep. Packard hopes that part of the remedy lies in legislation he is drafting  to require broad-based master planning of airports.  </P> <P> "Just think where we'd be if, 20 years ago, we'd come up with a long-term plan  and set aside land and asked cities to protect that land from encroachment,"  said Packard, who believes Southern California can serve as a model for an  airport planning strategy nationwide.  </P> <P> Although SCAG officials favor more coordination, their top aviation specialist,  Tim Merwin, suspects that local politics will always defy a cooperative  solution. "Even if you get six counties in a given region to agree to build an  airport in City A's jurisdiction, it's just not going to happen unless City A  says it's OK."  </P> <P> There have been suggestions for some sort of regional super-agency -- something  more powerful than SCAG, which does overall planning but has no decision-making  authority in the development of the region's air facilities. But Cliff Moore,  executive director of the Los Angeles Department of Airports, typifies many  local officials who question the need for such an agency -- and wonder how much  muscle it could truly flex.  </P> <P> "Any time you get away from local control," Moore observes, "you have to really  have strong justification for it."  </P> <P> Similar misgivings have greeted suggestions that the federal government play a  stronger role in siting airports. Some experts believe the FAA could insulate  airport construction from the perils of local politics by simply declaring a  new airport a national priority, finding a site and getting the thing built.  Others, however, say forget it: Congress would never usurp local authority over  land-use matters.  </P> <P> Even when decisive steps are taken to remedy the airport problem, unforeseen  gremlins seem to interfere.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Department of Airports, for example, has for years been  counting on Palmdale as a future relief valve for much of the region's air  traffic. Today, America West Airlines offers four round-trips daily between  Palmdale and Las Vegas. But the Airport Department's ultimate goal is to turn  the 36 square miles of sand, cactus and sagebrush it owns in the Antelope  Valley into a bustling "superport."  </P> <P> A competing proposal, however, envisions converting George Air Force Base -- on  another swatch of desert in San Bernardino County -- into an international  "megaport."  </P> <P> Experts agree privately that there is not enough demand for both airports, and  with billions of dollars in enhanced real estate values hanging in the balance,  the battle over the rival plans could span years.  </P> <P> Trouble is, there isn't time for protracted fighting. Getting the necessary  environmental clearances and then planning, building and opening new airport  facilities cannot be done overnight.  </P> <P> "Denver has been at it for 10 years," Wiggins said. "And they're just breaking  ground there."  </P> <P> For this and other reasons, SCAG officials -- frustrated after watching for  years as studies warning of the coming crisis stack higher and higher on  politicians' bookshelves -- are skeptical of the prospects for any significant  near-term relief.  </P> <P> "It's very likely that we won't be successful in finding the new airport,"  Armstrong said. "So the question we're facing is, what do you do short of  building a new facility to handle the demand?"  </P> <P> New technology is one option. Growing interest in high-speed trains offers hope  that rail service in the busiest air travel corridor -- Southern California to  the Bay Area -- might be in the offing.  </P> <P> And, in addition to the expected introduction of wide-bodied, large-capacity  jetliners on short-haul routes, some experts say that a hybrid craft called the  tilt-rotor -- which takes off vertically from a small space, like a helicopter,  and then rotates its engines to zip off like an airplane at 350 m.p.h. -- might  provide some relief.  </P> <P> Originally designed to carry combat troops, the tilt-rotor is considered a  promising craft for civilian use. Prototypes can carry only several dozen  passengers and are limited in range, but supporters say future models could be  practical for use on congested commuter routes. Another advantage is that the  tilt-rotor's vertical takeoff capability means it can be based virtually  anywhere, and researchers already envision floating platforms and "vertiports"  built over freeway interchanges and in urban centers.  </P> <P> But technological relief will take years -- and cost millions -- to bring to  reality, and thus some suggest a quicker answer to the crunch lies in the  military bases scattered across the Southland. In the past, installations like  Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in  Orange County and Camp Pendleton have been flatly declared off limits by the  Pentagon. Many feel it is time the Defense Department gave some ground.  </P> <P> "I like having the Marines around, but they have to share," said Wedaa, who  supports a commercial airport at El Toro.  </P> <P> Jack Koerper, special projects director for the San Diego Assn. of Governments,  recalls an FAA study describing the nation's 23 most congested commercial  airports. Within a short distance of each, he said, sat an under-used military  airfield.  </P> <P> "The relief valve at some point has simply got to be the military bases,"  Koerper said.  </P> <P> But even if such bases suddenly became available, opposition from neighboring  residents would undoubtedly be an issue. Each time talk of flying commercial  jetliners into El Toro comes up, angry shouts erupt from the folks in Irvine,  Leisure World and other communities near the base.  </P> <P> For this reason, many experts predict that only the severe pain of the pending  capacity crunch will usher in relief. Much like the old argument that commuters  will take the bus or car-pool once the traffic gets unbearable, this theory  holds that, ultimately, intolerable fares and a scarcity of flights will  persuade the public something has to be done.  </P> <P> "I'm enough of an optimist that I won't say this problem is impossible, but  it's pretty close," said Merwin, SCAG's aviation specialist. "We will have to  experience a good deal of the effects of the shortfall -- higher fares,  inconvenience -- before there is any push to remedy the problem."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Southern California Airport Capacities  </P> <P> Here are the passenger and cargo figures for the Southland's largest airports  (See key at center)  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1.

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Accounting change at TI SHARES in TI fell 2p to 301p yesterday as the market pondered the change in the specialist engineer's accounting policies which its annual report revealed this week. Analysts said there was also concern about the possible affect on acquisitive companies from the Accounting Standards Board's proposed changes to fair value provisioning. TI said it had capitalised Pounds 7.7m of research and development costs in its Dowty arm. It said the policy of writing R&amp;D off through the P&amp;L account remained unchanged elsewhere in the group. Dowty was, however, developing new landing gear for the Airbus A330 and A340. The capitalised R&amp;D was in the accounts within work in progress.</p>

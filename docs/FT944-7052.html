			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Relief on interest - Briefcase The mortgage on my sole residence is with a lender, Western Trust &amp; Savings, but its interest rate is not particularly competitive. If I re-mortgage with a different lender, will I still be able to claim tax relief on the interest charged? The present loan is under Miras and I am a standard-rate taxpayer. In principle the answer is 'yes', by virtue of section 354(1)(c) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. This gives relief for interest paid 'on a loan to defray money applied . . . in paying off another loan if interest on that other loan would have been eligible for relief under section 353 had the loan not been paid off . . .' However, the answer would be 'not entirely' - because of the restrictions imposed by section 355(2A &amp; 2B) - if, for example, part of your existing mortgage covered 'money applied in improving or developing land or buildings on land, otherwise than by the erection of a new building (which is not part of an existing residence) on land which, immediately before the improvement or development began, had no building on it'. We could have given you a simpler and more helpful reply if you had given us more precise background facts. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

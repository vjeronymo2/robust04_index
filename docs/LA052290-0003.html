			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RASPBERRY ON U.S. RACISM AND CHANGING PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES  </P> <P> In response to Raspberry's column in which he quotes the opportunistic  bootlicker Julius Lester as saying "anyone who defines himself as a victim has  found a way to keep himself in a perpetual state of self-pity and anger. And  that . . . is black America today."  </P> <P> Only another bootlicker such as Raspberry would quote Lester. And only  Raspberry would not question his credentials as a '60s revolutionary.  </P> <P> I recently had a personal experience with racism '90s-style. Yes, the incident  left me angry. Self-pity, no! I am a construction worker, and the racist  incident was caused by a major contractor doing work for the city of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> In brief, Raspberry and Lester are not dealing with the reality of racism in  the '90s. The column by Walter Farrell ("A Revolt by the Underclass?"  Commentary, May 11) represents more closely my attitude, and the attitudes of  my friends. To quote the brother James Baldwin, "No more water, the fire next  time!"  </P> <P> CHARLES D. McGREGOR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela has issued a communique to all  ANC regions and officials warning that any member found flouting  the electoral code of conduct will be disciplined, the ANC said  in a statment on Thursday [31 March].    This follows the Independent Elections Commission's [IEC]  finding on Wednesday against the ANC arising out of disruption  of a National Party election meeting in Venda three weeks ago.    "Although the happenings in Venda did not result from  decisions by either the leadership or the structures of the ANC,  the movement takes collective responsibility and will ensure  that a message of political tolerance is disseminated to all our  regions and structures," the statement said.    It said the ANC had on a number of occasions publicly called  on all members and supporters to desist from any activities that  undermined the principles of free and fair electioneering.    "In this regard, ANC President Nelson Mandela has issued a  communique to all our regions and officials, to ensure that any  ANC member found to have flouted the electoral code of conduct  will be disciplined in terms of the ANC constitution."    Thousands of posters and leaflets containing the electoral  code of conduct have been distributed to all ANC regions and  branches.    "The ANC regrets all incidents of intimidation and  disruption  irrespective of who the perpetrators are," the statement said.</p>

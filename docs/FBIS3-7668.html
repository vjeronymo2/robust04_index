			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Transparency Vital in Any Repatriation"] </F>   [Text] The protest by the United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR) over the Thai Government's "voluntary"  repatriation of some 25,000 Cambodian refugees back to their  homeland last week has focussed the attention of the  international community on the human rights issue involved. In  a letter to Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, UN High  Commissioner Sadako Ogata said she was saddened by the event.  She also took "strong exception" to the "manner" in which the  repatriation was carried out by the Thai Government.    Except for a number of Thai military officers who actually  supervised the repatriation, no outsiders -- not even UNHCR  representatives or members of the mass media -- were allowed to  witness the event. In fact, the UNHCR had requested access to  the displaced people, but this was rejected by the Thai  Government. According to an explanation offered by National  Security Council secretary-general Kachatphai Burutphat, the  situation at the time was confused and permission was,  therefore, not granted.    Because the repatriation was done in such a clandestine  manner,it was natural for the UNHCR to harbour suspicions that  the Cambodian refugees might be forced back into Cambodia and  that their lives might be at great risk due to the continuing  fighting. Besides, there had been previous instances -- which  were well-documented -- of forced repatriation of Cambodian  refugees into dangerous areas.    Had access been granted in the first place to UNHCR  representatives or the push-back been carried out in a  transparent manner, a protest would have been avoided and the  country's image and reputation would not have been affected.  And the trip organised by the Supreme Command for Bangkok-based  reporters to monitor the situation in the Chanthaburi border  area would have been unnecessary. It is unlikely to help much  in eliminating the mistrust of the international community,  anyway.    Of course, the Thai Government's foremost responsibility is  towards protecting national interests. The Government has every  right to repatriate the Cambodian refugees or even to deny them  entry if it felt their presence would jeopardise national  interests. But since we are not alone in this world and are part  of the international community, we have to recognise and accept  some of the universal principles laid down by the world  community, such as human rights. The Government was right and  should be commended for opening the border to receive the asylum  seekers from Cambodia. It is unfortunate that the Government  then chose to hide from the public eye when it decided to send  the refugees home.    But to view the Thai Government's action in a negative light  without taking a serious look at the root cause of the refugee  problem is very unfair to Thailand. The Cambodian Government's  accusation that Thailand violated human rights by driving  Cambodian refugees back into their home country sounds  hypocritical because it has to take the full blame for starting  a war which sent its people fleeing in panic across the border.  All the warring factions in Cambodia must share the blame for  their stubbornness and selfishness which resulted in their  inability to reconcile among themselves.    The United Nations must also be held responsible for its  ineffectiveness and complete failure to disarm the Khmer Rouge  guerrillas as well as their rival factions, leaving behind an  unaccomplished task and a country which is still very much at  war, much like the day the first UN peacekeeping troops marched  triumphantly into Cambodia to restore peace and supervise  general elections.    If the Government feels it has fulfilled its humanitarian  responsibility and considers it to be safe enough for the  Cambodian refugees to go home without risking their lives, there  is no reason to hide from the public the manner in which it  carried out the repatriation or will carry out any similar  operations in the future.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is not the Coast Guard's intent to classify the materials previously unregulated by the Coast Guard as ``hazardous''. In response to the concerns raised by the comments, this NPRM proposes to change the title of 46 CFR part 148 to ``Bulk Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling'' thereby eliminating the word ``hazardous''. The proposed rules would also establish a new classification called ``Potentially Dangerous Materials'' (PDM) which would parallel the IMO classification MHB. This classification would include materials that may be transported in bulk without posing undue risk if the precautions described in part 148 are observed. Conversely, if these precautions are not followed, the material in this category would have the potential to cause harm. In most cases the proposed precautions are simply good operating procedures that would be followed by a prudent mariner in order to ensure the safety and integrity of the vessel. Also, proposed &sect;148.1 clearly states that these regulations would apply only to bulk shipments of these materials by water, and proposed &sect;148.3 clearly states that materials defined as Potentially Dangerous Materials would be regulated only when being carried as a bulk cargo on board a vessel. These categories and requirements would clearly reflect the intended status and handling requirements for the materials in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. One comment noted that the amendments to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 will not render the BC Code mandatory, and, that since the code will remain a recommended standard, it should not be referenced in the Coast Guard regulations. The fact that IMO has not made the BC Code mandatory through SOLAS does not prohibit any sovereign nation from adopting the Code or any of its provisions through that nation's domestic statutes and regulations. The Coast Guard proposes, however, to incorporate by reference in 46 CFR part 148 only those portions of the BC Code dealing with hazardous materials. Thus, selected pertinent provisions of the BC Code would be adopted in the Coast Guard regulations. Where necessary, those provisions of the BC Code included in the proposed rules would be modified to fit the nature of the U.S. shipping industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. One comment suggested that the format of the regulations not be substantially altered because those affected by the regulations are familiar with the current format. The comment suggested that if the motivating concern of the Coast Guard is reduction of the paperwork burden of the Special Permit process, then the Coast Guard should change the permitting process to allow for one permit per commodity, with interested shippers becoming a party to that permit, and extend the expiration date of the permit by ten years. The comment suggested adopting these changes without adding any of the materials currently carried under Special Permit to the list of materials permitted under the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. It is the Coast Guard's position that while this rule, if adopted, would alter the current format of the regulations, it would also clarify the responsibilities of shippers and provide them with important safety information. Elimination of the time-consuming paperwork burden inherent in the Special Permit process for those materials which have an established record of safe transportation is only one of the motivating factors for undertaking this regulatory revision. Under this proposal, new or one-time carriers of a material would be informed of the risks and precautions involved in carrying that material. When the materials currently carried under Special Permit are not included in the proposed regulations, there is a possibility that a shipper or carrier might not be aware that a material is potentially dangerous when carried in bulk and therefore might not observe the appropriate precautions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the inclusion of materials currently carried under Special Permit in 46 CFR part 148 would allow all shippers more flexibility since they would not have to allow for lead time to obtain a Special Permit, and would have a wider choice in the number of cargoes that they would be able to carry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. One comment suggested that the Coast Guard differentiate between the hazards associated with the various materials. This has been done by placing the materials into one of the hazard classes defined by the HMR or by classifying them as PDM and including provisions with special requirements for materials with the potential to cause significant harm if mishandled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. One comment stated that there is no need to change U.S. regulations until the amendments to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 are approved by IMO and the BC Code becomes mandatory. The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. The amendment to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 will not make the entire BC Code mandatory, only certain basic provisions concerning the passage of cargo information from the shipper to the master and the use of vapor detection equipment will become mandatory. Moreover, since the comment was received, the revisions to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 were adopted at the 59th session of MSC. Therefore, the Coast Guard has determined that there is no need to further delay the proposal to revise 46 CFR part 148.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Three comments supported the addition of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), in both hot-molded and cold-molded briquets, to the regulations, since they are currently being shipped under Special Permits which mirror the provisions of the BC Code. The requirements for carrying DRI are included in proposed &sect;&sect;148.245 and 148.250. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

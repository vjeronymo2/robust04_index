			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Nikkei extends fall to seventh consecutive session INCREASING concerns over a delayed economic recovery in the US depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average extended its decline for the seventh session, its longest consecutive fall this year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed down 225.57 to 17,101.50 on arbitrage unwinding. The index opened at the day's high of 17,265.20 before falling to the day's low of 16,962.29 later in the morning. Volume fell to 180m shares from 245m, below 200m for the first time since August 18. Losers led gainers by 653 to 274, with 158 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 10.43 to 1,292.71 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index 7.08 to 1,020.74. Small-lot buying by public funds was noted in the afternoon but investors remained inactive following last week's fall on Wall Street. The higher yen and worries over profits at leading Japanese exporters also depressed sentiment. Investors said that the effects of the economic support package were wearing off. 'The market went up way too fast and there was bound to a correction,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson. The market has lost 8.1 per cent since the index started to fall on September 25. Construction companies lost ground, dragged down by Shimizu, which fell Y40 to Y910. Investors rushed to place sell orders on last week's announcement, that the company expected to post losses on the liquidation of its UK and Australian subsidiaries. Leading exporters were depressed on the yen's strength. Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y20 to Y1,070, and Nikon, the precision manufacturer, Y21 to Y600. However, Hitachi added Y13 to Y740 on bargain hunting by public funds. Alps Electric lost Y39 to Y870 on its announcement that it expected to post an 89 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year to next March. It also announced a Y5 cut in dividends per share for the business year. Aisin Seiki, a auto parts maker affiliated to Toyota Motor, rose Y42 to Y1,040, becoming the day's most actively traded issue. The company has become popular among short-term speculators on the reported success of its room-temperature nuclear fusion experiment. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 214.31 to 18,717.38 in volume of 4.1m shares. Foreign investors were seen liquidating Nintendo, the video game maker, which fell Y70 to Y9,700. Roundup TOKYO's decline was reflected in the region's weakness yesterday. Hong Kong was closed for a public holiday. AUSTRALIA retreated further but volume remained low because of a public holiday in New South Wales. The All Ordinaries finished at its lowest level for 18 months, down 15.80 at 1,467.1 with 52m shares traded worth ADollars 111m. The banking sector remained under pressure with BHP shedding 24 cents to ADollars 11.70 and ANZ striking its lowest level for nearly seven years, down 11 cents at ADollars 2.77. SEOUL fell on fears of political unrest, on reports that the steel tycoon, Park Tae-joon, had offered to quit as head of Pohang Iron and Steel and might decline to act as campaign manager for the ruling party's presidential candidate. The composite stock index closed 10.90, or 2.1 per cent lower at 502.22 in turnover of Won94.58bn, having been closed on Saturday for National Foundation Day. TAIWAN tried to accelerate last week's uptrend, with the weighted index up 70 points after the central bank's 0.5 percentage point cut in the rediscount rate last Saturday; but it lost momentum, and the index ended 16.20 better at 3,720.45 in turnover up from TDollars 22.08bn to TDollars 24.8bn. BANGKOK saw profit-taking in property groups and banks which had both risen strongly last week. The SET index fell 3.11 to 877.60 in turnover of Bt14.6bn. Advances led declines 127 to 114 with 47 unchanged. Bangkok Land and Krisda Mahanakorn lost Bt2 and Bt10 respectively to Bt143 and Bt175. MANILA rose around midsession as aggressive buyers came in to accumulate stocks ahead of a long-awaited fourth-quarter climb. The composite index rose 13.87 to 1,442.65. NEW ZEALAND was dominated by trading in Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey and the NZSE-40 index lost 11.43 to 1,412.00. Turnover was moderate at NZDollars 12.6m. FLC fell 3 cents to NZDollars 1.91 and Carter Holt Harvey lost 1 cent to NZDollars 2.49.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P>  HOT FLASHES: Is Chrysalis Records' colorful president Mike Bone on his way out  as head of that label? That's been the big rumor in the record industry, with  trade-paper reports saying Bone could be headed toward Arista Records, which  just lost its top exec, Donnie Ienner (who's moving to CBS). The rumors have  been fueled by reports of a possible sale to BMG Music or a takeover bid by  David Geffen, who recently purchased 10% of Chrysalis stock. We'd bet against  Bone leaving. A longtime promotion whiz whose speciality was breaking hard-rock  bands, Bone would seem out of place at Arista, a label largely devoted to  mainstream pop acts. Meanwhile, he can point to a promising crop of young bands  at Chrysalis, including Was (Not Was), Pursuit of Happiness and the Waterboys  (who've all topped the 100,000 sales mark). "If it wasn't for all these trade  press rumors, there'd be a lot more pine trees in south Georgia," Bone  responded. "I have no desire or plans to leave here. I couldn't be happier  here. I'm real proud of what we've accomplished so far."  </P></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / CrossRail off track: Financing a London rail link At last, the chancellor has given the go-ahead for central London's biggest public transport project since the opening of the Victoria Line in 1968. From around the turn of the century, people travelling on suburban trains into British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street terminuses will no longer have to change to the Underground to reach the West End and the City: they will stay on their trains and be carried through to their destinations on CrossRail, a new rail link underneath the capital. Or will they? More precisely, what the chancellor actually announced in his Budget speech was that the government was to seek ways of attracting private finance into the Pounds 2bn project, rather than building it with public sector money as originally planned. On the face of it, the idea has some appeal. It is sometimes forgotten that virtually the whole of London's Underground railway, bar the Victoria Line and a few extensions, was created by the private sector. A substantial part of it was built by Charles Tyson Yerkes, a convicted embezzler from Chicago, who doubled the size of the network with three new lines between 1905 and 1907 and profited handsomely as a result. The case for building CrossRail is that, like many other big cities, London suffers from having its railway terminuses on the outskirts of the central area. The result is that about 200,000 rail commuters a day have to switch from main line trains to the Underground to get to where they want to go, putting heavy strains on the system. The problem has worsened with the outward migration of London's population. One solution is to join the railway lines on one side of the city with those on the opposite side, so allowing trains to run right through the centre. London has already done this in a small way with the Thameslink service, which uses limited capacity on an old cross-city route to take some suburban trains through the capital on a north-south axis. The main obstacle to building new cross-city lines is their cost. Invariably, they have to go underground, and costs are further increased because the tunnels and subterranean stations have to be big enough to take main line trains. So how were Yerkes and his ilk able to build Underground railways at a profit? The answer is that labour was cheap in those days, and construction costs low. Costs were further minimised by digging lines just below surface level (as with the District and Metropolitan lines) or, in the case of the deep-level tubes, building very small-diameter tunnels (hence, today's cramped trains). Further, some companies made substantial property gains from the development of land adjacent to the surface sections of their lines. And, significantly, all were able to charge realistic fares because the absence of motor cars and buses gave them a monopoly on mechanised transport in the capital. Things are different today. There are few opportunities for development gains in a tunnel, so the private sector would have to remunerate its investment in CrossRail almost entirely by charging train operators tolls for the use of the link. The tolls, of course, would have to be recouped by charging passengers higher fares for going to destinations on the link than for stopping short of it. But if the price was much higher, passengers would simply disembark at Paddington or Liverpool Street as now and continue their journeys by Underground, bus or foot. So CrossRail could find it difficult to charge a toll high enough to cover its operating costs, still less make a dent in its financing and construction costs. It hardly looks a project fit for another Yerkes. But then, perhaps nobody ever really thought it would be. The cynical view is that, whether or not the CrossRail bill is revived after Easter, the government is looking for an excuse to dump the project altogether. Paris, meanwhile, has already completed three cross-city lines, has a fourth under construction, and is planning a fifth.</p>

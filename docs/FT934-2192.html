No it doesn't. Excellence is always to be welcomed, and anyway there is invariably some bookish connection. For today's programme they took Israeli writer David Grossman into the Occupied Territories on the day after Israel recognised the PLO to discuss the moral aspects of the Arab/Israeli conflict (8.00). Crime Story has not been the greatest series of its sort, but today's 'real life' episode is a memorable one.

Sure enough, he had sloped off to Australia and was later brought back to face trial (9.00 ITV).

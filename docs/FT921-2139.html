			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Czechs to sell Dollars 360m of T-bills THE government of the Czech republic yesterday launched only its second issue of securities since the overthrow of communism two years ago, with Kcs11bn (Dollars 360m) of Treasury bills to be sold to domestic buyers. The paper has a maturity period of two months and a yield of 9.6 per cent. One month ago, both the federal and the Czech government issued 30-day Treasury bills with a yield of 12.3 per cent and 10.6 per cent respectively. The federal issue was worth Kcs3bn and the Czech issue amounted to Kcs10bn The decline in the yield of Czech Treasury bills, despite the longer maturity periods, represents a fall in short-term interest rates which coincides with a lower inflation rate. The inflation rate in 1991 reached 58 per cent, but sharp rises were mostly recorded in the six months following the one-off price liberalisation of January 1991. On a monthly basis, inflation was near zero throughout last summer and picked up slightly in the autumn due to food price rises. Inflation in February increased by 0.5 per cent over January, which itself recorded a 1 per cent rise on December. The Czechoslovak central bank said yesterday it expected 1992 inflation to be around 12 per cent. Treasury bills are new financial instruments on the Czechoslovak market. There is no outstanding long-term government debt in local currency in the country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Russian president has written a letter to  deputies of the State Duma. It says that the free  interpretation of articles of the Constitution creates a  precedent which the chambers could use in the future to put  through federal laws and adopt other decisions in circumvention  of the Constitution. What is at issue is the procedure for the  election of the chairman of the lower house of the Russian  parliament -- the State Duma. The letter states that the  election of Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the house, formally  violated the Russian Constitution. The point is that Ivan  Rybkin required 225 deputies' votes for election, half the  number of seats in parliament, rather than 223, half of those  elected. This is what our parliamentary correspondent has just  reported. This was also reported by AFP. We asked Ivan Rybkin  for clarification on this score.    [Begin Rybkin recording] I would like to say that in the  French parliament it is sufficient for the absolute majority of  its members to be present in the chambers for there to be a  quorum. This is calculated from the number of seats actually  occupied in the house. A motion put to the vote is regarded as  adopted if it gains an absolute majority of votes cast. A  majority of the majority.    We have chosen a stricter option, according to the usual  method that was worked out in the standing orders of the  Congress of People's Deputies and other legislative bodies of  Russian power. Namely, we always calculate the quorum from the  number of actually elected deputies. I believe that this norm  is a sensible and thoroughly considered one and if there are any  variant interpretations in future, we can remove them. [end  recording]    We also asked what would happen if this matter were to be  taken to the Constitutional Court and the court decided that  Chairman Rybkin should stand down and deputies elect a new  chairman. This is what Ivan Rybkin replied.    [Begin Rybkin recording] The chairman of the State Duma  should be an example of obedience of the law and that will,  undoubtedly, be the case. But I also believe that what has been  worked out and achieved through long years of Russian practice  should be respected by all branches of power. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HART ON PEACE WITH THE SOVIETS  </P> <P> Many thanks to Gary Hart ("U.S. Policy Indecision Suggests Fear of Peace With  Soviets," Op-Ed Page, May 10) for reminding us that our main archenemy and  scapegoat is really in the midst of as major a change as any country has gone  through in this century. It is difficult not to notice how hesitant our leaders  are to acknowledge the Soviets' difficult struggle. Their decision to enter a  world economy which we have considered ours and end their dependence on the  Cold War as a national focus ought to be respected and supported. Instead, we  seem to be pooh-poohing and negating it to death.  </P> <P> Maybe it's not so easy to imagine Russia as a market competitor with us. Maybe  we can't deal with the thought of competing with a socialist-capitalist  country. Or maybe we just can't let go of our Commie-baiting history. It  remains to be seen whether we can change along with the Soviet Union and accept  the inevitability of its entrance into our world.  </P> <P> If we don't, and if we keep putting our resources into what is fast becoming an  imaginary Cold War, we may find ourselves, down the line, as a second-rate  power in the world economic community.  </P> <P> ALLAN RABINOWITZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

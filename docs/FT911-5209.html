			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brazil and Iran discover ideal partnership AT the time of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait last August Brazilian officials were, with remarkable foresight, already negotiating a deal to replace Iraq with Iran as the country's second largest oil supplier. Both sides insist the timing was mere coincidence but once the UN sanctions were announced outlawing commerce with Iraq, Brazil knew exactly where to look to substitute its major trading partner in the Middle East. Results were immediate. Last year Brazil's exports to Iran rose by 50 per cent to Dollars 425m - 40 per cent of its sales to the Gulf region  - while those to Iraq dropped 68 per cent to Dollars 110m. This year Brazil is expecting an even greater rise. Mr Marcos Azambuja, director general of the Brazilian Foreign Office, says: 'It has proved easier than we thought to replace the Iraq market. Our whole strategy now is to make Iran our major Gulf partner.' There is more at stake than simply sales of food and raw materials. Last October Mr Ozires Silva, Brazil's then infrastructure minister, led a mission of businessmen to Tehran to offer expertise for the reconstruction of Iran after eight years of war with Iraq and the building of an industrial complex near the mouth of the Hormuz Strait. The Brazilian mission was given a red carpet welcome including meetings with 12 ministers. Brazil's role as a big arms supplier to the opposite side during the Iran-Iraq war was forgotten with the signing of a second oil contract for a further 100,000 barrels per day making a total of 220,000. Officials came back with the news that Brazil could capture Dollars 12bn in contracts over the next five years both from the Iranian government and private sector. In many ways it is an ideal partnership. Brazil's perceived fencesitting during the Gulf war has ruled out any hope of it gaining contracts in Kuwait though Mr Azambuja insists 'the Brazil-Iraq connection was overblown'. Iran's still uneasy relations with the US and Europe means Brazil with its considerable experience in large development projects is the perfect solution. Already this year Brazil has welcomed eight Iranian missions including the ministers for mining, energy, heavy industry and agriculture, all dangling large contracts for the construction of steel and sugar mills, roads and railways and hydro-electric projects. It is not just talk. Although last year Brazil was in deficit in trade with Iran because of escalating oil prices, since October an estimated Dollars 800m of export contracts have been signed for the supply of sugar, steel, food and ten Tucano trainers. Agromachinery makers Caterpillar and Maxion have signed accords and two of Brazil's biggest capital goods producers, rivals Zanini and Dedini, have joined forces to build sugar mills in Iran. Construction company Andrade Guterriez is expected to soon sign a Dollars 350m contract to build a Dollars 1.4bn hydroelectric dam in consortium with Siemens and the Soviet company, Technopromoexport.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Amount saved by NAO tops running costs THE National Audit Office identified savings to the taxpayer of Pounds 200m in the 1991-92 financial year, five times its Pounds 40m running costs, according to its annual report, which is published today. The savings resulted from the NAO's audit of the accounts of government departments and public bodies, and its investigations of value-for-money in particular activities. That brings the total saved for the taxpayer over the past three years to Pounds 500m, Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, says. Greater freedom for the managers of public services requires close scrutiny if standards for conducting public-sector business are to be maintained, he adds. The largest savings identified by the NAO come from the 47 value-for-money studies carried out last year. They are estimated to have identified economies of some Pounds 165m, including: Savings of Pounds 30m a year in the running costs of married quarters provided by the Ministry of Defence for members of the armed services. Revised procedures on small-company tax relief, which saved the Inland Revenue Pounds 12m a year. Almost Pounds 1.5m from selling three of six surplus sites identified in a study of the Metropolitan Police estate management. Further savings of Pounds 35m were identified in the NAO's audits of the accounts of 478 organisations in the public sector, including all government departments, more than 70 executive agencies and a wide range of other public bodies such as the Charity Commission and the Sports Council. The accounts of 22 bodies were qualified, in eight cases because departments had spent more than the amounts authorised by parliament. Other qualifications related to uncertainty over accounting for sums of public money. Annual Report 1992. NAO, Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W 9SP. Free.</p>

On 5 December, the relevant government official stated: "The  Board of Audit and Inspection pointed out in July 1993 that `for  no valid reason, the U.S. Government has not paid rent while  occupying the embassy building for 13 years.' Thus, the  Ministry of Culture and Sports, which manages the Embassy  building, sent a notice to the U.S. Embassy requesting payment  of rent."    The official stated that "such steps by the government is of  significance in clearly informing the U.S. side of our position.  Since the issue of unpaid rent will be discussed in future  between the ROK and the United States, details regarding this  were left out of the notice." He added that "based on the  principle of resolving the rent issue for the U.S. Embassy  building in accordance with diplomatic norms and practices, the  government asked the U.S. side for a prompt settlement, and the  U.S. side said that it would make efforts for a solution when  the new ambassador came into office."    According to the relevant government authorities, annual  rent  for the U.S. Embassy building is estimated at five hundred  million won and unpaid rent for the past 13 years amounts is  estimated to amount to 6.5 billion won.    The U.S. Embassy building was built in 1961 as one of twin  buildings (the other building was formerly used by the Supreme  Council and now houses the Ministry of Information and Ministry  of Culture and Sports) with the ROK providing the land and $1.15  million of the total $3.21 million in construction costs and  with the U.S. side providing the remaining $2.02 million. The  building stands on 6,625 square meters of land, has one  underground floor and eight floors above the ground.</p>

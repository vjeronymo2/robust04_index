			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (7): New era of opportunities - The insurance sector is expecting growth Last year was an excellent one throughout Luxembourg's insurance and reinsurance sector, the Grand Duchy's Insurance Commission was able to report in October in its annual survey of the market. The completion of the single market in insurance - with the implementation of the European Union's third generation life and non-life directives, which took effect on July 1 - now offers Luxembourg the opportunity to become a centre for the cross-border life insurance industry, the authorities believe and hope. 'The life business has developed tremendously well over the past couple of years,' says Mr Victor Rod, the Insurance Commissioner, who is admired by players in the cross-border market for his vision in creating a hospitable legislative, regulatory and fiscal environment for the sector. A decade ago he took similar steps to create a captive reinsurance industry in Luxembourg. Many industry players believe Mr Rod is onto another winner. At the last count, about 20 'dedicated' cross-border life insurers were selling products on a pan-European basis, along with seven domestic insurers also active on a cross-border basis. By contrast, the Dublin International Financial Services Centre, widely perceived to be Luxembourg's main rival for pan-European business, had four companies, although both centres have more applications in the pipeline. Even under the EU's Second Life (Services) Directive, a half-way house on the way to the single market which allowed companies to sell products cross-border to customers who asked for them, freedom of services (ie non-domestic) business made up 71 per cent of all life premiums received by the industry in 1993. The new era will also mean changes in the local Luxembourg market, which is dominated by two large domestic insurers and the subsidiaries or branches of Belgian, French, German and Swiss companies. Instead of the Commission setting prices and conditions for the industry, companies will be free to decide their own - perhaps to the benefit of the long-suffering Luxembourg consumer. In fact, Luxembourg is one of the EU countries which have not yet passed the so-called third generation insurance directives into national legislation, in large part because of disruption caused by a general election in June and the subsequent formation of a government, followed by the country's traditional summer hiatus. The legislation is scheduled to go through parliament in November. According to Mr Rod, Luxembourg offers an 'unbeatable combination' of advantages as a life insurance centre - the existence of the banks and investment funds, fund management skills, a central location, the linguistic abilities of Luxembourgers and other residents, strict confidentiality rules which match those applying to banks, and the lack of any premium or capital tax. All those advantages are available elsewhere, he says, but not in one single place. All areas of the Luxembourg market - life and non-life, domestic and international, direct insurance and reinsurance - enjoyed growth in 1993, according to the Commission. At year-end the sector comprised 73 companies, but four new life companies have opened since then. Non-life premiums rose 18.12 per cent to LFr24.4bn, while life business grew 40.4 per cent, to LFr20.4bn, of which LFr14.6bn consisted of cross-border business. This growth compares with an increase of 146.3 per cent in life premium income in 1992, the first year in which pan-European business represented a substantial proportion of the total. Two companies dominated cross-border business last year and will continue to do so in 1994. PanEuroLife, established by France's UAP group and the Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, had premium income of some LFr6.3bn in 1993 and expects to exceed LFr10bn this year. Lombard International Assurance, whose shareholders include Standard Life, Europe's largest mutual life assurance company, and Aberdeen Trust from Britain and Switzerland's InterAllianz Bank, notched up Pounds 81m (LFr4.25bn) last year, and Mr Andrew McKinna, marketing director, says the company is on course to meet its 1994 target of Pounds 150m. Lombard's target is the so-called 'grey panther' - the growing market of medium-rich Europeans which is also the focus of Luxembourg's private banking sector. 'Life insurance enjoys an advantage over banks and investment funds,' says Mr McKinna, 'because it offers open tax benefits in our target markets' - Germany, Britain, the Benelux countries, Sweden and increasingly France. Mr McKinna says Lombard would be happy to see more competition because it would demonstrate the maturity of the sector - and would help to attract new customers to all market players. It looks as though he won't have too long to wait. A new wave of companies is now making plans to enter the market, with British institutions to the fore. Scottish Equitable and CMI have publicly declared their intention to come to Luxembourg; Norwich Union and Scottish Provident International have made no secret of their interest. There's more to come, according to Mr James Ball, whose consultancy firm, JBI Associates, specialises in the insurance sector. 'Since July 1 there has been great interest from the United Kingdom which was not there before,' he says. 'There's hardly a company there which is not in the marketplace. But German companies are showing interest too.' So are local ones. Le Foyer, Luxembourg's largest domestic insurers, has already ventured into the cross-border market by selling products to Danish expatriates. A change in the law curtailed that business, but Francois Tesch, managing director, says the company is seeking foreign partners and is devoting a third of its resources to foreign projects. Somewhat overshadowed these days by the more glamorous life business, Luxembourg continues to expand its role as a centre for captive reinsurance business, first welcomed in 1984 at the urging of Swedish companies which were forbidden by their national authorities to establish captives in offshore jurisdictions such as Bermuda. The reinsurance sector numbered 201 at the end of August thanks to a sudden burst of expansion, with 19 new licences being delivered since the beginning of this year. According to the Commission, some 20 more applications are likely to be approved in the coming months. The reinsurance sector, which until recently was dominated by Scandinavian, French and Belgian companies, collected premiums totalling LFr65.2bn in 1993 and at year-end had accumulated technical provisions totalling LFr153bn (up 42 per cent in two years) under rules which allow reserves of up to 20 times premium income to be sheltered from corporate taxation. Mr Rod believes that prospects for growth in the reinsurance sector are limited now because most of the multinational groups which meet Luxembourg's stringent criteria for the establishment of captives are already represented here. But a wave of interest from German groups, with five new companies set to be established this year, may persuade him to revise his view.</p>

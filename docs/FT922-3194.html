			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further losses as trading increases THE HEAVIEST day's trading in London equities since just after the re-election of the Conservative government early in April saw the FT-SE Index shed a further 22 points yesterday, bringing the 2,600 mark into closer perspective. Disappointing reports on the domestic economy finally took second place to worries over Wall Street following the latest data on US retail sales and producer prices. Concern over the outlook for UK equities was also fuelled by reports of increased political tensions at Westminster regarding the Maastricht treaty. Nervousness in the market was heightened as a series of very large share deals moved across the trading screens. At least two substantial trading programmes were reported, the first worth nearly Pounds 100m in two-way activity, and the second about Pounds 30m, also matched between buy and sell orders. There was very heavy business in Midland Bank shares as many arbitrageurs decided to bite the bullet and take losses on the large holdings built up when it still seemed possible that a counter-bid by Lloyds Bank might force higher bid terms from Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking. There were reports of substantial losses by some securities houses. Traders also had to grapple with increased activity in British Steel, British Airways and Glaxo. focused itself around the prospects for the next expiry of the stock index future contract in the middle of this month. Futures expiries have traditionally created presures on share prices as the big securities houses struggle to balance their positions in futures contracts and the underlying blue chip shares. Traders believe that large bull positions built up in futures in the weeks following the general election could make the expiry settlement difficult. Although the market made little further move in the second half of the session, there was hardly any recovery in the FT-SE Index which closed 22 points down at 2,614.1. The mood was gloomy, and several strategists forecast that the Footsie 2,600 mark could come under pressure if Wall Street, showing a fall of 15 Dow points in London trading hours, continued to give way. Store and retail stocks gave ground after the latest survey of distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) had indicated a slowdown in retail sales in May, reversing the post-election uptick. Most of the fund management core stocks came under pressure, with ICI, Glaxo, Reuters and Wellcome all recording sharp falls. The building and construction sector suffered a further setback as equity analysts digested the latest developments at Regalian, one of Britain's best-known property groups, where the accounts were qualified by the auditors in view of the 'very considerable uncertainty' affecting property markets. By the end of the day, the stock market was sounding somewhat demoralised, and was beset by renewed hints that a large rights issue might be pending.</p>

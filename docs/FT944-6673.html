			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Fears grow that EU's weapon may misfire - Some countries see trade proposal turning into unguided missile US Section 301 trade legislation, which calls on other countries to open their markets or face the threat of retaliation, has long inspired fear and loathing in critics around the world. Few have spoken out more loudly than Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's trade commissioner, who has accused Washington of using 'bilateral bully' tactics to extract trade concessions by force. But now Sir Leon has stirred up controversy by proposing an EU trade measure which, according to its opponents and supporters, could serve many of the same purposes as Section 301 actions. At issue is the Commission's plan for a so-called illicit practices regulation. Submitted to the Council of Ministers recently as part of the Uruguay Round implementing legislation, it aims to streamline existing EU procedures for tackling other countries' trade barriers. Sir Leon insists the regulation differs from Section 301 because it would be used only to hold other countries to agreed international rules, not to pass unilateral judgments on their trade policies. His reassurances have not, however, convinced everyone. 'The more Brussels tries to explain why the regulation is not like Section 301, the more similar it sounds,' says a senior official of one of Asia's most successful exporting economies. The proposal has divided EU members. France and most Mediterranean governments support it, saying the EU needs to beef up its negotiating muscle to compensate for cuts in its trade barriers required by the Uruguay Round. 'When your market defences are coming down, it makes sense to switch to the attack,' says an official of the Patronat, the French employers' organisation. 'The regulation is a can opener. It is not Section 301, but is in the same spirit.' Such thinking troubles more liberal EU governments. Britain, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands fear that the proposal could unleash an unguided missile which might threaten the authority of the new World Trade Organisation. The proposal is backed by Unice, the European industry federation. However, the BDI, the German employers' body, says it supported the Unice line only out of European solidarity, and has deep reservations about the planned regulation. 'We think this is a potentially dangerous measure which could go off in the wrong direction,' says a BDI official. Formally, the proposal is a revision of the EU's 'new commercial instrument', which permits action against trade practices not already banned by Community rules. Though in existence since 1984, it has has been little used. The new regulation would make it more accessible by entitling individual companies - not just EU governments and industry bodies, as at present - to institute complaints against other countries' trade barriers. The complaints would be dealt with by a new committee of member states and the Commission, and be chaired by the latter. Commission officials say this 'third track' would give European exporters the right to the same prompt investigations as EU anti-dumping procedures offer importers which face low-priced foreign competition. Brussels stresses that the proposal addresses trade practices 'incompatible with international law' and would be used primarily to identify cases for adjudication by WTO disputes panels. However, they do not exclude using it against countries outside the WTO, and in areas where WTO rules are lacking or incomplete. 'A lot of promises were made in the Uruguay Round trade talks which have not been delivered on,' says an adviser to Sir Leon. EU government critics, however, are worried by several aspects of the proposed regulation, which they say is not essential to implementation of the Uruguay Round. Their main concerns are: That its wording is too vague and could lead to indiscriminate attacks on any trade practices used by other WTO members, rather than only those which are actionable under WTO rules. For instance, French industry thinks the regulation should be used against countries which permit anti-competitive practices, such as cartels, in their home markets. These currently lie outside the WTO's jurisdiction. That the procedures envisaged could give the Commission too much scope for action, without consulting closely enough with the Article 113 committee, the body in which the Commission and EU governments co-ordinate external trade policy. That there are uncertainties about how the regulation would fit with a recent European Court ruling which says the Commission and the Council have 'mixed competence' over trade in services. That it is unclear what form of actions, other than reference to a WTO disputes panel, the EU might take against allegedly illicit practices, and whether such actions might include unilateral retaliation. Commission officials insist that, unlike Section 301, the proposal does not provide for unilateral sanctions and say they would not resort to them. However, French officials say the regulation's exact application in this and other areas is still under debate. Some observers suspect the Commission may have deliberately left details of the proposal unclear. They say that, for all Sir Leon Brittan's criticisms of aggressive US trade tactics, his alternative approach of 'quiet diplomacy' towards Japan has produced little. As a consequence, he faces growing pressure from European industry to adopt stronger market-opening measures. In its present form, the proposal looks sufficiently tough to satisfy these demands, without committing the Commission to taking specific actions. Even the regulation's liberal-minded opponents think Sir Leon would not abuse it. But that is not their main concern. Says one: 'The problem is that he will not have the job forever, and a more protectionist successor might have fewer scruples.'</p>

Both parties to the wage negotiations gave up their previous  taboo positions in Darmstadt. Giving up the vacation bonus or  reducing wage costs by 15 percent hardly played a role, just as  IG-Metall showed only little interest in wage raises.  Gesamtmetall was willing to agree to a drastic shortening of  work time on the condition that the working people renounce wage  compensation; IG-Metall wanted to agree to that only if entire  work forces were to work less than 35 hours per week, but not in  case of a differentiation of work time between groups of working  people within a company.    Agreement could have been reached about advancing the  introduction of the 35-hour workweek, which has been agreed on  by collective agreement as of 1 October 1995, since IG-Metall  was willing to compensate the employers for the resulting costs.  The collective agreement on opening clauses, which permit the  companies to deviate from the collective agreement regarding  work time regulations, was no problem anymore. IG-Metall was  willing to offer an annual work time on the basis of a 35-hour  workweek, which would have given the employers options with a  range of 30 to 40 hours per week, if the regular work time had  been adhered to on the annual average.    Despite these concurrences of the mutual negotiating  positions, the top-level talks in Darmstadt failed because  IG-Metall did not want to give up graduated wage compensation in  a case of shortened work time for partial work forces. The  IG-Metall Executive Committee now wants to explain the failure  of the negotiations on 21 February and to hold a strike ballot  on the possibility of a strike. There will probably be no  further top-level talks before this date.    After the beginning of the strike, the instrument of  "Special Arbitration" would then be applied, within the  framework of which Gesamtmetall and IG-Metall would try to  settle the wage conflict under the chairmanship of an arbiter,  who would be decided on either by drawing lots or by agreement.  It is assumed that such a development is necessary also so that  the two parties to the wage negotiations can avoid internal  pressure from their members, to which they are still subject to  at the moment.</p>

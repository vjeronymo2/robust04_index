			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Divisions over dollar rise THE dollar yesterday continued the slow rise against the D-Mark that has accompanied Mr Clinton's election as US president, but doubts remain about whether the currency's ascent is about to move into an even faster gear, writes James Blitz. This week, the currency has, in the words of one analyst, 'puttered upwards'. After closing at DM1.5420 last Friday night, it broke a key chart point of DM1.56 on election day, and closed in London at DM1.5940, up 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day. In the short term, the dollar's progress may be in the hands of Mr Clinton himself. If, for example, Mr Clinton were to choose Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, as Treasury secretary, the dollar could rise sharply because of his policy of raising US interest rates in the 1980s. However, in the longer term, the dollar will respond to perceptions about the upturn in the US economy, and here opinion is divided. Mr Brian Fabbri, chief economist for Midland Bank New York, gave a strikingly upbeat forecast for the US economy at a conference in London yesterday. 'The economy is likely to grow more rapidly in 1993, and growth should accelerate to 2.5 per cent from 1.7 per cent this year,' he said. 'The dollar should appreciate quite rapidly.' However, Mr Neil Mackinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, is more subdued. 'Mr Clinton's election victory is unlikely to result in any dramatic improvement in the economy for at least the next 6-12 months,' he says. He argues, for instance that the president-elect's stated aim of introducing investment tax credits may sap investment in the short-term as companies wait for the president's plans to be implemented. However, Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, is a strong dissenter in a camp of his own. 'I can't get bullish longer-term about the dollar,' he said yesterday. 'The next 10 pfennigs will be downwards, and I don't rule out the possibility of new lows against the D-Mark.' He believes there is still much weakness in the US economy, pointing to yesterday's sluggish rise in the non-farm payroll figure, up 27,000 in October, as evidence. Mr O'Neill also believes that the market is ignoring the D-Mark's residual strength. Shorter-term D-Mark interest rates remain nearly 6 per cent above those for the dollar, and, he argues, the Bundesbank will not ease policy quickly. 'People who think the D-Mark may have problems have to think again,' he says.</p>

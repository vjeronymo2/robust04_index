			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in a gathering of the  central council of the Islamic Coalition Society  [ICS--Jam'iyyat-e Mo'talefe-ye Eslami], described action based  on the axis of velayat-e faqih [guardianship of the  jurisconsult] and following the guidelines of the exalted  leadership [Khamene'i] at this juncture in society to be a duty  for officials, the people, and various formations of the  community.    Praising the lofty character of the martyrs of ICS, the  president said: What guarantees the correctness and soundness  of the activities of a formation is its adherence to the  principle of velayat-e faqih and giving preference to the  interests of the Islamic system as opposed to personal and  factional interests. The ICS has maintained its adherence to  that important principle since its inception.    Referring to the fact that Iran is known as a wealthy state  in the world, Hashemi-Rafsanjani laid emphasis on the need for  endeavor, planning, and sincere cooperation among each and every  one of the people and said: Thus, we will prove to the world  that a nation is able to make up for past underdevelopment and  to correct past wrongful policies through reliance on its  financial and human resources while preserving its holy,  Islamic, noble, and national values and aspirations. The  realization of that import by the end of the second development  plan is not hard to expect.</p>

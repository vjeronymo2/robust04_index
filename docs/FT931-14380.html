			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Arts: A weekend with Janacek - Concerts In 1926 Janacek came to London for the most important overseas visit he undertook to promote his music. Unfortunately, his timing was not propitious: a couple of days before the main concert the country was plunged into a general strike, leaving no programmes, no transport and no newspapers to advertise the event or carry reports of it. He returned to Czechoslovakia disappointed and dejected. The irony of this failed attempt to find a wider international audience is that since the 1950s it has been in this country, as much as any, that Janacek's music has come to prominence and popularity. The idea of a weekend devoted to a survey of his music, supported by films and talks, is one that no serious music-lover today would begin to question. Over the past few years these BBC single-composer weekends at the Barbican have become a regular feature of London's musical life. But what started out as an ambitious project to put before the public in-depth profiles of difficult 20th-century composers is now edging on to safer ground. Last year's choice was Berg, for the first time not a living composer; and now we have in Janacek one who has a large corpus of his works - the operas - already accepted by the public at large. As a result, the emphasis has changed. The importance of this weekend shifted to the smaller pieces, although the larger orchestral scores - Taras Bulba and the Sinfonietta - were included to provide a rousing climax to each evening, as they most certainly did in these muscular and dynamic performances by a BBC Symphony Orchestra in very fine fettle under Andrew Davis. So central is the place occupied by the operas in Janacek's output that at least one had to be included. This was From the House of the Dead, arguably the most suited to concert performance. Again Davis goaded the music forwards with an awesome grip on its vital energy, giving the lie to the theory that the opera does not have much narrative drive, but it was not in the end an especially moving performance. A well-chosen cast, headed by Jan Blinkhof as a Filka Morozov of raw power, Kim Begley a clarion Skuratov and Russell Smythe an impassioned Shishkov, seemed locked in the opera's claustrophobic ambience of prison violence. There was less of the tenderness that gives the opera its humanity. The 'spark of God' which Janacek saw in each of these characters encapsulates one of the personal beliefs that is expressed throughout his music. With their out-of-the-ordinary plots, focusing upon the human condition, the operas are able to develop those feelings in a way denied his other music. Of the rare works performed during this weekend, the 'Danube' Symphony, receiving its first UK performance, roamed across folk territory and down modernist paths with no very convincing sense of direction. The Violin Concerto, recently 'realised' from the composer's sketches, remains a wildly inventive, but unsatisfying torso. From other areas of his output there was a selection of the piano music, all fascinatingly individual, played by Radoslav Kvapil. The BBC Singers under Simon Joly ventured into the (mostly) unaccompanied choral music, including a drawn-out, but surprisingly sensual setting of the Lord's Prayer. There is a lot of folk arrangements that might have been added, but at nearly an hour in length this sample was enough. Altogether, the most entertaining single programme of the weekend was the Sunday afternoon chamber music recital. From a searing account of the First String Quartet by the Lindsay Quartet, it continued via a brilliantly sparkling Mlad from London Winds to the Concertino, which picks up on the animal life so beloved by Janacek. This was, in fact, the very programme as he intended it for the Wigmore Hall on his visit in 1926 - now generously applauded, a happy case of musical dues at last being paid.</p>

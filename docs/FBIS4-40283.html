			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" Interview with Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan </F> Karadzic by Sergey Moshechkov: "Are the Politicians in Bosnia  Really Going to Become Psychotherapists Again? In Conversation  with Your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Correspondent, Bosnian Serb  Leader Radovan Karadzic Was Extremely Frank"]    [Text] Until the beginning of the nineties, Radovan  Karadzic was not well known in Yugoslavia. He was known in  medical circles as a promising psychiatrist. Lovers of Serbian  poetry used to read his sometimes very interesting doggerel.  Karadzic's name could also be heard in sporting circles: He  worked as a psychotherapist for the well-known Yugoslav soccer  clubs Red Star and Sarajevo.    Now everyone in the Balkans knows him. And not only in the  Balkans.    To some he is virtually an international criminal. To  others, a fighter for his people's liberation. But no matter  how diametrically opposed the assessments of the Bosnian Serb  leader's actions may be, you cannot deny the obvious.    During the three years of the Yugoslav crisis Dr Karadzic  has  matured as a politician, possessing qualities essential for that  job: diplomacy and toughness, tolerance and flexibility. He  knows when to "beat the drum," when to "back off," and how to  smile even when saying a categorical "no, never."    The Russian authorities tried for a long time not to notice  the leader of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic in Bosnia and  were happy to allow the Russian opposition the right to make  contact with him first. Today the leaders of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, the chairmen of the State Duma and the  Federation Council, and the top church hierarchy are in contact  with R. Karadzic. During his present visit to Moscow he hopes  to gain admission to the Kremlin.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA managed to talk with R. Karadzic after  his talks with A. Kozyrev, who told him unambiguously that  Moscow has no intention of showing the Bosnian Serbs any favor.  However, Karadzic did not take offense at that. And he  answered our questions patiently.    He began by talking about himself.    [Karadzic] I am 49. Before the war I had a good  professional practice and I considered myself quite a wealthy  man. My wife is also a psychotherapist. We spent a long time  learning our craft -- in the United States and Britain. Our  children decided to follow in their parents' footsteps. My  daughter is completing her medical training and my son is just  starting out now. Admittedly they are not very fond of  studying. My daughter is working at a press center, my son is  serving in the police reserve. We all live in our "Serb  Sarajevo" -- Pale, the capital of the Serb Republic in Bosnia.    Before the war I was a very fortunate man. I had a happy  family, good friends, a job that I liked, and poetry for my  soul. I was keen on soccer, especially when I was working with  our soccer clubs.    I took virtually no part in politics. I belonged to the  Communist Party in my early youth -- we were enrolled in it  without being asked. As I grew older I considered myself a  dissident, although I did not take part in any actions.    However, my friends and I could not remain indifferent when  Yugoslavia disintegrated. In Bosnia the old ideology of World  War II began to be revived, but with the introduction of a new  and very dangerous element -- Islamic fundamentalism. In the  forties that ideology led to the deaths of 1.5 million Serbs.  We really did not want a repetition of that genocide, which is  why we entered the political struggle in the first place. We  created a Serb democratic party. My friends made me join. Then  there were elections, we entered parliament, and there was no  longer any way back to peaceful scientific work for me.    Nevertheless, after the war I hope to return to my  profession. I dream of opening a large, modern psychiatric  clinic in my homeland together with my friends. Especially  since staff for that clinic are already being trained in my own  family.    [Moshechkov] Do you see any preconditions right now for the  establishment of peace in the former Yugoslavia?    [Karadzic] The only pleasing thing is that the armistice  that was signed in Geneva is being observed on the whole at the  moment, if you disregard local clashes. Generally speaking, the  situation is quite bad. The Americans are supporting the  Muslims and are trying to lift the embargo on arms supplies to  them. But no one has any intention of lifting the economic  sanctions on the Serbs even though, I can assure you, that would  be the shortest route to peace. Lifting the sanctions against  us would mean the complete defeat of the Muslim side's plans for  our "economic demise" and would also show that the world  community takes an unprejudiced attitude to us.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does that mean that the economic  situation in the Serb Republic in Bosnia is desperate?    [Karadzic] We are not desperate at all. Our enterprises are  producing three times as much output as is needed for domestic  consumption. There is enough fuel and food. There is even a  surplus, which needs to be sold.    The Yugoslav dinar is our basic unit of currency. Just as in  Serbia, it is equal to the German mark [as published]. But it  is very difficult to maintain such a situation under sanctions.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] How do you see Bosnia's future? How  many states will there be here? What will the Serb Republic's  status be?    [Karadzic] It is hard to say how many states there will be.  But it is accurate to say that it will not be one state. We  Serbs dream of being with Yugoslavia as an independent federal  unit or part of Serbia. If that does not happen, we will live  autonomously. Reunification is inevitable in the future anyway.    Just as unification with the Muslims is impossible.  Incidentally, the world community has begun to understand that  Believe me, we are not opposed to Islam or Catholicism. But we  will not allow those religions to suppress the Orthodox faith.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] The question of the division of the  territory has been the main issue at the talks on a Bosnian  settlement for a long time. The Serbs presently control 73  percent of that territory, before the war they owned 64 percent,  and you are being offered 49 percent. Will you accept that?    [Karadzic] That will depend on the quality of the lands that  we are offered. Perhaps we will agree to less if we get  Sarajevo and Tuzla, for example (is that a joke? -- S.M. note).    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What can you tell us about Moscow's  position in the Yugoslav crisis?    [Karadzic] Russia is in a difficult situation now. It faces  many acute problems. We understand that. And we are very  grateful to the Russian people for showing us their  understanding and sympathy. We regard Russia's diplomatic  activity in the international arena as impartial and  independent, notably with regard to the Bosnian crisis.  However, the same cannot be said about other members of the  world community. Of course we want Russia to be on our side,  but we have no right to expect that.    The main thing, though, is that in Moscow we sense a revival  of interest in the Balkans. This means that Russia is thinking  about the future of its borders and the prospects for relations  with its closest historical neighbors.</p>

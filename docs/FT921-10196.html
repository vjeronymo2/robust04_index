			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Oils to telecoms switch Shares in BT and BP, the UK's second and third biggest companies as measured by market capitalisation, moved in opposite directions as dealers reported a switch out of the UK oil group and into the telecoms giant. The Seaq ticker confirmed extraordinarily heavy turnover in the two companies and provided evidence of two exceptionally large individual trades in the stocks. The first was a line of 6.7m BP at 270 1/2 p, and the second a block of 9m BT at 337p. Speculation in the market suggested that County NatWest had executed the deals on behalf of a big institutional client; County would not comment on the switch story. The big switch, it was said, was part of a general re-shaping of the investment portfolio of one of the UK's most powerful institutions. By the close of trading BT 'old' shares were 3 1/2 ahead at 334 1/2 p, after 337p, on heavy turnover of 8m shares, while the 'new' edged up 1 1/2 to 124p, after 125 1/2 p, with 14m traded. Also driving BT stock higher was the recent Warburg Securities 'buy' recommendation and hints that one of the analysts most bearish of BT in recent months, had lifted his 'sell' stance on the stock. BP shares, weakened over recent weeks by worries about the dividend cover, weak oil prices and hints of a boardroom rift, slipped to 273p, before stabilising and closing a net 2 1/2 off at 276p; turnover in BP totalled 18m shares. C &amp; W weaker Telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W) delivered one of the poorest individual performances among the Footsie stocks after Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment bank, chopped its profits forecast for the company. C &amp; W shares closed 13 lower at 580p, with 4.8m traded. C &amp; W was also included by BZW in a list of leading UK companies which may be affected by proposals put forward by the Accounting Standards Board, although BZW was at pains to point out that this had nothing to do with its profits downgrades. BZW reduced its forecast of profits for the year ended March 1992 from Pounds 720m to Pounds 695m and its estimate for the year ended March 1993 from Pounds 790m to Pounds 765m. The broker cited disappointing trading at C &amp; W's Mercury division which it said was suffering from the impact of price reductions last year and slowing volume gains. However, the investment bank emphasised it was retaining its 'hold' stance on the stock. Vickers sold Vickers tumbled after Smith New Court reduced its dividend forecast. The mid-morning reduction caused a 'backwardation' - a situation in which the bid and offer price are temporarily reversed, leaving the shares 16 off at 160p. The broker said it expects the full-year dividend to total 5p, down from its previous estimate of 6p and against the previous year's total of 9.9p. Mr Chris Avery, at Smiths believes the company is running out of time for the partial disposal of its Rolls-Royce Motors subsidiary before the company's full-year figures are reported on February 24, a move he believes would have assisted the dividend pay-out. But sources close to the company later indicated to the market that the dividend was likely to be nearer 5.9p. This helped Vickers rally off the bottom to end 10 down at 166p on a hefty turnover of 3.8m. Stores were generally firm, but Great Universal 'A' (GUS) gave up most gains, closing 2 up at 1430p. At one time the shares were 50 higher at 1478p, amid suggestions that Cazenove, the company broker, was trying to buy shares in an already illiquid market, and had recommended the stock after a visit to one of the company's divisions on Wednesday. The rise also reflected optimism ahead of a presentation given for GUS by Warburg Securities, but this disappointed and was described as something of a non-event. Sears were particularly active, rising 2 to 102p. Smith New Court recently recommended the shares as a good recovery stock, but regarded yesterday's movement as simply a reflection of the sectors general strength. Marks &amp; Spencer put on 5 to 304p, following a Kleinwort Benson recommendation. Discount supermarket group Kwik Save fell 32 to 594p after James Capel cut its profit forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 110m for the year to August 31 and by Pounds 12m to Pounds 122m for the following year. Kwik Save made a trading profit of Pounds 101.7m last year. Increased price competition from new operators in the discount food sector was behind the profit downgrade. Vodafone sped up 9 to 353p on good turnover of 2.7m, mirroring strong gains in cellular stocks on Wall Street. Smith Barney, the Wall Street brokerage, was said to have shifted from a hold to a buy on Vodafone. Standard Chartered raced up 9 to 420p in response to vague takeover stories while talk of a UBS Phillips &amp; Drew recommendation was said to have lifted Midland 3 1/2 to 230p. Lloyds Abbey Life was a notable weak spot in life assurances, the shares losing 14 to 380p after a bearish recommendation from Nomura, the Japanese-owned brokerage. Commercial Union retreated 8 to 455p after reports that BZW had cut its 1992 dividend forecast and increased its estimate of 1992 losses. Dollar weakness put pressure on internationally traded pharmaceuticals stocks and a negative press report yesterday gave the excuse to take profits. The newspaper article quoted a consumers' association study which was critical of over-the-counter cold and influenza medicines. SmithKline Beecham, which makes Beecham's Powders, fell 7 to 961p, Reckitt &amp; Colman which manufactures Lemsip dropped 4 to 674p and Wellcome, which produces a number of cough and cold remedies, slipped 12 to 1114p. Glaxo responded to US selling and lost 18 to 829p and Fisons shed 6p to 379p. Medeva gained 9 to 292p on the back of a presentation at US brokerage house Merrill Lynch, by the chairman, Mr Bernard Taylor, to investors in New York. Trading in Reuters Holdings was volatile following a significant share placing which prompted a sharp slide on Wednesday. The company was, early yesterday, rumoured to be suggesting that analysts' estimates of profits to be announced next week were too high and the fall continued until the shares were 20 off. Then, they proved oversold and bounced back to close only a penny off at 1097p with 1.1m traded. BTR was active in early dealing on concern that its Australian unit, BTR Nylex, may write down the value of assets. The shares closed only a penny off at 408p, after 403, with 3.6m traded. BOC rose 10 to 648p against the trend as Kleinwort Benson published an internal note restating its buy stance on the stock. The securities house believes the company is on 'an undemanding rating'. Babcock was active, the day's turnover reaching 12m and the shares remained unchanged at 56 1/2 p. Tomkins fell 4 to 435p. The word in the market is that the company is taking another look at Racal Electronics subsidiary, Chubb. Profit taking hit Inchcape, leaving the shares 9 down at 423p. British Airways fell 4 to 230p, with Goldman Sachs reported to have been offering stock at 231p. Smith New Court advised investors to take profits and the shares were also said to have suffered from worries about the company's accountancy methods included in a report from BZW. Senior Engineering retreated 2 1/2 to 69 1/2 p after announcing a Pounds 26.6m rights issue. Shares in Euro Disney firmed on reports in the French press that bookings were well ahead of expectations. After rising to 1530p, the shares eased to close 5 ahead at 1525p. USM-quoted ice cream manufacturer Clarke Foods jumped 15 to 88p in the old shares and 15 in the nil-paid to 27p after positive comment in a specialist tip-sheet.

During a joint press conference with visiting Georgian  President Eduard Shevardnadze, Clinton said Washington was  inclined to consider sending U.N. peacekeepers to Georgia.    He praised the contributions to the "peaceful end to the  Cold  War" made by Shevardnadze, who had been foreign minister of the  now- defunct Soviet Union.    "I reaffirmed in very strong terms America's support for the  independence, the sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of  georgia," Clinton said.    He said the United States would be inclined to support a  U.N.  peacekeeping operation in Georgia's Abkhazia region if the  government and the rebels there can achieve success in their  talks and maintain an effective cease-fire.    A possible U.N. peacekeeping presence in Georgia would need  U.S. funding but not U.S. military units.    Shevardnadze, arrived here Sunday night [6 March], will be  meeting with congressional leaders tomorrow.</p>

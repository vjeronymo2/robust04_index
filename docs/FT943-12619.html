			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Survivor waits to be made welcome: Maurice Samuelson talks to an anti-Nazi conspirator who has been fighting for justice for 40 years Instead of attending Berlin's 50th anniversary of the bid to kill Adolf Hitler, one of the leading survivors of the conspiracy remained this week in self-imposed exile from his beloved Germany. Dr Otto John, 85, told me he spent the day looking out at the spectacular mountains of the Austrian Tyrol, his home for the past 27 years. As a result of a stroke he can no longer walk and can write only with great difficulty, leaving him dependent on his secretary, the housekeeper who comes every day, and on his gardener. But this is not why he stayed away from the Berlin ceremony. It was because, instead of being one of the acclaimed heroes of Germany, John has for the past 40 years been an unperson, a political embarrassment to the Federal Republic and, in the eyes of many, victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice. Five years after the war he was appointed the first president of the Federal Republic's Office for the Protection of the Constitution, a sensitive intelligence unit intended to counter a resurgence of Nazism and Communist subversion. On July 20 1954, the 10th anniversary of the anti-Hitler plot, John attended the commemoration of the plot in Berlin. Later that day he disappeared and turned up in the Soviet sector of the city, where he criticised trends in West Germany, including the lingering influence of the Nazis. He has claimed ever since that he was drugged and kidnapped as part of a Soviet operation to destabilise the west and that his remarks were made under duress. He also insisted that he had betrayed no state secrets. That was his plea when, 18 months later, he escaped back to the west. He was tried for treason and sentenced to four years hard labour , double the term demanded by the prosecuting counsel at the high court in Karlsruhe. For 40 years, John has maintained his innocence and claimed his treatment by the court was influenced by a desire to punish him for his role in the anti-Hitler underground and by the fact that while others were executed after the failure of the plot, he had survived to continue the fight against Hitler. General Reinhard Gehlen, former Nazi and head of the Federal Republic's counter-intelligence network set up after the war by the Americans, said of John's apparent defection to east Berlin: 'Once a traitor, always a traitor.' After his release from prison, his reputation in tatters, John set out to clear his name. As far as public opinion is concerned, he largely succeeded. Leading politicians, such as the late Defence Minister Franz-Josef Strauss, and Dr Gerhard Schroeder, a former interior and foreign minister, accepted that John was a victim, rather than a collaborator of the Soviets, and that he had not betrayed his country. But three times, John failed to overturn the judgment of the Karlsruhe court. He vowed that until he succeeded he would never again attend a commemorative meeting for the heroes of the July 20 conspiracy. In Moscow last year, however, John met two of the former KGB officers who had interrogated him in Berlin and Moscow immediately after his disappearance. They have since made sworn affidavits at the German embassy in Moscow indicating he was not a defector but that he had been abducted by agents of the KGB as part of the cold war. Two weeks ago, a lawyer acting on John's behalf incorporated their statements in a new application to have the case reopened. If the court agrees, there is a chance that John's reputation will at last be vindicated and he will no longer feel an outsider in his own country. 'I hope that the new generation of German judges will be different from the ones who first sentenced me,' he said on the telephone this week. Meanwhile, there is no controversy about his role in the events of July 20 1944 and in the struggle leading to Hitler's final overthrow. A few hours after the bomb went off in Hitler's field headquarters at Rastenburg on the morning of July 20, John was personally briefed by the man who had laid it near Hitler's feet - Count Colonel Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg. John had been in touch with leading anti-Nazis since 1937. His friends included Klaus and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, two of the leading martyrs of the German resistance. From 1942, John had used his position as legal adviser to Lufthansa, the German airline, to act as the German resistance's liaison with British intelligence. (The MI6 officer who evaluated it in London was Graham Greene, according to the new biography published this week, Graham Greene, The Man Within, by Michael Shelden, Heinemann.) Immediately after the events of July 20 1944, John escaped first to Spain and then, via Lisbon, to Britain, where he aided the BBC's anti-Nazi propaganda, interrogated high-ranking German prisoners of war and, later, assisted the prosecutors at Nuremberg. However, in an ominous foretaste of John's later maltreatment by the Soviets, his entry to Britain was resisted by Soviet master-spy Kim Philby, who was Graham Greene's boss in MI6's Iberian Department. Stalin suspected that any contacts between Britain and the anti-Hitler resistance could have led to a separate peace between Germany and the west. During his 18 months of captivity in the Soviet Union he was repeatedly questioned about the possibility of such a deal. John's main new Moscow witness, regarding the events of 1954, is ex-KGB General Eugen Panyushkin who, John says, interrogated him in Berlin and Moscow. At that time, Panyushkin used the cover name 'Chernov'. But he is not sure that his appeal, if held, will succeed, and because of his age he would probably be dead by the time that happened. 'I have had many disappointments over the years,' he said. Today, John's strongest supporter, and closest friend, is 86-year-old Prince Louis Ferdinand, head of the Prussian former royal family. If the court allows his new appeal, John is expected to stay at the prince's home in Berlin during the court hearings.</p>

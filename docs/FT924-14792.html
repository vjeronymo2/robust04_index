			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Contractors hit by US recession BRITISH contractors, under severe pressure at home because of the recession, won fewer overseas contracts last year, according to figures published yesterday by the environment department. The value of international construction orders won by British companies fell by 11 per cent compared with 1990 to Pounds 2.2bn last year. The biggest fall in orders was in North America where the value of contracts fell by more than 30 per cent from Pounds 1.14bn to Pounds 781m. The decline reflects the recession in US construction markets. Overseas contracts account for less than 10 per cent of total order books of British construction companies. However last year contractors made big gains in the Far East, the world's fastest-growing construction market. The value of Far Eastern contracts won by British companies jumped by almost two thirds from Pounds 353m to Pounds 575m, in spite of a fall of Pounds 75m in Hong Kong. Construction of Hong Kong's multi-billion pound Chek Lap Kok airport is expected to provide big opportunities for UK construction companies over the next few years. Costain, Trafalgar House and Amec have already won contracts for a project that rivals the Channel tunnel in size. British contractors also increased orders in the Middle East, once the world's biggest export construction market, now greatly reduced in size. The value of orders won by contractors rose to Pounds 245m last year from Pounds 200m in 1990.</p>

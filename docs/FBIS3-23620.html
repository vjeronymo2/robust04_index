			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Vladimir Berezko, </F> under the rubric: "Arsenal": "This `Bumblebee' Stings With  Fire"]    [Text] Flamethrowers have been known as effective and at  times irreplaceable incendiary weapons for a long time. In the  light, portable variant, they were one or several tanks with a  flammable mixture that are connected to a nozzle shaped like a  gun. The pressure required to discharge the flammable mixture  was created either using compressed gas or a powder charge. The  shortcomings of this type of flamethrower are obvious. Their  combat employment has been associated with a series of  difficulties and limitations.    Today, we are familiarizing our readers with a new  generation  of flamethrower -- the capsule flamethrower.    The "Shmel" [Bumblebee] Rocket Infantry Flamethrower is  designed to destroy enemy protected firing positions, disable  lightly-armored vehicles, create fires and blind the enemy using  the smoke of fire points.    "Shmel" was accepted into the inventory in 1984; series  production began a year earlier. The flamethrower is in the  inventory of special flamethrower subunits and also in the  inventory of the airborne assault troops, naval infantry, and  combined arms subunits. "Shmel" underwent serious testing in  Afghanistan where it was utilized as a close combat weapon. By  way of illustration, if an artillery projectile made a hole in a  wall, "Shmel's" thermobaric munition destroyed the wall to its  foundation. The flamethrower demonstrated high effectiveness  while suppressing firing points in bunkers-caves, etc.    Today, a flamethrower is a multipurpose weapon that is  capable of not only destroying using high temperature and  pressure but it can also lay a smoke screen which permits the  crew to change position. Incidentally, under average weather  conditions the length of the impenetrable smoke screen created  by one round is from 55 to 90 meters.    It is interesting that the flamethrower can be utilized even  for peaceful purposes. They plan to study the possibility of  employing "Shmel" to combat snow avalanches, slush, or ice jams  near bridges. Experts think that "Shmel's" thermobaric munition  permits it to accomplish these missions.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Technical Specifications of the "Shmel" Rocket Infantry Flamethrower         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Firing range, m                       |1,000                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Aimed Range, m                        |600                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight of the flamethrower, kg        |11                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length, mm                            |920                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight of the thermobaric flammable m-|2.1                                   |  |ixture, kg                            |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight of the incendiary mixture, kg  |2.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight of the incendiary-smoke mixtur-|2.3                                   |  |e, kg                                 |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Number of flamethrowers in a pack, un-|2                                     |  |its                                   |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Crew                                  |1 man                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight of the pack, kg                |22                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

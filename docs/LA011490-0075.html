			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION  </P> <P> Your gun control editorial "A Move Toward Sanity" (Dec. 31) seems to gloss over  some important facts. You refer to Patrick Purdy as a disturbed petty criminal.  </P> <P> The truth is that Purdy had been charged with felony crimes seven times,  including drugs, assaults and weapons charges, and each time the charges were  either dropped or reduced to a misdemeanor. Because of this, he was legally  allowed to purchase numerous firearms, even to include some 15-day background  checks. One felony conviction would have prevented these purchases. Obviously  we have a severe breakdown in our justice system. Why have you never called for  harsher punishment of crimes and a reduction of the commonly used  plea-bargaining process that allowed Purdy to evade our laws?  </P> <P> As a second comment, you seem to suggest that a 15-day waiting period will  somehow keep guns out of the hands of criminals. It is a well-documented fact  that criminals don't buy guns on the commercial market; they steal them or have  access to an underground gun trade. And furthermore, the law enforcement  community and Justice Department admit that they can't even conduct background  checks within 15 days for handgun sales, and now we are going to more than  double their workload!  </P> <P> Laws such as AB 497, although well-intentioned, will only result in  restrictions to our law-abiding citizens. As a final comment, please tell your  readers how many assault rifles have been turned in or registered by the Crips  and Bloods gangs. It is my guess that on that score card, the only one which  really counts, we are batting zero.  </P> <P> JOHN P. PEARSON  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

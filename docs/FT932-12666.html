			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: DnB opens talks over Oslobanken DEN NORSKE BANK, Norway's biggest commercial bank, has opened talks aimed at acquiring Oslobanken, the troubled Oslo-based concern. Oslobanken warned last month that it would fall short of capital adequacy requirements during the first quarter, and its shares were suspended. DnB, which is 70 per cent state-owned, said earlier this month it was not interested in acquiring Oslobanken, but the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund has urged DnB to reconsider to at least acquire part of Oslobanken. In the meantime, the central bank is prepared to provide liquidity support to Oslobanken. DnB has initiated a due diligence process before deciding on an Oslobanken move. Oslobanken is expected soon to report poor quarterly results. In 1992, it made a pre-tax loss of NKr108m (Dollars 16m) following a big reduction in credit losses. Fokus Bank, Norway's third-biggest commercial bank which the state acquired last year, reports its first profit in four years. First-quarter net profit was NKr36.7m, against a loss of NKr137.6m last year, after cutting losses on loans and guarantees to NKr98.9m from NKr246.9m and reducing operating expenses by NKr100.2m to NKr229.2m. Vard, the cruise and ferry group, reports first-quarter losses, before taxes and extraordinary items, of NKr127.3m, up from NKr44.6m last year. Vard warned that its cruise business could be heading for an overall loss in 1993.</p>

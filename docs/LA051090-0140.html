			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GRATEFUL DEAD WON'T BE INVITED BACK TO  SCHOOL  </P> <P> Bowing to complaints about traffic, loitering and public urination, Cal State  Dominguez Hills has decided not to invite the Grateful Dead rock band back to  the campus. The band, which has a devoted following harking back to its roots  in the counterculture of the 1960s, performed over the weekend at the campus.  </P> <P> "The concert on the campus was peaceful . . . (but) in the interest of good  relations with the Carson community, we have decided not to invite the Grateful  Dead back to our campus," university spokesman Richard Turner said.  </P> <P> "That's probably best," said Carson Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt, "because our  neighborhoods are up in arms about it."  </P> <P> Also, a 19-year-old woman allegedly took LSD outside the concert Saturday, ran  a red light in Manhattan Beach and broadsided another car, killing a pregnant  woman and her fetus. Heather Tolles was charged Tuesday with two counts of  second-degree murder.  </P></p>

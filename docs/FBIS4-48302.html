			<p>BFN     [Text] The Afrikaans Handelsinstitut [Trade Institute--AHI]  has appealed to the ANC not to act over-hastily in introducing  drastic, uncoordinated reforms in certain sectors such as  agriculture. AHI President Nols Olivier said the reforms should  not be carried out before the programs and policy directions had  been subjected to full and thorough examination by all role  players. He said the policy proposals should also be exposed  within the scope of national goals aimed at urgent short-term  deficiencies, but with the retention of long-term survival and  sound development strategies in mind.</p>

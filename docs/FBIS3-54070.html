He said that "any such attempt would plunge the  country into a whirlpool of unhelpful conflicts and divisions."    In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from his  residence in the Syrian capital Damascus, he said it was very  important that the agreement should go into practical  implementation as soon as it was signed by Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and House of  Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar.  He expressed hope that a venue and date would be set for the  signing as soon as possible. [passage omitted]    'Ali Nasir also said: "What is important as far as we are  concerned is that the basic principles reached should be  implemented in an atmosphere of trust between members of the  political leadership with nobody feeling that he won or lost.  Everyone should feel that the triumph went to Yemen, the Yemeni  people, their unity, and their stability." He emphasized the  importance of implementation which, he said, was more  significant than the signing. [passage omitted]    'Ali Nasir revealed that, in his telephone contacts with  President Salih, Vice President al-Bid, and Shaykh al-Ahmar the  day before yesterday, he received assurances that the  subcommittee assigned by the the Dialogue Committee to make  arrangements for the signing ceremony had already begun its work  and was preparing to select a venue and set a date for the  signing of the agreement. [passage omitted]    Concluding his telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he  said that the local government system confirmed in the document  was a worthy solution to many of the crises experienced under  the Yemeni political system before and after the unity, and also  an ideal solution for the people's suffering. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, the Sons of Yemen League believes that the  agreement lays firm foundations for the building of united  Yemen. In a statement it issued yesterday, it expressed full  support for the document and appealed to all factions of the  Yemeni people to stand united in support of that document and  its implementation.    It said that any delay or dithering in the implementation of  the document would lead to a greater crisis in Yemen with no  time for the mediators to mediate and no time for dialogue.</p>

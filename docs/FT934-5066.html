			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Impact on incomes will be felt into the next century - The Institute for Fiscal Studies analyses the Budget's effects on households / What it means for society The effects on household incomes of Kenneth Clarke's first Budget will be felt well into the next century, with the announcement of an equalisation of the state pension age at 65. Rather more pressingly, the chancellor announced a wide range of measures on social security benefits, tax allowances and excise duties which will be in place next April. These, coupled with the measures already announced by Norman Lamont for April 1994, will leave households an average Pounds 4.60 per week worse off than if both chancellors had simply presented 'do nothing' Budgets which operated tax allowances in line with inflation and left tax rates unchanged. However, as the charts show, the effects on individual households vary greatly, with the richest households losing on average more than Pounds 10 per week and the poorest households losing less than Pounds 1 per week from the two packages. The main tax increases already announced by Norman Lamont in his March Budget will cost households an average Pounds 4.20 per week. The principal measures here are the increase in the rate of employee national insurance contributions, the restriction in value of the married couples's tax allowance and of mortgage interest tax relief, and the imposition of VAT on fuel at 8 per cent. The losses among the low income households arise almost exclusively from the VAT change, while far more important to better off households are the cuts in tax allowances and the NIC increase. The new measures announced yesterday to be implemented by next April imply only a modest additional cut in living standards next year for the population as a whole. But this average figure disguises big variations for particular groups. Pensioners and disabled people have in general done better than might have been expected out of the Budget. They will on average receive something approaching full compensation for the imposition of VAT on fuel and so losses among these groups fall significantly compared with the pure 'Lamont effect'. However, households headed by single pensioners still end up an average of 70p per week worse off, not least because of the increases in duties on tobacco and petrol. Married pensioners as a group are on average Pounds 1.50 a week worse off with the cut in value of the married couples' tax allowance adding to the effects of VAT and other tax increases. While the compensation package for VAT on fuel provided roughly adequate compensation for those over pension age, the same cannot be said even of low income households below pension age. The chancellor announced that income-related benefits for non-pensioners would be increased in April 1994 by 0.4 per cent - namely the effect on the Retail Prices Index of imposing 8 per cent VAT. However, the RPI is based on average spending patterns. Since low income households spend a significantly larger proportion of their income than the average on fuel they would need a bigger increase than this to provide full compensation. In other words, the compensation package does not even provide adequate compensation on average for low income non-pensioners, leaving aside any variations in individual circumstances. The second chart highlights this by showing that even after benefit increases lone parents will still have to find an extra Pounds 2 a week and unwaged couples with children an extra Pounds 1 a week by next April. It is worth remembering that even within these various family types there will be a wide variety of outcomes from the Budget. Thus around one in eight pensioners will actually gain modestly overall. An example of a gainer will be a pensioner living in a well insulated house, perhaps in the warmer south of England, and with an active lifestyle leading to low domestic fuel consumption. For such pensioners the 50p increase in the single pension will more than cover the effects of VAT on their fuel bills. It is also important to note the tax changes which have still to come, over and above those included in the above charts. Because the charts focus on April 1994 they exclude the extension of VAT to insurance next autumn, the imposition of the full rate of VAT on fuel in April 1995, the further cuts in the married couple's allowance and mortgage interest relief, also planned for 1995, and the cuts to social security benefits (mainly invalidity benefit and unemployment benefit) to be phased in over the next few years. They also exclude the above-inflation increases to cigarette and petrol duties apart from those planned for April 1994. The combined effect of all these changes will be to reduce weekly incomes by around a further Pounds 3 on average by April 1995. The results in the charts show how much each group loses on average in pounds per week and show losses rising with income. Another important question is how the losses look when expressed as a proportion of households' income after taxes. On this basis, the measures still seem to bear more heavily on richer households, costing the richest half of the population around 2 per cent of their after-tax income whilst the poorest tenth lose only around 0.75 per cent of their after-tax income. On balance, Mr Kenneth Clarke has been more successful than his predecessor in placing the burden of financing the government's borrowing requirement on the shoulders of richer households. However, our analysis suggests that for low-income families below pension age the chancellor may not have gone far enough. The results are produced by the IFS computer model of the personal tax and benefits system. The model applies the Budget measures to a representative sample of 7,000 households drawn from the latest Family Expenditure Survey, and works out which sorts of households gain and lose and by how much.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHO LOSES MOST?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE DO YOU FIT IN?

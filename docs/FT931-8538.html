			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Leaders and laggards from Latin America  -January offered a mixed outturn from the world's emerging markets The new year opened with strong performances in a number of the world's emerging markets. In Latin America, Chile led the way, far outperforming the region in dollar terms, according to data supplied by the IFC, part of the World Bank. Thailand also had a promising start to 1993 and, until a setback this week, had been building on those gains in February; Turkey and Greece also feature among the leaders. Chile received a boost in January following a long-awaited announcement of capital market reforms designed to broaden the range of investment options available to private pension funds (AFPs). This measure allows them to extend their investment opportunites beyond the 40 most liquid stocks. Later in the month activity was stimulated further when the central bank said that pension funds could invest up to 1 per cent of their assets in approved companies. The effect of these measures was to boost the IPSA index by about 12 per cent on the month - average daily turnover more than doubled to some Dollars 28m. First Boston, in a Latin American strategy document, comments that the outlook for Chilean equities remains positive, helped by the rosier economic outlook. 'Chile is expected to register a real GDP growth rate of 9.7 per cent in 1992, which would be the best performance in some 30 years,' the report says. 'Despite strong growth the year-to-year inflation fell to 12.7 per cent in 1992, down from 1991's 18.3 per cent and 1990's 27.3 per cent.' However, this must be set against high interest rates and the strength of the peso, which has had a negative effect on exports - these account for some 30 per cent of GDP. Conversely, Latin America also saw the worst performer on the month as Venezuela dropped by more than 13 per cent in dollar terms. According to Latin American Securities in London, public demonstrations against alleged elec-toral fraud in December's local elections and rumours of another coup attempt led to the market's sharp decline. Some confidence returned as January drew to a close with the stock exchange proposing a number of measures to improve the market's transparency and efficiency. With presidential elections scheduled for December, most analysts expect the market's volatility to continue throughout 1993. Thailand, benefiting from good economic data, briefly saw the SET index testing the 1,000 level, while declining interest rates also encouraged a switch into equities. Mr David Bates of Asia Equity says the rally was focused on the bank and finance sectors following better than expected results from the former. However, there was not enough momentum for the SET index to consolidate around the 1,000 mark. He expects a short term technical correction to bring the market back to around 930 to 940.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evolutionary Significance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS considered information provided by the petitioner on distinctive differences in habitat characteristics and life history traits between Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon and other California coho salmon populations, as well as the effects of hatchery influence on these populations. Distinctive differences in habitat characteristics included spawning in habitats characterized by highly mobile sediment bedloads and extreme hydrological cycles. Distinctive life history characteristics included the reduced number of eggs produced by female coho salmon that spawn in Scott and Waddell Creeks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the habitat characteristics and life history traits exhibited by coho salmon in Scott and Waddell Creeks are found in other coho salmon populations in California. Many of the streams and rivers in California exhibit similar elevated summer/fall water temperatures and extreme winter-flow bedload movements and hydrologic cycles. The extreme hydrologic cycles and resultant bedload movement found in Scott and Waddell Creeks undoubtedly affect the success of early spawning coho salmon in these watersheds. However, these conditions are similar to those found in most of California's coastal streams and rivers. Excessive use or diversion of drought limited flows in Scott and Waddell Creeks, as well as other systems, has probably exacerbated the problems created by poor land use management and stream habitat conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, we have no data to indicate that Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon egg production is related to the smaller average size of these fish in comparison to other coastal coho salmon populations. The number of eggs produced by a female coho salmon, in and by itself, does not indicate that there are differences between populations from other watersheds. Each river system is highly variable in year to year production and a smaller size of adult spawner may result from the overharvesting of larger individuals. The number of eggs produced by Scott Creek and Waddell Creek coho salmon were within the range reported from other coho salmon populations along the entire west coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS found some records of hatchery releases of other coho salmon stocks into Scott and Waddell Creeks, as well as most of the central California coastal streams, from the early 1900's through the early 1970's. The limited number of fish stocking records indicated that Scott and Waddell Creeks were planted with approximately a total of 500,000 and 130,000 coho salmon fry and juveniles, respectively, from numerous other watersheds. More than 2,000,000 coho salmon fry and juveniles have been planted in Santa Cruz County streams with coho salmon stocks from Washington, Oregon, and northern California. The magnitude (and likely effect) of early coho salmon fry releases was probably fairly small. However, starting in the 1950's, extensive juvenile coho salmon plants began. Even though Scott and Waddell Creeks have not been planted with outside sources of coho salmon since the early to mid-1970's, the effects of continuous hatchery plants prior to that time may have affected any distinctive phenotypic and life history traits that originally existed in these populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a thorough analysis of all information available, NMFS has determined that the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon populations do not represent a ``species'' under the ESA. Therefore, a proposal to list these populations under the ESA is not warranted at this time. However, these populations may be part of a larger ESU whose extent has not yet been determined. Whether this larger ESU merits protection under the ESA cannot be determined at this time. NMFS will attempt to identify the larger ESU that contains the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon populations as part of an ongoing status review of all coastal coho salmon populations in California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. This status review is being conducted in response to a petition received July 21, 1993, to list five stocks of coho salmon in Oregon and a petition received October 20, 1993, to list all coho salmon stocks in California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Nancy Foster,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Deputy Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Marine Fisheries Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9995 Filed 4&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

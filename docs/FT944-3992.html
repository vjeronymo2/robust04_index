			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein comes in from the cold It was a detail a newcomer to Northern Ireland would probably have missed - a flash of blue around the neck of a woman talking to a policeman outside the gates of Stormont Castle. 'Look at that. She's wearing a Rangers scarf. That's unashamed bigotry that is,' the driver remarked as his cab reached the end of the mile-long drive to Stormont.

On a bright, bitterly cold day Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, came to start the first public meeting with British officials in 25 years at Stormont - from where unionists ran the province for more than 70 years until direct rule from London began in 1972. Security was low key. Nine years ago there were 1,800 policemen on duty when British and Republic of Ireland ministers met at the height of loyalist opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement. Yesterday there were 16 constables, three sergeants, one superintendent and one chief superintendent. Sinn Fein arrived in a bullet-proof blue Ford Granada and a black London-type taxi. After briefly posing for photographs they entered the swing doors to the left wing of the building to be greeted by Mr Quentin Thomas, head of the five-strong government delegation.

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LAVERA GETS 58 YRS. IN KILLING OF SANTA ANA CHURCH ELDER, L.A. MAN FOR BEER  MONEY  </P> <P> A reputed gang member was sentenced to 58-years-to-life in prison today for two  slayings, including the murder of a Santa Ana church elder who was gunned down  as he prayed in a telephone booth.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge J. Michael Byrne gave Todd Lavera, 25, the  maximum penalty for being an accomplice in the first-degree murders of Leopoldo  Salgado of Los Angeles and David Eugene Thompson, an elder of the Greater Zion  Apostolic Church in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Thompson, 27, and Salgado, 48, were shot to death within 90 minutes of each  other in South Central Los Angeles on April 9, 1987, during an attempt by  Lavera and two other men to obtain money to buy beer.  </P> <P> Byrne also ordered Lavera to pay $10,000 each to the Salgado and Thompson  families as restitution. The Thompson family is from Tustin.  </P> <P> Lavera, who was not the triggerman, had faced a maximum penalty of life in  prison without the possibility of parole, but Byrne reduced the punishment  saying there was not enough evidence presented during the trial to show that  Lavera intended to kill Thompson and Salgado.  </P> <P> In June, a Superior Court jury recommended that Lavera be given a life sentence  after finding him guilty of a special circumstance allegation, murder during  the commission of a robbery. The charge qualifies the defendant for the death  penalty or life without parole.  </P> <P> Thompson was shot and killed in a telephone booth at Slauson Avenue and  Broadway. Police said he had gone for help after a church bus broke down. As  his wife, Namora, waited in their car, three men robbed them of $10 and shot  Thompson as he prayed.  </P> <P> Police said the men then took the Thompsons' car and drove to a liquor store  where they bought beer and cigarettes. They returned to the store later and  shot Salgado to death when he and his friend refused to give them money.  </P> <P> Still awaiting trial for first-degree murder and robbery is Tracy Lavell  Carter, 21, of Los Angeles. Andre Moore, 19, earlier pleaded guilty to the  first-degree murder of Thompson and was sentenced to 32-years to life.  </P></p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Salary of new IoD chief Sir, Your statement that the new IoD director-general's salary is to increase from Peter Morgan's Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 180,000 ('Nationwide chief to head IoD', May 5) is not correct. The present director-general receives a salary of Pounds 148,000, plus a pension contribution of Pounds 30,000 - a total remuneration package of Pounds 178,000. The new director-general will receive a salary of Pounds 160,000 and a pension contribution of approximately Pounds 20,000 - a total remuneration package of Pounds 180,000, and this salary will be frozen for three years. Michael Mander, chairman, Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5ED</p>

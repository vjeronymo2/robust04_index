			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Iraqi refugees start to panic as US forces withdraw REFUGEES in southern Iraq yesterday displayed their growing alarm at the departure of US forces in the area by staging demonstrations to call for a permanent UN solution to their plight - or continued US protection. The protests came as Maj Gen Gunther Greindl, Austrian head of the UN peacekeeping force in Kuwait and Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for discussions on the transition to UN supervision of the border area. The US troops were leaving positions south of the Euphrates River for a demilitarised zone being established by the UN along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border under the ceasefire that took effect last Thursday. The zone reaches six miles into Iraq and three miles into Kuwait. The refugees' protests served to underline the headaches the 1,440-strong UN force will face when it gradually takes up duty on the border area, sometime within the next two weeks. The most immediate problem for the 34-nation peace force is the two large refugee camps it will inherit on the Kuwait-Iraq border, one run by the US army and the other by the Kuwaiti Red Crescent, which together hold at least 15,000 Iraqis. Few if any formal arrangements appear to have been made for any transition of supervision at the camps - which receive daily supplies of water and boxes of food from the US army. Major Tom Grubb, the US Civil Affairs officer running the US camp says: 'You'd have thought someone from the UN or the Red Cross would have thought to talk to me about things, but they haven't yet.' Aware that Kuwait will refuse them entry, hundreds of refugees have in the last few days taken to the desert in a further flight, braving thousands of unexploded allied bomblets which litter the area and have already claimed five of the campdwellers' lives. One refugee said most would do all they could to resist returning to Iraq - apparently pinning hopes on the UN's ability to create a completely neutral zone to embrace the camps, which US military maps show to lie within Iraq's borders. Others echoed this. 'People will lie under tanks to prevent them leaving,' said Mr Hamid Ali, an refugee working as a nurse on the US army-run camp. Most refugees said they wanted a 'UN solution' to their plight, though this appeared generally to amount to being offered political asylum en masse in the west. The UN peacekeepers will also find themselves in the midst of increasingly tense relations between campdwellers and the local townsfolk of Safwan - and indeed between pro and anti-Saddam factions within the town itself. US military police units have been maintaining daily patrols through Safwan since the sudden influx of refugees more than a month ago sparked fights, thefts and even arson in the poor, bombed and flyblown border town.</p>

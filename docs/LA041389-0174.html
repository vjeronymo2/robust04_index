			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S NOTHING -- AND EVERYTHING -- BORDERLINE ABOUT FOSTER &amp; LLOYD'S  SUCCESS  </P> <P> Foster &amp; Lloyd figure they wouldn't have been around very long in country  music if they had shown up about 10 years ago.  </P> <P> That's because nobody in country radio would have played their records.  </P> <P> But Radney Foster, who hails from Del Rio, Tex., and Bill Lloyd, a native of  Bowling Green, Ky., figure that they lucked out.  </P> <P> "We were at the right place at the right time," Foster said.  </P> <P> Foster &amp; Lloyd are country rockers, or rocking countrians, depending on the  way one looks at things. But either way, one thing is clear: Country music fans  like 'em.  </P> <P> Their current single, "Fair Shake," from their new album "Faster and Louder,"  is already in the top 10, following a string of chart successes.  </P> <P> They were asked about being on the borderline, the edge of what is considered  country and what is not.  </P> <P> "I think we're just making music we enjoy and were influenced by as kids,"  Foster said.  </P> <P> "Whether it was the rock side of things -- the Beatles and the Byrds -- or the  country side of things -- like Buck Owens, Merle Haggard and Glen Campbell --  in the '60s there was tons of stuff on radio.  </P> <P> "Bill and I have been influenced by all those things, and I think we're trying  to throw all those together.  </P> <P> "Obviously, there's a lot of rock influence and a lot of country influence. It  works for us. I don't think there's a need to apologize for either one of  them."  </P> <P> Lloyd said "strict credentials" are primarily for marketing purposes and not  for listening purposes: "People will listen to whatever they like. And if you  present them a good song, they should like it. There's all kinds of formulas  for hit records, but the basic one is, 'Do you like it? Will you buy it?' "  </P> <P> "Faster &amp; Louder" has a list of "guest pickers," the two singers said. They  include John Cowan and Sam Bush of the New Grass Revival, great dobroist Jerry  Douglas, and pop revisionist Marshall Crenshaw.  </P> <P> "We were able to stretch some of the boundaries on songs and think about  different ideas," said Foster, adding that the album "was a great experience  for me."  </P> <P> Foster &amp; Lloyd sing Friday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San  Juan Capistrano. The Jack Rather Band opens at 9 p.m. Tickets: $13.50.  Information: (714) 496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

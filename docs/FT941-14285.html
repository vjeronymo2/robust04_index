			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Bundesbank announces a more refined system The Bundesbank yesterday reduced and restructured its minimum reserve requirements in a move it claimed would cut costs and improve competitiveness in the German banking system. It would also allow private sector banks' room to adjust their interest rates, the central bank said in a statement after a routine meeting of its policy-making council. From March 1, requirements for sight deposits held by domestic and foreign investors will be fixed at 5 per cent. At present German deposits are subject to a scale of requirements ranging from 6.6 per cent to 12.1 per cent. The Bundesbank calculated that the changes would lead to a total reduction of DM29bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in requirements set against their deposits, including DM18bn currently held interest-free at the central bank. 'This will allow us to use these funds more effectively,' said a spokesman for Commerzbank. 'It will also level the playing field and allow us to compete better with French and British banks.' But banking analysts were uncertain whether it would lead to more generous borrowing conditions for the private sector. 'Some benefits may be passed on to better quality clients,' one said. German banks have been widely criticised for their apparent reluctance to pass on to customers the full benefits of the Bundesbank's series of rate cuts over the past 18 months. The Bundesbank has traditionally used minimum reserve requirements as a means of controlling money supply growth, which is the central factor in its interest rates policy. The changes would not affect the long-term effectiveness of minimum reserves, which it described as an 'important instrument', the bank said in a statement. It would compensate for the increase in liquidity caused by the reduced requirements by reducing the volume of funds injected regularly through its securities repurchase agreements. Yesterday's meeting, which left key interest rates unchanged, agreed that repurchase agreements for the next two weeks would continue at a fixed rate of 6 per cent. The repo rate has been unchanged since December 8, while the short-term discount and Lombard rates were last reduced on October 22 last year. Government bonds, Page 25</p>

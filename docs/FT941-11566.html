			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cash injection for Aerospatiale The French government is injecting FFr2bn (Dollars 341m) into Aerospatiale to help the state-owned aircraft and defence company promote its new Airbus 330-340 programmes and improve its finances. The government has put Aerospatiale on its list of state companies to be sold into the private sector. However, it suggested recently that in the near term letting industrial partners take a stake in the company was far more likely than privatisation. Aerospatiale has forecast a 1993 loss 'significantly less' than 1992's FFr2.38bn.</p>

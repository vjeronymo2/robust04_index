			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Reassurance by Dutch chain Albert Heijn, the biggest Dutch supermarket chain, said yesterday that it would continue to sell Omo Power, a new generation of washing powder manufactured by Unilever, after receiving assurances about the detergent from the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group. The powder, called Persil Power in Britain, is at the centre of a highly public dispute between Unilever and its US rival Procter &amp; Gamble, which has charged that the detergent damages clothing. Albert Heijn said it would compensate any customers who were dissatisfied with the powder if they could prove the detergent was bought in one of its 612 supermarkets.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Kenya central bank comes under attack from angry exporters: Exporters complain of unfair burdens The central bank of Kenya has come under siege from irate exporters who claim a rapid appreciation of the Kenya shilling is strangling their Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) annual sales of fresh vegetables and cut flowers to European markets. Since the abolition of foreign exchange controls 12 months ago, the Kenyan currency has strengthened by more than 30 per cent against the dollar. A wave of speculative capital has come from abroad, chasing high-yielding Treasury bills which offer some of the best rates of return in the world. Exporters complain they are shouldering the cost of the government's inability to bring its budget deficit, and the inefficiencies of its large parastatal sector, under control. 'Interest rates must come down,' says Mr Richard Evans of Homegrown, the largest suppliers of fresh horticultural produce to Marks and Spencer in the UK. 'Speculators are making windfall profits on Kenyan treasury bills, while my earnings are down by 30 per cent.' Smaller export-oriented companies, he adds, are on the brink of disaster. The predicament of Kenya's horticulture exporters, who are the third largest exchange currency earners after tourism and coffee, poses an unprecedented challenge for Mr Micah Cheserem, central bank governor. If it were not for the bank's frequent interventions in the money market to buy surplus dollars, the shilling would be even stronger than it is. But the central bank has already accumulated Dollars 800m of reserves, enough to cover six months' imports, and ruled out any more interventions, to stabilise the currency market. The unexpected dollar bounty marks a dramatic turn of events. Only last year, the Kenyan government was forced to reschedule Dollars 500m of debt arrears. Mr Cheserem believes his success in curbing inflation, from an annualised rate of over 50 per cent last year to under 20 per cent, should allow interest rates to come down and a more realistic exchange rate to emerge. Treasury bill yields have fallen from a high of 80 per cent in June 1993 to 16 per cent this month, but commercial banks have been slow to follow suit. The prohibitive cost of credit has discouraged new investment in Kenya's economy, which has seen no significant growth in over two years. 'When inflation reaches single digits,' Mr Cheserem says, 'we will see a revival in economic activity, and the greater demand for imports should ease the dollar glut.' Kenya will be hosting an investors' conference in London next month, during which its rapid progress in deregulating the economy will be on display. Import curbs have been abolished, the currency is now freely convertible, and a host of incentives are in place to attract foreign investors. Doubts persist, however, about the willingness of President Daniel arap Moi's government to tackle more fundamental reforms. Little progress has been made in the programme to privatise loss-making parastatals, largely because of the inertia of civil servants. Meanwhile, the services provided by parastatals (telecommunications, electricity, water and the upkeep of roads) continues to deteriorate. President Moi has faced an upsurge in social unrest in recent months, with doctors and university lecturers staging strikes to demand government recognition of their unofficial trade unions. Both groups returned to work in September defeated, but the government's refusal to tolerate independent trade unions has drawn criticism from human rights groups and donor governments. Donors will be meeting in late November to review Kenya's economic progress and assess the country's aid requirements for 1995. Aid pledges are expected to be substantially lower than the Dollars 850m obtained last year, partly because of continued concern over Kenya's human rights record.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Woolcombers and Illingworth fall WOOLCOMBERS GROUP, the wool processing company which abandoned plans for a stock market flotation in September, yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits 26 per cent lower at Pounds 1.16m. Turnover for the six months to end-September slipped to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 12.12m), although this was more than accounted for by the discontinuation of businesses with a turnover of Pounds 834,000. The results show Pounds 229,000 of extraordinary costs associated with both the postponed flotation and a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the wool scouring (cleaning) market. Earnings per share fell from 3.46p to 2.55p. The company said its proposed flotation was abandoned 'due to volatile currency and equity market conditions'. Mr Alan Lewis, the chairman, said he hoped to try again to float in the early autumn of this year. Woolcombers is part of the Illingworth Morris Group, quoted on the stock exchange until 1989 when it was taken private by Mr Lewis. Illingworth Morris, owner of the Crombie brand name, also published its interim results yesterday. A doubling of the interest charge contributed to a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 905,000 for the six months to September 30. Turnover rose slightly to Pounds 25.75m (Pounds 24.2m). There were extraordinary charges of Pounds 434,000 associated with the postponed flotation and MMC inquiry. Both companies said 'general economic conditions have continued to be difficult' and that 'the second half of the year is expected to show improved profitability'. Cloth sales of Illingworth held up 'notwithstanding the competitive pressure on pricing' and market share improved. At Woolcombers, sales of lanolin-based products increased by 10 per cent, but sales of synthetic fibres fell 31 per cent.</p>

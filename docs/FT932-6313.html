			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Peseta dips below central rate THE SPANISH peseta came under heavy selling pressure against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, falling below its new central rate against the German currency and raising speculation that it might have to be devalued again, writes James Blitz. The peseta fell as a result of the growing feeling that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's socialist prime minister, would lose the forthcoming general election and that Spanish interest rates would come down in a bid to stimulate the economy. After closing in London on Wednesday night at Pta77.88 against the D-Mark, the peseta plunged to a low of Pta79.50, beyond its central rate against the D-Mark of Pta79.11. The currency later rallied to end in London at Pta78.83. Several dealers suspected yesterday that the currency was ripe for another devaluation. However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, felt that departure from the ERM was unlikely because Spain won large EC aid at last year's Edinburgh summit. Mr Mark Brett of BZW believes the currency might hold at current levels because Spanish bond yields are an attractive 4 per cent above Germany's. The Spanish currency's fall raised some fears about the stability of the ERM, triggering short-term currency flows into the D-Mark. However, there was widespread belief that the D-Mark had also profited from comments made earlier in the week by Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank governor, who had been reported as saying that the European Monetary System had effectively broken down. 'That was the most blunt condemnation of the ERM from a central bank governor that I have heard for a year,' said one analyst. The D-Mark was up nearly a centime against the French franc at one stage, before closing at FFr3.371 from a previous FFr3.368. The German currency also closed 2 pfennigs stronger against the dollar at DM1.6120; it moved further ahead in New York to end at DM1.6033. Heavy buying of Swiss francs was also reported, with the currency, often seen as a safe haven, ending at SFr0.891 per D-Mark from a previous SFr0.896. Sterling fell back 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark on the day Mr Kenneth Clarke was selected as the new UK chancellor, closing at DM2.5075. The pound's weakness was partly due to speculation that Mr Clarke, who is left-of-centre in the Conservative party, might introduce another base rate cut to stimulate the economy. But sterling's retracement was also explained by heavy technical resistance at DM2.52. 'There has been widespread profit-taking and people are taking another look at sterling,' commented a dealer. The dollar slipped lower against the yen in Europe in spite of two bouts of intervention from the Federal Reserve. It closed at Y107.80 from a previous Y108.60, and in New York fell to Y107.15.</p>

The State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training program responds to needs identified in the comprehensive system of personnel development in section 101(a)(7) of the Act. The program may include training designed (a) to address recruitment and retention of qualified rehabilitation professionals; (b) to provide for succession planning; (c) to provide for leadership development and capacity building; and (d) for fiscal year 1994, to provide training on the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 made by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eligible Applicants: Only State agencies designated under a State plan for vocational rehabilitation services under section 101(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, are eligible to receive an award under this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deadline for Transmittal of Applications: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  August 8, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deadline for Intergovernmental Review: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  September 7, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applications Available: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  July 7, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Available Funds: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  $5,944,350, of which $4,755,480 is available for allocation to designated agencies for basic awards and $1,188,870 is available for allocation to high quality applications.

In making a final selection of proposals to support under this program, the Secretary considers the extent to which proposals have exceeded a rating of 80 points and address one or more of the following absolute priorities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Development and Dissemination of Model In-Service Training Materials and Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed project demonstrates an effective plan to develop and disseminate information on its State Vocational Rehabilitation In-Service Training program, including the identification of training approaches and successful practices, in order to permit the replication of these programs by other State vocational rehabilitation units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Distance Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed project demonstrates innovative strategies for training State vocational rehabilitation unit personnel through distance education methods, such as interactive audio, video, computer technologies, or existing telecommunications networks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Enhanced Employment Outcomes for Specific Populations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed project supports specialized training in the provision of vocational rehabilitation or related services to individuals with disabilities to increase the rehabilitation rate into competitive employment for all individuals or specified target groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations. However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 24000), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ended June 8, 1994. Sixteen parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. The following is a summary of the changes that are expected to be made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review, based on the public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five commenters suggested deleting &sect;388.21(a)(4), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides a minimum share of not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available to Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The commenters believe agencies in the territories, some of which have as many employees as small designated State agencies, should receive the same minimum share of not less than one-third of one percent of the amounts made available for the fiscal year as provided in &sect;388.21(a)(3) to small agencies. The Secretary agrees that the same minimum share provided to small designated State agencies is appropriate for the specified territories. The Secretary also notes that the territories are eligible to compete for the remaining funds to be allocated based on the quality of the application as determined by competitive reviews conducted by the Department using the selection criteria in &sect;388.20 and the priorities in &sect;388.22. The Secretary expects to revise &sect;388.21(a) by deleting paragraph (4) so that all grant recipients receive the same minimum share of the sums made available for the fiscal year. A revision of &sect;388.30, deleting paragraph (c), which provides special matching considerations for the territories, is also expected to be made in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters requested definitions for the terms ``succession planning'' and ``capacity building'' used in &sect;388.1. The Secretary notes that these terms are found in the statute, but are optional for State agencies to address in their in-service training. There are alternative ways to address these terms, and the Secretary prefers not to define them, thus leaving the widest possible discretion to State agencies. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters addressed the requirement in &sect;388.20(a)(2)(iii) for an annual needs assessment of in-service training needs. The commenters believe an annual assessment is not necessary and recommend a comprehensive needs assessment every three years and a less comprehensive review annually. The Secretary agrees that a comprehensive assessment is not needed annually. A revision of &sect;388.20(a)(2)(iii), deleting the word ``annual,'' is expected to be made in the final regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CYCLING TOUR DE TRUMP;  </P> <P> SOVIET, 19, LEADS AFTER FOUR STAGES  </P> <P> Soviet amateur Viatcheslav Bobrik broke away from the pack in the Virginia  countryside, then used a powerful late attack Saturday to take the overall lead  after four stages of the Tour de Trump bicycle race.  </P> <P> Bobrik, 19, broke from a trio of riders on the second three-mile city street  circuit before claiming the 87.7-mile Fredericksburg to Richmond Road Race  third stage in 3 hours 50 minutes 11 seconds.  </P> <P> A few hours later, Bobrik's seven-rider squad finished fifth in the 39.3-mile  Richmond Team Time Trial in 1:16:48.  </P> <P> "The leader's jersey is an enormous responsibility, and it's a heavy shirt,"  said Bobrik, who holds a 1-minute 19-second lead over third-place road race  finisher Thierry Bock of Belgium. Previous leader Olaf Ludwig of East Germany  is third, 2:58 behind.  </P> <P> Mike McCarthy of New York, a member of the U.S. national amateur team, finished  second in the road race in 3:50:42. Bock was third in 3:50:57.  </P> <P> Bobrik, McCarthy and Bock broke away from the field of 131 riders 25 miles into  the trek through central Virginia, building nearly a 15-minute margin.  </P> <P> When the lead cyclists arrived in Richmond, Bobrik made his move.  </P> <P> The 7-Eleven team from the United States won the fourth stage with a 52-second  victory over the Netherlands' PDM in 1:15:10.  </P> <P> Two-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond finished 60th in the road race and  guided his Z-Kickers squad to a fourth-place finish in the team time trial. He  is 49th, trailing Bobrik by 3:32.  </P> <P> Greg McNeil of Ojai crashed in the final lap of the road course and suffered a  broken collarbone.  </P></p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity shares fall as loss grows sharply TRADE INDEMNITY, the leading trade credit insurer in the UK, yesterday announced heavily increased pre-tax losses to Pounds 46.6m for 1991 and said it would pay no dividend for the year for the first time in its 74-year history. Its shares closed 13p lower at 30p. Mr Peter Dugdale, chairman, said: 'The fight against the ravages of recession is not yet over.' But he reported signs that business insolvencies were now levelling off at the 1991 level. Trade Indemnity customers reported 8,824 business failures in 1991, up 60 per cent on 1990. The company accounts for 82 per cent of the credit insurance underwritten in the UK. The company's pre-tax loss, which compares with Pounds 28.8m in 1990, includes new provisions against an anticipated loss in the 1990 underwriting year of Pounds 20.6m. The total projected loss for that year is now Pounds 37.5m. The second main contributor to the loss was a Pounds 19.5m provision to wind up its Special Underwriting Unit, set up in 1985 mainly to specialise in commercial mortgage insurance. The overall loss, which is cut back to Pounds 38.7m after tax recoveries amounting to Pounds 7.9m, consumes virtually all of last May's rights issue. It had raised Pounds 39.6m at 55p a share. There had been speculation ahead of the company's results that the company would make a fresh call for funds. Mr Vic Jacob, managing director, yesterday scotched such talk. He said liquidity levels were 'quite favourable', and the solvency ratio strong. Following a premium rate increase of 40 per cent in May last year, premium income in 1991 rose by almost 30 per cent to Pounds 136.3m. The company noted that record business failures had thrown the spotlight on the value of Trade Indemnity's services, lifting new business of continuing operations from Pounds 24m to Pounds 27m. Trade Indemnity, which withheld its interim dividend in September, said yesterday it would not pay a final either. In 1990 it paid a total of 1.9p. Losses per share totalled 26.35p (21.64p adjusted for the rights issue). COMMENT A loss in the middle of the UK's longest post-war recession was no surprise but analysts were shocked by the size of the deficit and the doubling of gross claims to Pounds 163m. Worse was the Pounds 19.5m cost of closing the Special Underwriting Unit. It was an awful postscript on the disastrous decision to move into mortgage security in 1985. It is understood the unit has paid out on, or made reservations against, virtually all of the 50-odd polipany expects to make no provisions this year. This is scant comfort for the nine European insurance groups who hold 80 per cent of its shares which have collapsed from a 52-week high of 101p. There will be relief that no new rights issue has been made immediately. But a fresh capital injection, perhaps resulting in a rationalisation of shareholdings, cannot be ruled out. Coface, the leading French export credit company with a 3.5 per cent stake bought last September, is probably licking its wounds. Swiss Re and Munich Re, which together hold just under 26 per cent, might see value in closer linkage between Trade Indemnity and Hermes, Germany's leading export credit company.</p>

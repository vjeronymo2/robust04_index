			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRINCIPAL POINTS TO STRIDES AT GOMPERS  </P> <P> Gompers Secondary School Principal Marie Thornton on Wednesday asked parents  and students not to let a student demonstration in support of a teacher last  Friday overshadow what she said are continuing academic gains at the  long-troubled Southeast San Diego school.  </P> <P> During an afternoon press conference, Thornton also said her action in  transferring business education teacher Rhoenna Armster involuntarily to  Lincoln High School was not in retribution for Armster's outspoken opposition  to changes in curriculum at the math-science-computer magnet school.  </P> <P> Thornton and top San Diego Unified School District administrators say that  state law, and the threat of legal action by Armster, prohibit discussion of  specific reasons for the transfer. Armster has also declined comment on  specifics, although she has said that Thornton acted out of retribution. School  Supt. Tom Payzant said Tuesday night that he and school board members back the  transfer.  </P> <P> The demonstration by students provoked a police response of more than 30 units,  including trained dogs, a police helicopter and riot-equipped police, which  Payzant and trustees believe may have fanned the planned demonstration into a  larger news story than it otherwise would have been.  </P> <P> Thornton, who remained in her office dealing with telephone calls and other  matters during the demonstration, declined comment on the police action, saying  that she would await results of separate district and Police Department  investigations into why so many officers were dispatched to the campus.  </P> <P> But the school's African-American male pupil advocate, teacher Douglas  Williams, said he believes the "media circus" on Friday would not have occurred  if police had not responded in such force.  </P> <P> Thornton has been criticized by some parents and administrators for not being  publicly visible during the demonstration. But Thornton rejected those charges,  saying that she "could not be everywhere" and that a sufficient number of  administrators handled the demonstration.  </P> <P> Thornton said she has been an effective leader at Gompers, pointing to  improvements in the school's physical appearance and student achievement under  a year-old program to extend the high-powered curriculum to all of the  overwhelmingly nonwhite neighborhood students who attend the seventh- through  12th-grade school.  </P></p>

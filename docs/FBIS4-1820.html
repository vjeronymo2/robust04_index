			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- A new group will be set  up in Beijing to study policies concerning land and housing in  Hong Kong.    The decision was made during a two-day meeting concluded  here  today by the economic subject panel of the preliminary working  committee for the preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region (SAR).    Members of the economic subject panel agreed that such a  group is necessary when exceedingly high housing and land prices  in Hong Kong have already adversely affected the livelihood of  local residents and Hong Kong's economic growth.    During the meeting, these members heard a report on the  question of land in Hong Kong and the Chinese Government's  policy regarding the approval of land there.    Zhong Qiquan, secretary-general of the Guangdong Provincial  Government, briefed the members on the large construction  projects being undertaken in Guangdong. The members discussed  how to coordinate large construction projects undertaken in the  Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong.    Moreover, members of the banking and finance panels of the  preliminary working committee also met here to discuss an  initial report on how to manage the land fund of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region after 1997.</p>

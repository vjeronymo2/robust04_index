			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: NEC plans Dollars 50m investment in California semiconductor plant - Japanese company to produce 64-megabit memory chip in US NEC, the Japanese electronics group, yesterday announced it would invest Dollars 50m in its semiconductor manufacturing facility in California, becoming the first company to mass produce next generation 64-megabit chips in the US. NEC also revised upwards its planned 1994-5 capital investment in semiconductors by Y15bn (Dollars 153.1m). This would bring total investment in semiconductor facilities in the year to March 1995 to Y125bn. This represents a 39 per cent increase from the initial plan to invest Y90bn in semiconductor facilities this year. The decision to increase investments in semiconductor manufacturing facilities follows last month's announcement of an Dollars 800m investment in the company's semiconductor manufacturing facility in Scotland for increased memory chip production. 'I am optimistic about the future D-Ram (dynamic random access memory) market,' says Mr Hajime Sasaki, senior executive vice president in charge of the semiconductor business. In Japan, the video games and computer printer industries are providing a strong demand for semiconductors as the advanced products coming to the market require a larger memory. The emerging multimedia market, with personal computers increasingly using CD-Roms (small plastic discs on which vast amounts of information can be stored and retrieved) for incorporating video images, is also supporting buoyant demand for memories. Mr Sasaki said last month that there is a 20 per cent worldwide shortfall in memory chips. NEC's investment at its Roseville plant in California, where it manufactures current generation 4-megabit and 16-megabit D-Rams will go towards upgrading existing facilities. Although Roseville is acknowledged to be one of the company's most successful plants, it lost out to the Livingston plant for the more substantial investment of Dollars 800m. NEC's decision to manufacture 64-megabit D-Rams, which are expected to come into production around 1997, stems from the need for customers to secure stable supply and flexibility, Mr Sasaki said. Other new investments, making up the Y15bn increase in capital spending, will be at four of its manufacturing facilities in Japan and facilities in Malaysia and Singapore. A strong increase in sales has lent support to NEC's increased investment plans. In the first half of the current fiscal year, NEC's semiconductor production value increased 11 per cent from Y395bn to Y440bn, the company said yesterday. This was also a Y5bn increase from NEC's original estimate for the year. NEC expects full year shipments of semiconductors to increase by 12 per cent to Y910bn from a previous Y810bn. The company maintains an even more bullish outlook for its semiconductor sales in the year to March 1996 when it expects sales to at least top Y1,000bn for the first time. Japanese chip companies are eager not to slip behind their US competitors' expansion in capacity. NEC last year lost its position as the world's top semiconductor producer in dollar sales terms to Intel of the US, a symbolic blow which it intends to redress.</p>

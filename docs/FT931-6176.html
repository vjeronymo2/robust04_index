			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Bribe scandals hit Italy's credit ratings THE spreading corruption scandals affecting Italy's political establishment are beginning to affect Italy's credit ratings. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday announced a downgrading of the rating on Italy's sovereign long-term foreign debt from AA+ to AA. This comes after last Friday's statement from Moody's, the other main international credit rating agency, that Italy's debt was to be placed under review. The Moody's move provoked an unprecedented joint rebuttal from the Bank of Italy and the Treasury. They accused Moody's of failing to take account of the positive corrective measures introduced in recent months to tackle Italy's public sector deficit. Yesterday the Italian financial authorities issued no formal response to the S&amp;P move. Even with yesterday's downgrading S&amp;P still rates Italy as a significantly better credit risk than Moody's. If Moody's review results in Italy being downgraded to single A status, then many credit-conscious international investors will cease to buy its bonds. Standard &amp; Poor's action yesterday was based on a combination of political and economic criteria. The agency said the corruption scandals were weakening the fragile government coalition. The markets, which had reacted nervously to Moody's announcement, appeared to have discounted a move by Standard &amp; Poor's. The lira was being traded yesterday at L955 against the D-Mark. Last August, when problems first arose with creditors over payment of debts of Efim, the state holding company placed in liquidation, Moody's downgraded Italian debt from AA1 to AA3. Italy has undertaken with its EC partners, in return for a four-tranche Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.54bn) loan, to reduce the public sector deficit from nearly 11 per cent to 9.3 per cent of GDP this year. The budget envisages raising L93,000bn (Pounds 40.6bn) in taxes and extra revenues, about 5.8 per cent of GDP.</p>

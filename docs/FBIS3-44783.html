Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, said that the new  quotas will be placed on imports of certain textile and apparel  products from China in 1994 at levels 25 percent to 35 percent  lower than in 1993.    The move was seen as a retaliation to alleged "massive  transshipment" and "significant overshipments" of Chinese  textiles through third countries. Negotiations between  Washington and Beijing in the last nine months failed to solve  the issue before the bilateral textile agreement expired on  December 31, 1993.    The Chinese side made it clear that the problem of illegal  shipments should be dealt with seriously through negotiations  provided there is clear evidence, but the U.S. side insisted on  its unilateral power to impose quota reductions.    According to Kantor, the new quotas will be announced  formally in a federal register notice, which will become  effective on January 17, 1994, but it would apply to textile and  apparel products that have entered into the United States after  January 1 this year.    The sharp cuts cover 88 categories of products, including  sweaters, knit shirts, cotton trousers and shop cloths used to  clean machinery, according to Kantor.    The quota reduction is estimated to slash China's exports in  those categories by 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.</p>

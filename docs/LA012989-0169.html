			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY'S UPHILL STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL  </P> <P> "This is not a house!" our 14-year-old daughter, Mary, exclaimed as we pulled  up next to the dilapidated stable our friends had just moved into. "I don't  want to go inside."  </P> <P> I didn't either. We hated to see this Oaxacan Indian family evicted from a  decent apartment because they couldn't manage the rent and utilities. This  stable had been in better condition when it housed animals -- but it was warmer  than sleeping in the fields as many of their Mexican countrymen were doing.  </P> <P> Three of the children came out to greet us, full of smiles and hugs. A rusty  tricycle and a faded stroller sat in the dirt. Around the fire pit a circle of  small shoes was drying after the rain the day before. A hose led to a discarded  sink, the only sign of plumbing at the stable. The couple who lived in the  front house had offered the "Conde" family (as I'll call them) shelter in  exchange for yard work and baby sitting. I steeled myself to go inside.  </P> <P> A light bulb hung from the ceiling in the corner of the stable they were  occupying. An old refrigerator, table and chairs completed the kitchen, while a  scrap of avocado-colored sculptured carpet and one mattress made up the  "parlor." November winds came through the broken boards in the walls. Rita, the  tiny mother, changing 8-month-old Arturo, gave us a tired smile and asked us to  sit down. She looked a little fuller around the middle -- but I put the thought  out of my mind. Serufino was at work at a nearby nursery.  </P> <P> It appeared the only thing that had improved since my husband, Vic, and I met  them two years ago, before we helped them file amnesty papers, was that now  Serufino had a work permit and no longer feared being deported. Unable to read  and write Spanish or English, because he only went as far as third grade in a  remote mountain village, he still earned close-to-minimum wage. Most important  to the parents, the new baby is a citizen, as are his brother and two sisters.  Six-year-old Lucinda had started school and 5-year-old Oscar would soon. Pretty  4-year-old Teresa looked especially beautiful playing outside the run-down  stable.  </P> <P> But how could they survive in this primitive place . . .  </P> <P> Amnesty was not enough.  </P> <P> The Condes had tried to better their living conditions. Last year, before  Arturo was born, the family had moved out of a similar one-room shack with no  heat or running water, into a real house in Encinitas they shared with several  other families. The five were willing to live and sleep in a small corner of  the front room, partitioned-off with plywood and a sheet, in order to have the  use of a kitchen and bathroom. Rita was happy to be with other women -- until  drunks came in at all hours of the night, making it impossible, and unsafe, to  sleep.  </P> <P> Just before Thanksgiving, in 1987, the owner of the house came home drunk one  night, demanding the following month's rent. When the Condes didn't have it, he  forced them out onto the street. They called us, asking Vic to drive them to a  field where they could pitch a tent the Rev. Rafael Martinez had lent them.  They had all their possessions in five trash bags when we arrived.  </P> <P> Unable to bear the thought of them in a field, we took them to a cheap motel.  Vic had to persuade the desk clerk to let the family use only one room, even  though it had two double beds. The clerk claimed it was against the law for  five people to sleep in one motel room.  </P> <P> Our oldest daughter, Katy, surprised us by inviting them to spend Thanksgiving  weekend with her family. The Conde children explored the grassy yard filled  with toys, while Serufino and Rita walked up and down the streets of Leucadia,  searching for a casita they could afford.  </P> <P> They found a "For Rent" sign on an old house that was in the first stages of  being remodeled. Since the carpet had been torn out, holes punctuated the  walls, and the broken stove and refrigerator sat rusting in the courtyard, the  owner agreed to rent it for just $500 -- the rent would go up when the repairs  were completed. The five were thrilled to have four rooms to themselves -- and  hot baths.  </P> <P> The hot water lasted as long as the privacy. Just as the water heater gave out  the following week, the owner arrived late one night, bringing another family  to share the place with them. Nothing was said, however, about sharing the  rent. The others were to pay an additional amount. Serufino and Rita refused  and insisted that the other family leave.  </P> <P> The antiquated electric wall heater gave off little heat. They plugged up the  holes in the walls with rags, hung a bedspread at the drapeless sliding glass  door. Rita cooked on a kerosene camp stove someone lent them, waiting each day  for the new stove to be delivered.  </P> <P> A few days before Christmas, the owner called me, asking my help to get them  out. The school nurse had visited them, and, seeing piles of garbage under the  adjoining building, holes in the walls, and finding the children huddled in bed  to keep warm, called the woman a "slumlord" and threatened to call authorities.  </P> <P> "I am not a slumlord," she protested. "They moved in before the place was  ready. I never promised them a stove. . . . "  </P> <P> "And," she spat the words out, "she's pregnant again!"  </P> <P> When the family moved to a decent upstairs apartment in Carlsbad, they were in  for a shock.  </P> <P> Even though they had rarely used the electric heater, and little other  electricity in the time they were at the old house, faulty wiring had caused an  electrical leak somewhere, running up a bill of hundreds of dollars. The  utility company confirmed the meter reading. The huge bill kept coming, along  with threats of the electricity being disconnected at their new address. A  generous couple loaned them the money to pay the utility company.  </P> <P> Thinking that their problems would be solved if they could just get their three  children baptized in the Catholic Church, Serufino asked us to be the  godparents. We were delighted to do so, wishing that were the solution. On Feb.  28, 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the birth of my grandfather on a poor  farm in Ireland, the Conde children were baptized with our grandchild Katy's  new son, Billy. We were now compadres.  </P> <P> Since Rita had almost died giving birth to Teresa, the Rev. Martinez checked on  her often in March. When he found Rita in labor, he rushed her to the hospital  to give birth by Cesarean. The following week, when the Condes went to visit  their tiny preemie son, Arturo, they were told to take him home, as he had run  up thousands of dollars and they had no insurance.  </P> <P> With Serufino's low wages, and Rita unable to work outside the house, it was  difficult juggling rent, utilities and all the expenses of this growing family.  The electricity was finally turned off. Needing a way to keep their milk from  souring, he ran an extension cord from the refrigerator, down a wall and into  the laundry room of the complex on the floor below. By this time, in order to  pay the rent, they had "sublet" the bedrooms to two other families and they  slept in the living room. Serufino should run a hotel, we kidded.  </P> <P> But we were not surprised when the landlord asked them to leave. It was then  that the couple offered them the use of the former stable -- where they still  live.  </P> <P> Our church gave the Condes groceries at Thanksgiving and a family adopted them  at Christmas, providing toys, clothing and food. They were grateful that so  many people cared about them.  </P> <P> Life was improving until two weeks ago, when Rita wrenched her shoulder while  cleaning the stable. Serufino called us several nights later when she was still  in pain. Convinced she must have stepped on someone's grave, the tiny Oaxacan  Indian tried to treat the muscle spasms by rubbing herself with garlic.  </P> <P> When we took her to the hospital emergency room, the attendants were very kind  to her. The receptionist said they would not turn anyone away because he had no  money. They would mail the bill (for several hundred dollars) to the Condes.  </P> <P> Moments later, the nurse came out to the waiting room and asked Serufino in  front of everyone, "Is she pregnant?"  </P> <P> He nodded and said, "Five months."  </P> <P> I had to leave the room so he wouldn't see me cry.  </P> <P> Back at "home," the painkillers made Rita hallucinate. She thought she was  possessed or that a witch had put a spell on her. When rain leaked into the  shack, her spasms grew worse. Vic decided the only way she could get well was  if we brought her home with us. With pain-killing ointment rubbed onto her  shoulder and a heating pad, she fell asleep in our Mary's bed. After a hot  shower the next morning, Rita could move her arm a little. Knowing I would  understand, since I had seven babies in nine years, she told me this would be  the last child, making a scissors gesture at the sides of her abdomen.  </P> <P> Rita is now well and has found a Spanish-speaking doctor, who we hope will  deliver the baby -- and honor her wish that it be her last. Serufino is back at  work. He has patched the stable walls with plywood, and is building an  outhouse.  </P> <P> Our neighbors donated blankets, furniture and a crib. Chubby Arturo is  thriving. Lucinda is learning English -- and teaching it to her parents. The  Condes still need guidance, a living wage, medical insurance -- and a great  deal more than amnesty.  </P> <P> But these people are survivors. They give me more than I could ever give them.  </P> <P> Little Oscar has a dream. In good weather, he sees red, green and blue hot air  balloons launched near the stable. He announced to his family, "When I get big,  I'm going to buy us our own hot air balloon."  </P> <P> I hope he'll take me up with him.  </P></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK dairy farmers 'to be among highest paid in EC' THE UK'S dairy farmers could be among the highest paid in Europe when the milk market is opened to competition next year, according to Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board. Mr Dare will head Milk Marque, the board's successor, which will be a voluntary farmers' co-operative when it is set up next April. Rules for the new organisation and farmers' contracts are in place, but the new set-up must be approved by the government. The Agriculture bill, which abolished the milk board, received the royal assent yesterday. Mr Dare said he would submit his re-organisation proposals in August with industry consultations expected to begin by the end of September. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the minister of Agriculture, will then probably approve the Milk Marque structure by the end of October. It also has to be given the go-ahead by the European Commission. When Milk Marque was launched, Mr Dare said, he hoped payments to UK farmers would be among the three highest in Europe. 'With more milk going to fresh products than any other country in Europe, we should be near the top of the league on prices, but it would be folly to price milk in this country so high as to attract imports.' But Mr Dare said he had not included any price in his draft contracts to farmers. He was speaking before the final annual meeting of the board in its present form, where farmers were urged to stand united and join Milk Marque once the board disappeared. Milk Marque is hoping to attract more than 80 per cent of dairy farmers, but Mr Dare says the organisation can be viable if it gains as few as 15 per cent. He is offering farmers contracts that enable them to leave the co-operative on three set dates with a year's notice. If farmers leave with three months' notice, they will be liable to pay a penalty equivalent to 2 per cent of their previous year's milk receipts  - or about  1/2 p a litre. Mr Dare is committed to a cost-cutting programme at Milk Marque where he hopes to trim transport costs to 1p a litre from 1.1p and keep overall costs at 1.4p a litre for the next three years, compared with 1.5p this year, in spite of inflation and the loss of some economies of scale. In an effort to save on transport costs, Mr Dare will suggest that milk from some farmers is collected every other day - not every day as at present. But he stresses that this will be only for farmers who have additional storage capacity for the extra milk. Farmers outside England and Wales, for example from Scotland or France, will be able to join Milk Marque, although they may have to pay extra transport costs, says Mr Dare. Milk Marque faces competition for farmers' milk in the free market next year from dairy groups such as Northern Foods and Nestle. In an effort to persuade producers to rally to Milk Marque, Mr Dare points to the risks of tying their fortunes to a single dairy company. For example, Express Dairies' share of the yoghurt market had fallen from 27.1 per cent in 1989 to 15.5 per cent last year, while that of Muller had soared from 4.3 per cent to 17.8 per cent, he notes. Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board's dairy products subsidiary, is to be spun off before next April and Mr Dare says shares will probably go only to current milk producers. Some former producers have threatened legal action if they do not obtain shares, arguing that they have contributed to Dairy Crest in the past through the milk price and capital levies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Vitaliy Churkin, Russian special envoy for </F> former Yugoslavia, Milan Martic, president of the republic of  Serbian Krajina, and Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska  republic, in Belgrade on 16 March; Churkin speaks in English  with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Churkin] On Russia's initiative, official  delegations from Zagreb and Knin will meet in the Russian  Embassy in Zagreb on Tuesday, 22 March, in order to agree on the  cessation of military and other hostilities. Thank you very  much.    [Unidentified correspondent] Does this mean that you want  the Krajina to become a part of the Croatian state?    [Churkin] No, this only means that we want the hostilities  to stop and we want the situation in this area to return to  normal. We hope that such an agreement on the cessation of  hostilities will contribute to an improvement and gradual  normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations, because this is a  very important element for the entire situation in the former  Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]    [Churkin] This was a working meeting, one of many that we  have had in the past year and a half. We discussed the  prospects for a political solution of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in light of the latest events, namely, the  Muslim-Croatian concept of federation. I think that the bottom  line we agreed on was that any kind of future political solution  in Bosnia-Herzegovina must take into account the interests and  sovereign rights of all three constituent peoples in  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. We agreed  that there are still paths to be explored in order to further  the extremely difficult negotiating process.    [Karadzic] We are very satisfied with the fact that it is  clear that the Serbian people have their sovereign rights to the  same extent as the Croats and Muslims; we have, of course,  stressed our need to have special relations with Serbia,  Yugoslavia, that is, and we must look for a solution within this  context, within the context of realizing our sovereign rights  and (?particular) ties; for the time being we do not see a  solution, but we do see the way to it.</p>

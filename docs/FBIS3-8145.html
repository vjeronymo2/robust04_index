Nevertheless, since the independence, this state  has functioned as a national state of the Macedonian people,  says a letter of the (Macedonian) People's Democratic Party  [PDP] addressed to the CSCE Council of Ministers recently.    The Macedonian Constitution and many other laws have thus  discriminated against the Albanian people especially in the  fields of education, culture, and citizenship, the letter  stresses. The Law on Nationality in Macedonia has declared some  100,000 Albanians as persons without nationality.    The government in Macedonia is in general centralized while  local governments do not exist. The central government is made  up almost wholly of ethnic Macedonians with the occasional  symbolic Albanian, although there are some 300 Albanian jurists  looking for work in Macedonia. Non-representation of the  Albanians in the structures of the present government is  justified by the government as being inherited from the past,  the letter says, but this is not convincing because new  institutions, such as diplomacy, are being set up on the basis  of nationalities.</p>

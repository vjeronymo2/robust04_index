			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Seoul and Beijing to announce diplomatic ties today KOREAN WELCOME: a huge South Korean advertising poster, a common sight in Beijing, greets travellers on arrival in the Chinese capital's airport. Agencies report from Seoul. The two countries have long been doing business together, a relationship expected to be cemented today with the official announcement of diplomatic relations. The new ties will signal the end to four decades of cold war hostility, a foreign ministry official said yesterday. 'All the paperwork is ready and the only thing left is the signing of the accord on the 24th (of August),' KBS radio quoted a high ranking foreign ministry official as saying. For South Korea, long-sought diplomatic ties with North Korea's strongest backer are a key step towards its dream of reunifying the peninsula. China's trade links with South Korea expanded to exceed Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.03bn) last year, with trade expected to top Dollars 10bn this year.</p>

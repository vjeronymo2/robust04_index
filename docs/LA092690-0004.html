			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR FORCE CHIEF FIRED FOR REMARKS ON IRAQ STRIKES  </P> <P> Gen. Dugan was fired for candor, for saying in public what is evidently said at  the White House and Pentagon in private. I find this approach to Dugan  stupefying because his nonsensical ideas were his real problem, not his candor.  </P> <P> Crudely put, he argued that the U.S. military lost the Vietnam War because it  was constrained in its use of air power. If these constraints were lifted in a  war against Iraq, the U.S. military could this time obtain a quick and decisive  victory.  </P> <P> Now that Gen. Dugan has time on his hands, I suggest he re-learn the history of  the Vietnam War. His military colleagues, as well as those in the White House,  Congress and the press could also benefit from the same lessons.  </P> <P> In order to "bomb them back to the Stone Age," the U.S. government relied  heavily and ineffectively on massive aerial bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia.  Facing outmoded air defenses, it engaged in carpet bombing of North Vietnam and  totally destroyed rural agriculture in Cambodia. Furthermore, air power was  also used for napalm, Agent Orange and cluster bombs.  </P> <P> The strategy not only failed, it backfired. More than 3,000 planes were shot  down and more than 500 surviving crew members captured. Nevertheless, the  resolve of the Vietnamese was hardened and the chaos we created in Cambodia  brought the Khmer Rouge to power.  </P> <P> Dugan is now gone, but Washington's other born-again hawks ought to mull over  this history before they so eagerly march more young men and women off to war.  </P> <P> DICK PLATKIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

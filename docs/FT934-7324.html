			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Balladur steps into merger row: PM tries to soothe Swedish fears on Renault-Volvo link-up FRANCE'S prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, has written to Mr Carl Bildt, his Swedish counterpart, in an attempt to counter Swedish opposition to the proposed merger between Renault and Volvo's car and truck operations. It is the most significant move so far by the French government in its attempt to win over Swedish shareholders who threaten to vote down the plan to create Europe's second largest automotive group. The Swedish government also confirmed for the first time that it had approached the French government. At Volvo's request it had pressed demands that Paris provide assurances on the timetable for the privatisation of Renault and a commitment not to use a state golden share to force down Volvo's proposed 35 per cent stake in the merged Renault-Volvo company. Details of Mr Balladur's letter were not revealed. But it appeared not to have fully satisfied the Swedish side. Senior officials said the dialogue with Paris would continue. Mr Bildt, who had previously avoided direct involvement in the issue, is understood to have intervened two weeks ago following an appeal from Volvo. The prime minister told Swedish radio yesterday there was 'a strong need for clarification' of the privatisation and golden share issue, the main focus of shareholder concern. He said that without it there was a 'very limited' chance the deal would be approved. The French government has said it plans to privatise the merged group as quickly as possible, with a target date of the second half of next year. It has also promised that the golden share to be retained after privatisation will not be used against Volvo and is designed to protect the merged group from a hostile takeover. But verbal statements have failed to satisfy Volvo shareholders who forced the Swedish group to postpone a vote on the deal until December 7. Continued shareholder resistance and the approach of the deadline have pressed the French government into a concerted effort to reassure Swedish investors. Mr Balladur's letter follows a meeting earlier this week between Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, and Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive. Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chief executive, was also in Sweden yesterday to lobby Volvo shareholders. The merger, and the planned privatisation of the new automotive group, is one of the most important elements of French industrial policy and the government's plan to sell 21 publicly-owned companies.</p>

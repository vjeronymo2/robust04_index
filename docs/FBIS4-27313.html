			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 27 May commentary: "A Shameful Spokesman for </F> Splittist Forces"]    [Text] The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean  puppets are making an attempt to arouse the public opinion by  slandering our reunification formula through a confederal  system, regarding the fact that Yemen, which was reunified four  years ago, has recently entered into a situation of internal  conflict.    Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUM reported in an article regarding the  internal conflict in Yemen that the confederal system -- under  which the North and South would be reunified by leaving their  systems as they are without a political merger on the Korean  peninsula -- is shaky, and that it may even bring about a war.    South Korea's CHOSON ILBO reported that reunification  through  the confederal system would promise [word indistinct] caused by  the internal conflict in the future, and that a war must be  avoided even if the reunification is delayed.    Such assertions by some Japanese and South Korean  newspapers,  as backing sophistry made by splittist forces at home and  abroad, have created obstacles to the reunification of Korea  and, also, are insidious plots to perpetuate national division  and confrontation.    As reported by foreign newspapers, the reason for Yemen's  plunge into a crisis situation today, due to its bloody internal  conflict, is not only because it is reunified without achieving  reconciliation and unity between North and South Yemen, but  because it was not able to guarantee the balance of power or  merge the Armed Forces even after the reunification.  Considering the background of its internal conflict, this will  clearly prove the justification and reasonableness of our  reunification formula through the confederal system.    It is reported that North and South Yemen have reunified  their country based on an agreement between the heads of the two  sides without achieving reconciliation and unity. On the other  hand, our reunification formula through the confederal system  clearly defines an ideological basis and principle of the great  unity of the whole nation for national reunification. This  reunification formula is based on the national sentiment and an  ideology of national independence, as well as plans to establish  a national reunified state embodying the principle of promoting  coexistence, coprosperity, and public interests.    Our reunified state through the confederal system regards  the  common demands and interests of the nation as its basic mission  and, also, is the most reasonable form as a reunified state that  makes it possible to achieve national unity, transcending the  difference of ideas [sasang], ideology [inyom], and systems.    Our reunification formula through the confederal system  gives  the highest priority to the nation over the system and, also, is  the reunified formula deployed based on national ideology.  Therefore, this formula has elucidated the most practical and  reasonable way to realize national reunification by achieving  national reconciliation and unity even under the situations in  which the two different systems exist between the North and  South.    It is also reported that the merge has been made in Yemen  without a structural guarantee that can sufficiently maintain  the balance of political forces representing the North and  South. However, our reunification formula through the  confederal system has prepared a structural guarantee that makes  it possible to establish the national reunified government made  up of the same number of delegates from the North and South  based on the local governments that can fully exercise their  autonomous rights; that enables the North and South to take  turns in operating it and to equally share the function and  authority of the confederal government and local government;  and that makes it possible for other political forces to  equally exercise their rights.    For the governments of the two regions of the North and  South to equally participate in the confederal system guarantees  equality in the two autonomous regions to consolidate national  unity, equally realizes the interests of the two regions in  operating the confederal system, and makes it possible to  achieve common prosperity of the nation. This is a superior and  unique form of a confederal system.    Then, in Yemen, the North and South maintained each other's  forces and the leadership was unified in a situation in which it  was under a separate control. Apart from this, our  reunification method through the confederal system anticipates  that each Army of the North and South be drastically reduced to  100,000-150,000 each; unify each other's Army to organize a  single national united Army; and put this under the unified  command of the confederal government. Therefore, apprehensions  on invasion from the North, invasion from the South, victory  over communism, and communization will disappear, and there is a  military security device to maintain solid peace.    Truly, the fatherland's reunification method through the  confederal system based on one nation, one state, two system,  and two governments, is the most just and practical national  reunification program which makes it possible to most quickly  realize the country's reunification independently and peacefully  without someone not swallowing the other or being swallowed by  the other under the condition in which other ideology and  systems exist in North and South Korea.    As we have seen, there is a fundamental difference in the  principle of reunification, method, and content in the process  of unification in Yemen and our reunification method through the  confederal system. Nevertheless, slandering our reunification  method through the confederal system by unreasonably linking it  with the Yemen situation, without even researching it, stems  from an insidious political goal.    The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets are  opposing our reunification method through the confederal system  to perpetuate Korea's division, and are persistently preventing  peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula.    In connection with the Yemen situation, some media in Japan  and South Korea are slandering our reunification method. This  speaks for the true intention of the insidious forces who want  to perpetuate division.    For the media, which regard justice and truth as life, to  become a tool of the splittists opposing peace and reunification  on the Korean peninsula which the Korean people and the world's  peace- loving people are consistently desiring, is indeed  nothing but a shameful act of tarnishing their own face.    Our reunification method through the confederal system is  receiving a wide range of support and approval from the fellow  countrymen of the North, South, and overseas in its justness and  practicality with each passing day. Splittists at home and  abroad cannot prevent our nation's strong trend which is moving  toward the fatherland's reunification with any kind of schemes,  obstructions, and maneuvers.    Through united strength, our nation will eliminate barriers  and difficulties lying ahead in the road of the fatherland's  reunification, and realize the country's reunification without  fail according to the reunification method through the  confederal system.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SABERHAGEN'S FUND-RAISER TO BENEFIT TEAM  </P> <P> The inaugural Bret Saberhagen golf tournament, a fund-raiser for the baseball  team at his alma mater, Cleveland High, has been set for Feb. 3 at the  Knollwood Golf Course in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Saberhagen, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, is expected to be joined by  several major leaguers, including fellow Kansas City Royal pitcher Mark  Gubicza, who lives in Porter Ranch.  </P> <P> Fees for the tournament, which include golf, electric cart and a steak dinner,  are $60 per person. Tournament organizers also are looking for corporate  sponsors.  </P> <P> Information: Cleveland assistant Coach Marty Siegel, 818-342-2580.  </P> <P> Freddie Bradley, Sean Cheevers and Tom Briggs of Moorpark College and Sam  Edwards of Valley were named to the 1989 JC Athletic Bureau Coaches'  All-Southern California football team.  </P> <P> Bradley, a freshman tailback, led the Western State Conference in rushing  yardage (1,334) and touchdowns (24) this season. Cheevers, a sophomore kicker,  converted 44 of 50 extra-point attempts and 12 of 15 field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> Briggs, a linebacker who has also been chosen an All-American by the JC  Athletic Bureau, had 37 tackles behind the line of scrimmage, including 20 1/2  quarterback sacks. He was voted the Southern California co-Defensive Player of  the Year.  </P> <P> Edwards had a WSC-leading eight interceptions for Valley.  </P> <P> Moorpark quarterback Jayson Merrill and three teammates -- offensive tackle  Kevin Elder, linebacker Jeff Lujan and defensive back Troy Thomas -- were  second-team selections.  </P> <P> Eric Wynalda, a former Westlake High standout who now plays soccer at San Diego  State, was one of 28 players invited Tuesday to report to the U. S. national  soccer team's training camp when it regroups Friday to prepare for the World  Cup.  </P> <P> Wynalda, a forward, holds the Westlake career scoring record and led the  Warriors to a 22-2-2 record as a senior in the 1986-87 season. He was invited  along with six players who were on the U. S. national "B" team last year.  </P> <P> The core of the team that helped the United States qualify for the World Cup  for the first time in 40 years will be at the training camp, but U. S. Coach  Bob Gansler is looking for scoring help. The Americans had just 10 goals in 11  games last year.  </P> <P> "We certainly are going to attempt to augment our roster to improve in any way  we can," Gansler said.  </P> <P> The U. S. team next plays Feb. 2 against Uruguay in the Marlboro Cup of Miami.  It plays either Colombia or Costa Rica in Miami on Feb. 4 and the Soviet Union  on Feb. 24 at Stanford.  </P></p>

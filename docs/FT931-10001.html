			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Share sale bolsters CH Bailey SALES OF investments, mainly the disposal of part of its stake in Bristol Channel Ship Repairers, produced a Pounds 1.24m credit for CH Bailey in the 28 weeks to October 9. The company returned to profit to the tune of Pounds 773,250. Sales rose some 12 per cent from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 2.34m, but margins remained slim. The corresponding period saw a Pounds 305,600 loss. Mr Christopher Bailey, chairman of both Bailey and Bristol Channel, in which CH Bailey retains an 8 per cent stake, also voiced his opposition to the Cardiff Bay barrage bill. He said that if the scheme, which is being considered in the House of Lords, was sanctioned it would make shiprepairing at the Bute dry dock impossible.</p>

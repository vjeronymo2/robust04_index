			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Four-fold rise in Merloni payout Shareholders in Merloni, the Italian white goods company, yesterday awarded themselves a four-fold increase in their ordinary share dividend, following a year in which the group's net profits rose to more than L32bn (Dollars 19.9m), compared with L1.6bn in 1992. The shareholder assembly approved a dividend of L80 per ordinary share, against L20 in 1992, and L100 for each savings share, up from L50. The company also announced that it had been granted a Dollars 100m medium-term credit line by a consortium of Italian and foreign banks, headed by Banca di Roma, Swiss Bank Corporation, and Union Bank of Switzerland. It said that in the first quarter of 1994, consolidated turnover and operating margins had grown by 20 per cent, compared with the same period last year. In 1993, turnover increased by 34 per cent to L1,755bn from L1,306bn. Merloni's recovery, heralded in February, was based on higher margins, partly due to the lower foreign exchange rate of the lira and the one-off effect on 1992 earnings of a L24bn foreign exchange loss.</p>

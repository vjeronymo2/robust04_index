			<p>BFN     [Text] Katowice, May 3 -- Freedom Union leader Tadeusz  Mazowiecki said during a Tuesday press conference in Katowice  that the cause of the present tensions in Poland is the "policy  of procrastination of the government, which has not taken up its  own standpoint in light of many problems." He added that the  "political echos of the present strike wave are not subject to  doubt." According to Mazowiecki the "way to resolve the present  problems in the country is to clearly define the standpoint of  the government towards the most important national economic and  social affairs."    When speaking about the strike wave, the Freedom Union  leader  said that he wonders why "those who now say that they are  striking in the name of Solidarity in support of the state  enterprise pact not so long ago undermined a government which  created the pact." According to Mazowiecki, "it is unjust that  all of society suffer due to a strike staged by a narrow social  group such as that of the coal miners in Belchatow."</p>

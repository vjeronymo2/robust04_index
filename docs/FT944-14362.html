			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Clinton ventures abroad in search of votes: Diplomacy can't do Democrats any harm President Bill Clinton's decision to spend nearly a week on diplomacy in the Middle East, rather than on the search for votes in the American midwest may not hurt the Democratic party in mid-term elections now only 16 days away. Mr Clinton himself, yesterday winding up a west coast campaign trip in which he has been more warmly received than in earlier excursions, said he detected some improvement in party fortunes. The president certainly appeared more confident and relaxed than for some weeks, eloquently expressing his opposition both to the California referendum on illegal immigration and to the conclusions of the controversial new book linking race and intelligence. Some prominent endangered Democrats, like Senator Edward Kennedy in Massachusetts and Senator Dianne Feinstein in California, do appear to have re-established leads. But the prospect for substantial Republican gains in Congress and in governorships remains strong. The polling evidence to bolster Mr Clinton's belief remains mixed. Two surveys at the end of last week showed his own standing had received a boost from foreign policy achievements such as Haiti, Iraq and North Korea but that confidence in his management of domestic policy and in his character remained low. Even Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican leader, conceded in a television interview yesterday that 'they've been better (at foreign policy) in the last six weeks than at any time in the administration'. But three polls also found that for the first time since the Truman presidency Republicans held a sizeable edge over Democrats among likely voters. In sharp contrast to 1992, when discontent with 'gridlock' in Washington helped unseat President George Bush, the surveys found Americans more comfortable with the idea that if one party held the presidency, the other should have control of Congress. Administration officials, only too well aware of the sour and introspective mood of the electorate, have been careful not to make too explicit a connection between foreign policy and the elections. President Clinton's weekly radio broadcast on Saturday, for example, was exclusively devoted to domestic issues, principally education, and to an attack on alternative Republican policies. Mrs Madeleine Albright, the ambassador to the UN, yesterday cast the president's decision to go to the Middle East solely in foreign policy terms. 'In no way does it impede the political process going on here,' she added. A somewhat different twist was given by Mr David Gergen, the formerly influential White House aide now virtually invisible as a counsellor at the state department. 'I think this foreign policy will have precious little to do with the election results,' he said in a weekend TV interview. But, he added, 'I think the American people want to know he (the president) has a strong effective foreign policy ...when they sense that's not happening, it could cut the heart out of your presidency.' Still, he said there was no substitute for delivering the goods on domestic policy. The principal Republican campaign aim is also to emphasise domestic issues. Yesterday they were claiming to have found a 'smoking gun' in the shape of a leaked memorandum to the president from Dr Alice Rivlin, the White House budget director. The memorandum, which Dr Rivlin and other White House officials said was merely an hypothetical discussion document without specific recommendations, pointed out that Mr Clinton might find have to cut social spending and increase taxes in order to continue to reduce the deficit. This was enough for Mr William Kristol, a leading Republican strategist, to charge that it was 'craven hypocrisy' for the administration to allege that the Republicans intended to slash medicare and social security as a means of achieving the balanced budget. The vigour of the Republican response may reflect awareness that its own heavily promoted 'contract with America,' mostly unfinished business from the Reagan presidency, seems to be making little headway with the electorate. One poll found that 70 per cent had never heard of it, while some Democratic candidates have used it to paint their opponents as captives of the extreme right. The overwhelmingly negative tone of so many individual campaigns continues to dominate the election. A successful Clinton visit to the Middle East, including Syria, might not appear likely to sway many minds but any diversion from domestic mudslinging might be beneficial.</p>

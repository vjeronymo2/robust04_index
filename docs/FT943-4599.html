			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Gas industry and users step up call for legislation The gas industry and consumer groups yesterday stepped up their lobbying efforts to persuade the government to include a new bill on gas in the Queen's Speech this autumn. Utilicorp, the US group which has established joint ventures with a number of regional electricity groups, said that 'scaremongering' by British Gas had 'meant that the benefits of competition have been obscured'. A report entitled 'Gas: The Final Act' said continuing uncertainty about whether the government remained committed to the timetable to open up the domestic market was causing big problems for independent gas marketing companies. The uncertainty meant that they were putting off investment decisions that needed to be taken to prepare for the phased opening of the household market for gas from 1996. The Consumers Association appealed to the government for legislative action. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, the association said: 'A truly competitive market . . . is the best spur to quality improvement and lower prices.' British Gas said it was committed to the introduction of competition. But legislation had to be 'introduced on an equal basis . . . so that everyone shares the social obligations currently undertaken by British Gas'. A cabinet sub-committee is to meet later this month under the chairmanship of Mr Heseltine to decide whether to include the bill on gas in the legislative agenda. Political support in the government and the Conservative party for gas competition has been undermined in recent months by fears that many consumers might face sharp price rises in the transition to competition. This would result from British Gas moving away from uniform pricing to that which reflected the actual costs of serving individual customers. The company says its biggest and best-paying customers subsidise those which have poor payment records or use small amounts of gas. Gas industry executives believe advisers to Mr John Major, the prime minister, are the biggest stumbling block to inclusion of the bill. The advisers are said to fear the political consequences of higher gas prices for some consumers.</p>

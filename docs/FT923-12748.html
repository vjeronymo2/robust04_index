			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Letter: Bankruptcy facing BCCI customer Sir, While efforts are being made on behalf of Bank of Credit and Commerce International shareholders to mitigate their losses, there are many like myself who personally guaranteed their company overdrafts and are now being pursued by the BCCI liquidator, Touche Ross, with personal bankruptcy and loss of our homes. I ran my company on a professional basis and within the terms of our loans. In our particular circumstances we had a negligence case against BCCI, but owing to the bank's demise we are unable to pursue it. Through our professional advisers, we have submitted to Touche Ross our sworn statements of affairs which are evidence of our means. While these are less that the total indebtedness, they do reflect the true situation. The response from Touche Ross, however, is no negotiation and a demand for full and immediate repayment within seven days or it will pursue for repossession of our home and place us in personal bankruptcy. If Touche Ross proceeds with personal bankruptcy petitions and repossession of our home, it will achieve less than the offer on the table. Where is the logic? Where is the moral code? Our professional advisers are appalled by Touche Ross's stance. I do not believe that Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi would support such an approach, nor do I believe those who are in a position of influence in the UK will allow such actions to continue.

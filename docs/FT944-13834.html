			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Hamilton forced out by 'foul rumour' Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate affairs minister, said last night that he had been forced to quit the government by 'foully motivated rumour and a media witchhunt'. Mr Hamilton said in a bitter letter to Mr John Major that the events surrounding the prime minister's demand that he leave the government were 'sad and deeply disturbing'. He said he had conducted himself with 'integrity and due regard for propriety and probity' and had received no payments from Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods. Mr Hamilton thanked Mr Major for confirming in the Commons that allegations of impropriety made against him were unsubstantiated. He said he would clear his name. In his response Mr Major said he was sorry for the way Mr Hamilton's ministerial career had ended and praised his work at the Department of Trade and Industry. He said: 'I am grateful to you for the readiness with which you recognised that it was impossible for you to continue in government in the circumstances.' The letters were released amid a mixture of relief among mainstream Conservatives and anger among rightwingers. MPs on all sides were confused by the day's events. Initially it was assumed Mr Hamilton had been forced to quit because of a defiant statement issued to newspapers in his Cheshire constituency. The prime minister's disclosure to the Commons that he had agreed to resign because of the impact of fresh allegations made on Monday stunned MPs. At no time yesterday did Mr Major detail the new allegations against Mr Hamilton, but senior government sources confirmed they did not relate to Mr Hamilton's connection with Mr Fayed. Mr John Carlisle, the MP for Luton North, said: 'The prime minister is attempting to resurrect a situation which has gone a bit out of control, but I don't agree with the way he has gone about it.' Mr Alan Duncan, another rightwinger, said: 'He was a colourful and a competent minister. There is a sad irony that he has gone on the day that the spotlight has moved to the questionable conduct of the man who accused him.' Mr Hamilton, a witty rightwinger, had earlier appeared determined to fight on against allegations that he asked Commons questions for Mr Fayed in return for cash and a week at the Paris Ritz. In a statement issued in his constituency he said he was dismayed by the 'wild and false accusations' against him - comments regarded by most Tory MPs as typically robust. But there was widespread dismay and embarrassment about his reasons for refusing to leave office to pursue a libel action against The Guardian. He said: 'Of course I could resign and fight a libel action from the back benches. But the same argument could have applied to the prime minister in respect of his action against the scurrilous Scallywag magazine, or against other ministers who have fought libel actions. 'There is no reason whatsoever why a minister of the crown should not remain in office whilst undertaking libel proceedings. Indeed the prime minister did just that - and quite rightly so,' he said. Many Tory MPs were aghast at his reference to Mr Major's successful libel action against the New Statesman magazine, which reported unfounded allegations in Scallywag that the prime minister had had an extra-marital affair. When it emerged in mid-morning that Mr Hamilton had cancelled an engagement and was returning to London it was widely assumed that he was about to be sacked for issuing the statement without government approval. In fact, Mr Hamilton was summoned by Mr Richard Ryder, government chief whip. He was informed of the fresh allegations and agreed to quit.</p>

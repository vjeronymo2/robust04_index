			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Soviet Politburo commission blamed most of the 25,000 deaths in Armenia's  earthquake last Dec. 7 on shoddy construction and turned its findings over to  prosecutors to "file criminal charges and bring those responsible to account,"  the official Tass news agency reported. "The catastrophic consequences of the  earthquake in Armenia are explained above all by the low quality of the  building and assembly work, by the inadmissible violation of design norms and  the strength of underground tremors," Tass said. The report ended an  investigation that began after the earthquake, which was measured at a  magnitude of 6.9. The Politburo commission was headed by Premier Nikolai I.  Ryzhkov.  </P></p>

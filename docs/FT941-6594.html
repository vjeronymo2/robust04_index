			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Brent Walker loan moves proceed Lenders to William Hill, the betting shop business owned by Brent Walker, should be repaid today, the date their Pounds 325m loan is due. The repayment follows the refinancing of the loan by banks to Brent Walker, with Standard Chartered and Lloyds Bank each lending significant amounts. Without the refinancing, Brent Walker would have had to sell or float Hill. Bankers now admit that if Hill had been sold Brent Walker would almost certainly have gone into receivership. Changes to Brent Walker's Pounds 827m term loan agreement have been accepted by lenders. Last Friday holders of the group's variable rate notes agreed to changes in their conditions, including the payment of interest in preference shares for a longer period. Of the Pounds 83m of notes outstanding, votes were received from Pounds 74m, with 99.998 per cent voting in favour. The notes were created at the time of Brent Walker's refinancing in March 1992, when they were exchanged for Pounds 101.9m of convertible bonds issued in autumn 1990. Many of the bonds were held by Brent Walker banks, but some had originally been bought by investors found by Mr George Walker, who was chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker at the time the bonds were issued. There were no positive abstentions from note holders, as there have been previously, but it is understood that Lonrho and Tunis International Bank were among those not voting. Bankers said that last week there were fears that the William Hill lenders might have to be asked for a few days grace before the loan was repaid, but hitches had been sorted out in time.</p>

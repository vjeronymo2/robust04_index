			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Dentists vote to freeze NHS lists MORE THAN 25m patients not already registered with a dentist will find it harder to get NHS treatment and may have to pay for private treatment, after dentists voted for partial withdrawal from the National Health Service. The dentists are responding to government plans to cut their fees by 7 per cent from tomorrow. Some are likely to withdraw from NHS work altogether. Two-thirds of members voted in separate ballots of two dentists' associations, the results of which were announced yesterday, and neither of which is binding. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday urged dentists to think 'long and hard' before taking action which would jeopardise NHS dental treatment. She pledged to take 'all necessary steps' to safeguard NHS dental services. Members of the 16,000-strong British Dental Association voted to stop taking all new NHS patients - including children and people on low incomes who would be eligible for free NHS treatment. A proposal to remove adult NHS patients from members' lists was defeated, with 55 per cent voting against. The 4,000 members of the General Dental Practitioners' Association voted to withdraw all NHS services from patients not entitled to free treatment. There is unlikely to be a rapid exodus from the NHS, with both associations warning against hasty action. Scope to opt out of the NHS may also be limited in some areas, where private practice may not be viable. The BDA described the future of NHS dentistry as 'bleak', and both associations appealed to the government to avert the crisis. Dentists' leaders said the government was effectively privatising NHS dentistry by forcing practitioners out of the health service through the cuts in fees. Mrs Bottomley said she regretted the dentists' ballot decisions in reply to an emergency question in the Commons from Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow health secretary. Detailed arrangements for a 'fundamental review' would be announced shortly, she said. It would aim to 'find a system which is fair to dentists, fair to patients and fair to the NHS'. The government claims the fee cuts are needed because dentists are earning more than the target income set by the doctors' and dentists' pay review body. Dentists' negotiators say earnings have risen because they have registered more patients and that cuts will lead to bankruptcies. Dentists take preventive action, Page 7</p>

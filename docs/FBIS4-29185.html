			<p>BFN     [Text] While ruling and opposition parties waged their  political battle -- over such issues as a possible no-confidence  motion against the Hata Cabinet -- with the current Diet session  set to close 29 June, ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a survey by  interview of all House of Representatives members to hear their  views on questions like the dissolution of the House for a  general election and the no-confidence motion against the  cabinet.    On the focal issue of a no-confidence motion against the  cabinet, the survey results that reflected the current chaotic  political situation. While almost equal numbers of Diet members  supported and opposed the motion, over 20 percent said they  still cannot decide their position on it.    Asked what the Hata Cabinet should do after the 1994 budget  is approved, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito members  insisted that a next general election should be held only under  the new electoral district system. But nearly 60 percent of  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] members said that either the House of  Representative should be dissolved for an election under the  current medium electoral district system or the Hata Cabinet  should resign en masse.    The interview results showed that the members' opinions were  also divided over the question of future political realignment.  For example, while a majority of SDPJ members favored a  tripolar political system, nearly 90 percent of Shinseito and  Komeito members were in favor of a two-party system.    When asked what the Hata Cabinet should do after the passage  of the budget, which is expected to take place around 24 June,  15 percent of the Diet members said: "The House of  Representatives must be immediately dissolved. We have no  choice but to hold an election under the current system."  Twenty-three percent said: "The election should be conducted  under the new system." Moreover, 21 percent of Diet members,  mostly from Shinseito and Komeito, said that while the next  election should be conducted under the new system, "the house  should not be dissolved before the end of this year," in view of  the fact that the government faces so many tasks at home and  abroad and that the "non-LDP" camp is not prepared for the next  election. In addition, 29 percent of respondents, mostly from  the LDP and SDPJ, gave "other opinions," most of which were  those seeking the cabinet's resignation.    Broken down by the political parties, in the LDP, 40 percent  -- the largest proportion -- gave "other opinions"; 19 percent  favored "an election under the current system"; while 23  percent, mostly the advocates of the new system within the  party, favored "an election under the new system." In the SDPJ,  26 percent supported "an election under the current system," 24  percent favored "an election under the new system," and 30  percent gave "other opinions." The results show views in these  two parties are diverse.    Asked "what will you do if a no-confidence motion on the  cabinet is presented," the number who said they would support or  oppose it was almost the same. Among those who gave "other  opinions," most were of the view that they will have to wait and  see. For example, former SDPJ Chairman Sadao Yamahana said:  "Our stand on the motion will be decided depending on who will  submit the motion and for what reason." As such, it appears  likely that whether the no-confidence motion will pass or not  will come to depend on how this group of people will move.    Asked about the way the next coalition government should be  formed in case the Hata Cabinet resigns, Diet members responded  in diverse manners. A little less than 20 percent said it  should be "a coalition with the SDPJ back," "a government led by  the current coalition with part of the LDP and the SDPJ  participating," or "a caretaker government." Almost 10 percent  said it should be "an LDP-led government" or "a coalition  comprised of the LDP, the SDPJ, and Sakigake."    About 60 percent of the Diet members of Shinseito and  Komeito  wanted it to be "a continuation of the current coalition with  part of the LDP and SDPJ added to it," indicating their strong  desire to only "reorganize" the current coalition. Nearly half  of the SDPJ members said they wanted the SDPJ to return to the  coalition. The LDP members naturally wanted to control the new  government. Some of them also replied in favor of "a  conservative and moderate government led by the LDP" and "an  alliance of conservatives led by the LDP and Shinseito."</p>

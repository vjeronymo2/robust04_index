			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY STUDIED AS YOUTH ESCAPES CUSTODY 2ND TIME  </P> <P> A day after the second escape in as many months by the same youth, authorities  at County Juvenile Hall on Thursday launched a review of security at the  detention facility.  </P> <P> "We are doing an internal review to look at the circumstances of the escape,"  said Rod Speer, a spokesman for the Orange County Probation Department, which  helps administer Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> Ryan Neale, 18, of Los Alamitos and Baldomero Diaz, 17, broke out at 7:45 p.m.  Wednesday by scaling one 16-foot chain link fence and crawling under a loose  section of another, said Mack Jenkins, the facility's assistant director. Diaz  was awaiting sentencing for attempted murder.  </P> <P> They were last seen wearing the facility-issued dark blue T-shirts and sweat  pants as they ran from the facility toward the Santa Ana River Trail, Sheriff's  Lt. Jay Mendez said.  </P> <P> Neale, who was waiting a transfer to a California Youth Authority center in  Norwalk, had escaped Aug. 17, but was quickly recaptured, Speer said.  </P> <P> "He has been in Juvenile Hall repeatedly for numerous sentences over a period  of years," Speer said, but he declined to say why.  </P> <P> Neale is described as 5 feet, 8 inches tall, weighing about 160 pounds with  short-cropped red hair and hazel eyes. Diaz is described as 5-foot-9, about 150  pounds with black hair and brown eyes.  </P> <P> Speer said that the department has alerted sheriff's officers and other police  agencies in the county. Authorities are especially anxious to find Diaz, who is  considered more dangerous.  </P> <P> Speer encouraged anyone with possible information leading to the recapture of  the fugitives to call the Sheriff's Department at (714) 647-7000 or a local  police agency.  </P></p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Further cuts at MK Electric THE CUTS in RTZ Corporation's UK workforce are to continue with 540 job losses at its MK Electric subsidiary, which makes plugs, sockets and circuit protection equipment, Kenneth Gooding writes. That represents more than 20 per cent of the workforce of 2,600. Two factories in Edmonton, north London, bear the brunt of the cuts, as 330 jobs will go this year and one plant will close. The rest of the 410 job losses this year are at factories in Essex  - at Southend and Basildon  - and MK's head office, which will cut its workforce by 130 in the next two years. This is the second substantial cut in jobs at MK.</p>

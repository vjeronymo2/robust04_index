			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (16): A new channel every month - Broadcasting, technology has made the old laws irrelevant / Emine Usaklgil explains how satellites have provided the loophole that has been exploited and led to 'media shock' IN THE past three months, Ahmet Ozal, the 36-year-old son of Turkey's president, has spent between Dollars 20m and Dollars 30m on launching a new television channel. Every now and then, questions are asked about how he put together this money. His answer - by successful use of bank credits and oil trading - is as striking as the phenomenon he has come to symbolise, the explosion taking place in Turkey's air waves. The young Ozal's new venture, Channel 6, is his second foray into television. In 1990, he was one of the founders of Star, the first private channel in Turkey; and, although he and his partners later split up, his initiative carved a route which others have since followed. In 1989, there were a mere three channels, all run by the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT). Today there are 11, with new channels being launched at a current rate of one a month. This 'media shock', as it is dubbed by Jeffi Medina, president of the prominent advertising agency, Manajans/Thompson, means that the number of private channels has already reached six, while the five state channels include one broadcasting to the Turkic Republics of Central Asia. This rapid growth is not the result of deregulation. Instead, technology has made the laws of the past irrelevant. The 1982 Constitution gives the TRT a monopoly on establishing television and radio stations; but, under a 1924 law, all telecommunications services in Turkey are the exclusive preserve of the Turkish PTT. As now interpreted, this means that the PTT alone has the right to operate landlines and telecommunications satellites serving Turkey, and it is the PTT which leases channels and transponders from Intelsat and Eutelsat and which controls licenses for TVROs. The TRT's eight transmitter directorates are connected to the PTT which established a Radio and Television Department in January 1989. However, neither the PTT nor the TRT can stop broadcasts from satellites with a footprint covering Turkey - and this is the loophole exploited by Turkey's new channels. The present government has promised to amend the constitution and law to allow private-sector broadcasting. In common with many promised areas of reform, progress has been slow. But, as one television executive says: 'The present situation suits all the present players. The government has more potential control over us than it would if clear regulation existed. The broadcasters are able to proceed without interference, with several potential new entrants discouraged.' Most prominent among those waiting for a clearer legal structure is the planned joint venture of Turkey's Koc Group and Time Warner. Apart from Show TV (a joint venture of the banker Erol Aksoy and Hurriyet and Sabah newspapers), those already in the field are: the Uzan family's Interstar and Teleon; HBO, in joint venture with the Has Group; Ahmet Ozal's Channel 6; and Istanbul Municipality's BRT. In radio, a similar mushrooming has occurred. In the provincial city of Denizli alone, four small radio stations have been set up. All this means that Turkey's viewers no longer have to rely on the sedate diet fed to them by the TRT. Instead, the new channels offer a glitzy reflection of the consumer society which has burgeoned in Turkey's major cities. They are pushy, slick and dominated by dubbed US programmes and quiz and talk shows. Local programming is limited. This is particularly so in news and current affairs, where Show TV's fortnightly 32nd Day, produced by Mehmet Ali Birand, stands head and shoulders above the dull rest. Educational programmes and documentaries are conspicuous by their absence. However, doubts exist about the financial viability of many of the stations. Few controlled their set-up costs, and now there are too many stations fighting for the advertiser's dollar. Even if it is rising fast, per capita advertising expenditure is a mere Dollars 10-12 a year, compared with Dollars 150-200 in western Europe. In this situation, advertisers are beginning to become selective. Rating agencies, though inadequate, confirm that Show leads the field with over 25 per cent of the audience, followed by Interstar, with Channel 6 attracting less than 10 per cent. Stations like Interstar seem to depend largely on in-group advertising, and zapping has become the bogey of the moment. The advertising world has suddenly woken up to the way that viewers are no longer sitting passively when the commercial break comes, but switching from channel to channel. The dynamism in this area is not yet matched where cable television is concerned. A cable television infrastructure was to be completed by July 1992, connecting 2m subscribers in 10 cities. Today, less than 30,000 homes are connected. The surge in television advertising has hit the newspaper industry. In the first nine months of 1992, this received 52 per cent of the advertising expenditure, compared with 57 per cent in 1990. Overall circulation and readership remain among the lowest in western Europe. However, the division between television and newspaper companies is becoming progressively blurred. Sabah, a founding partner in Show, is now establishing its own channel, Satel. Hurriyet, also a founding partner in Show, has established its own production company. Of the major newspapers, only Milliyet has yet to declare its interest or show its hand. For the smaller newspapers, the outlook is bleak. Advertisers are being increasingly offered cross-media packages. As a result, small may be beautiful, but it is also progressively lonely. Meanwhile, a telemarketing channel is about to be launched - by Ahmet Ozal. The author of this article, formerly managing director of Cumhuriyet newspaper, is now managing director of IF film production and distribution agency.</p>

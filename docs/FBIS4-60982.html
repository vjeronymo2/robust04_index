			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KYRGYZKABAR-TASS correspondent Albert Bogdanov] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 3 May TASS -- "Russia's main interest in  Central Asia and in Transcaucasia is peace," speaker of the  upper chamber of the Russian parliament Vladimir Shumeyko told a  press conference here on Monday [2 May] after the signing of an  agreement on interparliamentary cooperation between Russia and  Kyrgyzstan. Russian troops in the Caucasian conflict zone serve  only as a disengagement buffer between the conflicting sides.  In Shumeyko's opinion, any "war between two CIS nations is an  obstacle to the development of the Commonwealth of Independent  States as a whole."    Speaker of the Kyrgyz parliament Medetkan Sherimkulov added:  "We cannot leave Russia to deal with the Karabakh problem alone.  We must prevent it from being accused of imperial designs when  it tries to restore peace in this area by its own means. Of  course, we are aware of Russia's interest in the republics of  the former Soviet Union. But today Russia can rely not only on  its own forces. Its efforts are now correctly assessed in all  the states of our commonwealth."    Asked about the plans for achieving peace, Shumeyko said:  "The MPS are unanimous that the problem should be solved as a  single whole." Shumeyko indicated three settlement stages:  complete end of hostilities, withdrawal of all the troops from  the conflict zone, and conclusion of a peace treaty. "The status  of Nagorno-Karabakh can be determined only after that," he  stated.    Shumeiko, together with his counterpart Medetkan  Sherimkulov,  flew to the southern part of the republic today to visit  districts hit by a recent natural calamity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Kamal] </F>   [Text] The Sudanese opposition factions have agreed to  form a government in exile to be headed by Faruq Abu-'Isa,  chairman of the Arab Lawyers Federation. Lieutenant General  Fathi Muhammad 'Ali al-Muqim assumes the post of president.    The Sudanese factions distributed the ministerial portfolios  among themselves and without publicity in order not to cause new  problems among them. The arrangement agreed upon recently will  prepare the way for an expanded meeting in which the names that  occupy what is called "the grouping committee" [hay'at  al-tajammu'] will be announced.</p>

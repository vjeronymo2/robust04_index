			<p>940429 FT  29 APR 94 / MoD criticised on costing of projects The National Audit Office has found that the Ministry of Defence is too optimistic about the timing and cost of large defence projects. According to the government watchdog's report, most projects miss their budgets because of unforeseen technical difficulties or underestimation of costs by the MoD. It concludes that the ministry should pay more attention to the early stages of projects, to obtain a more accurate picture of final costs. A particular focus of concern is mid-life updates of existing equipment such as the Tornado and Sea Harrier aircraft, Challenger 1 tank and Trafalgar class submarines. Here the MoD has underestimated the risks arising from over-ambitious aims and over-optimistic cost estimates.</p>

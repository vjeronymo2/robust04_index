			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Life company fined Pounds 50,000 for 'churning' client policies THE LIFE company Cannon Assurance has been fined Pounds 50,000 and ordered to pay compensation for 'churning' customer policies, the first time regulators have been able to prove such a charge. Allegations of policy 'churning' have been rife in the life assurance industry for years. Churning occurs when sales agents urge a client to cash in an existing policy after a short time and replace it with another. Cannon, based in Wembley, north London, has also been ordered to pay the costs of the investigation, believed to be about Pounds 50,000. Mr Eugene McCormack, the company's marketing director, declined to reveal the cost of paying compensation to clients except to say: 'There were quite a number of people involved.' The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation, a US financial services group based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. It has about 250,000 policies in force and Pounds 500m in assets under management. Lautro said that Cannon had co-operated fully with the investigation, which covered activities between June 1989 and June 1991, and said it had taken steps to correct the problem. For sales agents, churning is lucrative because they earn commission on each new policy they sell. However, for clients, because such commissions are deducted from the premiums paid in the initial years of a policy contract, cancellations before maturity often result in losses. 'Churning is legendary within the industry but it is difficult to spot and much more difficult to prove,' said Mr Michael Abrahams, head of compliance at Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry which conducted the investigation and imposed the fine. In the case of Cannon, regulators were able to spot churning because one group of sales agents was said to have encouraged the clients of another group of Cannon sales agents to cancel their existing policies. Mr McCormack said the matter had come to the attention of Cannon's senior management around the time of a Lautro review. Lautro also found that Cannon had allowed individuals who had not yet been formally licensed to sell its policies and had failed to monitor properly the activities of its tied agents. Tied agents sell the products of one company exclusively but are not employed by it directly.</p>

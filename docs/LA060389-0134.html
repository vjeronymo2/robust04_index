			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> EDISON'S TAYLOR LEARNS A LESSON WHILE QUALIFYING IN 1,600  </P> <P> Edison High School freshman Shelley Taylor learned a quick lesson about the  quality of competition found at the State track and field championships Friday  night at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Her teacher? Rancho Buena Vista's Kira Jorgensen.  </P> <P> Running in a preliminary heat of the girls' 1,600 meters, Jorgensen, the  two-time defending State champion at 1,600 meters and a two-time national  champion in cross-country, cruised to an easy victory in 4 minutes 55.44  seconds.  </P> <P> Athletes who won their heat, plus the next five fastest overall, qualified for  tonight's finals, beginning at Cerritos College at 5 p.m.  </P> <P> Taylor, who despite being in her first year of competitive running had not lost  a 1,600-meter race since mid-April, could only watch as Jorgensen loped away at  the start for a commanding lead. Taylor started out in mid-pack and eventually  made her way to second, where she finished in 4:58.77, a half-second personal  improvement and good enough to qualify for tonight's final.  </P> <P> Taylor's improvement, her fourth in as many races, didn't seem to satisfy her,  though.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel great in the race," she said. "I guess I put a lot of pressure  on myself (to win). I think I expect too much out of myself sometimes."  </P> <P> Although Taylor wasn't impressed with her finish, Jorgensen certainly was. Said  Jorgensen: "She's not depressed is she? She should be proud of herself,  especially making it this far as a freshman. I never made it to State finals as  a freshman."  </P> <P> In the boys' 1,600, Mater Dei's Mike Nielsen advanced with a third-place finish  in his heat in 4:15.05, the fifth-fastest time overall. Nielsen, who last year  did not advance past the Southern Section preliminaries, started out in  mid-pack, then gradually worked his way into fourth.  </P> <P> With 200 meters to go, Nielsen, trying to maintain his crisp, efficient stride,  charged to third and then tried to catch Burbank's Todd Lewis and Arroyo  Grande's Louie Quintana but could not. Lewis won in 4:12.66, and Quintana was  second in 4:13.00.  </P> <P> "I felt pretty good," Nielsen said. "I think I have a lot left. They went by me  and beat me fair and square."  </P> <P> Corona del Mar's Eddie Lavelle finished a surprising and disappointing eighth  in his 1,600 heat and did not advance. Lavelle, who has a best time -- and  county-leading time -- of 4:11.95, came through the first 300 meters fourth  from last but worked his way into what appeared to be a comfortable third.  </P> <P> But with 200 meters to go, Lavelle faded and, without a kick, dropped to  eighth. After the race, he walked off the track with a noticeable limp, his  left shin bleeding from spike marks.  </P> <P> After a disappointing finish in the long jump, Canyon's Allison Franke  qualified in her specialty, the discus, with a toss of 151-feet-10, fourth best  overall. Franke, who fouled twice in the long jump before leaping 17-7, made up  for the disappointment with an discus series of 151-5, 151-10 and 150-8.  Bakersfield's Melisa Weis leads the field at 163-9, her first and only throw of  the night.  </P> <P> In the girls' shotput, Irvine's Bev Oden advanced with a mark of 40-9,  eighth-best overall. Edison's Leslee Briggs, the county's season leader at  41-11 1/2, fouled on two of her three attempts. Her only legal mark was 39-8,  which tied her for tenth. Only 2 3/4 inches separated Briggs from advancing to  tonight's final.  </P> <P> In the girls' high jump, El Dorado's Lori Svoboda advanced with a leap of 5-6.  That mark tied her for first with defending state champion Crissy Mills of  North Hollywood Campbell Hall. Svoboda, who defeated Mills last Friday to win  the Masters title, passed on the first three heights, cleared 5-4 on her first  attempt, passed at 5-5 and cleared 5-6 again on her first try. Mills duplicated  Svoboda's series exactly.  </P> <P> Other county athletes who advanced to tonight's finals were Edison's Doug  Nichols (sixth-best 800 at 1:54.11); Capistrano Valley's Laurinda Mulhaupt  (fifth-best 800 at 2:15.38); Magnolia's Phouphet Singbandith (fourth-best  triple jump at 49-7 3/4); Westminster's Shelly Tochluk (the final 400 qualifier  at 56.34); Valencia's Eric Whitcomb, and Irvine's Sean Rogan (both 14-4 in the  pole vault); Edison's Greg Thurston (56-3 3/4 shotput) and Edison's boys'  1,600-meter relay team (3:19.84).  </P> <P> State Meet Notes  </P> <P> The boys' and girls' 3,200-meter finals are tonight and include Santa Ana  Valley's Jimmy Rodriguez and Katella sophomore Martha Pinto . . . Other county  athletes whose season came to an end Friday included: Esperanza's Chuck  Underwood (54-2 1/2 shotput); Foothill's Elizabeth Bauer (5-2 in the high  jump); Woodbridge's Louie Muniz (39.56 in the 300 hurdles); Sonora's Shannon  Bryant (300 hurdles); Mater Dei sophomore Melissa McDonald (17-11 1/4 in the  long jump); Mission Viejo's Allison Axtell (17-5 in the long jump); San  Clemente sophomore Tim Martin (10.77 in the 100 meters; ties for alternate  position); Foothill's Janette Reed (2:21 in the 800).  </P></p>

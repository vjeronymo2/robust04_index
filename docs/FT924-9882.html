			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (5): Diluting the monopolies  -European Single Market LIBERALISATION of the European Community gas market was regarded as one of the most difficult obstacles to a true single market when the British took over the presidency of the EC in July. Indeed, faced with the joint opposition of energy producers and government in most member states, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, and Sir Leon Brittan, responsible for competition, had already watered down their parallel proposals for the gas and electricity markets since last year. The directives, published in January, aim to open the gas and electricity networks to greater competition from the start of next year, allowing large energy users to buy from suppliers anywhere in the Community, and, if successful, extending the principle to smaller users on January 1, 1996. Ministerial discussions since then have produced tentative support for the ending of monopoly rights over the construction of gas networks, and the 'unbundling' of integrated energy companies' accounts to improve transparency. But debate has always stalled on the ultimate aims of the Commission proposals  - the concept of 'third party access' to gas networks. Britain, arch-privatiser of the 1980s and champion of free trade, was thought the ideal presidency to push ahead with liberalisation. But Commission hopes that discussion might be finished by the end of this year look wildly optimistic. On top of the controversial nature of the proposals, the political climate has changed. The Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty, and the very narrow French vote in favour have made the Commission wary of treading too hard on member states' toes. As a result, individual states, sensing they have the upper hand, are even more reluctant to relax their opposition. 'There are clearly problems and we will be reporting these to the council (of energy ministers),' says one British official, somewhat ruefully. When those ministers meet on November 30, Britain will attempt to soften them up with a quiet discussion of the main difficulties which have arisen among national officials. Security of supply will be one area under discussion  - opponents of the plans believe it would be severely jeopardised by the introduction of third party access to gas networks. Another area of concern is the protection of small gas consumers: critics say the main benefits of the Commission proposals would accrue to the large customers. Those which use more than 25m cubic metres of gas a year  - such as steel and aluminium plants, large construction sites, chemical, glass and fertiliser factories  - are the only ones to qualify for third party access under the first phase of the Brussels plan. If there is a glimmer of hope for energy liberals, it comes from Sir Leon Brittan, who still seems prepared to use autonomous powers to punish member states which transgress strict EC treaty rules on competition. Last month, for example, he threatened court action against member states which had not adapted their legislation on exclusive gas export/import rights to EC law. Opponents of Brussels' plans, by contrast, hope that changes in the composition of the Commission in the New Year may reduce the pressure for liberalisation. Sir Leon, although he is certain to stay in Brussels, may change portfolios, giving up competition to a less forceful colleague. Mr Cardoso e Cunha  - who took up the liberalisation crusade almost as soon as he started the energy job in 1988  - is leaving the Commission. 'There is a chance of starting off on a better footing with a new commissioner who would be less committed to a particular policy,' Mr Peter Claus, secretary general of Eurogas, the natural gas industry's lobby group, points out. If the main trophy of energy liberalisation looks like remaining unclaimed at the end of the British presidency, then the UK is still hoping for a consolation prize. Officials believe ministers may be able to agree on Commission plans which would guarantee free and open competition between companies applying for oil and gas exploration and drilling licences in the EC. The directive, published in March, is the first aimed directly at ensuring the oil producers enjoy the benefits of the single European market from January 1, 1993. Some member states still restrict the rights of natural resources companies to drill for oil and gas. The Commission's proposals would not force national governments to accept the lowest bid for exploration and drilling contracts, and member states could still restrict licensing on the grounds of national security, or to prevent depletion of natural resources. But other discrimination, most notably on the grounds of nationality, would have to be eliminated. The EC industry's main worry is that the new directive might be used to cancel out long-term contracts which are already running. 'If you go forward from (the end of the existing contract) with new legislation, then that's fine  - but don't tear up old agreements,' says one industry source. More worrying for the Commission is the possibility that Norway may challenge the plan next year, through the medium of the European economic agreement (EEA)  - the free-trade area which comes into being on January 1. Norway wants to continue to give state-owned Statoil 50 per cent of every licence it grants. 'That's clearly discriminatory and will never be acceptable,' says a British official. But if Norway can muster the support of its partners in the European Free Trade Association (Efta) it could block the Community legislation.</p>

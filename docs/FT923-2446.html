			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Gota suspends payments in SKr3.5bn debt crisis GOTA, the Swedish holding company which owns Gota Bank, Sweden's fourth largest commercial bank, said yesterday it had suspended all payments because of funding problems. Gota's liabilities amount to about SKr3.5bn (Dollars 643.4m), including short-term and medium-term borrowings from domestic industrial, institutional and private investors. The holding company said it would begin negotiations with investors today to see whether it can repay part of the debt. The activities of Gota's subsidiary - Gota Bank - are not affected by yesterday's announcement. Gota Bank last week announced a dramatic deterioration in its financial situation, warning that credit losses for 1992 would reach SKr8bn - or double its earlier projections. The bank added that it would run up an operating loss of between SKr3-SKr4bn this year. Sweden's centre-right government promised to support Gota Bank, saying it would take the necessary steps to ensure the stability of the Swedish financial system. The government yesterday repeated its pledge to guarantee Gota Bank's commitments to private individuals, businesses and all other creditors and counter-parties - liabilities which amount to an estimated SKr65-70bn. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, said yesterday it would continue normal dealings with Gota Bank on both the interbank and securities markets, adding that it 'intends to give Gota Bank access to the liquidity it requires'. However, the government has said it will not guarantee the obligations of Gota, the holding company which owns Gota Bank. Mr Per Lundberg, managing director of Gota Bank, said the holding company has borrowings of about SKr3.5bn, including about SKr1bn in commercial paper certificates and the remainder in loans and sub-ordinated debt. Most of the funds have come from Swedish companies, municipalities and individual investors. Negotiations are expected to start today between Gota and its creditors in an attempt to see whether a proportion of the debt can be repaid.</p>

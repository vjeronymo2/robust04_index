			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Battle stepped up to keep Germany in EFA THE last-ditch battle to keep Germany in the multi-national European fighter aircraft (EFA) project was stepped up yesterday, with a strong hint from the aerospace industry that withdrawal would cost jobs in the Hamburg constituency of Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister. Mr Ruhe is determined to axe the fighter project from his budget, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. Mr Jugen Schrempp, chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), said loss of the company's main military aircraft contract would require a complete rethink of the split in manufacturing between Hamburg, where Dasa has most of its civil production, and Munich, where military manufacture is concentrated. A negative decision by the end of the month would also mean the first of up to 10,000 lost jobs before the end of the year, he said. The key decision on the aircraft will be taken probably on June 23, at meetings of the parliamentary groups of the ruling parties, and not on June 16 as originally proposed. The latter date coincides with the opening of the Berlin international aerospace exhibition.</p>

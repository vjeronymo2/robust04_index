			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Morev, people's deputy of the Republic of </F> Moldova and member of the Socialist Party: "Who Is the Leftist  of Them All?..."]    [Text] Now, on the eve of the elections to parliament, it  is becoming necessary to explain more and more frequently that  the socialists and social-democrats in Moldova are not only not  close in their views but are political opponents who differ in  their basic ideological positions.    While the Socialist Party expresses the interests of wage  labor, the Social-Democratic Party is a party of the national  bourgeoisie. Up to the present time it has maintained the image  of a "left-wing" people's party and even exploited the concept  of "democracy" in its title, which means the "power of the  people." But the fact that the SDPM [Social-Democratic Party of  Moldova] also uses the term "social," well, after all, the  national socialists also have it... Thus, the essence of parties  is not in their names but in their fundamental ideological  positions. First and foremost is the attitude toward property.  Socialists understand the diversity of forms of property as an  objective reality. But we are for a determinant role of people's  property in the form of state and associated collective  property. Only then is national income redistributed in the  interests of the workers, and this means real social guarantees  for the population, and there cannot be unemployment, inflation,  and an increase in prices with a reduction in wages. People have  access to housing, education, health services, etc., which makes  it possible for them to live without fear of the future. There  are also no reasons for massive corruption and crime. It is  exactly under the supremacy of national property that it is  possible to form the private sector of the economy on legal  principles, with honest competition, and without the  impoverishment of the working people.    The social-democrats, first and foremost, defend private  property, under which the income of the people is redistributed  in the interests of property owners, but not more than 10  percent of the population can be the real owners of the means of  production. I will not refute or confirm the opinion about the  prerogative of the social-democrats in law-making and the  conduct of privatization; i.e., the organization of the process  of transformation of national property (state, kolkhoz,  cooperative) into private property. Officially, everything went  along the line of the state structure. Although V. Ciubotaru,  while being one of the leaders of the SDPM, was the deputy  general director of the State Privatization Department, and  there are also members of this party in the department. But this  is not the question.    While the Law on Privatization defines this process as  national privatization, the practice went in an entirely  different direction. The law makes it compulsory to guarantee  the social protection of the population, but, in fact, it cuts  itself out of participation in privatization by means of duties,  fees, taxes, contracts, etc. A person frequently cannot even  privatize his own apartment and, what is more, later maintain  it, although he has already paid for its cost with his labor  over dozens of years.    The rights of citizens are crudely violated in the receipt  of  an equal share of the ownership of state property that is  subject to privatization. The first auctions revealed a  deviation from the basic principles of privatization defined by  law, including also the mandatory consideration of the work  collective of the object being privatized. There is also a  complete lack of reliable information about the progress of  privatization. The law strictly prescribes that only citizens of  the Republic of Moldova can participate in privatization, but,  for some reason, the names of new owners are not publicized.    But perhaps it is necessary to seek answers to such  questions  from V.B. Ciesuev, who holds the position of general director of  a state department: "The show will be directed by whoever really  possesses the property. The market--is it not the best place for  the application of unselfishness?" Well, this is just as frank  as it is cynical.    The socialists are conducting an open political campaign  against those who hurt the interests of the workers and violate  their rights. At the initiative of the socialists, parliament  decided that stocks acquired for BND [national property  certificate] can later be sold only for national currency. We  are for land and its wealth belonging only to the people and in  no case to foreigners. We are for the ratification of interstate  agreements and for Moldova's joining the economic union of the  CIS. We are not for a return to the past, but for the  improvement of society on socialist principles. We think that on  27 February 1994 it is necessary to submit to a referendum the  question of the political independence of the Republic of  Moldova, and its joining the CIS and its economic union. The  people, and not the parliament and not diminutive parties,  should decide whether the state of the Republic of Moldova will  or will not exist.    A very important factor that determines the essence of a  party is its formulation of the type of authority that it  defends. The socialists are for genuine sovereignty of the  people; that is, for a referendum and for a national discussion  on very important draft laws. The working people should not only  nominate and elect deputies, but they themselves should also be  represented with all of the powers in all branches at all levels  of authority. The social-democrats assign primary importance to  a professional parliament and to a bourgeois system of  elections, where a working person is given the right to elect,  but does not have a practical chance of becoming a deputy in  parliament. After all, according to the new law on elections,  the workers in Moldova are deprived even of the right to  nominate candidates for deputy--only political organizations  have this right, in a majority of cases small in membership and  unknown to the people. This means that it is not the people who  will nominate candidates, but the politicians--who will nominate  themselves.    The positions of the Socialist Party and the  Social-Democratic Party have also diverged with respect to the  tragic events in Moscow at the beginning of 1993. In our  republic, only the Socialist Party condemned the tyranny against  the Supreme Soviet of Russia, which confirmed its legitimacy in  a referendum in April 1993 on a par with the president of the  Russian Federation. In those days in Moscow, not only were many  unarmed people killed but democracy was executed there, opening  the way to dictatorship of the right-wing reactionary forces.  But the social-democrats openly supported these reactionary  forces, showing that they are democrats only in words, for  camouflage.    The party lists of candidates for deputy will also say a  great deal. Oazu Nantoi, leader of the social-democrats, is now  actively criticizing the democrat-frontists, but in the recent  past he was cochairman of the People's Front of Moldova. Now Mr.  Oazu has a new cover on his ideological banner...    The destiny of the people of Moldova will be decided on 27  February 1994. On that day it will be possible to stop the  policy of absurdity and put an end to the suffering of the  people. According to the new law on elections, the elections are  considered to be held if not less than 30 percent of the voters  registered on the rolls take part in them. It is quite likely  that if you do not come to vote, others will decide your destiny  for you. Silence and inaction have already created trouble.</p>

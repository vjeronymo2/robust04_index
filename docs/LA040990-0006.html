			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1990 CENSUS QUESTIONS  </P> <P> I'm mad as hell, but don't know who or where to write to express my complaint  about the census. This marks the third time in the last three censuses that I  have not been sent a form to fill out.  </P> <P> I feel I haven't been counted. The first time was in 1970 in San Francisco, the  second time was in 1980 in Los Angeles and now the same thing in 1990. I also  never had anyone knock on my door to ask me census questions either.  </P> <P> I've always lived in Skid Row hotels, as I do now. I've had a private mailbox  address in Hollywood since 1975. I also had one in San Francisco. None of my  friends who live in downtown Ski Row hotels got census forms either. We feel  the census is discriminating against us because we're poor and live in Skid Row  hotels. We want to know why we weren't sent census forms and why we weren't  counted or contacted!  </P> <P> TOM LOVELACE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

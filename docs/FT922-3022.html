			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): The dodgy lodger IN 1980 I rented my property to a woman. One of the conditions on the signed agreement was: 'not to sub-let, take in lodgers as paying guests and to use the flat for residential purposes only'. A later signed rent agreement in 1991 said: 'not to assign, sub-let or allow any other person to reside in the premises or to take in any lodgers'. In 1988, her 50-year-old son, after his divorce, moved into the flat without my knowledge. When I eventually found out, she assured me that it was only temporary. I have continually told her that she only is the tenant and her son should not be there. He is self-employed and although he keeps his van elsewhere, his business address is the flat, where he does his paper-work and telephoning. The rent is always in arrears. I do not want her son in my property. What are my rights as a landlord? Can I legally move him out now? As the son has now been in the property for some three or four years you may have difficulty in enforcing the strict provisions of the letting agreement: it can be argued that you have waived the apparent breach of covenant. You will need to give the tenant notice to restore the position. This is a complex area of the law and you would be wise to consult a solicitor. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

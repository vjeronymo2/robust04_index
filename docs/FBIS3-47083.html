The tax, introduced January 1, 1992, is aimed at curbing  Japan's astronomically high land prices.    The business community has called for the tax to be scrapped  or its rate of 0.3 percent to be lowered.    While refusing to accept these calls, the Finance Ministry  has decided to increase the exemptions from the tax.    Points being considered are a cut in the tax burdens on  holders of land which is open to the public, public parking lots  or sites for urban development, the sources said.    They said the plan will substantially ease the tax burden on  retailers, financial institutions, realtors and the leisure  industry, which pay hefty taxes at present because much of their  land is located in big cities.</p>

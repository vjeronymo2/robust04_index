			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mostar cannot be a divided city, and the Bosniak  Muslim people will never agree to this long-suffering,  massacred, and humiliated city becoming the center of a canton  with a Croatian majority. This is the view of the Party of  Democratic Action [SDA] for Mostar.    Such an outcome of a 10-month-long siege of Mostar by the  Croatian aggressor would present a direct award to the  attackers, who have committed unprecedented crimes in this  region against the Bosniak Muslim people. Contrary to such a  regressive option, the Bosniak Muslim people from Mostar and the  Neretva River valley are committed to an open and cosmopolitan  city. The political representatives of this nation at all the  future political activities aimed at solving the  Bosnia-Herzegovina drama will promote only this option, based on  five strategic principles, including the demand that all the  expelled and displaced people of Mostar and the Neretva River  valley return to their homes of origin, where their personal  safety and protection of property will be guaranteed, that the  crimes and criminals on all the warring sides are punished, and  that, in future solutions for Mostar -- in accordance with the  initiatives of the European Union -- their direct participation  in the administration of this city is guaranteed.    These are the fundamental commitments of the SDA for Mostar,  whose newly appointed municipal committee again reiterates that  there can be no deviation from the party program defined clearly  earlier, and the principles of the struggle for Mostar and its  fate.    As Mr. Safet Orucevic, chairman of the municipal committee,  stressed, the SDA for Mostar extends its full political support  to the Bosnia-Herzegovina state delegation led by Mr. Alija  Izetbegovic in its attempts at definitely solving the bloody  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis through political means.</p>

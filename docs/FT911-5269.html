			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Reed ponders dilution of stake in BSkyB REED International, one of the main shareholders in British Sky Broadcasting, may decide not to put new money into the venture and to accept dilution of its stake of roughly 10 per cent. No final decisions have been taken but Mr Peter Davis, chairman and chief executive of Reed, yesterday declined to confirm or deny reports that the international publishing company might not participate in plans to raise up to Pounds 200m for the satellite TV venture. Reed's share of the fund raising for the consortium created in November by the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television would be between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m. Mr Frank Barlow, chief operating officer of Pearson, which holds roughly 10 per cent of BSkyB, said yesterday that if Reed decided not to take part in the new round he was confident that the money would be raised by the other original BSB shareholders. (Pearson is the publisher of the Financial Times.) The main BSB shareholders other than Reed that would be responsible for raising half the new money are Pearson, Granada and Chargeurs. Mr Murdoch has said he will put up his half of the Pounds 200m in a mixture of cash and value such as film rights. The industry would be surprised if Reed decided not to go ahead. Mr Davis was important in setting up the negotiations that led to the merger of BSB and Sky, and Mr Ian Irvine, deputy chief executive of Reed, is also chairman of BSkyB. The apparent doubts at Reed come when the other shareholders are more optimistic about the medium-term prospects for what is virtually a monopoly.</p>

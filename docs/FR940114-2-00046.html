Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;151&hyph;000 and CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;002]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> January 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on December 21, 1993, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas 77001, filed an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for authority to abandon by transfer to its subsidiary, Panhandle Field Services Company (Field Services), gathering systems located on its West End System in the states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle states that, as a result of its compliance with Order No. 636 and the required unbundling of its transportation and gathering rates together with its customers' elections to cease purchasing natural gas from Panhandle, the utilization of Panhandle's gathering facilities has declined and is expected to continue to decline. It also indicated that Order No. 636 has intensified the competition for gathering services in the Anadarko Basin Area where the bulk of Panhandle's facilities are located. It is alleged that because of its status as a ``natural gas company'' under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act, Panhandle cannot compete with gatherers that are not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. Panhandle proposes to transfer its gathering facilities to Field Services which would not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. Panhandle then contends that Field Services could then compete as a gatherer on a more level playing field with the competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle states that approval would permit Panhandle to eliminate its existing gathering rates and would result in a decrease in Field Zone transportation rates. Panhandle also indicates that its customers would not be exposed to the potential of Order No. 636 transition costs associated with the stranded investment of any gathering facilities in the future. It is then indicated that, upon transfer of the facilities to Field Services, the facilities would be operated on a stand-alone, open-access basis. It is also indicated that Field Services would be responsible for all of the financial, economic, operational and business risks associated with the facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle proposes to transfer at net book value 54 distinct gathering systems. Panhandle indicates that as of April 30, 1993, the net book value of the facilities to be transferred was $39,012,101.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle also proposes to further amend in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;002 a pending application filed in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;000,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to conform its application to reflect the abandonment of its gathering facilities to Field Services and to update the list of facilities proposed to be certificated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nunc pro tunc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and/or refunctionalized, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Panhandle proposes to reduce from 283 to 94 the facilities proposed to be refunctionalized from gathering to transmission in the application to amend filed in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;001. Panhandle also proposes to refunctionalize from gathering to transmission 74 other facilities not previously requested to be refunctionalized. Panhandle estimates the book value of the facilities proposed to be refunctionalized from gathering to transmission in the amended application in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;002 at $4,623,276.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  January 27, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

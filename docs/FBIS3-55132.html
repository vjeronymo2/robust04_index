			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Shchelkovo (Moscow Oblast, central Russia), 6 Oct  [date as received] (ITAR-TASS) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader  of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), who received  the card of a State Duma deputy in this city near Moscow today,  assured those present that "the election campaign was honest"  and that his party did not receive financial aid from any  companies.    Elected to the parliament in the 114th single-seat  constituency in Shchelkovo, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was today  approved by members of the district election commission as  deputy, and the local adminstration congratulated him. The  commission's chairman assured those assembled that although some  people questioned the results of the elections, there are no  grounds to speak about abuse during the elections. According to  him, for instance, a suit had been filed with judicial bodies to  declare the results of the elections in the 114th district  invalid.    As usual, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy vigorously "beat off"  Russian  and foreign journalists who were still interested in the problem  of financing the LDPR's election campaign and the results of his  foreign tour. "Nobody gave us anything, it is all lies," he  said and added that the campaign was conducted at the expense of  "money orders from Russian citizens." "Not a single mafia  grouping, economic structure, bank, or political organization  gave us a kopeck," the LDPR leader claimed.    At the same time, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy did not deny that he  accepts foreign currency from foreign journalists for his  interviews. "There is a long line and those who want to jump it  have to pay," he said.    He tried to play down the consequences of the scandal caused  by his pronouncements in Bulgaria and Germany's refusal to grant  him an entry visa. "[Bulgarian President] Zhelyu Zhelev was  frightened by something, but all is now sorted out." According  to him there was "an outburst of conflicting opinions in  Germany," but now "everything has calmed down too, and the  minister of foreign affairs is prepared to receive me."    According to Zhirinovskiy, he is being invited "to Austria,  Spain, France, and Norway."    Questions regarding U.S. President Bill Clinton's refusal to  meet the leader of the victorious party during his forthcoming  visit to Moscow brought an especially emotional response. "I am  ready, but he is scared -- and so much the worse for him,"  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated. "Shame on such a president, let  him go on playing his saxophone at home and not come here at  all." "You in the west are all scared of the new, honest, and  brave politician emerging in Russia," the LDPR leader added.    Answering the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question,  Zhirinovskiy reported that leaders of the four largest factions  in parliament have reached an agreement in principle on the  candidature of the future speaker . "He will be a representative  of a small neutral faction and his four deputies will be  representatives of the four largest factions," Zhirinovskiy  specified.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Japan and US reach partial agreement on trade The US and Japan both claimed victory yesterday after reaching a partial settlement of their long-running trade dispute. The deal averts the immediate threat of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. The agreement on opening Japan's markets to US goods and services is also expected to influence currency markets, which had strengthened the yen on fears that the two countries would be unable to resolve the conflict. The last-minute negotiations resulted in agreement on opening the Japanese glass, insurance and government procurement markets - the first results of 14 months of tough talks under the framework pact. However, the two sides were unable to reach a deal to lower barriers in Japan's car and car parts market. Foreign producers capture just 2.6 per cent of total sales in Japan, compared with 47 per cent in the US. Japanese car and car parts exports account for 60 per cent of the US's Dollars 60bn (Pounds 37.9bn) annual trade deficit with Japan. The US will start investigating Japan's replacement car parts market under Section 301 of US trade law, which could lead to sanctions in 12 to 18 months. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said Japan's car market remained discriminatory but noted Japan's willingness to reach deals in other areas. In spite of the US move, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, said Tokyo was open to further discussion with the US on the issue. However, the two sides were likely to benefit from a cooling-off period before resuming discussions, he said. 'In the area of auto and auto parts it is very regrettable that despite vigorous efforts in sincere discussions since July last year, the US government has decided to initiate a Section 301 investigation provide the Japanese government of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama with a welcome respite from one potentially explosive issue. Meanwhile, with the immediate danger of sanctions behind them, officials were able to congratulate themselves on having averted another sharp jump in the yen's value, which could have undermined the country's anaemic recovery. Mr Hashimoto and Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, have earned their reputations as capable negotiators, able to stand up against persistent US pressure for numerical targets. US companies in industries where the two sides reached agreement on market-opening measures welcomed the outcome. Mr Ralph Gerson, president of Guardian International, a glass maker, said: 'We are very pleased after long and difficult negotiations that US negotiators have achieved agreement on the key principles that will finally open the Japanese glass market to real competition.'

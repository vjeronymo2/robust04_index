			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Grim outlook for Tories in Black Country It looks bad for the Tories. Very bad. With less than a week to go to the Dudley West by-election, there are signs that it might even be disastrous. After a week like the one Mr John Major's government has just been through, few people expect the Conservatives to hold on to this quiet constituency in the heart of the Black Country. On paper, it ought to be a tough task for Labour. The seat is number 101 on its list of Tory targets. It has been held by the Conservatives break since 1979. And its local population is made up of the kind of hardened middle class voters who epitomise rank-and-file Conservative supporters. But few Tory candidates can ever have fought a by-election in conditions as unfavourable as those facing Mr Graham Postles, a 37-year-old insurance executive who lives in the area. His party is now a record 39.5 points behind Labour in national opinion polls. Its divisions have been fully exposed in debates on Europe and value added tax in the Commons throughout the by-election campaign. And there is no powerful Liberal Democrat challenge here threatening to split Labour's vote. Above all, the majority of 5,789 which Mr Postles is defending seems trifling compared with the hefty Tory leads overturned at Christchurch and Eastleigh in the past 18 months. A senior Tory party official admitted this week that Labour should get a majority of 6,000 next Thursday. But his demeanour let slip that even this might be an underestimate. 'It's just been too difficult on the doorstep,' he said. A government minister who had campaigned in the constituency also admitted at Westminster yesterday that the result could be disastrous. At first glance the constituency of 80,000 electors occupies the kind of industrial landscape which evokes the recent recession and discontent with the Conservative administration. Manufacturing in the Black Country is a shadow of its former self. Much of it can be found in museums dotted around the area. But rows of detached and affluent-looking houses in towns such as Sedgley and Upper Gornal are an indication that this area has one of the highest levels of owner-occupation in the country. Local unemployment is down to 8 per cent from 22 per cent in 1992. According to Tory statistics, 71 per cent of local business leaders expect turnover to rise in the next 12 months. A Conservative Central Office official working on the party's campaign said: 'It's not all that different from fighting Guildford or Chingford. It's very much C2 territory - without the Essex accent.' Mr Postles is confident the constituency is, at last, enjoying the promised economic upturn. And he can certainly count on the support of a few hard-core Conservatives. 'This isn't Christchurch or Eastleigh,' he says. 'In the Black Country people are steeped in local tradition, they care about local issues and they like stability.' There are signs of that. Mr John Guest, a retired refuse collector, said: 'The government has its problems. But Tories here will stick with the government through and through.' Others say that the decline in regional unemployment is making itself felt. Mr Roy Hampton, a gas engineer, said: 'I'll vote Tory again. You just need to give the Tories time to let the economic changes make themselves felt, that's all. People aren't being patient enough.' But Labour's campaign is milking national discontent with the Tories to good effect. A mother-of-two in the Merry Hill shopping centre said: 'I voted Tory last time but it will be Labour now. The Tories don't understand what the tax rises have done to families like ours.' A pensioner who is also thinking of switching said: 'I'm impressed with Tony Blair. He appears sensible in a way Labour didn't before.' Mr Fraser Kemp, who is masterminding Labour's campaign to take the seat, refuses to get too excited about his party's chances. 'We cannot just assume that the Tories are losing voters,' he said this week. 'We need to go out and win them over.' If the government loses this seat, its position at Westminster will be even worse. But the parliamentary arithmetic is not the main issue. A Labour win here would show that Mr Tony Blair's party can attract voters who have never thought of supporting it before. That could signal a vital turning-point in its fortunes.</p>

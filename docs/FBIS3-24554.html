Semenov;  UDC534.222.2+536.7]    [Abstract] Explosive systems of the oxidizer-fuel type  appear to be most promising from the standpoint of increased  explosive power resulting from the supplemental interaction of  the decomposition products of the initial explosive system. This  non-traditional approach to the development of explosive systems  is based on the principle of increasing explosive power not by  any direct increase of detonation characteristics, i.e.  synthesis of newer more powerful individual explosive  components, but by virtue of a chemical reaction in the  Chapman-Juge zone, thereby providing for more complete flow of  detonation processes and directing the evolved energy towards  completion of useful forms of explosive action. The feasibility  of this approach has been demonstrated in another work with the  benzotrifuroxane-hexanitroethane system, where the overall  explosive power exceed that of each of the individual  components. In the present work experimental data are presented  on heats of explosion, rates of detonation, and propellent  capabilities of an oxidizer-fuel system consisting of  bis-(2,2,2-trinitroethyl)nitramine with supplemental oxygen  balance, and three types of fuels: a) octagon and  benzotrifuroxane, b) an inert organic fuel consisting of lamp  black and ultra-finely dispersed diamond, and c) an inorganic  fuel consisting of finely dispersed aluminum of 4-10 microns  particle size. It was demonstrated that addition of the  additives results in increased detonation and propellent  capability of the composition. References 2 (Russian).</p>

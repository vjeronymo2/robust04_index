			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / People: Three new directors at Bank of England Frances Heaton, the director general of the City of London's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, yesterday became the first woman director of the Bank of England. Two other non-executive directors were also appointed to the Bank's court: Sir Jeremy Morse, who retired earlier this month as chairman of Lloyds Bank, and Sir Chips Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank. Bank directors are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister's office. John Major has adopted a policy of appointing women to senior public posts wherever possible. Heaton worked at the Treasury between 1970 and 1980, when she joined the merchant bank, Lazard Brothers. She was seconded to the Takeover Panel last year. 'The thing I am particularly pleased about in being appointed a director is that it maintains a continuity between the Bank and the Treasury,' she said yesterday. One of the three retiring bank directors is Sir David Walker, the deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank and a former Treasury official. The others are Sir Brian Corby, chairman of the Prudential Corporation, and Lord Haslam, former chairman of British Steel. The court of the Bank of England usually meets once a month on a Thursday. The non-executive directors serve as a sounding board for the Governor, but do not get involved in setting interest rates and monetary policy or in the minutiae of bank supervision. Heaton, 48, says that there could be a conflict between her Panel responsibilities and her new Bank role, if there were a takeover bid for a bank. In that case, she would concentrate on her role of adjudicating on the bid and absent herself from any Bank discussions of the takeover attempt. Sir Jeremy Morse, 64, has had a long association with the Bank of England. For ten years from 1965 he was an executive director of the Bank, before joining Lloyds. Both Sir Jeremy and Sir Chips both began their banking careers at Glyn Mills, now part of Royal Bank of Scotland. ***** Ian Rae, a director of COURTAULDS TEXTILES, died on February 17. ***** Neil Cannetty-Clarke has been appointed finance director at LWT in succession to Peter McNally who retires next month. ***** Alan Woods has been appointed operations director of Palmer Environmental Surveys, Michael Greasley production director of Standard Machinery, and Antony Raine sales director of Apollo Fire Detectors, all parts of HALMA. ***** Michael Jeanes, formerly deputy chief executive, has been appointed chief executive of MIELE UK on the retirement of its founder, Karl Wedekind. ***** Alan Kay has been appointed chief officer of the South East Co-op, part of the CWS. ***** Tony Farrington has been promoted to the board of FOSTER WHEELER ENERGY as sales and marketing director. ***** Richard Morris has been appointed safety director of EUROTUNNEL. ***** Wim Roselaar, former director of distribution (Europe) for United Distillers, has joined BURN STEWART DISTILLERS, the independent Scotch whisky company which was floated on the UK stock market in 1991, as European sales and development director. While at UD Roselaar was responsible for implementing sales and distribution strategies for the European single market.</p>

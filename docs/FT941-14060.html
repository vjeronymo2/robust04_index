			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness strong on deal The surprise restructuring move by Guinness and LVMH sent the shares in the former surging forward as drinks analysts hailed it as a fundamental change in the stock's rating. The deal, in which the French group reduces its holding in Guinness which in turn switches its LVMH stake into Moet-Hennessy (owned by LVMH), was said to go a long way to answering market criticisms of the UK group. Chief among these was the potential instability threatened by LVMH, whose media ambitions were seen increasingly at odds with those of Guinness. LVMH has also given additional safeguards on its new 20 per cent holding. Mr Andrew Holland at Kleinwort Benson, who yesterday moved Guinness off the sell list for the first time in 18 months, said: 'The deal improves the long term profit outlook at a time when they sorely need it.' Guinness enthusiast Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest said: 'This deal removes any remaining uncertainties surrounding the stock. On a two-year view, Guinness has got the best earnings growth potential in the sector.' However, there was some consternation at Guinness's timing. After the company spoke to some brokers last week, several analysts downgraded the stock, one house apparently cutting its profits forecast and issuing a sell note yesterday morning just as the restructuring news was announced. The shares closed 49 up at 521p with a hefty 30m traded, the fourth highest ever and the largest daily volume for two and half years. There was no stopping the bull run in Standard Chartered shares, which outpaced the rest of the banks sector, the FT-SE 100 Index and the wider equity market as institutions focused on the bank's outstanding earnings growth potential based on its pre-eminence in the Far East. An ever-tightening stock shortage was also cited as helping to squeeze the share price higher. Revived speculation of a possible takeover bid for the bank was disregarded by some traders, who reported signs of panic buying by marketmakers caught short of stock. 'Put simply, the shares were underpriced and are now beginning to reflect the big upside potential in profits,' said one dealer. A welter of buying interest, both domestic and overseas, drove Standard Chartered shares up 87, or 7 per cent, to a record close of 1316p, only marginally below the all-time high of 1324p reached in mid-afternoon. Turnover was an above average 1.6m shares. Bank specialists said much of the heavyweight buying interest in the stock had been triggered by the Cazenove buy recommendation issued on Wednesday, which highlighted the stock's relative cheapness against others such as HSBC and Bank of East Asia. However, some of the market's more cautious analysts pointed out that Standard shares outperformed the market by 20 per cent in 1992 and 75 per cent in 1993, and that in the absence of a takeover bid the shares looked fairly valued. Standard is due to announce preliminary results on March 9. Shares in Kingfisher fell sharply as the stores group finally acceded to pressure to make a trading statement in the wake of the recent Dixons profits warning. Although widely expected, weak sales at Comet and Darty and sluggish margins still managed to shake investor confidence. Analysts cut forecasts by around 5 per cent to about Pounds 300m. The shares, which have had a strong run since the November Budget, checked only by the Dixons news, are likely to be weak ahead of results in March. The stock tumbled 37 to 678p with 10m shares traded. Dixons gained 4 at 222p. Industrial gases group BOC bucked the market after surprising investors with a restructuring package forecast to save Pounds 60m over the next three years. The restructuring will involve 1,700 staff losing their jobs worldwide and Pounds 85m of provisions, but the market decided that all the bad news was now out of the way and bought the shares, lifting them 33 to 699p. Analysts cut their forecasts for this year by around Pounds 65m to between Pounds 255m and Pounds 265m to take the provisions in to account, but raised estimates for next year and 1996. Chemicals group ICI came under further attack as UBS published a review with a short-term sell recommendation attached. The house told clients that the dismal state of the industry in continental Europe, a Pounds 20m hit from adverse exchange rate movement, diminishing scope for further cost cuts, and fears of an oil price rise, would hold the company back. It sees the shares falling as low as 700p before yield benefits kick in. Yesterday the stock surrendered 12 to 755 1/2 p. Pharmaceutical stocks were under pressure following US selling that began after Pfizer announced a sharp slowdown in sales late on Wednesday. Glaxo was further affected by a downgrade from Kleinwort Benson and weakened 20 to 661p. SmithKline Beecham fell 7 to 432p and Zeneca 16 to 808p. Speculation of further trouble in the stores sector circulated, with MFI attracting attention as a potential candidate for reporting dull trading news with its results in two weeks' time. The stock receded 7 1/2 to 168 1/2 p. Bank shares ran ahead towards the close, with Bank of Scotland finally 7 1/2 higher at 232 1/2 p and Lloyds 2 harder at 646p after Kleinwort Benson buy notes; and Barclays finishing 8 up at 617p, with Morgan Stanley said to be about to publish a strong buy recommendation on the shares today. In the composite insurances, Commercial Union benefited from switching out of General Accident, the former settling 5 firmer at 693p and the latter 15 cheaper at 725p. Talk that one marketmaker had finally placed a line of 3m shares in Sun Alliance saw the shares edge up 2 to 391p. Disappointing new business figures unsettled Prudential, which retreated 12 to 364p, and London &amp; Manchester, 23 down at 413p. Mining group RTZ forged ahead 31 1/2 to 876 1/2 p on the back of rising metal prices. Courtaulds Textiles dropped 32 to 536p when one agency broker attempted to place a line of stock just as the steam went out of the Mid 250 Index. United Newspapers slipped 9 to 673p in reaction to the latest newspaper circulation figures, which showed that the group's Daily Express had been hit by the Times price cuts.</p>

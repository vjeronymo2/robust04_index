			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Zhongluo (2621 0022 3157): "Li Laizhu Takes </F> Command as Commander of Beijing Military Region"]    [Text] In January this year, 62-year old Lt.Gen. Li Laizhu  replaced Wang Chengbin to become the eighth commander of the  Beijing MR. Yang Yong was the seventh commander of the Beijing  MR for nine years. His tenure was the longest of all. Chen  Xilian and Qin Jiwei were next. Both of them stayed on the post  for seven years. The tenure of both Li Desheng and Zhou Yibing  was the shortest one for less than three years. Wang Chengbin  was at this post for three years and nine months, and the first  commander of the Beijing MR Yang Chengwu stayed on his post for  three and half years.  <H5>  Li Laizhu Comes From 2d Field Army </H5>   Just like Yang Yong, Li Desheng, Chen Xilian and Qin Jiwei,  Li Laizhu comes from the PLA 2d Field Army which was under the  command of Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping. The only difference is  that all the several predecessors of his were veteran Red Army  members who fought hundreds of battles during the 10-year civil  war, while Li Laizhu, just like his predecessor Wang Chengbin,  were cadres of the 1938 era who joined the army in the later  stage of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression.  <H5>  Li Laizhu's Hometown in Northwest Shandong </H5>   Li Laizhu was born in 1932 in Shenxian County, located  in northwest Shandong Province. Shenxian County was a part of  the anti-Japanese base area in northwest Shandong built by the  Chinese Communists during the War of Resistance against Japanese  Aggression . The Northwest Shandong District was originally  under the administration of the Sixth Prefectural Commissioner's  Office in Shandong Province, which has jurisdiction over 12  counties including Liaocheng, Chiping, Boping, Tangyi, Kouxian,  Shouzhang, Yanggu and Shenxian County. The district cut across  the Yellow River and was located along the border of Hebei,  Shandong and Honan.    In November 1936, Fan Zhuxian was appointed Commissioner  of the Sixth Shandong Provincial Special District of the  Kuomintang Government.    After the "Lugouqiao Incident" in 1937, Zhang Linzhi,  Director of the Organization Department under the Shandong  Provincial CPC Committee, led more than 70 Chinese Communist  Party members and students who were forced to leave their native  places to go to the Liaocheng Prefecture to carry out activities  against Japanese aggression and for national salvation. They  also built fine relations with Fan Zhuxian and formed a united  front with him. Liaocheng fell into the Japanese hands on 15  November 1938. Fan Zhuxian, CPC member Zhang Yuguang and 600  soldiers and civilians died for the country during this campaign.  <H5>  Yang Yong Opened Up Northwest Shandong Base Area </H5>   The Western Shandong Regional CPC Committee was  established in January 1938. Zhang Linzhi was appointed  secretary of the committee. The 686th Regiment of the 115th  Division of the Eight Route Army (Regiment Commander Yang Yong  and Political Commissar Su Zhenhua) moved into the region and  spread the War against Japanese Aggression to areas west of the  Yun River. The main military forces boldly drove to the areas  west of the Tai Mountains in April. In July, those PLA units in  areas west of the Yun River became an independent brigade of the  115th Division. Yang Yong was appointed the brigade commander  and concurrently political commissar of the brigade. Then, the  area west of the Yun River and that west of the Tai Mountains  joined together. The  Juancheng-Juye-Heze-Jiaxiang-Wenshang-Yuncheng Border Region was  established in August 1939. It stretched further toward  northwest Shandong. In the winter of 1939, the Eighth Route Army  troops which entered northwest Shandong opened up base areas in  Shouzhang, Fanxian, Yanggu, Liaocheng, Shenxian, Chaocheng and  Guancheng. The West Shandong Military District was established  in April 1940. The 343rd Brigade (which became the 3rd Training  Brigade later) with Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar  Xiao Hua was stationed in the district. The area under its  jurisdiction covered Jinan, Yanzhou, Juye, Juancheng, Guantao  and Yucheng. At the end of 1940, this area was developed into a  western Shandong anti-Japanese base area which covered the areas  west and east of the Yun River, the area west of the Tai  Mountains and the Northwest Shandong District . At that time,  Shenxian was under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Shandong  District. In addition to Shenxian, this district also covered  Guanxian, Guantao, Chaocheng, Linqing, Qiuxian and other  counties. After the founding of the West Shandong Military  District, the Northwestern Shandong District became the 3d  Military Sub-Command (Commander Bai Yun and Political Commissar  Wang Leting). In April 1940, the Chinese Communist Party held a  congress of representatives from 52 counties in western Shandong  and set up the Western Shandong Administrative Office. Xiao Hua  and Duan Juni were elected director and deputy director of the  office.  <H5>  Li Laizhu Took Part in Revolution in Later Stage of War </H5> Against Japanese Aggression    In July 1941, The Western Shandong District and the  Hebei-Shandong-Henan District merged. After that, they were  placed under the command of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan  Anti-Japanese Base Area. In May 1944, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan  District merged with the South Hebei District, and the Northwest  Shandong District became the 7th Hebei-Shandong-Henan  Sub-District (Sub-District Commander Chao Jian-min and Political  Commissar Xu Mengxia). Li Laizhu was doing some local  anti-Japanese work in the 7th Sub-District in May 1944. He was  only 12 years old at that time.  <H5>  Li Laizhu Joined PLA in February 1947 </H5>   After Japan surrendered in October 1945, the 7th  Hebei-Shandong-Henan Sub-District was incorporated into the  southern Hebei area and became the 1st Southern Hebei  Sub-District (Commander Bai Yun and Political Commissar Xu  Mengxia). At the same time, the main army units in the Southern  Hebei Military District formed the 2d Column (Commander Chen  Zaidao and Political Commissar Song Renqiong) of the  Shanxi-Hebei-Henan Military District (Commander Liu Bocheng and  Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping) in Handan, Hebei. After the  civil war between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communists  started, this column took part in the Juancheng, Huaxian and  other campaigns. In February 1947, the 2d Column and other  columns moved to the north, and crossed the Yellow River for  regrouping. They stationed in the areas northwest of Chaocheng  and east of Daming which were under the command of the 1st Henan  Sub-District. During the period of regrouping, the 2d Column  recruited several thousand soldiers from southern Hebei. At that  time, Li Laizhu who was doing some work for the 2d Southern  Hebei Sub-District officially started to work for the army, and  joined the PLA. He was 15 years old at that time. He joined the  11th Regiment (Regiment Commander Luo Chongfu and Political  Commissar Li Xianzhong) of the 4th Brigade (Brigade Commander  Kong Qingde and Political Commissar Liu Minghui) of the 2d  Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Column as a fighter.  <H5>  Participate in Battles in Southwest Shandong and in Huaihai </H5> Campaign    Since then, Li Laizhu followed the column took part in  the Northwestern Shandong Battle and the Dabieshan, Wanxi,  Wandong, Huaihai and other well-known campaigns, and was  promoted to deputy platoon leader and then platoon leader.    During the Huaihai Campaign, the 11th Regiment of the  4th Brigade of the 2d Column of the Central Plains Field Army,  to which Li Lanzhu belonged, checked the assault from the  Kuomintang Huang Wei Army Group at Dengjiadeng, northwest of  Mengcheng. It fought for five hours and killed more than 300  enemy soldiers. The regiment distinguished itself in the entire  Huaihai Campaign.  <H5>  Took Part in Yangtze River Crossing and Southwestern </H5> Campaigns    The Central Plains Field Army changed its name to the 2d  Field Army on 26 January 1949. The 2d Column of the Central  Plains Field Army changed its name to the 10th Army of the 2d  Field Army (Army Commander Du Yide, Political Commissar Wang  Weigang and Deputy Army Commander Fan Chaoli). Li Laizhu was a  platoon leader of the 83rd Regiment of the 28th Division  (Division Commander Chen Zhongmin and Political Commissar Yao  Keyou) of the 10th Army. Later, Li Laizhu fought one battle  after another, and took part in the campaign of crossing the  Yangtze River, the Southwestern Campaign and others.  <H5>  Follow 29th Division from Southwest China to North China </H5>   Following the founding of New China, the 29th Division  of the 10th Army was transferred back to the 15th Army in  February 1951 (Army Commander Qin Jiwei and Political Commissar  Gu Jingsheng). After that, the division took part in the Korean  War. In march 1951, Li Laizhu was promoted to deputy political  instructor of a company under the 83rd Regiment of the 28th  Division of the 10th Army. In April 1952, the 28th Division of  the 10th Army was once again placed under the command of the  23rd Army Corps (Commander Dong Qiwu and Political Commissar Gao  Kelin). Li Laizhu was promoted to a company-level political  instructor. At that time, the official designation of the 10th  Army was abolished, and the 30th Division originally placed  under its command was transferred back to the Navy. Then the  23rd Army Corps was placed under the command of the North China  Military District.    The 23rd Army Corps was reorganized into the 69th Army  and placed in command of the 28th Division and the 107th  Division. Dong Qiwu was the Commander of the army. The 69th Army  was under the command of the North China Military District. It  was later under the command of the Beijing MR. Li Laizhu was  promoted to deputy regiment political commissar and then  regiment political commissar, regiment chief of staff, deputy  regiment commander and then regiment commander of the 83th  Regiment under the 28th Division. He later became the Division  Commander of the 28th Division.  <H5>  Graduated from the PLA Military and Political College in 1976 </H5>   Li Laizhu graduated from the PLA Military and Political  College in 1976. The college was established on 6 August 1970  during the "Cultural Revolution" for the training of military,  political and logistics commanders at and above the division  level and a few outstanding officers at the regimental level in  the PLA. Located in Beijing, the college was placed under the  direct command of the Military Commission of the CPC Central  Committee. Huang Yongsheng, Xiao Ke and others were presidents,  and Zhang Xiuchuan, Tang Liang, Liu Xingyuan were political  commissars of the college. The college had departments of  military affairs, political affairs, logistics and others. (The  college was closed on 7 November 1979.)

(This school was reorganized first on  22 June 1962 and closed on 19 February 1969 during the "Cultural  Revolution.") At that time, Yuan Jie was President, and  Political Commissar was Song Shuanglai. Soon after that, Li  Laizhu was transferred to become Deputy President of the school  and concurrently Director of the school's Training Department.  The Beijing MR Infantry School was renamed the Shijiazhuang Army  School. Li Laizhu was appointed President of the school. The  school had training classes for company commanders, political  instructors, platoon leaders and quartermasters and for students  specialized in communications, logistics and financial affairs.  The school provided undergraduate studies and professional as  well as on-the-job training.  <H5>  Promoted to Deputy Commander of Beijing MR in 1985 </H5>   In June 1985, Deng Xiaoping reduced China's armed forces  by one million men. The 11 major military regions were reduced  to seven. At that time, Qing Jiwei remained commander of the  Beijing MR. Yang Baibing replaced Fu Chongbi as Political  Commissar of the Beijing MR. Former deputy commanders of the  Beijing MR Pan Yan, Wang Yang, Ma Weihua, Xiao Xuanjin, and  former deputy political commissar Wu Lie, Luo Yinghuai, Qu  Jingji and other group of veteran Red Army and Eighth Route Army  members either moved back to the second line or retired.

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1990S: THE GOLDEN DECADE;  </P> <P> POLITICS;  </P> <P> GROUP PROMOTES AMERICAN TRADITION OF INVOLVEMENT  </P> <P> Nearly 90% of its members speak Chinese, but leaders of the Chinese American  Assn. of Southern California make it a point to conduct meetings in English.  </P> <P> "We are Americans of Chinese descent," said spokeswoman Yvonne Liu, a  first-generation American. "We are proud to be Americans."  </P> <P> Founded in 1983, the Palos Verdes Estates-based group is united in the belief  that success in the United States means more than economic and educational  advancement; it also means community involvement and political activism.  </P> <P> "Our kids are just like Americans, only their face is different," said  Elizabeth Szu, a group founder and immigrant from Taiwan. "We have to teach  them if you want to stay in this country, you have to merge with the  mainstream."  </P> <P> A struggling student when she moved to this country 20 years ago, Szu realizes  new immigrants are often preoccupied with making a living and adjusting to a  new culture. But once they settle down and become financially secure, she said,  it is crucial to be active in their communities and the political process.  </P> <P> "We have to pay our dues," Szu said. "If sometimes (Anglos) treat you like  second-class citizens, it's because you're not active in this community."  </P> <P> The association, which has about 400 members from Mission Viejo to Thousand  Oaks, devotes most of its energy and resources to political activities, such as  nonpartisan fund-raising for candidates sympathetic to Chinese-American  concerns and lobbying against anti-Asian violence and prejudice.  </P> <P> For example, as chairman of the group's political awareness committee in 1988,  Szu's husband Charles succeeded in getting the California Republican Party to  support a resolution opposing apparent university quotas restricting the  admission of Asian-American students.  </P> <P> When the movies "Year of the Dragon" and "Sixteen Candles" featured disparaging  portrayals of Asian-Americans and perpetuated negative stereotypes, the  association bombarded studio executives with letters and telephone calls to  voice their anger.  </P></p>

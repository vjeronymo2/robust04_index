			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Motors firm as Dow retrieves early decline Wall Street US EQUITIES shrugged off the drop in Tokyo yesterday and moved modestly in a session dominated by programme trading, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a marginal 0.45 up on balance at 3,236.36 after having fallen more than 24 points by midsession. Volume was exceptionally thin, with only 155.9m shares changing hands. On the big board, declining issues still outscored advances by 928 to 771. On Friday, the Dow gained 27.28 at 3,235.91. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost just 0.55 on the day at 406.39 and in the secondary market the Nasdaq composite was finally a mere 0.68 off at 617.94. Motor companies dominated trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday after Chrysler named Mr Robert Eaton to succeed Mr Lee Iacocca as chairman. Mr Eaton, previously chairman of General Motors Europe, will initially join Chrysler as vice-chairman and chief operating officer before taking over at the end of the year. Ford led the big three automakers in terms of volume, adding Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 37 3/4 . Chrysler firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 1/4 and General Motors held steady at Dollars 37 1/8 . Among other active issues, Weyerhaeuser, the forest products company, climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 36 1/8 after Smith Barney Harris Upham increased its first-quarter earnings estimate for the company. Eastman Kodak fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 after the photographic equipment concern said that it does not expect its business to rebound in the first quarter. However, Kodak added that it expects to post good gains for the year. Pfizer, the big pharmaceutical group, weakened a further Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 70 1/2 . The stock started to tumble on Friday amid concern that risks associated with the company's Shiley heart valves might be greater than had been previously thought. Sports shoe maker Nike dropped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 70 1/4 after posting third-quarter profits of Dollars 1.08 a share, against 93 cents a year ago. Shares in the group's competitor, Reebok, were unmoved at Dollars 32 5/8 , while LA Gear eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 13 1/4 . Unisys was one of the strongest big board issues yesterday, climbing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 10. Mr James Unruh, the company's chairman and chief executive, predicted first-quarter profits in spite of continued weakness in the US economy and very competitive conditions in the computer industry. Unisys had a loss of Dollars 98m, or 79 cents a share, in the 1991 first quarter. In over-the-counter trading, Good Guys tumbled Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 18 3/4 after Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its recommended list. Canada RISING interest rates helped to spark a broad-based sell-off on the Toronto market in solid turnover. The composite index dropped 31.6 to 3,444.1, while declining issues outpaced advances by 415 to 165 after volume of 30.7m shares. Every sub-group except pipelines posted a loss.

Transportation lost 2.03 per cent and financial services fell 1.49 per cent.

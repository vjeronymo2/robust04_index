			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> KIN OF SOCCER VICTIMS CAN SUE  </P> <P> Close family members who watched on television as relatives died in the crush  of a soccer crowd a year ago can claim damages for mental injury, a British  judge said today.  </P> <P> Justice Anthony Hidden limited eligibility to spouses, parents and siblings of  the fans who were killed or injured in the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium in  April, 1989.  </P> <P> The crush in a standing room area at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium left  95 people dead and hundreds injured in an FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool  and Nottingham Forest.  </P> <P> Hidden ruled that those watching the events unfold on TV were just as liable to  suffer severe mental anguish, or "psychiatric injury" as British law describes  it, as those who were in the stadium and could do nothing to stop the  fatalities.  </P></p>

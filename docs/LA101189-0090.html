			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QINTEX'S PLAN TO ACQUIRE MGM/UA FALLS APART;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: THE AUSTRALIAN FIRM IS SUED FOR FRAUD AFTER FAILING TO FULFILL  PROMISES. SPURNED SUITOR RUPERT MURDOCH MAY MAKE ANOTHER OFFER.  </P> <P> True to Hollywood's and Wall Street's most cynical expectations, MGM/UA  Communications Co.'s "irrevocable" sale to the Australian Qintex Group  collapsed Tuesday amid rancorous accusations and a lawsuit by MGM/UA accusing  the Australian firm of fraud.  </P> <P> The $1.5-billion deal -- amended twice over the course of seven months -- came  unglued after Qintex failed to deliver a $50-million letter of credit by Sept.  22 as promised.  </P> <P> The deal's collapse was a blow to MGM/UA employees as well as to majority owner  Kirk Kerkorian, who -- after 20 years of selling and repurchasing various MGM  assets -- appeared genuinely committed to the sale of the entire company.  </P> <P> On another level, the scrapped transaction appears mortifying and costly  because two bids by media mogul Rupert Murdoch were spurned in favor of Qintex.  In the last go-round, members of the Murdoch camp accused Kerkorian of using  their offer to extract a higher price from Qintex.  </P> <P> Murdoch could not be reached for comment late Tuesday, but earlier in the day,  he addressed a News Corp. shareholders meeting in Australia and said he might  still be interested in MGM/UA, although he wasn't prepared to raise his bid.  </P> <P> No overtures had been made as of Tuesday night, however. "We are not in contact  with MGM, and they are not in contact with us," said Barry Diller, chairman of  Fox Inc., another Murdoch-controlled entertainment conglomerate that  participated in the earlier MGM/UA bids.  </P> <P> Executives at rival Hollywood studios predicted privately that Murdoch will  step up again -- but perhaps at a lower price. "I think Rupert wanted it  badly," said one entertainment executive.  </P> <P> Qintex's entrepreneurial chairman, Christopher C. Skase, was unavailable for  comment, but the company issued a copy of an Oct. 11 letter to the Brisbane  Stock Exchange that expressed Qintex's version of recent developments.  </P> <P> Skase said Qintex had posted security for the $50-million letter of credit but  received "subsequent demands" from MGM/UA, including additional letters of  credit and "substantial liquidated damage" which, in Qintex's view, were  proposed in bad faith.  </P> <P> MGM/UA's demands "shifted daily and, in essence, reflected an attempt by MGM to  extract higher economic value," resulting in Qintex's ultimate determination  that acceding to the financial requests would not be in the best interest of  Qintex's shareholders, Skase wrote.  </P> <P> Skase's version was denounced by MGM/UA's lead attorney as "a bald-faced lie."  Terry Christensen, the attorney who has worked closely with Kerkorian for two  decades, declared in a telephone interview that "the letter is patently absurd  and ignores the fact that they were in default when they woke up on the morning  of Sept. 23."  </P> <P> When asked to assess Kerkorian's personal reaction, Christensen said "he feels  badly" that Skase couldn't complete the deal.  </P> <P> At MGM/UA's headquarters in Beverly Hills, company Chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow  read a brief statement from Kerkorian. "We were extremely disappointed. We  tried to hold the transaction together in every possible way that we could  think of. Finally it became clear to the board that Qintex could not perform."  </P> <P> Barbakow ticked off several of the solutions proposed by MGM/UA, to no avail.  The company offered to reduce the letter of credit or to accept substitute  security, or even a favorable opinion from an investment banker on Qintex's  behalf, he said. MGM/UA also proposed that Qintex could proceed without a  letter of credit if it agreed to allow MGM/UA to consider a better offer.  </P> <P> Kerkorian's own company, Tracinda Corp., indicated a willingness to help  finance up to $135 million of the acquisition cost, without requiring voting  rights in the surviving corporation, Barbakow said.  </P> <P> But Qintex's final proposal, according to Barbakow, was "to eliminate the  letter of credit or any other security" and to postpone for two months the  closing date of the deal. MGM/UA would also have been required to invest in  Qintex "without any confirmation from Qintex of its ability to perform." The  upshot was "we had no choice other than to terminate the agreement," Barbakow  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm Files Suit  </P> <P> Evidence surfaced last week that Qintex was having difficulty delivering the  non-refundable payment, but the company told the Brisbane Stock Exchange that  it had posted security with a bank to obtain the letter of credit, and Qintex  executives publicly expressed confidence that the deal was on track.  </P> <P> Attorneys for MGM/UA filed a lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los  Angeles against Qintex Australia Ltd., alleging breach of contract, fraud and  negligent misrepresentation, among other things.  </P> <P> In the 12-page complaint, MGM/UA said Qintex induced MGM/UA to reject Murdoch's  cash offer last month of $23.16 per share. As a result, MGM/UA said it has  suffered damages exceeding $50 million.  </P> <P> The scrapped deal was announced after the close of trading. On the New York  Stock Exchange, MGM/UA lost 62.5 cents a share to close at $21, on volume of  79,800 shares. In the over-the-counter market, Qintex closed at $5.625 a share,  off 25 cents, on volume of 45,800 shares.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WILSON'S TAILBACK TAKES CONTROL TO RUN PAST SERVITE  </P> <P> Maybe it's still too early for football.  </P> <P> At the end of the first half Friday night at Cerritos College, it looked as if  the players' minds were on baseball -- after two quarters, the score was  Servite High School 3 and visiting Long Beach Wilson 2.  </P> <P> Fittingly, it was the best player on the field -- Wilson tailback Mike Steward  -- who took control of the game in the second half. Steward's run on a  fourth-quarter fake punt gave Wilson a 14-12 victory in front of 1,100.  </P> <P> "Steward is a very good football player," Servite Coach Larry Toner said  afterward. "He was like a man among boys out there tonight."  </P> <P> Steward helped cut into a 10-2 Servite lead on the first play of the final  quarter when he took a handoff to the left, cut back across midfield, then  sprinted past the Servite defense for a 25-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> The next Wilson drive stalled at the Servite 36-yard line. But with 5 minutes  11 seconds left, on fourth and 16, Wilson Coach John Brennan crossed everyone  up when he called for the fake punt.  </P> <P> The ball was snapped to the up-back, Brian Poyer, who handed off to Steward on  a reverse. Steward did the rest, accelerating down the left sideline and  outrunning Servite's Billy Ray to the goal line.  </P> <P> "We're still learning," Toner said. "When we get snookered like that on a fake  punt on fourth down, we've obviously got some coaching errors to take care of."  </P> <P> Especially tailback Chandler Robbins (107 yards on 13 carries), who broke a  series of tackles to bust loose along the left sideline for a 57-yard  third-quarter gain. That set up Mike Wallock's two-yard touchdown dive on the  next play, giving Servite the 10-2 lead.  </P></p>

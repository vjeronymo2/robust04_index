			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "The Bosnian Tragedy </F> -- Paris Urges Watchfulness"]    [Text] By choosing to speak on television yesterday, the  president of the Republic did not intend to close one of the  most difficult and sensitive chapters of the interminable  Yugoslav tragedy. He was conceivably satisfied, like the whole  government, with the positive outcome of the ultimatum, but his  message to the nation was far from triumphant.    Thanks to a credible military threat from NATO, the  situation  has been "unlocked." Still, "nothing decisive has taken place  yet." Nothing, especially with regard to what is deemed the  primary goal: the restoration of peace in Sarajevo, in Bosnia,  and throughout the former Yugoslavia. "Watchfulness" therefore  remains the operative word.    Even if that means adopting a different position from that  of  other Western capitals. Paris yesterday did not limit itself to  merely acknowledging a "positive step." According to Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, it was important to "maintain pressure"  and, as emphasized by presidential sources, "to garner the fruit  of threat with a view to the future."    What matters is determination, making sure that the  vacillating glimmer of hope will not be extinguished -- this is  also what Edouard Balladur repeatedly told his successive guests  throughout the day: First Philippe Seguin and Rene Monory, the  presidents of the two Houses of Parliament; then political party  officials, whether or not they have representatives in the House  or Senate. Flanked by Defense Minister Francois Leotard and  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, the prime minister reviewed the  local situation for each of his guests. Air and ground  observation missions carried out yesterday confirmed that for  the most part, heavy weapons had been moved at least 20 km from  Sarajevo, regrouped, or -- for a number of immobilized weapons  -- placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control.    After providing this information, the prime minister mostly  focused on future action -- that is, the political-diplomatic  phase, which should be started "resolutely and rapidly." It is  even a matter of "urgency."    The president of the Republic and the prime minister, who  are  determined to keep dealing "in total harmony" with the Yugoslav  issue, want French diplomacy to remain not only "active," but  whenever possible a "driving force" ready to take initiatives or  to promote those that may be submitted by other parties. Given  past experiences, including the mired Geneva negotiations, the  priorities are clear: to enhance American as well as Russian  involvement in the peace process.    It was noted yesterday that the arrival of Russian  paratroops  in Sarajevo had no negative impact on the Serbs' decision to  observe the ultimatum. In the past hours, neither Francois  Mitterrand nor Edouard Balladur appeared shocked, much less  angered, by this arrival.    Paris hopes that a Russian presence among the Sarajevo blue  helmets will contribute to restoring a measure of security,  which, Alain Juppe stressed yesterday morning, is a necessary  step toward achieving the "goal for the next few days: placing  greater Sarajevo under UN administration."    Here too, "swift action" is essential inasmuch as Sarajevo  is  supposed to become "an example" for other safe havens "such as  Tuzla, Srebrenica, or Gorazde."    "We must act," insists Mr. Juppe. "In Tuzla, the airport  must be reopened. This objective must be achieved as soon as  possible." "Everything is ready," he indicated, even adding that  the Russians were ready to participate in the operation meant to  seize control of the airport.    This "common discourse" of the president of the Republic and  the prime minister was approved by a very large majority of the  personalities the prime minister met with yesterday. United  last week (with the exception of the National Front and the  Communist Party) in their call for a very strict enforcement of  the ultimatum, political leaders were once again united in  asking that all "peace opportunities" be pursued. [National  Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen stated he felt "a little  heartened," while the new Communist Party leader -- who used to  be so afraid of a NATO intervention -- finally adopted the same  position as other political leaders, stating that "there is  nothing more urgent than lowering tension, consolidating the  ceasefire, and promoting political solutions."</p>

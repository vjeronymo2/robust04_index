			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (1): In search of a new identity - The country is still on track for a customs union with Brussels, but political vacillation has served to undermine the case for economic convergence with the EC RARELY CAN Turkey have had such an opportunity to shape the future of its region. In a wide arc, stretching from the Balkans through the new republics of central Asia even to its Arab neighbours to the south, Turkey is quietly asserting a growing influence. These, of course, are turbulent times. A country which suffered a bout of painful soul-searching when the president suggested sending troops to the Gulf war, is today offering conscripts to sort out the horrors of Bosnia Hercegovina; is despatching military experts to advise its allies in the Caucasus; and has deployed up to 20,000 commandos to fight Kurdish separatists in North Iraq, in what most Turks are describing as the largest operation since the invasion of Cyprus in 1974. If Turkey appears ready to assume new responsibilities towards the emerging states of central Asia and the Black Sea, it is a policy shaped more by necessity than choice. Few of the Soviet Union's neighbours can have welcomed its collapse with quite such mixed feelings. The strategic imperatives which once underpinned its role in Western defence, are now changing with alarming speed. In its place the country faces uncertainty and confusion wherever it turns. When he arrives in London for a working visit next week, the prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, will again make the case for Turkey's special relationship with Europe - an idea promoted by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary but rudely overtaken by European issues of more urgent concern. Early this month, Turkey won the EC's endorsement for the idea of enhanced ties, following a meeting of the EC-Turkish Association council. However, on security issues, Turkey has reluctantly had to accept an offer of associate membership of the nine-nation Western European Union defence organisation. Turkey's contention is that its value to the west has become more vital. But in the wake of the confusion over the Maastricht Treaty, even government officials concede that any chance of early Turkish membership of the European Community now looks increasingly remote. Today, Turkey finds itself conducting the search for a new identity against a backdrop of political and economic uncertainty at home. Turkey's political establishment is still trying to rid itself of the constraints imposed in the wake of the last military coup in 1980. Moves are under way to liberalise the broadcasting sector from state control. Patent legislation is ready to go to parliament. There is even talk of seeking the necessary two-thirds support in parliament to throw out the 1982 military constitution, which many Turkish politicians feel is at the root of the country's problems. In many respects, Mr Demirel's conservative-led government has proven more resilient than many can have imagined. The prime minister has shown himself a skilful ringmaster in the often awkward squabblings of cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats. An apparently weakened coalition has shown little sign of being permanently disabled by the recent defections of a number of deputies from the junior partner Social Democratic Populist party. Nonetheless, for many Turks the great expectation with which the government's programme was initially greeted has been replaced by doubts and disappointment at the lack of progress. In an international environment of such dizzying change, the domestic agenda has come to play second fiddle. On too many occasions, the painstaking search for political consensus has hindered effective action. On a range of domestic issues, from tax reform and privatisation to human rights, Mr Demirel has instinctively chosen a policy course of least resistance. Almost a year to the day since taking office, he has bowed to hardline pressures within his True Path party, and abandoned any hope for a political solution to Turkey's Kurdish problem. With the economy forecast to grow by around 5-6 per cent this year, much of the urgency has gone out of the anti-inflation policy. The economy is still on track for a customs union with Brussels in 1996, but an increasing number of companies question whether this is still in Turkey's best interest. Political vacillation has served to undermine the case for economic convergence with the EC. Foreign investors intending to come to Turkey are still uncertain whether to expect more reform on the trade side, or whether they can plan for continued protection and labour costs currently enjoyed in the domestic market. Turkey's problems are those of a robust economy trying to unburden itself of the shackles of a vast public sector, something that Mr Demirel inherited rather than created. Today many of Turkey's industrial families would not look out of place in more developed countries. Trade liberalisation has increased the efficiency of Turkish producers. Domestic manufacturing can no longer rely on an overvalued currency to protect it from import competition. Existing lines have been reoriented for exports, which today account for a growing proportion of company turnover. This growing strength of the Turkish product market was underlined this year, when Unilever, the UK-Dutch industrial group, bought out the local Komili group, in what is believed to be the first instance of a foreign buyer putting a value on a Turkish brand name. For all that, even in the most successful boardroom, the burden of the government's budget on the economy has become an increasingly dominant motif. The public sector borrowing requirement was 12.5 per cent of GNP in 1991, and shows little sign of improvement this year. Inflation, after slowing through the summer, rose to 69 per cent in October. Some bankers talk gloomily of impending business failures. In such an environment, companies have little inclination to put resources into greenfield site developments, although recent increases in capital goods imports are seen as a more positive sign that the investment cycle may be on the turn. Stock market reform has been slow, while the index has fared worse than that of almost any other developing country, according to the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector lending arm. The Istanbul Exchange is still driven by the prevailing trend of interest rates, and until equities offer investors comparable returns, corporations are unlikely to be able to tap the market for a source of investment capital. The tax system is also inadequate. An amnesty offered to tax offenders will provide a blip to the tax receipts in the current year, but it does not address the real problems of poor collection and widespread payment avoidance. Moreover the system itself is distorted. Ironically, the one area where collection is possible is that of waged labour, now taxed at rates higher than any country in the OECD - an anomaly which is at the heart of Turkey's poor labour relations record. The farm sector continues to enjoy implicit subsidies through the government's support-price programme. Any attempt to cut back on the programme could add to the social and political problems of urban migration, which has put services under such strain in Istanbul and other cities. In many areas of social policy, there is an urgent need for more spending, not less. In health care, social security insurance, and primary education, Turkey falls far behind its OECD competitors. There is still no effective safety net which might ease the impact of the widescale closure of state companies. As the World Bank makes clear in a study on the public sector enterprises, the cost of reform, through labour restructuring and other measures, is only Dollars 7bn over two years. The financing cost of continuing to support the state industries is conservatively estimated at Dollars 18bn. There would seem little choice but to push forward.</p>

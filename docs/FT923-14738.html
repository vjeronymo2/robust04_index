			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Observer: The Bard says Britain's 14-year-olds will soon be facing compulsory examinations on Shakespeare. But how many will ever reach the proficiency shown by the unknown Portuguese official who drafted the traditional valedictory telegram to the UK government on its assumption of the presidency of the European Community last week? 'The unique experience of a first presidency can be described in many ways,' it said. 'Some may believe it is like a tempest, others that it is much ado about nothing. We refrained from applying measure for measure and sought to prevent EPC (European Political Co-operation) from ever looking like a comedy of errors. When we began our presidency in January the next six months seemed like a winter's tale and July was a distant midsummer's night dream. But today we can truly say that all's well that ends well and hope we did it as you like it.' Admittedly, no mention of Hamlet, or something being 'rotten in the state of Denmark'. But perhaps Downing Street can make up for that when it pens its own note to the Danes, when it is their turn to take over the presidency next January.</p>

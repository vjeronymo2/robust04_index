			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Groundwork done and ready to move - The management buy-out from the Massey Ferguson Group THE announcement was hardly the sort of thing to set City pulses racing: Manchester-based construction equipment company reports significant success with sophisticated new electronic control system for its backhoe loaders. But the news was of more than average interest to a number of organisations not noted for their devotion to the minutiae of earthmoving technology, such as Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance, Granville Development Capital and the Mars pension fund. Three weeks earlier, on September 8, the Manchester-based company MF Industrial had ended months of speculation by announcing a Pounds 12m management buy-out from the Massey Ferguson Group, arranged or backed by the three City groups. And it is innovations such as the Servotronic system, introduced earlier this year after two years' development work, that give Mr Richard Robson, MF Industrial's managing director, confidence that the company can make the buy-out work at a very difficult time for the European construction equipment industry. The deal was completed last month, finally dispelling uncertainty over the future ownership of Europe's third largest producer of backhoe loaders - MF Industrial also makes light industrial tractor loaders and skid steer loaders - and creating an independent UK-owned company with some Pounds 65m of annual sales and 430 employees. That makes MF Industrial much smaller than companies such as JC Bamford Excavators, by far the largest UK-owned construction equipment company and MF Industrial's biggest rival in backhoe loaders. Instead, MF falls firmly in the ranks of Europe's medium-sized players, which know they need a clear product and marketing strategy in the 1990s to avoid being squeezed between the global multinationals such as Caterpillar and Komatsu, and the niche players. Mr Robson has spent almost as much time discussing and negotiating the buy-out as his colleagues spent developing the new control system. The new company has been painstakingly put together this year from operations in the UK, France and Germany. Called Fermec Holdings, its products will continue to carry the MF Industrial badge. Long-term component supply deals have been negotiated with Varity, Massey-Ferguson's US parent company. Mr Robson brought in Arthur Andersen to arrange equity and loan financing for the deal as well as working capital requirements. In a period when many venture capital companies have been concentrating on rescue work, 'they knew who was investing', he said. Eventually, an international equity syndicate led by Granville was put together to support the management team, which has a 20 per cent stake. But, with the construction equipment industry still deep in recession and European market prospects uncertain at best, does the deal make sense? It certainly looks logical for Varity, which had quit the big league of construction equipment manufacturers in the late-1970s with the disposal of Hanomag of Germany (now controlled by Komatsu), and now sees its future in diesel engines, agricultural equipment and automotive parts. Apart from components, therefore, there was little remaining synergy between Varity and MF Industrial in manufacturing or distribution, according to the Corporate Intelligence Group, which advised the equity syndicate. For MF Industrial, Mr Robson believes there are several reasons why the buy-out should work. First, he says, an 'awful lot of pain has already been taken' shrinking the company from a workforce of about 1,000 at the height of the 1988/89 boom to about 430. Another redundancy programme is under way, involving 50 to 60 employees. But with the reduction in size has come a dramatic transformation in manufacturing methods and attitudes at MF's Stretford plant. Mr Robson, who joined MF Industrial in 1977 from Varity in Toronto, managed to persuade the parent company of the need to keep investing in the operation, whatever it decided to do with it eventually. After Pounds 6m of investment in new machine tools and robots, a paint booth and a reorganised manufacturing flow, what Mr Robson calls 'a backside of a factory' with 22 levels of piecework has been turned, he says, into one of the best in Europe with total flexibility of employment. The new company has also taken a potentially significant decision to spend a further Pounds 1m on its own-self-contained parts operation at Stretford, in a move linked to a new emphasis on 'aftercare' for customers. Finally, Mr Robson has been careful to begin with a strong balance sheet and the ability to expand. Bank borrowings and loans of Pounds 4.4m are backed by shareholders' equity of Pounds 15.6m, and a further Pounds 7.5m borrowing facility has been agreed. Along with almost all construction equipment companies, MF Industrial lost money last year. But it has been trading profitably since the buy-out, says Mr Robson. According to Corporate Intelligence Group, there is 'every indication that this relatively small, specialist manufacturer can prosper independently of its multinational, diversified parent'. But MF Industrial will need to draw on all its recent changes to achieve its next target - becoming Europe's second largest backhoe loader maker by the end of 1994. Its market share has hovered around 12 per cent for the past five years, but Mr Robson hopes a new outgoing approach to marketing will help it take share from rivals. And with the single market in prospect, Mr Robson is looking to Germany in particular to reach the target. Unlike the plant-hire dominated UK market, the German owner-operator or small contractor is much more likely to pay more for special features, he says. The company may also deepen its involvement in skid-steer loaders, a growth sector in Europe, taking on more customisation and final assembly work of products which it currently markets. Whatever happens, though, it plans to stick by its new motto: 'Large enough to serve, small enough to care.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 13 June, the branch of the Senate of the Republic  led by Senator Bernard Sansaricq restored officers and soldiers  of the Haitian Army who had been dismissed by the foreign  occupation forces during the years 1915 and 1916. In a  resolution adopted on 13 June, the assembly of the contested 18  January senators declared that the military dismissed in the  years 1915 to 1916 would enjoy the same rights, prerogatives,  and privileges granted to the retired members of the Haitian  Armed Forces. This decision, which had mere symbolic value, is  aimed at encouraging Haitians to sacrifice themselves for the  glory and greatness of the homeland. Here is an excerpt of the  resolution presented by Sen. Cadet:    [Begin Cadet recording] Considering that it is necessary to  encourage and stimulate Haitians to sacrifice themselves for the  honor and glory of the homeland; considering that it is  necessary to restore the memory of the members of the Haitian  Army dismissed during the years 1915 and 1916 by the foreign  occupation forces, and to correct such a grave injustice, the  Senate of the Republic has decided on the following:    Article 1. The dissolution of the Haitian Army, Navy, and  police force by foreign occupation forces during the years 1915  and 1916 is null and void.    Article 2. The members of the Army, Navy, and the Haitian  police force, dismissed during the years 1915 and 1916, are  restored with their respective ranks to the Haitian Armed  Forces. [end recording]    That was an excerpt from the resolution voted on 13 June by  the branch of the Senate led by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq.</p>

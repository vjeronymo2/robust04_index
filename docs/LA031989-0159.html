			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STEROID CHARGES: ANOTHER HURDLE FOR UCLA COACH  </P> <P> If anyone knows of unexpected barriers one needs to conquer in life, it is John  Smith.  </P> <P> An outstanding quarter-miler, Smith attended UCLA during the turbulent late  '60s and early '70s and became active in the anti-Vietnam War and black  nationalist movements. But Smith kept aim at his goal: to win an Olympic gold  medal for the United States. As the 1972 Munich games rolled around, he was  favored to finish first in 400 meters.  </P> <P> But then life played one of its tricks -- a hamstring injury three weeks before  the games. He struggled to make it to the finals but pulled up around the  second turn of the race.  </P> <P> Smith would also be haunted for years by the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes by  Arab terrorists during the games.  </P> <P> "Why my Olympic Games? Why my games?" Smith asks, shaking his head. "During  (the Seoul Olympics), people lost medals for taking drugs. Well, whoop-de-do.  People were losing their lives when I was in the Olympic Games.  </P> <P> "It was like being home during the Watts riots. I was so sick of that stuff,  and then I went over there and I'm in a war zone again. I said to myself,  'Damn, I can't leave this garbage.' "  </P> <P> Now in his fifth season as an assistant coach in charge of sprinters for the  UCLA track team, Smith has established himself as one of the most prominent  coaches in the world. Four Smith-coached athletes participated in the Seoul  Olympics, and two, Danny Everett and Steve Lewis, came home with two medals  apiece. Lewis provided Smith with some measure of redemption when he won the  gold medal in Smith's event, the 400.  </P> <P> But then another obstacle popped up.  </P> <P> On March 1, disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, implicated  Smith and dozens of other current or former athletes during a Canadian  government inquiry into use of anabolic steroids. Francis testified that Smith  told him that another professional coach, Pat Connolly, asked Smith in 1979 for  Dianabol, a steroid drug, for Olympic sprinter Evelyn Ashford.  </P> <P> Then last week, Canadian sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko testified that Smith  told her that when he lived in Toronto in 1980-81 he used Dianabol while  competing. Commented Smith: "This is getting ridiculous. They (Issajenko and  Francis) are fabricating and distorting everything."  </P> <P> Smith said he has never taken steroids nor advocated their use by his athletes.  He points out that during the four months preceding the Seoul games, Lewis, for  example, tested negative eight times for steroids. To date, none of the  athletes coached by Smith has tested positive for steroids.  </P> <P> "Charlie's trying to justify why he told his athletes to take drugs, and he's  using people such as Evelyn, Pat and myself," Smith said. "We're three who have  not been tainted, so to speak, about the use of performance-enhancement drugs.  . . . We've done our coaching day in and day out in a very mother-and-fatherly  approach. Charlie's done it through science and needles and the whole nine  yards.  </P> <P> "Charlie's a very intelligent coach, but he resorted to experimenting with  people's bodies, and that's a heavy responsibility. Now he's facing the  pitfalls of taking that route."  </P> <P> Smith met Francis when Francis was a sprinter at Stanford and Smith was at  UCLA. Like Smith, Francis suffered an injury before the Munich games and  couldn't compete.  </P> <P> "When we met in 1980, he (Francis) was more or less into developing athletes  though drugs," Smith said. "I wanted to do it through teaching the artful  approach of running and the metaphysical side.  </P> <P> "Charlie discussed his lack of acceptance of religion and of a higher being. .  . . We didn't agree on anything once we started talking about things that  weren't tangible.  </P> <P> "I've known what he's done. I feel I'm a better coach because I don't have to  use the stuff. There's only room for one at a time on top. I took my time over  the years, and so did he, but he did it out of a bottle and I did it  straightforward."  </P> <P> UCLA enters this season trying to win a third straight National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. title.  </P></p>

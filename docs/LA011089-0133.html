			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> SAJAK IN DEBUT OUT-RATES 'TONIGHT' WITH GUEST HOST IN CARSON'S SPOT  </P> <P> It remains to be seen whether CBS' Pat Sajak can beat NBC late-night king  Johnny Carson, but the premiere of "The Pat Sajak Show" did out-rate "The  Tonight Show" with comic Jay Leno as guest host Monday night.  </P> <P> According to A. C. Nielsen Co. television ratings released today from the 17  biggest television markets, Sajak's 90-minute talk show had a rating of 7.0 and  a 25 share, to a 6.1 and 18 for the hourlong "Tonight." Sajak and Carson won't  go head to head until Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Sajak also was up against the first half of "Late Night With David Letterman"  and ABC's half-hour news show "Nightline." Ratings for those shows were not  immediately available.  </P></p>

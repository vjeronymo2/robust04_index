			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just received the text of the speech of  Arpad Goncz, Hungarian head of state. Arpad Goncz considers it  important that all those states which make efforts for the  assertion of democracy, market economy, and human rights should  be allowed to join the Partnership for Peace program. The  president of the Hungarian Republic spoke at a working lunch in  Prague, attended by the leaders of the United States and  Visegrad countries. The head of state also pointed out that  neither Russia, Ukraine, or any other state of the region can be  excluded from the European security systems.    According to Arpad Goncz, President Bill Clinton's talks in  Prague prove that the United States continues to be committed to  Europe and the democracies of the Visegrad Group.</p>

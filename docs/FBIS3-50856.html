Canal from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Among the gringo workers who arrived at Juanchaco,  there are professors whose speciality is not included in the  education program of the small school they are building. The  U.S. troops did not come to Colombia only to build civilian  facilities; they have also gone into areas of conflict to  conduct military training.    [Begin General Octavio Gnecco, Naval Infantry commander,  recording] They have sent several U.S. Marines as temporary  instructors, especially in river combat techniques. [end  recording]    Several training exercises have already been held at a base  called Barranco, located in Guaviare. The foreign military  personnel, together with several engineers, have arrived with  their weapons in the area. Just as in the Malaga Bay and Puerto  Lopez areas, the military have been sent by the United States to  help the Colombian Navy build several facilities.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Have those  instructors also given antiguerrilla courses in Colombia?    [Gnecco] Yes, on several occasions. Based on a U.S. Army  offer, we held a one-month training course for our troops in San  Jose del Guaviare. [end recording]    This type of military training has also been given in Puerto  Legizamo and, according to the Colombian Navy, is also part of  the cooperation agreement with the United States. What we do  not know is, as is happening in other parts of Colombia,  military advisers are also arriving, and not as professors of  the school they are going to build in the Malaga Bay area.</p>

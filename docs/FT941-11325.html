			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Clouds roll in over Silicon Valley - The microprocessor market faces fierce competition Intel, the US semiconductor maker, unveiled some sparkling 1993 financial results: net income had jumped 115 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn and revenues had risen 50 per cent to Dollars 8.8bn. The figures confirmed the Silicon Valley company's position as the world's largest and most profitable semiconductor manufacturer. But there are some clouds gathering. Driving Intel's growth is its domination of the market for microprocessors that power personal computers. About 80 per cent of the 36m PCs sold last year contained an Intel microprocessor chip. Yet recent setbacks have demonstrated the intense competition Intel will face in the year ahead, raising questions about how long the company can maintain its grip on the PC microprocessor market. The latest bad news comes from one of several tangled legal disputes in which Intel has been attempting to prevent competitors from 'cloning' its microprocessor chips. Intel this week dropped patent infringement claims against Cyrix, a small Texas semiconductor company that has been selling its own versions of Intel's 486 microprocessor. Intel agreed to settle the dispute, granting Cyrix patent licences and paying the company Dollars 5m, contingent on an appeal of one aspect of the case. While the settlement will enable Cyrix to compete more effectively with Intel, more importantly, it could open the way for larger chip manufacturers to compete with Intel. As part of the settlement, Intel was obliged to provide Cyrix with a list of semiconductor companies that could manufacture clone microprocessors on Cyrix' behalf, because they already hold licences to Intel's patents. These include SGS Thompson's US division and Texas Instruments, as well as 'a short list of other manufacturers'. These companies, if they choose to partner Cyrix or another clone designer, could pose a far more significant threat to Intel. Intel's capitulation in the Cyrix case stems partly from a US Supreme Court decision last month not to hear an appeal of a similar case in which Intel was attempting to prevent another small competitor circumventing its patents by contracting with Hewlett-Packard to manufacture clone microprocessors. In the meantime, Intel's lawyers have been busy in San Francisco in a re-trial of the company's technology licensing dispute with Advanced Micro Devices, a Silicon Valley neighbour and former Intel technology partner. This case will determine whether AMD can continue to sell microprocessor chips incorporating Intel technology. If Intel wins, it could stop AMD in its tracks. But the outcome is far from certain. AMD is Intel's strongest competitor in the PC microprocessor market. In a significant blow to Intel, Compaq Computer, the third largest PC manufacturer after IBM and Apple Computer, last week announced it would buy, for the first time, some of its microprocessor chips from AMD. Although Intel is expected to remain Compaq's principal supplier, the shift represents a strong endorsement for AMD that could influence other PC manufacturers. In another development that may in the long term represent a far more serious threat to Intel, IBM is not taking up its option to manufacture, under licence, Intel's latest Pentium microprocessors. Instead, IBM will focus its semiconductor production investments on 'PowerPC' microprocessors, co-developed by IBM with Motorola and Apple Computer. IBM's decision confirms it now regards PowerPC as its strategic microprocessor technology for the future. But it stresses it has a large and growing business in PCs based on Intel chips, and expects to buy large quantities from Intel. Despite Intel's clouded outlook, none of its competitors can match its resources. This year, for example, it is planning capital expenditures on new production plants and equipment of Dollars 2.4bn, a 26 per cent increase over 1993. The capital injection will enable Intel to deliver new generations of chips that are smaller, faster, more energy-efficient and less expensive to make than those produced on older technologies, Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief executives, told industry analysts last week. This year, Intel will greatly expand production of its latest Pentium microprocessors to 'several million units'. Mr Grove said he expected Pentium processor-based computers to represent 15 per cent of all PCs sold this year, up from only about 1 per cent in 1993. 'So long as we don't screw up, we will be very hard to catch,' says Mr Grove.</p>

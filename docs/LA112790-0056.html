			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> WIRE TRAIN ON A TRACK WELL TRAVELED  </P> <P> Back in the mid-'80s, San Francisco's Wire Train was briefly a leading entry in  the post-R.E.M. alternative-rock sweepstakes, with its derivative but  attractive song "Chamber of Hellos."  </P> <P> After a three-year absence, the band operated on Sunday at the Roxy largely in  the shadow of current alternative-rock contender World Party -- no big  surprise, considering that Wire Train guitarist Jeffrey Trott toured as a  member of that band earlier this year.  </P> <P> But the problem then is the problem now: Singer-songwriter Kevin Hunter has  neither the moxie nor the mystique of R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe or Party chief  Karl Wallinger.  </P> <P> For much of Sunday's hour-plus show the quartet (augmented by a keyboardist)  did an adequate job of covering the same expansive kind of Dylanstones  territory that World Party often travels. But simulation was all it was: Hunter  and crew lack the vision to make it more.  </P> <P> Not that Hunter doesn't want to be seen as a visionary; he seems to want it  real bad. The nadir came with "Tin Jesus," a ponderous attack on organized  religion with music that sounded like an excerpt from Pink Floyd's "Dark Side  of the Moon." In the band's best new song, "Spin," some legitimate rock  momentum was cast aside in favor of a brief psychedelic diversion in which  Hunter quoted "Light My Fire" and "Let's Spend the Night Together" like words  from God.  </P> <P> And then there was an encore of Neil Young's "Mr. Soul," during which Hunter  coaxed the crowd into free-form "hippie dancing." As if it was ancient history,  Hunter explained, "The hippies didn't like rules very much." But he should  remember that the music figures he refered to did follow an inviolable rule:  Shut up and rock. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Bank cannot retain leases as security for father's overdraft DEUTSCHE BANK AG v IBRAHIM AND OTHERS Chancery Division (Mr DE Neuberger QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge): December 18 1991 A BANK is not barred by the unenforceability of an overdraft guarantee for lack of written memorandum, from asserting its right to retain title deeds deposited with it under a contract to secure the overdraft. But the owner of the deeds is entitled to their return if there was no contract between him and the bank, in that consideration for the deposit passed not to him but to the customer. Also, he would be entitled to their return even if a contract were to exist, if he agreed to their deposit as a result of the customer's undue influence of which the bank had notice. Mr DE Neuberger QC, sitting as a deputy Chancery judge, so held when giving judgment for the defendants on further argument on a claim and counterclaim in an action by Deutsche Bank AG against Mr Datuk Mohamed Ariff Haji Ibrahim and his two daughters. On December 3, 1991, the judge dismissed the bank's claim for a declaration that it had valid equitable mortgages of two leases owned by the daughters, held by the bank as security for Mr Ibrahim's overdraft (FT, December 13, 1991). He held that the bank could not enforce the security because it constituted a guarantee which was unsupported by a written memorandum signed by the daughters in accordance with section 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677. Section 4 provided that no action should be brought 'upon any special promise to answer for the debt default or miscarriage of another' unless the agreement on which the action was brought or some memorandum or note of that agreement, was in writing and signed by the party to be charged with the promise. The daughters' counterclaim for delivery up of the title deeds was adjourned for further argument until the present hearing. At the hearing the bank applied to recall the judgment on the claim for further argument. It wished to raise two new arguments aimed at rebutting the defendants' reliance on section 4. The application was granted on the grounds: (1) that the argument related to a point taken and pleaded for the defendants after the case had opened; (2) the hearing had not closed, in the sense that the counterclaim still had to be argued; (3) there was no suggestion of prejudice to the defendants outside the proceedings in that they had not acted in reliance on the judgment, nor inside the proceedings in that the argument was one of law and did not require further evidence. HIS LORDSHIP said that the first new argument on the claim was that draft memoranda sent by the bank to the daughters on November 19, 1985, for signature were sufficient to satisfy section 4. Those memoranda recorded the deposit of the title deeds as security for Mr Ibrahim's indebtedness, and asked the daughters to acknowledge that fact. The court had found that the memoranda were received by the daughters, but were never acknowledged by them, nor executed them in any way. In those circumstances they were not sufficient memoranda for the purposes of section 4. The bank said the memoranda had the daughters' names on and therefore should be treated as having been authorised by them because, having received them, they stood by and did nothing. It would be quite wrong in legal principle or common sense to infer approval on the daughters' part, whether of the memoranda generally or of inclusion of their names. The second new argument on the claim was that the daughters should not be able to use section 4 as an engine of fraud. The argument was rejected. The circumstances in which the engine of fraud principle might be invoked were restricted to two classes of case, set out in Williams on the Statute of Frauds, section 4 1932, page 223: '1. Cases where one party has partly or wholly performed his side of the contract and the other thereupon, designing to secure the benefit of such performance without performing in return the obligations which the contract imposes on him, sets up a plea of non-compliance with the statute. 2. Cases where such a plea is set up by one who has, by fraud, prevented the execution of sufficient writing.' The bank could not bring the facts into either class. Mere refusal to sign was not enough (see Wood v Midgley 5 De GM &amp; G 41). The second new argument was therefore rejected. Accordingly, despite recall of the judgment dismissing the claim, the further argument did not cause the court to alter its conclusion. The claim having been dismissed, the daughters counterclaimed for return of their title deeds. They argued first that as the claim failed under section 4, the counterclaim must succeed. The bank said section 4 did not provide that the absence of a signed memorandum rendered a guarantee contract void. It merely provided that no action might be brought on the contract. Accordingly, the bank argued, it could contest the counterclaim and refuse to hand over the title deeds on the basis that they were deposited as security for Mr Ibrahim's borrowings, which had not been repaid. In Maddison v Alderson(1888) App Cas 467, 475 Lord Selborne said section 4 'does not avoid parole contracts but only bars the legal remedies by which they might otherwise be enforced'. The counterclaim would have been dismissed had it been based only on that ground. However, the daughters had raised other points. First it was said there was no consideration for the guarantee. The court accepted that Mr Ibrahim's promise to provide the title deeds was made in consideration of the bank's extending his right to an overdraft. But the question was whether he was making that promise on behalf of his daughters. There was nothing to suggest that he had their express authority to make the promise. There was nothing in the documents or in the evidence to suggest that he sought their consent to commit them to depositing the title deeds as security for his overdraft. The bank then alternatively relied on estoppel. There was no action or omission on the bank's part after the title deeds were handed over to it which gave rise to any argument of estoppel. On the evidence there was nothing the bank did or did not do which it would or would not have done if the title deeds had not been handed over to it. Unless the bank could establish some sort of estoppel in relation to the deposit of the title deeds, it was in the same position as a bank which had gratuitously received title deeds from a third party as security for the debt of another after that debt had been incurred, following which the third party changed his mind and sought to collect the title deeds from the bank. Unless the bank could say it had acted to its detriment in reliance on the security, there being no contract, it would be obliged to hand back the title deeds. Accordingly, the daughters' argument based on absence of consideration succeeded. Their final point was that if there was a contract between them and the bank,it was voidable or void on grounds of undue influence. Where two people who were unmarried provided security for the liabilities of their father without any independent legal advice, there was a presumption of undue influence (see Lancashire Loans v Black (1934) 1 KB 380. There was no evidence that the daughters got independent advice. When the bank saw the leases in November 1985 it almost immediately appreciated that they were granted to Mr Ibrahim's daughters. It knew enough to be unable to claim to be an innocent third party without notice so far as voidability of the agreement at the daughters' suit was concerned. It knew the title deeds were being offered as security for Mr Ibrahim's overdraft. It knew they were in his daughters' names. It must have appreciated that it was through his influence on the daughters that the title deeds were produced. It would be inappropriate for the court to criticise the bank's conduct of the matter. All it could say was that if an organisation chose to deal with matters in a comparatively informal way, it could scarcely claim it had no notice of matters such as undue influence in circumstances such as these.

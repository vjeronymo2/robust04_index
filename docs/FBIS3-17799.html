He was elected by a secret  ballot, earning 57 votes. There were 43 votes against, and two  ballots were found invalid.    Luchinsky is 54 years old. In perestroika years he was first  secretary of the Central Committee of the Moldovan Communist  Party, secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet  Communist Party, CPSU. He was elected speaker of the previous  Moldovan parliament after an acute parliamentary crisis last  year. The parliament, torn by contradictions, had to be  dissolved.    It is the first time that a Moldovan parliament has been  formed on a multiparty basis. It will include 104 deputies.  The Agrarian Democratic Party will have parliamentary majority,  56 deputies.    Agrarians believe that the legislative body should above all  adopt a new constitution, create a legislative base for economic  reform, and resolve the Dniester and Gagauz problems through  granting special legal status to these territories.</p>

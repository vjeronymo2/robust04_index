			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (10): A basic guide for visitors VISAS for visitors from most countries are fairly easy to obtain from Taiwan's official or, more likely, unofficial missions. Names for the unofficial offices can vary, but are usually economic and cultural offices containing the catch-words 'Republic of China' or 'Taipei.' For example, in London, Taiwan's representative is at the 'Taipei Representative Office in the UK.' Trade contacts: A useful source is the China External Trade and Development Council (Cetra) Tel: 886-2-725- 5200; Fax: 757-6653). Cetra has offices in most of the leading trading nations, often together with Taipei's unofficial representation, or separately under the moniker 'Far East Trade Service.' Companies more interested in investment projects can also contact the offices of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, often known as the 'Economic Division' of the Taipei representative office. Directory: If possible, travellers should purchase upon or before arrival the Directory of Taiwan, which offers a thorough and indispensable collection of important offices, companies and services for NTDollars 400 (Dollars 17.50) if purchased in Taiwan. It can also be ordered at higher prices (including postage) from The China News (one of the island's two English-language dailies) at 11F, 110 Yenping S. Road, Taipei, Taiwan. Tel: 886-2-388-7931 or Fax: 381-5987. Getting to Taiwan now presents even fewer problems for European travellers with the growing number of direct air connections between European capitals and Taipei. In 1993, Taipei entered into reciprocal air traffic right pacts with the UK, Germany and France. EVA Airlines now has a direct service, via Bangkok, between Taipei and London and will soon start a service to Paris. China Airlines (CAL) in September initiated a Taipei-Bangkok-Amsterdam-Frankfurt service. Subsidiaries of British Airways and Air France also now operate flights to Taipei. Where to stay should be determined by the visitor's centre of activity. Lobbyists should consider hotels close to Taipei's key centres of political influence. The Taipei Hilton or the Lai Lai Sheraton are both a short walk from the Executive Yuan (or cabinet) and the Legislative Yuan and near to other key agencies such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Interior. The main disadvantage of their locations on Chung Hsiao West and East Road, respectively, is that a main line of the Taipei mass transit system is now being built under this six-lane avenue. Executives rushing from the Hilton or Lai Lai to business appointments in eastern Taipei will learn first-hand why most residents complain daily about the 'black age' in city transport. A compromise choice for those whose schedules are weighted with both political and corporate appointments are a number of hotels on Chung Shan North Road, including the Formosa Regent, the Fortuna, the Ambassador, Royal and the President. Transportation from these hotels to the political zone is quick, and many local and foreign companies have offices on Chung Shan N. Road, along the city's main north-south corridor. These north-side hotels are also close to the city's traditional night-life zones. Businessmen whose agenda is dominated by corporate appointments should choose a hotel on the east side, where most key companies and business organisations now have their headquarters. Among the superior hotels in this region are the Ritz, Howard Plaza, Sherwood, Asiaworld, Brother, Magnolia or Holiday Inn. Businessmen whose main purpose is to participate in trade shows, international conferences or make trade contacts should consider the Hyatt near the World Trade Center on the extreme east of the city. Most local hotels offer tour packages for businessmen or their families who have time to take in some of the island's sights. Outside Taipei: Visitors should not think that the rest of theisland resembles Taipei. Taiwan's coast and mountain regions have a number of attractive scenic locations, including Alishan (Mount Ali) and Taroko Gorge. Time off: The most notable of Taipei's museums is the National Palace Museum, which contains many art treasures removed by the Nationalists when they fled to Taiwan in 1948-49 (Tel: 886-2-881-2021; Fax: 882- 1440). Taipei now boasts several fine venues, including the National Concert Hall and the National Theatre in central Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park. Visitors interested in local handicrafts may consider a visit to the Taiwan Handicraft Promotion Centre on 1 Hsu Chou Rd, Taipei (Tel: 02 321-7233). The best part of a visit to Taiwan is the food. Visitors are strongly advised to get out of their hotels and explore. Various Chinese regional cuisines can be enjoyed - and may be ordered by simply pointing at menus by those lacking Chinese linguistic skills. An ideal place to try Taiwanese food is 'Green Leaf' (Ching Yeh) on Chung shan North Road. An alternative is a later competitor, 'New Leaf' (Shin Yeh), which has several locations in Taipei.</p>

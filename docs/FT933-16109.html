			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Industry gives cautious welcome: Nuclear plans unchanged DEFENCE CONTRACTORS cautiously welcomed the details of cuts and procurement plans in yesterday's white paper. Few contracts were cancelled, and the reduction in the numbers of conventionally powered submarines and Tornado fighter aircraft should be achieved through the decommissioning or sale of existing equipment. Mr Brian Lowe, chairman of the Defence Manufacturers' Association, said: 'The industry could be reasonably relieved that most of the cuts are lost opportunities to refurbish rather than cancelled orders.' Among those hearing bad news were GEC and British Aerospace, which were competing for one of the two cancelled missile contracts, the Pounds 500m-plus medium range surface to air missile to replace the Bloodhound missile. But both companies shrugged off the news. 'We've known for some time this was likely to happen,' said BAe, which was bidding with Raytheon of the US. GEC, which had joined forces with Thomson and Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia, would have contributed only about 10 per cent of the contract on an industrial level with its radar-seeking equipment, but it has lost its chance to become a prime contractor to the UK in the project. GEC and BAe said the cancellations were unlikely to lead to job cuts. They are working in international consortia which are selling their missiles to several markets other than the UK. Thorn EMI may lose 200 jobs as a result of the MoD's withdrawal from a four-nation collaborative programme to develop a ground-launched Multiple Launch Rocket System. The company is hanging on to the slim hope that it may be involved in the supply of an air-launched version. At the other end of the scale, Southampton shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft could receive orders for new mine-hunting ships worth up to Pounds 350m as a result of plans in the white paper to 'build up a fleet of 25 mine countermeasure vessels'. Mr Martin Jay, managing director of Vosper, said: 'We're delighted that the white paper seems to recognise the importance of minehunters in general and Sandown class in particular.' Helicopter-maker Westland said that it was 'good news' that the white paper specified a need for additional support helicopters. The company's EH101 helicopter is a strong candidate for the business. Staff at Swan Hunter said the yard would try to bid for the refurbishment of the Sir Bedivere, announced in the white paper, although previously such contracts have gone to state-owned military yards. The contract would be worth about Pounds 30m to the Tyneside yard, which is fighting for survival after losing a contract to build a helicopter carrier to VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness. A decision on the production of a further 200 Challenger 2 main battle tanks by Vickers remained unresolved. The white paper said the MoD is still considering how best to equip the Army's tank regiments.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Vaccines venture wins approval A joint venture between Merck, the US pharmaceuticals company, and Pasteur-Merieux, a subsidiary of the French pharmaceutical group Merieux, has been approved by the European Commission pending further public comment. The Commission had originally indicated that the venture, which plans to develop new vaccines for diseases such as diphtheria and tetanus, would breach EU competition rules. But officials said it was exempted because of its potential public health benefits and because the companies had offered to grant distribution rights and manufacturing licences to other companies.</p>

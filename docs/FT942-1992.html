			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / People: Non-executive directors Nigel Rudd, 47, chairman of Williams Holdings, is severing his ties with one of the three Derby companies he has been involved with for many years. He is stepping down as a director of Raine Industries, the building materials group that he chaired for six years. He will retire as vice chairman and leave the board after the next agm. Trevor Finn, 36, chief executive of Pendragon, the up-market car distributor floated off by Williams four years ago, joins the board on July 1. Peter Parkin, Raine's chairman, says the fact that Rudd is chairman of Pendragon, which is based a block away from Williams on Derby's Sir Frank Whittle Road, had nothing to do with Finn's appointment. Parkin, who chairs Raine's nominations committee, says he had been looking for 'a young, successful chief executive of a plc operating in the Derby area'.</p>

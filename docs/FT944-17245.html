			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Iraq Menaces Kuwait: With gun in hand, Saddam goes back to the brink - Leaning on Security Council seems to be Iraqi leader's main motive - but his threat has already failed Once again President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, has forced the world at gunpoint to try to guess his motives and intentions. His apparent motive in ordering the massing of tens of thousands of troops and supporting armour near the border with Kuwait is, as the past week's bitter rhetoric from Baghdad suggests, to give the United Nations Security Council an ultimatum: take immediate steps to ease the crippling oil embargo or suffer the 'consequences'. This threat appears already to have failed. An emergency weekend meeting of the Council stated the 'complete unacceptability' of Iraq's threat to cease co-operating with the UN over implementation of Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. Instead, his actions appear only to have confirmed that the Saddam of the Gulf war is unchanged - that he is, in the words of the Washington Post last week, 'an unregenerated potential repeat offender', a leader whose primary foreign policy tool is force and who is entirely capable of the dangerous, unpredictable, apparently illogical and almost certainly self-defeating gesture. The limited logic of his action appears to be to suggest to the Security Council, and in particular Britain and the US as the members most resistant to alleviating the four-year-old oil embargo, that unless he is given immediate hope that the sanctions will be lifted, he can and will be a dangerous nuisance in the Gulf. The mobilisation of US and British forces already shows he can quickly force costly military deployments into a region which, outside Kuwait at least, remains uneasy at the thought of a permanent US military presence. Mr Saddam's immediate target is the Security Council discussion due this week on the readiness of long-term monitoring systems installed to prevent Iraq from renewing acquisition or manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN envoy, will report that these systems are ready and a test period can begin. And before Iraqi troops moved south, there was strong sympathy among some Council members, notably France, China and Russia, for giving Iraq a definite 'probationary' test period, after which the lifting of sanctions should be discussed. Whether such sympathy will survive Mr Saddam's belligerent troop deployment must be highly unlikely. 'It's brinkmanship,' said one senior Arab diplomat. 'But what Saddam has not learned is that his brinkmanship usually rebounds on him.' Perhaps more damaging to Mr Saddam's case is that the Security Council is unanimous in requiring that, before anything can be done to lift sanctions, Iraq must unequivocally recognise both Kuwait's sovereignty and the post-Gulf war UN-demarcated borders between the two countries. By threatening this very border, Mr Saddam has suggested an instinctive refusal to recognise it and made it hard to take credibly any eventual recognition he might decide, or be forced, to accord. His actions only appear to strengthen the argument of those, like the Kuwaitis themselves, who say that sanctions could never safely be lifted while he remains in power. Iraqi officials have made clear that they believe this to be US policy, although Washington denies this. The US has certainly maintained the hardest line against offering Mr Saddam any concessions in recent weeks and, before the troop movements, were beginning to look isolated within the Security Council. Even British officials have suggested privately that had Iraq behaved during a six-month testing of the UN weapons monitoring systems, they would then be forced to consider seriously easing the embargo. Iraq may now have lost this diplomatic ground it had been winning. But to see Mr Saddam's renewed aggression solely in terms of influencing debate around the Security Council table may be a mistake. Like most Middle Eastern leaders, his most basic motivation is to take whatever actions he deems necessary to remain in power. This, for 15 years, he has done with genocidal brutality, but with success - crushing Kurdish, Shia and any other domestic political opposition and of course, surviving ignominious defeat in the Gulf war and four economically ruinous years without selling oil, previously the fount of more than 90 per cent of Iraq's earnings. But there have been recent clear signs that the regime may be wobbling under the accumulated effects of sanctions. Iraq is so short of food that government rations, on which most Iraqis rely for two thirds of their basic nutritional intake, recently had to be halved. Rocketing inflation has driven all but Iraq's elite into penury. Army desertion has become so rife that Mr Saddam recently ordered that deserters should have their ears severed. Similarly brutal punishments have been decreed for common criminals in what recent visitors to Iraq say has becoming a dangerously lawless place. There have been recent reports of Mr Saddam having to crush opposition within the army. If such things have pushed Mr Saddam close to desperation, it is also the case that he has little room to manoeuvre. He may well consider a military adventure the best, perhaps even the only, means of reasserting his leadership and distracting opponents. At least one western diplomat in the region wondered over the weekend whether, having survived the Gulf war's allied bombardment, Mr Saddam might believe that inviting another war was his best hope of persuading the Iraqi people that the US, Britain and the west are the true enemies responsible for their suffering, while attempting once again to stoke up Islamic groups and anti-American feeling within the region. According to Arab diplomats, there have been recent attempts to persuade Mr Saddam that his best hope for an eventual lifting of sanctions lay in sitting out UN weapons monitoring programme for six months, formally recognising Kuwait's sovereignty and continuing to lobby fiercely for a humanitarian reprieve. Many influential Arab states, among them Egypt, might then have been able to rally strongly behind attempts to lift the embargo. But Mr Saddam seems to have ignored this advice. The quality of independent information arriving to him in Baghdad is almost certainly worse now than four years ago. At the same time, Mr Saddam is clearly more desperate today than in August 1990. Conventional wisdom among Arab and western diplomats, echoed widely in yesterday's Arab press, is that Mr Saddam is once again bluffing. One Saudi paper, al-Riyadh, even suggested the Iraqi leader was making a last defiant gesture before conceding to the recognition of Kuwait. 'Fabricating a military situation is nothing more than prelude to more concessions,' it said. No-one doubts it would be folly for Mr Saddam to push his troops further south. Given his record, however, few observers can confidently exempt him from the capacity for folly.</p>

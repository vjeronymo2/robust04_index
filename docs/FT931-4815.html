			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: European impetus for global equities Europe provided most of the impetus for global equities last week. But a 1.7 per cent gain, leaving the FT-Actuaries World Index up 0.4 per cent in local currency terms, eventually owed little to the German interest rate prospects which seemed to obsess bourses earlier in the week. Friday's big event - a repo rate cut by the Bundesbank, after it refused to alter the discount and Lombard rates on Thursday - had a negligible effect in France and Germany, serving mainly to cheer up the UK market ahead of Mr Norman Lamont's Budget statement a week today. The big winners on the Continent were Finland and Italy. Both Helsinki and Milan have had a good start to the year; both have seen devaluations and, especially in the former, gains have come to more in local currency terms than when measured in the dollar. Devaluation has had its positive effects, notes Mr Peter Tron of Unibank in London. Finland's strength, especially last week, reflected results from cyclical industrial and forestry groups, with the devaluation effect translated into reduced losses for 1992, and the prospect of positive earnings for the current year. Italy, meanwhile, has been accentuating the positive in somewhat similar fashion, but with more obvious influences on the downside. The country's growing corruption scandal, moving higher and higher up the political and corporate hierarchies, seems to have been effectively discounted as investors chose to concentrate on the cheaper lira and lower interest rates which devaluation brought in its wake. Also performing well last week was Mexico, retrieving some of its losses of the week and, indeed, of the two months before. Commentators said that a market destabilised by President Bill Clinton's equivocal commitment to the North American Free Trade Agreement seemed to have decided that Mr Clinton was solidly behind Nafta after all.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     % change   % change                    % change in local currency *     sterling *   in US                                                                 Dollars*               1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of  Start of   Start of                                              1993     1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        +2.68    +6.21   -16.54      +9.46   +11.14       +6.15 Belgium        +1.52    +1.08    +0.62      +9.37   +11.34       +6.33 Denmark        +1.53    -0.75   -16.30     +10.45   +13.48       +8.38 Finland        +6.51   +16.61   +21.93     +24.22   +12.72       +7.66 France         +0.63    +4.95    +1.72      +8.73   +11.28       +6.28 Germany        +0.38    +3.16    -6.63     +10.30   +12.20       +7.16 Ireland        +3.15    +1.94    -5.87     +13.02    +6.12       +1.36 Italy          +4.45    +7.17   +10.68     +24.08   +21.53      +16.07 Netherlands    +2.40    +4.84    +7.42      +9.86   +11.64       +6.63 Norway         +2.08    +1.39    -9.85      +4.02    +6.91       +2.11 Spain          +2.03    -0.56    -7.48     +12.63   +13.81       +8.70 Sweden         +2.82   +10.06   +16.78      +9.12    +4.43       -0.26 Switzerland    +1.70    +0.67   +14.83      +3.63    +2.86       -1.77 UK             +1.93    +1.91   +16.19      +3.46    +3.46       -1.19 EUROPE         +1.71    +3.00    +7.24      +7.26    +7.73       +2.89  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia      +0.44    +5.30    -1.12      +4.14   +12.24       +7.19 Hong Kong      +2.23   +14.38   +26.97     +18.15   +23.85      +18.29 Japan          -1.48    -3.30   -15.28      -3.12    +7.64       +2.81 Malaysia       +0.63    +2.82   +17.22      +6.38   +11.23       +6.24 New Zealand    +0.70    +2.28    +3.51      +3.11   +10.69       +5.71 Singapore      +0.20    +1.08    +5.81      +4.71    +9.30       +4.39 Canada         +1.86    +3.64    -4.18      +3.80   +10.64       +5.67 USA            +0.58    -0.70    +9.70      +2.27    +7.80       +2.27 Mexico         +6.86    -4.07   -11.44      -9.10    -4.31       -8.60 South Africa   -1.17    -2.25    -7.83      +4.09   +16.41      +11.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX    +0.39    -0.11    +1.22      +2.32    +7.80       +2.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on March 5th 1993.

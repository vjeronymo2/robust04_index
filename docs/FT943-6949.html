			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Moscow stalks Chechens' rebel state: The mountain region's independence looks increasingly shaky The embattled government of the break-away Russian region of Chechnya brought thousands of supporters by bus to the capital Grozny yesterday to defend its stand against political challenges from Moscow and armed local rivals. This was all very well, except for the 10,000 people gathered at an opposition rally 5km away, celebrating - mistakenly - the supposed resignation of President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Nearly three years ago, the Chechens, a mountain people in the Caucasus renowned for their fierce military traditions, asserted their independence from Russia with Mr Dudayev, a charismatic former Soviet air force general, as their leader. Over the past few months, however, the sovereignty of the increasingly impoverished region, and Mr Dudayev's rule, have been threatened as Moscow has sought to bring the rebels to heel and internal opposition has grown. 'Russia still wants to enslave us,' Mr Dudayev - clearly still in office - told about 3,000 supporters gathered yesterday in Grozny's central square. 'Russia has declared there can be no free republic inhabited by free people.' Some 15 black-clad presidential guards, their Kalashnikovs at the ready, stood on a balcony above Mr Dudayev as he spoke while dozens of his backers in the square below broke into the frenetic dancing, chanting and drumming of the mystical Islamic Sufi sect. 'We are dancing in support of Dudayev and the sovereignty of the country,' said Mr Akhmad Makhmudov, a local Islamic religious leader. At about the same time, in the nearby town of Sunzha, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the former leader of the Russian parliament who was ousted last year after a bloody power struggle with President Boris Yeltsin, declared that Mr Dudayev's government had been dissolved. An ethnic Chechen who has returned to his homeland in an effort to launch a political comeback, Mr Khasbulatov made his claim at a rally of heavily armed opponents to Mr Dudayev's regime. Among their weapons were two Russian army helicopters. Some opposition leaders have said they have been armed by Russian military. The two political rallies came against a backdrop of an increasingly tense tug-of-war between a Russian government trying to keep the federation together, and the maverick Mr Dudayev. Over the past three years the Chechen leader has repeatedly challenged Moscow's suzerainty over his oil-rich north Caucasus republic, and in the past month Mr Yeltsin has stepped up pressure to topple him. Local analysts do not expect Mr Dudayev to be ousted soon but they say his conflict with Russian-backed opposition forces is coming to a head. The power struggle is complicated by the intricate clan-based loyalties which dominate local politics, and the region's unforgiving warrior traditions. One product of this culture is Mr Ruslan Labazanov, a 26-year-old warlord who appears to have taken control of a region 100km north of Grozny. Formerly a Dudayev supporter, he declared a blood feud against the president last month and has now emerged, seemingly heavily armed, in support of Mr Khasbulatov. Mr Dudayev's regime has been marked by his reliance on armed force and the effective support it has enjoyed from a powerful, locally based mafia which reaches into Moscow, other areas of Russia and even western Europe. Mr Dudayev has also successfully tapped his people's deep-seated hostility towards Russia based on a centuries-old struggle for independence and on Stalin's mass deportation of Chechens to Central Asia after the second world war. Russian government efforts to unseat Mr Dudayev, which include a fierce rhetorical attack in the media but have fallen short of direct military intervention, have increased as lawlessness has spread from Chechnya to other areas of southern Russia. A turning point for Russian public opinion came last month when Chechen nationals kidnapped several people in the nearby Caucasus city of Mineralnye Vody. Five of the hostages were killed in the rescue attempt. Russian officials have accused Mr Dudayev of providing a sanctuary for Chechen gangsters and have claimed that Chechnya is a country run by and for criminals.</p>

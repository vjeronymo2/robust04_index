			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the $500 million market capitalization/80 million share trading volume standard and the flexibility, with the concurrence of the Commission, to list issues of SEEDS that do not satisfy the market capitalization and trading volume requirements, are the only significant modifications to the SEEDS listing standards from those currently in place for the listing of ELDS at the NYSE and for the listing of ELNs at the Amex. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The additional tier for trading volume and market capitalization is warranted, the NASD believes, because trading volume is a better barometer for market liquidity than market capitalization. Accordingly, the NASD believes imposing a higher trading volume standard and a lower market capitalization standard will not jeopardize the integrity of the market for the linked security. Moreover, the NASD notes that the minimum market capitalization requirement will still be $500 million, assuring that the linked security is issued by a sufficiently large company capable of underlying SEEDS without any disruption to the market for its common stock. The NASD also believes that the flexibility to list issues of SEEDS not satisfying the objective criteria is appropriate for those cases where the NASD, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, determines, based on factors including, among others, public float and affiliations between the issuer of the SEEDS and the issuer of the linked security, in addition to market capitalization and trading volume, that the listing of the SEEDS does not raise any material market manipulation or investor protection concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the market capitalization and trading volume requirements, the issuer of the linked security must be a reporting company under the Act. The underlying linked security also must be traded through Nasdaq or on a national securities exchange and be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act. In addition, consistent with the Amex and NYSE proposals recently approved by the Commission, <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  the NASD proposes to permit SEEDS on certain non-U.S. companies <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  subject to reporting requirements under the Act whose securities are traded in the United States either as ordinary shares or sponsored ADRs, provided there are at least 2,000 holders of the underlying linked security. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Exchange Act Release Nos. 34545 and 34549,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD defines a non-U.S. company as any company formed or incorporated outside of the U.S. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, a SEEDS could be listed on a non-U.S. company that is subject to reporting requirements in the U.S. when ordinary shares or sponsored ADRs representing that company are traded in the United States if: (1) The NASD has a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the primary exchange in the country where the security is primarily traded (in the case of an ADR, the primary exchange on which the security underlying the ADR is traded); or (2) the combined trading volume of the underlying security and other related securities occurring in the U.S. market represents (on a share equivalent basis for any ADRs) at least 50% of the combined worldwide trading volume in the underlying security, other related securities, and other classes of common stock related to the underlying security over the six-month period preceding the date of designation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Exchange Act Release Nos. 34545 and 34549,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4; and Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Limitations of the Size of Particular SEEDS Offerings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Without the approval of the Commission, the issuance of SEEDS relating to any underlying U.S. security may not exceed five percent of the total outstanding shares of such underlying security.

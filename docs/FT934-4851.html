			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Purchasing index points to US growth Reports of rising confidence in the US manufacturing sector and a strong gain in construction spending yesterday provided further evidence of buoyant economic growth in the current quarter. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the manufacturing outlook - rose to 55.7 per cent last month against 53.8 in October. The new orders component of the index soared to 64.8 per cent, one of the strongest results since the Reagan boom of the late 1980s. This was the third consecutive monthly gain in the overall purchasing index and the strongest reading since the beginning of the year, when factory output was lifted by a surge of demand at the end of 1992. Figures above 50 per cent indicate that the manufacturing economy is expanding. Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose by 2.5 per cent in October and 9.8 per cent compared with the same period last year. This was the sixth consecutive increase in construction spending, the longest string of increases for seven years. Trade figures yesterday confirmed that the speed-up of growth is causing a deterioration of the US external account. In the third quarter, the merchandise trade deficit rose 5.5 per cent to Dollars 34.4bn (Pounds 23bn), the biggest quarterly deficit for six years. Officials also announced a slight revision to third-quarter growth figures. Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent rather than the 2.8 per cent previously reported. Growth of consumer spending and business investment was revised up, but the positive impact on growth was more than offset by upward revisions to the US trade deficit. 'The figures confirm that this quarter will be very strong,' said Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, the US financial services group. He predicted growth at an annual rate of '4.5 per cent or perhaps even higher'. Many forecasters, including Mr Steinberg, expect the pace of growth to moderate early next year to an annual rate of 3 per cent or slightly less because consumer spending has outstripped growth of personal incomes, pushing the savings rate to a near record low.</p>

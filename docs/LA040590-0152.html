			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS GET A LESSON IN HOW COLD WAR CAN HEAT UP  </P> <P> It was billed as a speech on perestroika. Instead, it became an illuminating  lesson on the legacy of the Cold War.  </P> <P> Eager to give their students a global perspective, administrators at Sierra  Nevada College on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe invited a Soviet diplomat to  the campus to discuss the political and economic changes convulsing the Soviet  Union. Gennady Zolotov, the deputy consul general in San Francisco, graciously  agreed, and a date for the lakeside mini-summit was set.  </P> <P> Then politics got in the way.  </P> <P> On the other side of the globe, an American diplomat in Leningrad was denied  permission to travel into Lithuania the day before last Friday's scheduled  speech at the tiny college. So the State Department, in a tit-for-tat policy  dating to the 1950s, promptly called Zolotov in San Francisco and told him to  unpack. He was informed that the special permission he needs to journey more  than 25 miles beyond the consulate had been revoked. His trip to the mountains  was off.  </P> <P> "It wasn't retaliation," State Department public affairs representative Chuck  Steiner said. "It was just an in-kind response. They denied our request, so we  denied theirs. It's been a long-held rule between the two countries."  </P> <P> Foreign affairs officer Kim Lamberty added, "We didn't zap this guy on purpose.  . . . It just so happened (Zolotov) was the next (Soviet diplomat) scheduled to  travel" in the United States.  </P> <P> College officials, expecting a crowd of several hundred students and community  leaders at their event, protested heartily. But it was no use.  </P> <P> "It seems pretty petty and immature to me," college dean Mark Hurtubise said,  recalling his fruitless pleadings with Washington. "Why couldn't we have been a  role model rather than resorting to the same type of activity we criticize in  other countries?"  </P> <P> The episode has become something of a cause celebre in Incline Village, the  small, woodsy town two miles from the California state line where Sierra Nevada  College is located. Last year, the 500-student liberal arts school hosted the  consul general from San Francisco, Sergei Aivazian, and his appearance was a  smash hit.  </P> <P> Referring to the turmoil in the Soviet Union sparked by Lithuania's declaration  of independence from Moscow on March 11, Hurtubise said: "We figured it was a  great time to bring another Soviet official to our campus."  </P> <P> In addition to Zolotov's speech, a weekend of events -- including tete-a-tetes  with local politicians and hiking in the surrounding mountains -- were planned  for the diplomat.  </P> <P> "Gennady was going to bring his wife, Valentina, and they were going to stay at  our house," Hurtubise said. "Everyone was looking forward to it."  </P> <P> Zolotov did not return telephone calls from The Times. But reaction to the news  in Incline Village has been "disappointment and disbelief," college spokeswoman  Roz Parry said. Callers from the community "basically agreed the whole thing  was childish," while students were puzzled by what looked to them like State  Department paranoia over an innocent social visit, she said.  </P> <P> "The students thought it was quite ironic, since the topic of the speech was  perestroika and glasnost, that their own government would deny them the  opportunity to hear new ideas," Parry said. "We had hoped they would  reconsider, as a gesture of openness, but they said a policy is a policy."  </P> <P> Hurtubise is an optimist, however, and is hopeful the speech can be  rescheduled. Perhaps by next semester, he reasons, chilly international  relations -- like the frosting of snow on the peaks surrounding Lake Tahoe's  sparkling waters -- will have thawed.  </P></p>

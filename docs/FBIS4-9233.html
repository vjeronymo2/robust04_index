			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1993 -- The second plenary  session of the Crans Montana conference started on Thursday [21  April] afternoon, on "Economic Perspectives for the Middle East  in the Aftermath of the Israel-PLO Peace Accord," which had  President Ion Iliescu as moderator for Romania.    The other moderators were: Jean-Paul Carteron, president of  the Crans Montana Forum Foundation, Yasir 'Arafat, president of  the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation  Organization, Shim'on Peres, Israeli minister of foreign  affairs, and Fathi Surur, president of the People's Assembly of  Egypt.    Opening the session, President Ion Iliescu expressed his  satisfaction at the privilege to be the moderator of the  discussions of the two politicians who have assumed the  difficult task to break the deadlock and start negotiations that  should give shape to peace in the Middle East. Stressing in  this respect the courage and realistic-mindedness of 'Arafat and  Peres, President Iliescu highlighted also the contribution of  Egypt, an important promoter of the peace negotiations in the  Middle East. He considers that new ways are about to be found  for the overcoming of the conflict situation, suggesting to the  international community to back the efforts of the two, who are  currently under powerful pressure.    President Iliescu recalled Minister Peres' saying that one  would find money more easily for weapons than for building  peace, and stressed it was the duty of the international  community to back these two politicians in their constructive  effort. Also, he hoped the Bucharest meeting would help the  attainment of the desideratum of peace for which 'Arafat and  Peres worked.</p>

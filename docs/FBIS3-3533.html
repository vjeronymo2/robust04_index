Statistics from local agricultural departments show that by  early March local farmers had got 420,000 ha of farmland  levelled for spring farming, one third of the area to be  levelled.    They have transplanted rice seedlings on about 57,333 ha of  farmland, accounting for more than a half of the planned  transplanting area and at a faster rate than last year.    At the same time, they have also planted 554,000 ha of  spring  crops such as sugarcane, peanuts and vegetables, completing 70  percent of the set plan.    To make a success of this year's spring farming, different  localities had made good preparations and drawn up careful plans  before the traditional spring festival in early February.    Leaders from Shantou city led a working group shortly after  the spring festival to conduct investigations in rural areas,  and organized assistance for agricultural production with the  purpose of making a success of the spring farming and to achieve  a better grain harvest. The city fulfilled its task of seed  sowing before March 5.    Meanwhile, different localities have also attached great  importance to the work of including idle farmland in spring  farming. They have worked out a series of preferential policies  to encourage farmers to transplant rice seedlings on more idle  farmland in a bid to fulfill the grain-growing plan.</p>

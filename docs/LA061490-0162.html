			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CHARGE REDUCED IN INJURY OF STORE CLERK  </P> <P> Citing lack of evidence, prosecutors reduced a charge of attempted murder to  assault and battery against a Marine Corps recruiter accused of attacking a  supermarket clerk after an argument.  </P> <P> "After receiving additional reports and further investigation, we don't believe  we can prove an actual intent to kill," said Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> James W. Hicks.  </P> <P> Sgt. Juan Rodriguez, 29, of Irvine, a former boxer, is accused of assaulting  Larry Lamar Hatch, 22, of Garden Grove, during a confrontation in the parking  lot of an Albertson's supermarket in Anaheim on April 27.  </P> <P> Rodriguez now faces charges of assault with a deadly weapon and battery in  North Orange County Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Police say Rodriguez was arguing with Hatch and several other workers in the  store parking lot when the fight broke out, leaving Hatch unconscious after  Rodriguez allegedly hit him twice.  </P> <P> Rodriguez was confined to the Marine base in El Toro following the incident,  which left Hatch in a coma. Hatch has since regained consciousness and is  listed in fair condition at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Hicks said he does not expect the reduced charges to alter the court order  confining Rodriguez to the base.  </P> <P> Rodriguez's attorney, Dennis O'Connell, who has contended that his client was  acting in self-defense, said Wednesday that the case proceeded before all the  evidence could be collected.  </P> <P> "There was never a factual basis for the charge of attempted murder," he said.

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / British Alcan renews coal supply arrangements BRITISH ALCAN, the aluminium smelter based in north-east England and British Coal's largest manufacturing customer, has renewed supply arrangements for 1.2m tonnes of coal a year from Ellington colliery, Northumberland, Chris Tighe writes. British Coal, which sells about 6m tonnes a year in the industrial market, has also announced further orders worth Pounds 40m from industrial companies for almost 1m tonnes of deep-mined and opencast coal. They include an order for 500,000 tonnes over three years from Fife-based papermaker Tullis Russell, a new customer. There is also a new contract from Scottish Power for 200,000 tonnes. Ellington, which employs 1,600 people, is the only one of the north-east's five remaining collieries not earmarked for closure in the October 1992 list of 31 pits. It was ranked bottom, however, among the remaining 19 collieries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Tihomir Vinkovic from Geneva] </F>   [Text] There has been no progress in the negotiations on  the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At a plenary session presided  over by peace mediators Owen and Stoltenberg, the Bosnian Serbs  demanded that an international commission for establishing the  crime at the Sarajevo marketplace should include both Serb and  Muslim representatives. The Muslims refused, saying that the  perpetrators, who they are convinced are the Serbs, could not  take part in the investigation of the crime.    Owen and Stoltenberg are trying to salvage the negotiations.  The mandate of the Geneva conference are peace negotiations,  not individual cases. This is a task for UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces], Lord Owen says. The basis for the Geneva  negotiations on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina is a European  Union plan. Croatia accepts this plan, Croatian Foreign Affairs  Minister Mate Granic clearly said. Croatia, as well as a Croat  delegation from Bosnia-Herzegovina, led by Mile Akmadzic,  proposes international supervision of borders between Croatia  and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats also propose inspection of  military formations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, through which Muslim  allegations that the regular Army of the Republic of Croatia is  fighting within the ranks of the Bosnian Croats would be denied.    The Croat delegation urges that an international commission  should investigate last week's crime at the Sarajevo  marketplace, but negotiations ought to be continued. The Croats  also agree with the establishment of hot lines as a  trust-building measure and the exchange of representatives of  the three nations, as proposed by Owen and Stoltenberg. While I  am reporting, there is a break in the plenary session, the  resumption of which is expected soon.</p>

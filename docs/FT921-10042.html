			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Molson ahead after nine months HIGHER BEER sales in the US and a cleaning-services acquisition helped Molson, the diversified Canadian brewer, lift net earnings to CDollars 110.4m (USDollars 94.3m) in the nine months to December 31, from CDollars 105.5m a year earlier, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Per share earnings dropped from CDollars 1.99 to CDollars 1.97 as a result of a share split last July. Sales rose to CDollars 2.25bn from CDollars 1.98bn. Interest expenses jumped to CDollars 43.2m from CDollars 19.7m. Molson Breweries, a joint venture with Foster's Brewing of Australia, raised operating earnings by 22 per cent to CDollars 136.3m. The figures exclude the company's return on preferred shares and the amortisation of a deferred gain arising from the 1989 brewing merger. The company is the second biggest supplier of imported beer to the US, with a market share last year of 17 per cent. Molson Breweries' share of the Canadian market was steady at 52 per cent, but volume for the industry as a whole declined by 1.7 per cent in the nine months. Operating earnings of Diversey Corporation, Molson's cleaning-services unit, jumped by 39 per cent to CDollars 50m.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (7): Success harks back to the city's origins - Fund Management Whatever else may have gone wrong with the Massachusetts economy in the late 1980s, Boston's fund management industry never missed a beat. At the tail-end of the boom in 1989, Boston-based Fidelity, America's biggest fund manager, had Dollars 109bn under management and 6,500 employees. It now manages Dollars 295bn and employs 14,100. Bostonians have a sense of history, and explanations of their success in fund management tend to hark back to the city's origins. Mr Daniel Pierce, chairman of Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark (funds under management: Dollars 90bn-plus) says: 'In many ways, Boston is the cradle of investment management. It probably goes back to the point where wealth was created in this country on the east coast rather than the west coast. 'The legal concept of the prudent man came up through the courts here in Massachusetts, and people became trustees here in the days when you managed money out of your hip pocket.' Professor Michael Porter, of the Harvard Business School, agrees: 'Massachusetts always had a financial centre: it's where the industrial revolution really started. When you get critical mass, you start a chain reaction. 'Every company that makes a presentation to analysts comes to Boston - you can hit 100 institutions here. The State Street Bank and the Bank of Boston are among the country's biggest custodians. And talented people in the financial community like living in Boston - it's an intellectual community and a nice place to live.' Scudder, according to Mr Pierce, can claim to have been America's first pure investment manager, having been formed in 1919. Scudder, Stevens and Clark were Harvard graduates who started out in broking as bond salesmen. 'One of their clients was the head of the Boston Fed,' Mr Pierce says. 'They came up with a service for him based on a fee for assets under management. So they came up with the investment counsel concept.' The success of up-market Boston firms such as Scudder is partly based on an adroit combination of professionalism and genteel discretion. Private clients with a net worth of Dollars 1m-Dollars 2m, Mr Pierce remarks, are Scudder's bread and butter. Many of them are not from Boston. 'I've had a lot of good clients from New Orleans. That's an even tinier place than Boston, so perhaps privacy is an element there.' Another part of Boston's success is based precisely on its distance from New York. There is an intriguing British parallel in the investment centre of Edinburgh, where fund managers like to argue that they gain in objectivity by viewing the London market from afar. 'With modern communications you can have analysts anywhere,' Mr Pierce says. 'But in New York, you can get quite swept up by the emotions of the market. People get quite hysterical down there. 'Part of our job is to be a stabilising influence, and that's easier when you're away from the screaming and yelling.' Nevertheless, he concedes, New York tends to have the more international outlook. That is important to Scudder, which is quite unusual among US firms in its international exposure. Against a US industry average of 7-9 per cent of assets invested abroad, Scudder has 30-35 per cent. In equities, it has more money invested abroad than at home; and while the bulk of its bond business is handled out of Boston, most of its global equity funds are run out of New York. But the mutual fund industry continues to increase its employment in Massachusetts. According to Fidelity, its US employment has risen 33 per cent since August 1993 to 13,900: its Massachusetts employment has risen 24 per cent to 6,700. Thus, Ms Connie Hubble, of Fidelity, points out, while the firm's 7m customers are spread across the US, half its employees are still in Massachusetts. 'This is our home and our heritage, and it will remain that way,' she says. This fact has been a godsend to the local real-estate market, which has never really recovered its nerve since the crash of 1989. Scudder has just started building a 110,000 sq ft office building 15 miles to the south of Boston - the first such new building in the area for years. According to an estimate quoted recently in the New York Times, the mutual-fund industry now occupies 8.5m sq ft in the Boston metropolitan area, compared with 3m in 1989. Looking forward, the Boston fund management community may find it hard to combine explosive growth with regional loyalty. However, it seems committed to trying. 'Our objective,' says Mr Pierce, 'is to be a pre-eminent global investment firm. I don't think you have to give up your heritage to do that.'</p>

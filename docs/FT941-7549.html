			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Practise what you preach Sir, I read with interest your article about government-sponsored guidelines for company directors (Management: 'Boardrooms pressed on standards', February 21). They should establish the company's vision, mission and values; set strategy and structure; supervise management and be responsible to stakeholders. The chairman must ensure the board is structured correctly. Would that Britain's prime minister and cabinet did what they would have others do.

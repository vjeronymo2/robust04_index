			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP SCOREBOARD  </P> <P> UPSETS  </P> <P> Paramount High School quarterback Jack Manu threw four touchdown passes and ran  for another as the Pirates defeated the county's top-ranked team, Capistrano  Valley, 36-35, to advance to the championship game of the Division III  playoffs. Manu kicked two conversions and passed for a pair of two-point  conversions, including the game-winner in overtime.  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills tailback Ben Rooker, who missed five games after having  arthroscopic knee surgery three games into the season, rushed for 200 yards and  a pair of touchdowns in 23 carries in the Mustangs' 48-21 Division VIII  semifinal victory over Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Brian Remmel rushed for 282 yards on 25 carries, including 220 in the first  half, and scored touchdowns on runs of 78, one and 94 yards, to lift Orange to  a 35-22 victory over Agoura and into the championship game of the Division III  playoffs.  </P> <P> ODDS AND ENDS  </P> <P> Be True to Your School: Administrators at La Quinta High School offered its  students free bus transportation to La Mirada for the Aztecs' Division VI  semifinal game but had to cancel the free trip when only eight students signed  up for the free ride. The lack of school spirit didn't hurt La Quinta, however,  as the Aztecs beat La Mirada, 20-7, to advance to the championship game.  </P> <P> SHOWDOWNS  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills' 48-21 victory over Santa Clara put the defending Division VIII  champion Mustangs in an all-Pacific Coast League final for the second year in a  row. Trabuco Hills, which will meet Orange in next week's championship game,  defeated Woodbridge for the title a year ago.  </P> <P> LATE HEROICS  </P> <P> El Toro's Danny Maestas scored on a four-yard run in overtime, then intercepted  a pass on the final play of the game to give the Chargers a 28-21 Division III  semifinal victory over Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD  </P> <P> "Yeah, I'm very much surprised. Are you kidding? Aren't you?"  </P> <P>  -- Dave Holland, Corona del Mar coach, after his Sea Kings had stunned  previously unbeaten Sunny Hills, 27-0.  </P></p>

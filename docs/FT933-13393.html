			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / China looks to cool its red-hot economy and restrain inflation CHINA'S State Statistical Bureau said yesterday the economy grew in the first half by an annual rate of 13.9 per cent, more than a full percentage point higher than the 12.8 per cent recorded for all of 1992. Mr Zhang Zhongji, a bureau spokesman, nevertheless remained convinced that policies introduced in recent weeks aimed at cutting soaring inflation and cooling the red-hot economy would keep growth down to 12 per cent for the whole year. 'As long as every region and every department fully implements the policies set by the central government, we will be able to overcome the problems that crop up in the course of development,' Mr Zhang said. The government's inability to control inflation led to the appointment earlier this month of Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier, to the governorship of the Bank of China, the central bank. Inflation is now year-on-year 14 per cent nationally, and 21.6 per cent in 35 big cities. Chinese people are not known for their tolerance of rapidly rising prices and in 1988 were spurred by rampant inflation into a panic-buying spree that was followed by the anti-government demonstrations eventually put down by the army on June 4 the following year. Since taking on the extra workload on July 2, Mr Zhu has increased interest rates to encourage companies to repatriate hard currency and to attract bank deposits. He has poured tens of millions of dollars into the money market to stabilise the yuan, and has blocked speculative loans. Yesterday's figures show that money supply is still growing at an annual 50 per cent. Investment in fixed assets grew at an annual rate of 61 per cent - accounting for the construction fever that has turned cities into quagmires. But the growth is patchy, reflecting the inordinate amount of investment that goes to the relatively well developed coastal regions, leaving China's centre with conditions comparable to the poverty and feudalism of the 1920s. Mr Zhang's call for all areas of the country to follow the new belt-tightening policies no doubt has its roots in a breakdown of the figures his bureau released yesterday. The southern and eastern regions - led by Guangdong province bordering Hong Kong and Shanghai on the eastern seaboard - attracted an annualised 81.2 per cent more investment from state-owned enterprises. This is almost 30 per cent more than the money that went to the country's centre and west. While retail sales grew nationally by 21.6 per cent year-on-year, two-thirds of that can be attributed to 10 areas in the south and east.</p>

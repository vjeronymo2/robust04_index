			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Optimism mounts over VAT accord FRENCH and Spanish objections are still preventing adoption of a provisional accord on value-added tax and excise duties across the EC. But British and European officials in the Commission are optimistic a deal will be struck in the next few weeks. Britain, which holds the EC presidency, had hoped the two countries would drop their reservations to the package by today's meeting of EC finance ministers. To avoid rekindling the five-year political debate, the UK is aiming for technical agreement among national officials on outstanding points. The whole package of eight directives could then be rubber-stamped at any meeting of ministers. A British diplomat said after last week's meeting of officials: 'We're making progress, and the signs are quite good.' Finance ministers nearly reached unanimity on the package in July. It would impose, for example, a minimum binding standard VAT rate across the Community and lay out a framework for duties on tobacco, alcohol and mineral oils. EC officials say formal adoption is essential to the single market. But they do not believe delays at this stage will hold up the opening of barriers, as Community VAT rates are in line with requirements of the package and a number of member states are preparing to introduce legislation based on the main points of the July agreement. The principal stumbling blocks are still French calls for a nominal 'control levy' on wine and Madrid's wish to bring the duty on British sherry into line with that imposed on the Spanish product. The Netherlands is also said to have voiced concern about VAT on the repair of shoes and clothes, but the Commission and presidency are not going to add new problems to the existing French and Spanish reservations.</p>

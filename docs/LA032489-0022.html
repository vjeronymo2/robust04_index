			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> LEHNHOFF STAGES MODERN VERSION OF 'SALOME' AT MET  </P> <P> A few years ago, Nikolaus Lehnhoff directed an epochal production of Richard  Strauss' "Salome" in San Francisco. Dark, bleak and semi-abstract, it turned  out to be a model of enlightened contemporary stagecraft. It respected the  spirit of the decadent libretto while blithely redefining the letter.  </P> <P> Now, trendily aggressive and progressive to a fault, Lehnhoff has created a  "Salome" for the Metropolitan Opera that violates the spirit and the letter of  the original. It looked fascinatingly awful at Lincoln Center on Wednesday  night.  </P> <P> There is, of course, a painful irony here. The Met doesn't dare or care to go  modern very often. When it finally does, it goes wrong. First "Bluebeard's  Castle" and "Erwartung." Now this.  </P> <P> One can find much to admire in this emphatically original "Salome" -- so long  as one doesn't happen to admire the specific intentions of the composer.  Lehnhoff has invented lots of amusing gimmicks, some of which are mutually  complementary, and he splashes them all across the vast Met stage with bravado.  Jurgen Rose has created a staggering array of sleazy visual images that exert a  compulsion all their own.  </P> <P> Gil Wechsler has bathed the scenic orgy in expressionistic light and, where  unavoidable, smothered it in moody shade.  </P> <P> The stubbornly antiquated synopsis in the house program insists that the  biblical action takes place "on a moonlit terrace of King Herod's palace in  Judea." No way.  </P> <P> Lehnhoff and Rose have given us a supersleazy basement in some black-walled,  semi-expressionistic, neo-Nouveau disco. There is no moon. But there are lots  of corpses lying around, not to mention glitzy matrons, supernumerary bimbos  worthy of Weill and Brecht, and thugs borrowed from "Guys and Dolls."  Picturesque and oh-so-meaningful poses are struck on fire escapes, amid oil  barrels and in jarringly mis-angled doorways.  </P> <P> This, clearly, is a nasty new world gone askew. It is delineated with careful  thought, executed with loving detail. The effort is wasted, alas, within the  given musico-dramatic context.  </P> <P> The characters who inhabit the crazed environment are just that: characters.  There is a petulant lady in a pink pomponed birthday-party dress who, in some  sort of snit, peels off a few layers of outer skirts and throws her white  gloves at a funny little guy in a tiger-skin shirt who does a lot of ranting.  The lady, according to the program, is Salome. The funny little guy is Herod.  </P> <P> Then there is a portentous hippy who lives under a subway grate and wears a  white robe. That's John the Baptist.  </P> <P> And we mustn't forget the dame with the spiked heels who has trouble navigating  the raked ramps and can't seem to decide if she is supposed to impersonate  Margaret Dumont or Mae West. That's Herodias. She makes her lascivious exit, by  the way, on the arm of the big, bare-chested black slave who acts as the  Baptist's decapitator.  </P> <P> Obviously, there is a potentially beguiling parody hidden somewhere among all  this puerile indulgence. Too bad it has so little to do with Strauss' shocking  eroticism, psychological thunder and poignant catharsis.  </P> <P> Given the weird comings and goings on the stage, not to mention the vocal  shortcomings and shortgoings of a mostly second-string-cast, Marek Janowski did  the wisest possible thing in the pit. He put his head down and made music --  loud, clean and fast.  </P> <P> The Salome at this performance -- possibly a dubious choice in the first place  -- was supposed to have been Eva Marton. The Hungarian diva hastily left town,  however, pleading illness after a well-publicized disagreement with the  management regarding future assignments.  </P> <P> Her alternate turned out to be Katarina Ikonomu, a Greek soprano from Tashkent  who has sung the same role in the presumably more congenial productions of  Paris, Zurich and Charleston. She looked reasonably attractive in her silly  Shirley Temple costume and pouted deftly. However, she sketched Salome's  insinuating, arching conflicts in bright, somewhat shrill tones that proved  notable neither for accuracy nor steadiness.  </P> <P> In the climax of the terminal scene, she clutched the freshly severed head of  Jochanaan to her breast without besmirching her lily-white bodice with so much  as a drop of blood. Even more disconcerting, she suggested that her lyric  resources were too frail to compete with the lush, orgasmic utterances of the  orchestra. Under the circumstances, it seemed compassionate as well as  convenient for Lehnhoff to have her drop dead long before Herod, impotent and  unattended, could order her execution.  </P> <P> Graham Clark, Bayreuth's Mime, was the buffonesque Tetrarch. Mignon Dunn served  as his blowsy bride. Bernd Weikl barked mightily as the bearded Baptist in the  basement (when the technicians didn't turn off his sub-stage microphone).  </P> <P> The top ticket for this performance cost $98. The house was not sold out.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> TEACHERS, DISTRICT AGREE ON PAY HIKE  </P> <P> Ojai teachers settled for a conditional 6% raise, half the increase they sought  in March, after the union and school officials agreed to use a new negotiating  technique, officials said.  </P> <P> The Ojai Unified School District board approved a three-year contract Tuesday  for 210 full- and part-time teachers in two high schools, a middle school and  five elementary schools.  </P> <P> "It was probably the most positive experience I've ever had in salary  negotiations for 17 years," Assistant Supt. Leo Molitor said.  </P> <P> "We're very pleased with the settlement," said Ronnie Rodriguez, president of  the Ojai Federation of Teachers union.  </P> <P> The agreement provides for a 4% pay hike retroactive to Aug. 28. Another  retroactive 2% hike will take effect Feb. 1 if this year's student enrollment  continues to be at least 190 students more than last year.  </P> <P> "The March proposal was taken off the table when we went into collaborative  negotiations," Rodriguez said of the new discussion method that the union and  district agreed to adopt.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a problem-solving approach where both parties agree to look at  the issues and see what's best for the district," said Bill Purdom, district  negotiator. "It raised the trust level significantly."  </P> <P> District administrators and another 160 employees will also receive a 6% pay  hike, with 2% of it contingent on enrollment figures through January.  </P> <P> The increases will largely be funded by state money for student enrollment,  Molitor said. The district's enrollment of 3,573 students jumped to 217 more  than last year, the largest increase the district has experienced in 10 years,  he said. THIA BELL  </P></p>

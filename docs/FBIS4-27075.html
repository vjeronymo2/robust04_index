			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ping Hefu (1627 0668 1133), researcher of Russian </F> military affairs]    [Text] Russia officially confirmed in April this year that  the CPC has decided to import a new batch of Russian Su-27 jets,  and the two sides are now discussing the prices at the talks.  At the same time, the Russian air force and scientific and  technological personnel are helping the CPC set up a large Su-27  jet maintenance center. Talks on transferring the Su-27 ground  training simulator production technology are also under way.  This shows that equipping the CPC's air force with Russia's new  Su-27 fighters is just a matter of time.    News from the Russian air force and the Sukhoi Design Bureau  has confirmed that the first batch of 26 jets are the Su-27k  model aircraft used by the navy and air force, that is, the  already imported Su-33 model, which is produced in limited  quantity. It is noteworthy that when the air unit of the  Russian navy (stationed in the Kara peninsula) was equipped with  the first batch of 12 Su-33 model jets, the firing and control  system was redesigned at the request of the consumer. The new  generation of Su-33 jets are refitted with SS35 firing control  radar. The air and ground search distance (of the improved  N-011 "Beetle" model) is 400 and 200 km, respectively. It can  track 15 targets in the air at the same time and intercept 6 of  them. The whole process of the Su-27 jet from take-off to  searching targets, launching missiles, and returning is  automatic, and it needs almost no manual operation. When the  CPC's navy is equipped with the Su-33, it will undoubtedly  become the best functional jet in Asia. It outshines the CPC's  Su-27, which is now in service, and has the capability of  attacking navy vessels and threatening warning systems.  Meanwhile, the future trend of the weaponry such as the new  Kh31 anti-vessel missile and the AA12 middle range air-to-air  missile with a firing range of 400 km, which are in conformity  with the Su-33 aircraft, also merit attention. If the CPC  purchases these weapons, it will be able to change the  comprehensive offensive and defensive structure across the  Taiwan Strait. When something happens, it can make the most of  the long-range advantage of the Su-27 (3,000 km) and use systems  like the AA12 to attack Taiwan's warning systems from the  northeast or southeast.    The CPC's air force will possess a total of 52 jets when it  is equipped with the second batch of Su-27. While its overall  combat effectiveness has been enormously enhanced, the CPC will  have more bargaining chips at the talks to obtain part of the  Su-27 production technology. Viewed from the examples of  Russian-Indian military cooperation, the transfer of production  technology is carried out on the basis of a certain amount of  imports. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the CPC will batch  produce the Su-27 and turn it into the main combat force in the  21st century because it is costly, the production price for each  aircraft reaching as high as $40 million. Moreover, the  technology is complicated. Beset with economic difficulties, it  seems that Russia simply cannot ensure a regular supply of  technology and materials.    The purchase of Su-27K once again proves that the CPC has  taken the needs of both the navy and air force into account and  has resolved the source of aircraft for the manufacture of  medium and large aircraft carriers. There was hearsay about the  CPC's interest in the vertaplanes on board the Yak-141, but the  report was denied by the Yak Designing Bureau. Hence, the  intention of the CPC to build a large aircraft carrier for  fixed-wing planes is very clear.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Trio shares drop on profit warning Trio Holdings, the revamped investment trust, warned yesterday that although it continued to trade satisfactorily, its results for the year to September 30 were not expected to meet market expectations. Directors said they had noted the recent movement in the share price, which last night closed 10p down at 51p. The results, which will be announced in December, included eight and a half months trading of Martin Bierbaum, which was acquired in January.</p>

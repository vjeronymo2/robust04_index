			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- The government spokesman on  Monday [20 June] expressed disappointment at the final result of  the March 31 lake Qiandao [Chien-tao] murder of 24 Taiwan  tourists.    Jason Hu, the director-general of the Government Information  Office, said that because many questions regarding the case  remain unresolved, it is "an unsettled case with the truth  behind it having no chance of being uncovered."    After a brief hearing on Sunday affirming the sentence of  the  three men convicted for the murders, the men were executed.    "The government is extremely disappointed at the result," Hu  said while meeting a group of journalists from Hong Kong.    He said that Beijing cannot call an end to the case because  two important issues remain unresolved -- compensation for the  relatives of the victims and how the mainland will ensure the  future safety of Taiwan tourists in the mainland.    He accused Beijing of trying to cover up the truth behind  the  killings not long after the crime occurred, thus destroying the  credibility of its later explanation.    Hu advised Beijing that honesty is the best policy.    Hu said that exchanges between the two sides should be  continued even though the incident has inflicted grave damage to  cross-strait relations.</p>

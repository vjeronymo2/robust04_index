			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Accountancy Column: Poacher turned gamekeeper has accountants in his sights - Andrew Jack explains the little-known background to Michael Heseltine's attack on 'wealth managers' A WELCOMING sight lies just a few pages inside the front cover of the freshly-printed 1993 members' directory of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. It is a smiling photograph of Mr Ian Plaistowe, this year's president. But if Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK secretary of state for trade and industry, were to turn to the previous page, he would be unlikely to share that facial expression for long. Judging by a speech he gave last week, he would probably substitute a gritty grimace for the grin. The page proudly states that the institute counted 100,135 members on its rolls by July 1 last year. The rest of the directory - all 1,500 pages of it in microscopic print - is devoted to listing each of them and their firms. By the end of last month, that figure had risen to 102,390. There was even a formal presentation of an engraved paperknife to the lucky 100,000th member. Mr Heseltine would no doubt have preferred to offer a mallet, or some other more practical industrial object. In a sombre address to the Scottish Division of the Institute of Directors in Edinburgh last Friday, he criticised what he saw as Britain's imbalance of 'wealth managers' to 'wealth creators', contributing to the lack of innovation in business. Accountants and lawyers were high up his hit list. While the route to the top of German and Japanese companies is through engineering, science or research qualifications, in the UK it has been through 'the City, Parliament and above all accountancy,' he said. 'I find it hard to believe this offers us the best way ahead.' Knocking comments about accountancy are nothing new. It may be one of the world's younger professions, but it has long been the butt of jokes and dismissive comments. Early last year, Mr Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, described as 'very curious' the fact that many UK companies are headed by accountants rather than engineers. Some bruised beancounters have taken particular satisfaction in seeing Sony's own financial position deteriorate since that time. But Mr Heseltine's prominence as head of the government department with responsibility for British industry and for monitoring and regulating accountants, means that his comments are worthy of attention - and given even greater weight by the comparative silence on the subject by Mr Neil Hamilton, his junior minister. To be fair, his dismissive remarks were only part of a wide-ranging speech on the need by companies to take a longer-term view. But the opinions certainly struck a raw nerve in Mr Plaistowe, who wrote an indignant response to the secretary of state on Monday in which he said he was 'surprised and disappointed'. He accused the minister of falling into 'a notorious elephant trap' by making comparisons with other countries, and asked him to address the issue of why so many talented young graduates considered accounting such an attractive career. 'We have a qualification which is highly prized,' he said yesterday. 'People choose it because it gives them a wide range of options.' Mr Heseltine's antagonism towards accountants is not new. In his book Where there's a will published in 1987, he says auditors should ideally be appointed by a body independent of a quoted company's board. He says auditors should be banned from conducting non-audit work such as management consulting for audit clients. He also tells how he helped create the Audit Commission for local government, rejecting the idea that an auditor could be independent when appointed by the local authority on which it was reporting. But his views have apparently hardened in the last few years. In 1990, he was still reported as claiming in a speech that 'accountancy is not boring' and that it provides 'wonderful training' as a preparation for business. Sigmund Freud would no doubt have drawn considerable significance from Mr Heseltine's early experiences as an accountant. Though strangely missing from Who's Who and other biographical reference works, the minister began his career as an articled clerk with Peat Marwick Mitchell, now part of KPMG Peat Marwick, in the 1950s - but failed the final exams. He did extremely well by the profession, founding the weekly journal Accountancy Age through his publishing company Haymarket, and then selling it at a healthy price. The relationship may have begun to sour in the 1980s, when he launched another journal called Account, which folded within a matter of months. Whatever the reason, Mr Heseltine has a point. Both the absolute number of accountants and their proportion of the population in the UK is very high. Add the Scottish and Irish to the English and Welsh chartered accountants, include the certified, public finance and management accountants, and the total quickly tops 200,000. As the table shows, these levels are substantially above those in Japan and Germany. In between come a number of tax havens or countries with favourable regimes for multinational companies, such as Luxembourg and Gibraltar. The only countries with more accountants per capita than the UK are members of the Commonwealth such as Australia and Canada. Conclusions and trends are certainly very difficult to draw from these figures. Some of the statistics are outdated, and others not entirely reliable. The abilities, qualifications and range of functions carried out by members of the different professional bodies varies widely between countries. In Japan, they cease to be counted as accountants once they leave public practice. In the UK, by contrast, many of those with accountancy qualifications do not work in public practice at all. More than half of chartered accountants work in business and industry, and a significant proportion  - particularly of the certifieds - work in other countries. None the less, Mr Heseltine's argument is partly echoed by Mr Peter Davis, chairman of the Board of Chartered Accountants in Business, and out-going finance director of Sturge Holdings. 'Accountants are not generally good wealth creators, initiators or risk takers,' he says. 'But Britain is still producing its share of entrepreneurs, and accountants have an important secondary role in business.' Perhaps what the professional bodies should consider is a more radical overhaul of their syllabi to make them more relevant to the majority of recruits who move into business after qualifying. But Mr Plaistowe makes a fair point when he says accountants can hardly be blamed for any failure of other businesses to make sufficient investment to attract as many good recruits. Arguably, Mr Heseltine, wearing his hat as regulator of accountancy, should be returning to the thoughts in his book six years ago about conflicts of interest and the question of to whom auditors should report. As with the number of accountants, these issues have only continued to grow in the meantime.</p>

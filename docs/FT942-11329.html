			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: India warns over labour controls Mr Pranab Mukherjee, India's commerce minister, has warned the US and other industrialised countries against putting plans for controls on cheap labour on the agenda of international trade talks. Suggestions that developing countries should be penalised for providing workers with inferior social and other benefits than industrialised countries amounted to 'introducing protectionism through the back door', said Mr Mukherjee this week. Mr Mukherjee was referring to proposals advanced by the US to insert 'social clauses' into the brief of the newly-formed World Trade Organisation, which will next year replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in accordance with the Uruguay Round pact signed on Marrakesh last month. American and European politicians are concerned that the high social welfare payments made in industrialised countries reduce their competitiveness vis-a-vis the Third World. Mr Mukherjee said: 'It raises doubts about whether some of the industrialised countries are serious about liberalising trade.' The social clause proposals made it more difficult for the ruling Congress(I) party in India and other developing country governments to enact legislation to bring the Marrakesh agreement into effect. These problems are particularly acute in India, where there is a long tradition of economic self-sufficiency and of hostility to foreign business interests. Opposition parties - including the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party and the parties of the left - have seized the Gatt accord as a stick with which to beat the government. They have taken their case on to the streets, calling rallies in Delhi which were attended by hundreds of thousands of people. The opposition parties have tried to whip up support by lumping together criticism of the Gatt accord with attacks on the government's economic liberalisation. They have exploited fears of Indian farmers, some of whom have been led to believe the Gatt accord threatens agricultural subsidies. (In fact poor countries are exempted from the subsidy-cutting clauses of the agreement.) Mr Mukherjee said the protests would not stop the government from getting legislation through parliament. The opposition was trying to build support before state elections later this year. He hoped the opposition parties would eventually accept the wisdom of the Gatt deal, despite their public posturing.</p>

The results were discussed with the applicant who responded with appropriate corrective action and clarification to the comments and recommendations made as a result of the survey of the Cleveland Laboratory [Ex. 6B]. The final on-site review report [Ex. 6] and the OSHA staff recommendation were subsequently forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for a preliminary finding on the application. A notice of AGA's application together with a positive preliminary finding was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 3, 1993 (58 FR 47000&hyph;47001).

This recognition is limited to equipment or materials which, under 29 CFR part 1910, require testing, listing, labeling, approval, acceptance, or certification by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. This recognition is limited to the use of the following 38 additional test standards for the testing and certification of equipment or materials included within the scope of these standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

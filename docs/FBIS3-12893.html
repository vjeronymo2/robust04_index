In its editorial today, AL-JUMHURIYAH notes that the U.S.  President has asked Congress to continue to support the embargo,  citing a series of fabricated stories and lies, which have been  worn out by repetition. The U.S. President has even taken a  further step by appointing himself a "guardian" over Iraq and  its people and poking his nose in its domestic affairs.    The paper notes the extreme frustration the Clinton  administration has faced as a result of two connected phenomena  in the Arab nation. The first phenomenon is the collapse of two  pillars of U.S. policy following the aggression against Iraq,  the regimes of Fahd and Husni Mubarak. The second is that Iraq  has maintained popular support all over the Arab nation and that  Saddam Husayn has continued to be a symbol of pan-Arab honor and  adherence to honorable values in the Arab nation and the Islamic  world.    The paper asserts that the steadfastness of the Iraqi people  and the genius of President Saddam Husayn have changed regional  and Arab equations in their favor. They have also defeated  attempts by Western-Zionist media to influence the masses of the  region and drive them to antagonize Iraq.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Hani Wuhayyib: "Sense of Frustration"] </F>   [Text] Western media channels are busy these days with  reports about the fighting between the agents in the northern  part of the homeland. These channels, especially BBC radio,  cannot not hide their anxiety about those incidents. The  anxiety expressed by the BBC is on behalf of the Western  governments that are protecting the "security zone" and are  frustrated by the subversive behavior, as the radio says.    In its comments and roundtable discussions, the BBC  attributes Western anxiety to the fact that the agent groups are  more concerned about their own rivalry than about what the West  thinks about what is taking place. So, the West suddenly wakes  up to the reality of what is taking place in the northern part  of the homeland and expresses its sense of frustration, not out  of affection for the citizens in northern Iraq but due to the  exposure of its claims about the "security zone," which has  turned into an open arena for crimes of murder, plunder, and  fighting between the leaders of agent groups over plots of land  and commissions, as the BBC says. The radio clearly admits that  thousands of Kurds have come out in the streets of Irbil  protesting against these crimes.    No doubt, our Kurdish people's rejection of the agent groups  has strengthened the sense of frustration among Western  governments, which are now convinced that the land has begun to  move under the feet of the agents and traitors in the Kurdistan  Autonomous Region -- hence the overlords' sense of frustration  about the fate that awaits their agents and followers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second part of a serial report on the Spratley Islands, </F> entitled "Cherish the Reefs With Deep Feelings" -- by RENMIN  HAIJUN BAO reporter Li Xiangdong and station reporter Xiong  Zhengyan; from the "News and Press Review" program]    [Text] People who have never been to the Nansha [Spratly]  Islands usually use these words "bleak, desolate, and hardship"  to describe the islands, but the Nansha that we have seen are  full of vitality. As we landed at Dongmen Reef, what caught our  eyes first were the words "Garden on the Sea," which somewhat  surprised us. The small garden, whose diameter is slightly more  than a meter long, was built with coral stones collected by the  officers and men stationed on the reef from the sea. Decorated  with coral stones shaped like flowers and deer horns, as well as  shells of various types, the garden looks magnificent. Every  pillbox in Nansha is like an ocean of flowers. Because of the  high temperature and humidity and the high degree of alkalinity  on the reef, the more than 20 types of flowers brought from the  mainland by officers and men withered as they could not  withstand the harsh environment. Only a small common plant  survived the scorching sun and began to bloom in the soldiers'  emptied food cans. The officers and men guarding the reef call  them sunflowers. Before long, the sunflowers were blooming in  all the pillboxes. After consulting each other over the  telephone, the officers and men agreed to name this type of  flower the Jiaohua of Nansha. In addition to sunflowers, other  purple and pink flowers, pine trees, and green bamboos have  taken roots at Nansha pillboxes. At (Yushu) Reef, there is a  path lined with more than 10 green loquats. Cultivated from  loquat seeds by the soldiers, these trees are now over 1 meter  tall.    Compared with the mainland, life in the Nansha Island is  especially hard. Fresh water and vegetables, in particular, are  too precious. Every drop of drinking water has to be shipped  from the mainland. Soldiers once had sores in their mouths  because long periods without green vegetables. Some soldiers  longed for green vegetables so much that they drew a pile of  eggplants with purple color and a pile of tomatoes with red ink.  However, these are things of the past, things from the early  days when the soldiers took up their duty of guarding the reef.  Now, at every pillbox we visited, we could see soilless  vegetable plots made from discarded ammunition boxes, basins,  food cans, as well as man-made mobile vegetable plots. In fact,  this has turned every pillbox into the well-known Nanniwan  Production Team.    The largest vegetable farm (words  indistinct) measured nine fen [a unit of area equal to 66.666  square meters]. The dirt was partly brought here by soldiers  guarding the reef and partly provided by supply ships. The soil  was nearly one foot thick. No less than 10 varieties, including  water spinach, leaf mustard, three-colored amaranth, pakchoi,  wax gourd, pumpkin, peas, and tomato, were in full growth. When  Nansha's first home-grown cucumbers -- grown by soldier Wang  Shanzhu in a cartridge box -- were ripe, soldiers on the reef  held a special cucumber banquet. It was so precious that every  soldier was reluctant to eat the piece distributed. Nowadays,  soldiers are able to eat vegetables every other day, and each  week they slaughter a self-raised pig.    The pillboxes, inhabited by soldiers on the reef, have also  seen great changes. Soldiers proudly told us that what they  inhabited were the third-generation high-foundation houses [gao  jiao wu]; the first-generation houses had completely gone. We  saw some second-generation houses, which were still retained.  To build reinforced concrete high-foundation houses, soldiers  guarding the reef have worked painstakingly under the sun; some  have dedicated their lives. In building the third-generation  houses, the resourceful soldiers designed and built devices that  could hold water when it rains. Every square inch of the  pillboxes was skillfully utilized to ameliorate the shortages of  fresh water in Nansha.    Nanniwan on the sea crystallizes the soldier's dedicated  service to the motherland. The miracles created on the vast sea  by soldiers guarding the reef were footnotes to the poster on  the reef: "Make the Reef Our Home, Guard the Territory in the  Remotest Frontier With Pleasure!"</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: TI declares Pounds 504m Dowty bid final - Only unlikely appearance of white knight would affect offer TI GROUP, the specialist engineering company, yesterday turned the heat up on bid target Dowty by declaring its Pounds 504m offer final. Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman and chief executive, said that the original 4 for 15 share offer, which values the bid at 186p and its cash alternative of 175p, fully valued Dowty. By taking the unusual step of making its first offer final, TI is confident that it was pitched high enough to see off potential rival bidders. However, it retains the right to increase its offer in the increasingly unlikely event that a white knight emerges with a rival bid. Mr Bruce Ralph, chairman of the aerospace and information technology group, said there was nothing new in TI's document, which still presented Dowty shareholders with an offer that was too low. As part of the defence, which is expected early next week, Dowty is likely to reveal an estimate of profits and earnings for the year ended March 1992. Stockbrokers have estimated profits between Pounds 18.5m and Pounds 22m  - giving earnings of 4.1p to 5.4p - down from Pounds 60.6m in 1991. Mr Ralph said he was glad the phoney war was over and warned that some analysts might be embarrassed by their low estimates of 1991 earnings. Dowty will also try to slow the momentum TI has developed in the three weeks since it launched its hostile bid by focusing its shareholders on the strengths of its future order book and its development programmes. Late yesterday Dowty also said that Mr Christopher Bunker would no longer be joining in August as finance director from Westland, the helicopter manufacturer where he holds the same position. In what Mr Ralph called a humanitarian gesture Dowty had agreed to Mr Bunker's request not to join Dowty in the middle of a bid. In his letter to Dowty shareholders yesterday, Mr Lewinton repeated that the Cheltenham-based company had lost its way after diversifying into information technology. He said he recognised the problem from when he joined TI in 1986 and found that TI - formerly Tube Investments - had diversified from its core businesses into Raleigh bicycles and consumer products. TI has been refocused and built into an international group. The acquisition of Dowty would provide a third aerospace leg to add to the tubes and seals businesses. Dowty has two weeks to produce its first defence document and 28 days to convince its shareholders of the strength of its management. Dowty's shares fell 6p to 181p on news of TI's final offer while TI shares fell 1p to 697p.</p>

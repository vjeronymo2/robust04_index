			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOTHING SNEAKY ABOUT BOARD ACTION  </P> <P> Your article regarding the Board of Supervisors' action on the Paramount Ranch  zoning case ("County Alters Report, Reapproves Housing Project," Aug. 9) may  have left the casual reader with an impression that the board was seeking to  somehow secretly cover our tracks on this case.  </P> <P> However the facts are quite different. As anyone expert in the field of EIRs  and the California Environmental Quality Act would readily attest, public  agencies often prepare addenda to their environmental documentation whenever  minor changes are made to a project as a part of the final approval, and this  case is no different.  </P> <P> These addenda help satisfy the informational goals of CEQA by describing the  approved project as clearly as possible. CEQA also encourages the use of  addenda to allow for minor technical additions to provide for the most thorough  impact report. Contrary to the impression left by the article, none of the  information included in the addendum for this project was significant new  material or information that the county was trying to withhold from scrutiny.  </P> <P> What the opposition to the case did not choose to disclose is that the board at  my urging reduced the impacts of the project significantly -- thereby  triggering the need for the addenda. On my motion, the board reduced the  project from 159 homes to 150, and we required the developer to provide a large  continuous permanent open-space buffer adjacent to the park property to the  south. We required 80% of the oak trees to be saved and we imposed other  requirements to reduce the impacts on surrounding areas.  </P> <P> Two final points. First it should be remembered that the general plan in place  when I became supervisor in 1980 permitted 234 homes on the site. Today that  amount is only 150, or two-thirds of the original amount. Second, one should  not forget that there were significant numbers of nearby homeowners who  supported the approval of the case.  </P> <P> MICHAEL D. ANTONOVICH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Antonovich is county supervisor for the 5th District.  </P> <P> </P></p>

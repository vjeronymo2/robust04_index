Fifteen days later, SDMA  initiative groups already were functioning in more than 20  institutions of higher learning and secondary schools in the  republic. The 500 delegates elected by these groups took part in  the congress.    The congress adopted the Rules of the Democratic Youth Union  of Azerbaijan.    Rovshan Dzhavadov outlined the main directions of SDMA  activities. Then elections were held to the union's governing  bodies. The congress elected Rovshan Dzhavadov as SDMA chairman.  Elections were held to the Supreme Council and the Central Audit  Commission.    The congress participants declared that in keeping with the  Republic of Azerbaijan law on public organizations, the  Democratic Youth Union of Azerbaijan will not engage in  political activities. Its main goal is to aid directly the  process of building a democratic state in Azerbaijan. Another  important direction of its work is young people. Defining its  tasks in the area of social protection of young people, their  patriotic upbringing and physical fitness, as well as developing  their talents, the union made a decision to hold a congress once  every four years.</p>

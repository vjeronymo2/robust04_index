			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): The pensioner Bill Caswell, 66: Former export consultant and, latterly, probation officer. Lives with a friend in a large house on the Isle of Wight, and is divorced with two grown-up children. He has no mortgage, a small pension of Pounds 6,500 but investments producing income of Pounds 30,000. Said yesterday: 'For a retired person like me on a reasonable income there were no nasty surprises. The VAT increases on fuel do not really affect me, since I anticipated them by putting in a condensing boiler. Lower inflation does not help everybody since higher inflation wipes out debt. But I am not complaining. The one thing I would like to have seen was tax benefits for the disabled. I have become disabled recently and I do need help. I am little disappointed about the increase in fuel taxes. If you live in the country like I do, where public transport has collapsed, this is an extra burden. On the whole, though, there was little to worry me.'</p>

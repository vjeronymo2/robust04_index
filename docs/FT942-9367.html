			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Mitchell urges hard line on China's human rights: Senate leader wants trade sanctions imposed Senate Democratic leader Mr George Mitchell said yesterday he favoured punishing China with trade sanctions unless it improves its human rights record in the next two weeks, Reuter reports from Washington. In remarks that could complicate a decision President Bill Clinton must make by June 3, Mr Mitchell said he was drafting sanctions because he believed China had not yet met US conditions for the renewal of Most Favoured Nation trade status. 'There has been significant progress in some respects, not in others,' he said on the NBC television programme Meet the Press. 'As of now, I don't think that the terms of the executive order have been met. And therefore the extension of the MFN status should be conditioned with some sanctions.' In his executive order last June, Mr Clinton said he would revoke MFN this year unless China made 'overall, significant progress' on seven human rights issues, including freeing political prisoners, ending repression in Tibet and easing emigration. If Mr Clinton fully carried out his threat, China would be relegated to the handful of nations whose exports to the US are ineligible for the low tariffs MFN bestows. US business groups, among others, fear Beijing would retaliate in kind, restricting access to one of the world's fastest growing markets for American goods. Mr Mitchell said Chinese human-right policy had gone back and forth, and that a decision on extending MFN would have to be made on 'the full record on all seven issues' next month. 'I think it'll be a very close call,' he said. He added that he had already begun drafting a measure to punish China for any failure to meet the executive order's conditions. 'But it depends upon what the decision is at the time and what sanctions are imposed,' he said. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, appearing on the same programme, urged Mr Clinton to eat crow, renew MFN and admit he had erred in tying it to human rights. 'My view is that we have to continue to look at their human rights policies, but we ought to separate the two,' he said. 'The president just ought to say 'Listen, maybe I went too far, I made a mistake. Let's go ahead and extend Most Favoured Nation status for China and we'll continue to work on human rights'.' Being second-guessed on China in Congress by his own party would be a blow to Mr Clinton. During the 1992 presidential campaign, Mr Clinton criticised then-President George Bush for unwillingness to make trade conditional on progress in the human rights field in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. A classified inter-agency study of the impact of revoking MFN found that it could cost each side as much as Dollars 10bn to Dollars 13bn (Pounds 6.7bn to Pounds 8.7bn) if high US tariffs went into effect across the board. A senior administration official, who discussed the study on condition he not be identified by name, said: 'We are trying like hell to get movement (from the Chinese on human rights) so that in the end we don't have to do this.' 'We assume the cost would be extremely high,' the official added.</p>

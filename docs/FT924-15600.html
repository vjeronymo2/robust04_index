			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Despatches: Farcical skirmish in a niggling, weary little war LAST Saturday, my family and I were victims of what the police report described as an 'act of hostility against Israel.' It was likely, added the report, that it was carried out by 'a hostile organisation' or 'foreign military forces' or 'infiltrators.' The Israeli government is going to pay for the 'war damage.' None of us - my wife, myself and our three small children - was hurt or even threatened with injury. Only our car was smashed up by a gang of Palestinian likely lads, and we were not in it. It was as far removed from a real war as you could imagine. But it tells you much about the weary impasse that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has reached and, perhaps, a little of the reason why the two sides are now engaged more deeply in peace talks than ever before. Here is what happened to us. Some time between the Weetabix and the day's first cry of 'Mummy, I'm bored,' my wife and I decided the 4 1/2 -year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories had subsided enough for us to feel confident about a family outing to the West Bank town of Hebron, about 20 miles south of our home in Jerusalem. With specially-installed strong plastic windows, a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf displayed prominently and a 'foreign press' sticker on the windscreen, we reckoned we were insulated well enough against the occasional intifada rock-thrower out to hit cars bearing the giveaway yellow Israeli licence plates. Our judgment seemed justified. We spent a couple of happy hours visiting the Hebron souk (camel heads hanging outside butchers' stalls a speciality) and a local glass blowing factory, and the locals gave us the warmest of welcomes. But on the way back, just before Bethlehem, we turned off the main road to visit Solomon's pools, ancient reservoirs set in attractive countryside which used to supply Jerusalem's water. We parked in the shade of a tree and went off for a walk, ignoring the several groups of young men milling about the pools. As we were enthusing about the pleasures of tension-free sightseeing in the West Bank, a nice young fellow approached us. 'Is your car up there?' he asked, pointing to where we had parked. When I said yes, he told us: 'Some boys - they are . . .' He waved his arms up and down and made ominous crunching noises. 'You must hurry,' he added. I needn't have bothered; the deed was well done by then. The reinforced windscreen had been smashed by a rock the size of my head while the doors had been sprung open and some interior panels ripped off. The outside had been given a good kicking, some of the lights were crunched, and the car had been heaved backwards into thick bushes. What little was inside had gone, including the keffiyeh. As I cursed my stupidity, an old Fiat pulled up. Two young men, bearded in the fashion of Hamas, the Palestinian fundamentalist group, looked at me with an air of amused satisfaction. But as they heard me speak, there was a frown of doubt. 'You are Jewish?' the driver asked. 'No, I'm British.' 'Oh,' he said. He conferred with his friend. 'Would you like us to help?' he offered with what I thought was rather a contrived air of innocence. Suddenly, the car was surrounded by shebab - young men - all absurdly solicitous, the more so when they saw blonde-haired Fred, Hannah and Patrick arrive on the scene. 'Smash car?' asked two-year-old Patrick, clearly pained that he had not been able to join in the fun. 'Blimey, guv, who would do such a terrible thing?' is a rough translation of what the shebab said as they helped clear up some of the mess they obviously had created moments before. They beamed happily at the camera as my wife took souvenir photos. To the Israeli police in their fortified station in Bethlehem's Manger Square, just across the street from the Church of the Nativity, ours was a tiresomely routine case. They seemed relieved not to find any fingerprints. Just give a statement, sign the forms for compensation for the repairs, and you can go home. 'Next time you come, don't go to Solomon's pools,' said officer Yossi Cohen. 'Just come and drink coffee with us.' Of course, it is a mistake to read too much into an event like this. There are, after all, still people getting killed in the intifada. If you are a Palestinian in a refugee camp under curfew, it is no laughing matter. Nor is it a joke for Israeli soldiers patrolling those refugee camps. But I cannot help feeling that what happened to us last Saturday was a sign of how cynical resignation has set in on both sides. The Palestinians, hopelessly outgunned, have proved unable (or unwilling) to mount a sustained IRA-style campaign of ruthless, sophisticated violence that might have dislodged Israel from the occupied territories. Our friends at Solomon's pools were hardly of the SAS image conjured up by the official label of 'foreign military force.' Yet, they were part of the stubborn, niggling refusal to accept Israeli rule that has made Israelis realise they can stay in the West Bank only under hostile conditions. Each side keeps up the rhetoric of a war - but each side knows it cannot win. So now, at last, they are talking peace instead.</p>

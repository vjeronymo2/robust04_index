Sergey Filatov, chief of the Russian president's administration,  said this in answer to a question from ITAR-TASS about his stand  on a conflict regarding privatisation between Russian Deputy  Premier, Chief of the State Committee on Property Anatoliy  Chubays and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov.    Filatov believes that to change the rules of privatisation  of  state property 20 day before the validity of vouchers expires  means to undermine the confidence of citizens in the authorities.</p>

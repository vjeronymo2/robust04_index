			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The report characterized the remaining 25 percent of rear-end accidents, those in which the lead vehicle was moving (LVM) at impact, as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In contrast, the LVM crash subtype may involve driver reaction time following a sudden crash threat as a critical factor. Vehicles involved in this circumstance are often ``locked pairs'' with one vehicle following the other. However, gaps or following distances can range from a few lengths to very substantial distances even in this subtype. Not all LVM crashes are precipitated by rapid deceleration of the lead vehicle. Many involve slow decelerations (e.g., typical slowing before a turn) or simply a speed differential between the lead and following vehicles. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This also indicates that driver inattentiveness is critical in LVM crashes. It is hard to accept that a 0.25 second advance in stop lamp activation would be of value to an inattentive following driver. NHTSA accepts the IVHS report as an accurate reflection of the conditions under which rear-end collisions happen, and has concluded that Red Alert would not provide an adequate warning to avoid these collisions in virtually all the circumstances under which they occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, a manufacturer should not be precluded from offering its product, even if safety benefits cannot be demonstrated, unless there are potential safety disbenefits created by the product. The agency objected to ATAT's ABLD because it was not an unambiguous signal of brake application. NHTSA believed that such devices created the potential for confusion and dilution of the effectiveness of the stop signal. It pointed out that the activation of the stop signal under the requested circumstances only signified that the accelerator had been released. It did not necessarily follow that the brakes would be applied. The brakes were not applied 28 percent of time that the ABLD activated in a test report submitted by its proponent, ATAT. Similarly, the brakes were not applied 23 percent of the time the ``Red Alert'' activated in a test report submitted as part of Baran's petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, both devices activated the stop lamps far less frequently than did the ordinary brake switch activated by depression of the brake pedal. During their respective tests, the ABLD activated the stop signal about 3 percent as frequently as the ordinary brake switch did. ``Red Alert'' activated the signal about 1.2 percent as frequently. Both tests compared the number of false alarms to the number of ordinary stop signal activations of one second or less. False alarms of ``Red Alert'' were about 2.4 percent as frequent as short brake applications, and false alarms of the ATAT device were reported as less than 10 percent as frequent as short brake applications. The conditions under which the two devices were tested differed greatly. ATAT used a special test course, three test vehicles and a limited number of test subjects who knew that some undisclosed part of their driving behavior was being evaluated. Baran installed ``Red Alert'' on six communal car pool vehicles that were operated for a period of months in ordinary traffic by various drivers who had no knowledge that their behavior was being measured. Given the large variations in activation and false alarm rates between test vehicles within each test and the differences in test conditions between the ABLD and ``Red Alert'' tests, there is no reason to believe that the two devices vary significantly in activation rate and false alarm performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The activation rate observed in both tests seems to be too high for true emergency braking actions, as neither test documented an actual incident of emergency braking. ATAT did not report either observing emergency maneuvers or questioning its subjects regarding such instances, but it did measure the foot movement times when the accelerator control activated the stop lamp. A range between 0.23 and 0.77 second was observed. When ATAT's subjects were asked to perform fast accelerator to brake movements, the 5th and 95th percentile times were 0.10 and 0.28 second respectively. It appears that very few of the activations in ATAT's test of an accelerator controlled stop lamp were rapid enough to indicate an emergency. Baran did not report measurements of foot movement times, but it assumed that ``Red Alert'' activations were equivalent to instances of emergency braking. ``Red Alert'' was characterized as providing an advance warning of 0.35 second which falls outside of ATAT's rapid foot movement range. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both manufacturers argued that the false alarms were insignificant because they were few in comparison to the quite large number of brake applications of less than one second. Baran also argued that the short brake applications themselves had little significance because the duration of brake effort would be further reduced by the time consumed to build up pressure and to release the brake pedal within one second. Baran pointed out that a short brake application may represent only a release of cruise control, a state of preparedness or a warning to other drivers. While these facts tend to diminish the importance of the systematic false alarms, they also demonstrate why following drivers are unlikely to act at the instant of the stop lamp illumination in the absence of closing speed or some other cue. All the test experience reported for accelerator controlled stop lamps involved leading and following drivers who were unaware of the use of the device. But this device facilitates intentional false alarms as well as systemic occurrences. Its widespread use would raise suspicions of intentional false alarms on the part of drivers in following vehicles. Intentional false alarms can and will occur, sending a misleading signal to the driver behind. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To sum up, the idea that a slightly anticipatory brake lamp will prevent large numbers of rear-end collisions is intuitively attractive. However, it ignores the fact that lack of driver attention is the root cause of rear-end accidents. It is unlikely than an extra quarter second of brake light activation would cure or offset the inattentiveness of a following driver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency concludes that the potential safety benefits are minimal, but it will consider the results of the Israeli Highway Safety Administration's trial of accelerator-controlled stop lamps when they are available. While Baran's data indicate that the absolute numbers of systematic false alarms may be small on average, a perception by following drivers that the brake signal allowed false alarms, whether or not intentional, might dilute the currently unambiguous message of the stop signal. The agency previously found that ATAT's device would render the stop lamp partially inoperative as a result of the same loss of unambiguous operation. There are no fundamental differences between the systems to cause the agency to change its determination or even to allow the agency to distinguish between them in a regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, NHTSA has conducted and concluded a technical review of the petition, and has determined that there is not a reasonable possibility that the amendment requested would be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. Accordingly, the petition by Baran Advanced Technologies, Ltd., for rulemaking to amend Standard No. 108 is denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 30103; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: July 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18802 Filed 8&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

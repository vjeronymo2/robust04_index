			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> SEASON'S FIRST SNOW IN TETON MOUNTAINS  </P> <P> The first snow of the season dusted the Teton Mountains of Wyoming and heavy  rainfall drenched much of the nation. There was flooding in Oklahoma and  Kansas. Some rural roads remained impassable in portions of Maryland, where an  official reported holes up to 20 feet wide and 10 feet deep following weekend  flooding. Showers and thunderstorms soaked the Florida peninsula, across New  York state and portions of New England. But it was summer as usual with  temperatures in the 90s in the middle and southern Atlantic coast states, the  Gulf Coast, lower Mississippi Valley, the southern plains, the interior valleys  of California, the desert Southwest and near the big bend of the Rio Grande in  Texas.  </P></p>

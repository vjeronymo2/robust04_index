			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Punt still under pressure THE Irish punt faced a further day of heavy selling in the foreign exchange markets yesterday in spite of Wednesday's increase by the Irish Central Bank of overnight lending rates to 100 per cent.

Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, reiterated his determination to defend the punt, saying: 'I want to assure those in London that are spreading rumours of a devaluation that they are wrong.' He added, however, that he is 'very concerned' by sterling's weakness.

The government said his remarks were 'singularly unhelpful' and had contributed to speculative pressure. Mr Michael Noonan, the finance spokesman for Fine Gael, dismissed the attack as 'government propaganda' and said the government will be forced to devalue as 'it has no policy in place to cut the cost base of Irish business.' Industry and farm leaders, alarmed by sterling's weakness and the high real interest rates in the Irish market have demanded a comprehensive package of tax reforms, and a renegotiation of pay deals with trade unions, if the government is determined to continue defending the punt.

A spokesman for the Irish Business and Employers Confederation said yesterday: 'We are asking for strategic policies which will assure that the cost base for business and industry is brought down to a level where business can continue to compete.'</p>

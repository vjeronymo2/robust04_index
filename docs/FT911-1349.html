			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Observer: Up market For sale: 230ft reinforced concrete tower on prime hillside site near Chester. Owner, Science and Engineering Research Council, forced to sell for want of cash. It built the tower for nuclear physics experiments two decades ago. But since no buyer is likely to want it for its original purpose of generating bolts of electricity on the scale of lightning, the council is exploring other potential selling points. For instance, its height might have value for tele- communications - it already has one microwave dish and could carry a lot more. Then again, it could become a wind turbine for an electricity generator. Another possibility is a platform from which sight-seers might save themselves much footwork. Given a lift to the top, in fine weather they could see the Peak Distict to the east, industrial Lancashire to the north, Merseyside and the Irish Sea to the west, and Snowdonia to the southwest. Professor Alan Leadbeater, director of Serc's Daresbury Laboratory, would welcome suggestions for other uses - and even more so offers to buy.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / A hatred that went unbridled and remains on the loose Dr Baruch Goldstein did not disguise his hatred for Arabs. The US-born Jewish settler, who massacred some 43 Palestinians in the Cave of the Patriarchs last Friday, had given recent interviews, describing Arabs variously as 'the root of evil', 'a sickness in our society' and 'Nazis'. He had stressed the need for Jews to react more forcefully to Palestinian 'terrorism'. When one interviewer asked him about the apparent contradiction between such views and his profession of medicine, he replied: 'No. There is a time to heal and a time to kill.' A few days before his dawn massacre at the mosque, it emerged yesterday, he had confided to two people - one a friend, the other a rabbi - that he was planning an act that would shock the world. Yet, despite his frequent public racist pronouncements, the Israeli security forces, which operate intensively among the Arab population of the occupied territories, did not consider him a serious threat. Worse, those security forces for months ignored clear evidence that many radical settlers were planning violent anti-Arab actions. Even when the settlers had begun to translate threats into action, few offenders were severely punished. In the half-year since Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, shook hands on the White House lawn, there have been frequent efforts by settler extremists to honour their commitment to torpedo the peace negotiations. During last December alone - the month when the Israeli army was originally supposed to have begun pulling out of the West Bank and Gaza  - at least four Palestinians were killed by settlers in the Hebron area, where Goldstein lived: three shot from a passing car, one at a settler roadblock. On several occasions, small settler vigilante groups have virtually taken over central Hebron, firing at random down the main streets, with soldiers watching alongside the bearded gunmen, either disinclined or afraid to get involved. In the aftermath of a Palestinian attack on a Jewish target, settlers would enter Arab villages in convoys, firing into the air, breaking windows, overturning cars, shouting death threats through loud-hailers. In recent months, at least six extremist supporters of the assassinated racist Rabbi Meir Kahane have been arrested for smuggling arms into Israel for use against Palestinian targets. From the central Jerusalem offices of the Kach movement, founded by Kahane and enthusiastically supported by Goldstein, Kahane's heirs have been enthusing for months about their plans to attack Palestinian policemen when the Israeli army eventually withdraws from Palestinian autonomous areas. 'We want to increase the friction,' boasted Kach activist Noam Federman recently. 'Then there'll be anarchy, and the army will be forced to come back to restore order.' It is an indication of the extent of Goldstein's hatred that he could massacre innocent people at prayer, at a site sacred not only to Moslems but also the second most holy place to Jews. Also, it is an indication of the support for such extremist sentiment that dozens of fellow-settlers have spoken out this weekend not merely to defend Goldstein, but to praise him. Ordering a crackdown on Goldstein's colleagues from Kach and other extremist groups, the Israeli cabinet yesterday promised to place a handful in adminstrative detention, disarm 20, and restrict the movements of a few dozen.</p>

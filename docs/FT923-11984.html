			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Block vote is poser for Smith MR JOHN SMITH, the new Labour leader, confronts his first party management dilemma today as the national executive committee meets to decide whether to cut the trade unions' conference block vote from 90 per cent to 70 per cent. Under agreements reached before the election, the change was due to go ahead in 1993 after final approval at this October's annual conference in Blackpool. Some senior union leaders are now suggesting that the issue should be shelved to allow proposals for comprehensive reforms to the party's union links to be presented as a package next year. Critics of that suggestion are countering that a postponement would allow the unions to maintain their present voting strength in 1993 at the very time when crucial ballots will be held on their future powers and influence. The quandary represents the first significant management difficulty for Mr Smith since being elected by an overwhelming 91 per cent vote last Saturday. The NEC meeting will be the first he has attended. If the reduction in the block vote is postponed, Mr Smith risks being accused of slowing the process of reform in favour of the more conservative unions. Yet if he supports the cut, he risks jeopardising the goodwill of union leaders that he might need in the future. Aware of the delicacy of the issue, the newly formed review committee into the party's union links failed to make a recommendation on how the NEC should proceed when it met for the first time on Monday. The review committee, chaired by Mr John Evans MP, is scheduled to have drawn up its proposals early in the new year, to allow a thorough debate before the 1993 conference takes place. An emergency economic programme to cut unemployment should be agreed at today's cabinet meeting, Mr Gordon Brown, said yesterday, Alison Smith writes. Mr Brown, who is expected to become shadow chancellor after Labour's frontbench elections tomorrow, called on the government to use the UK presidency of the European Community to press for co-ordinated efforts to achieve economic recovery.</p>

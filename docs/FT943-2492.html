			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate earnings With input prices rising faster than output prices the risk of a UK corporate margins squeeze appears of more than academic interest. The worry is that the earnings and dividend expectations underpinning the London equity market may have failed to include such problems and are therefore over-optimistic. The realisation that the City could have been anticipating unrealistic earnings growth is undoubtedly contributing to the present stock market turbulence. The conundrum is whether the experiences reported this month by APV and BTR were special cases and their margin squeezes specific. The alternative view is that they represent the harbinger of a more general round of disappointing results. After all, a trend starts with individual examples. For the moment, APV's and BTR's problems look exceptional, though nonetheless worrying. APV suffered specifically from a German competitor trying to elbow its way into one of its markets through aggressive pricing. As for BTR, only a small minority of its businesses actually experienced shrinking margins. By contrast, Cookson, Bowater and Arjo Wiggins Appleton reported little difficulty passing on the cost of raw material price rises. Nevertheless, the market will be sensitive to any additional margins disappointments that might indicate a real trend. Given so much is expected, those companies failing to match the City's hopes are likely to be find themselves severely punished.</p>

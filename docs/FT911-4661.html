			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Institutional interest shows revival - Turnover continued its recovery in March EUROPEAN equity turnover continued its steady recovery in March. The receding spectre of the Gulf war and cuts in interest rates in some countries encouraged institutional investors to return in force. Mr James Cornish at County NatWest, which provides the monthly figures, says that in general volumes were highest at the start of the month, with another run-up before the Easter holiday. The UK was the month's star performer as turnover rose 15.3 per cent from February to Pounds 36.76bn, its best monthly figure since the Pounds 39.7bn of January 1989. Investors were attracted back to the UK by a relatively neutral budget, a further half-point cut in interest rates and a more positive perception of the economy. According to the FT-Actuaries indices, the UK has risen 18 per cent since the start of the year in local currency terms, marginally ahead of the Europe index which shows an advance of 17.8 per cent. Mr David Roche at Morgan Stanley believes that it is time to shift out of the UK and into Germany, which shows a smaller rise of 13.3 per cent so far this year. He argues that a lot of liquidity in the UK is being swallowed up by rights issues and that the market is no longer looking cheap. 'Common perceptions of the costs of unity have driven the German market below where it was in November 1989 in terms of relative performance to the UK,' Mr Roche says. Turnover in Germany rose a mere 1.7 per cent to DM122.90bn in March, but this was still its best performance since August 1990's DM142.8bn. After the UK the Netherlands showed the largest monthly rise, with a 10.2 per cent climb to Fl 15.30bn, also the highest level since last August's Fl 17.90bn. Mr Rob Sweers of Banque Paribas Nederland NV attributes the improvement mainly to the stronger dollar which helps the dollar-denominated earnings of Dutch companies. The rise on Wall Street also played its part, since shares which account for 50 per cent of Dutch market turnover (Royal Dutch and Unilever being the two leading shares with ADR programmes) are actively traded in the US. The FT-Actuaries indices show that Amsterdam has risen 19.2 per cent in local currency terms so far this year, but in March alone it rose 7.8 per cent. Mr Sweers notes that while there was evidence of fresh investment in Dutch shares in March, this has been less apparent so far in April, with options activity on the increase. Spain continued to advance in March, with turnover 8.2 per cent better at Pta803.60bn, the highest level since July 1990 when it reached Pta834.4bn. Mr Victor Galliano of Baring Securities says that investors were attracted by signs of continuing improvement on the inflation front and the sustained downward movement of interest rates. Renewed takeover speculation in the utility sector also provided interest. The only bourse to show a drop in turnover last month was Italy, down 3.4 per cent. However, volume had risen 80 per cent the previous month.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse              Dec      Jan        Feb        Mar        US                    1990      1991      1991       1991    Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium           18.58     21.59      41.52      45.48       1.29 France            92.30   **79.00   **106.80     110.40      19.09 Germany           78.00     81.40     120.90     122.90      72.08 Italy         10,007.60  8,672.40  15,592.40  15,060.00      11.87 Netherlands        7.15     11.02      13.88      15.30       7.96 Spain            614.49    498.46     742.61     803.60       7.59 Switzerland        8.30     12.00      14.20     *14.70      10.11 UK                23.80     24.50      31.87      36.76      63.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales. * Provisional figure. ** Revised figure.

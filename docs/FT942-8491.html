			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Labour calls for fullest exposure of information Labour yesterday called for the fullest possible exposure of the information submitted to the nuclear review, and argued that no companies should be allowed to hide behind the defence of commercial confidentiality. Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow energy spokesman, said the review should be a proper assessment of the industry's future and not a first draft of its privatisation prospectus. Labour, he said, remained committed to retaining the nuclear industry in public ownership as the best means of ensuring the highest standards of safety and environment. Greenpeace, the environmental group which opposes nuclear power, welcomed the wide-ranging nature of the reviews. Ms Bridget Woodman said the environment department's review of radioactive waste management would cause significant problems for the nuclear industry, parts of which had opposed such a thorough approach. However, Nuclear Electric said the radioactive review would help it resolve issues on safe storage which it had been pressing the government to address for some time. Nuclear Electric said privatisation was certainly possible given its impressive improvements in commercial performance over the last four years. Scottish Nuclear, which is less enthusiastic about immediate privatisation than Nuclear Electric, was delighted the review would be wide-ranging. 'It is an opportunity to put to rest once and for all some of the outstanding issues such as waste and decommissioning liabilities and to consider the financial structures of the companies,' said Mr James Hann, chairman. The UK Atomic Energy Authority said it did not believe the reviews would affect the proposed privatisation of its technology division. The authority's decommissioning and waste management arm will stay in the state sector. 'Our structure may provide a useful model for the review to consider,' it said.</p>

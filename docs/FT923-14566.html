			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: World's tyre industry 'set for recovery' THE WORLD tyre industry is poised for recovery after Dollars 1bn of collective losses in the past two years, an Economist Intelligence Unit study* says, John Griffiths writes. Provided the US car market recovery is consolidated, the industry could earn profits above Dollars 1.5bn next year, the study concludes. Bridgestone of Japan should raise its market share in Europe and North America, as Japanese vehicle makers continue to expand their 'transplant' operations. Goodyear of the US, already back in profit, should gain market share in Europe, but Michelin of France risks losing share there, Mr Philip Wylie, the report's author, says. * World Tyre Industry: Back from the Brink. Special Report 2307. Economist Intelligence Unit, 40 Duke St., London W1A 1DW. Pounds 295/Dollars 585 Goodyear, Page 28; Bridgestone, Page 30</p>

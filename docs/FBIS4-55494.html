			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. L.: "The Most Important Thing -- End of the </F> War"]    [Text] The European plan for an approach to solving the  crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is better and more  realistic than the United States' plan and it is good that it  prevailed at the meeting in Geneva. Of course, there are bound  to be problems, but they can be solved. The most important  thing is that this plan envisages the cessation of hostilities,  which means the continuation of the peace talks, Nikola  Koljevic, vice president of the Serbian republic, told Radio  Kragujevac yesterday. Commenting on the declaration of the  ministerial council in Geneva, and the proposed division of  territory -- 49 percent for the Serbs, 51 percent for the  Muslims and Croats -- he said that the Serbian side was ready to  correct the borders if functional entities are created, that is,  if the quality and quantity of territory are treated equally.</p>

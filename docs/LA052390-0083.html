			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALMOST ALL OF THE WESTERN FINALISTS AGREE WITH CHOICE OF MAGIC AS MVP  </P> <P> Nearly every player on the Phoenix Suns and the Portland Trail Blazers said  Tuesday that the Lakers' Magic Johnson deserved his second consecutive NBA  most-valuable-player honor, although most diplomatically added that any of six  players could have been selected.  </P> <P> "The man deserves it," Trail Blazer forward Buck Williams said.  </P> <P> "Magic is the best player that's come down the pike in a long time. He is  phenomenal, but he makes people like A.C. Green, Mychal Thompson and Vlade  Divac better players."  </P> <P> The lone dissenting vote was cast by Portland guard Clyde Drexler. Although  Drexler did not begrudge Johnson the honor, he said he would have voted for  fellow Houstonian Akeem Olajuwon.  </P> <P> "Any time you pick Magic Johnson for MVP, you can't go wrong," Drexler said.  "But maybe I'm a little biased. I would've taken Akeem. It's hard to overlook  his statistics. He was up there in almost every category." SAM McMANIS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 18 (TANJUG) -- Two years of economic  sanctions have made it necessary for Yugoslavia to import food  articles it used to export to meet the most basic needs of its  population, experts of Serbia's Ministry of Agriculture set out.  Despite great potential in food production, Yugoslavia would  have to import some 100,000 tonnes of sugar, some 400 million  liters of milk, 50,000 tonnes of potatoes and 20,000 tones of  beans, said Ivko Djonovic, Serbian agriculture minister in an  interview to Belgrade's daily BORBA Monday.    In this way, Djonovic denied assessments by federal  government experts that farmers would this year secure enough  food to satisfy the needs of the Yugoslav population. Yugoslav  farmers have prior to the introduction of the sanctions exported  all currently deficient articles. Thus, Yugoslav sugar  factories earned 300 million dollars annually from sugar  exports, said Djonovic.    Market surpluses, in his view, could be expected in basic  cultures such as grain and maize. Experts assessed that some  2.5 million tonnes of grain would this year be reaped in Serbia.  Yugoslavia's overall needs may be met with 1.5 million tonnes.    Apart from its population of 10.4 million, more than 500,000  officially registered refugees from the former Yugoslav  republics, were a cause for concern.</p>

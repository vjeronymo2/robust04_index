			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Finance said its policy goals for  1997 are the economy growing at 8.2 per cent a year, with  inflation of no more than five per cent and current account  deficit within two per cent of gross domestic product. Also, it  wants all departments to shape up and cope better with the  increasingly competitive economic environment.    Between May 13-15, the Ministry of Finance held a seminar on  its five-year plan. It was chaired by Finance Minister Tharin  Nimmanhemin, and attended by most senior officials.    Until recently, the plan which is to cover the years  1993-1997 had been just a broad framework. The seminar was to  refine the plan, transforming policy goals into policies and  concrete measures.    Speaking at the seminar, Tharin stated the role of the  Ministry of Finance. He said it must strive for the country's  macroeconomic stability given that international economic  conditions are changing rapidly. It should also try to bring  about more equitable regional income distribution, but that  shouldn't adversely affect the overall economy.    Thus, in its latest five-year plan, the ministry targets  economic growth of 8.2 per cent a year in 1997. The ceiling for  inflation and current account deficit (to GDP) is set at 5 per  cent and 2 per cent, respectively.    "The growth rate that we set is not too high compared to  current economic conditions. This is because we need to  maintain macroeconomic stability , otherwise inflation could be  too high causing the current account deficit to deteriorate  further," said Suwan Phasuksawat, the Fiscal Policy Office's  (FPO) deputy secretary general.    Suwan said the policy instrument that the ministry will use  is the govemment's budget, especially the expenditure side. It  has to be consistent with prevailing economic conditions, and  for the year 1995 it will have to be a balanced budget.    He also said, "Public investment will become a major tool  for  the government to absorb the impact of externally induced  economic volatility. It will decrease when the economic growth  is too strong, but it will help activate the economy when it  slows down."    Dr Somchai Ruchuphan, FPO secretary-general, said the  ministry will seek to maintain the value of the baht so that it  remains credible as it is increasingly used in Indochina.    "We seek to stabilize the baht because it is used widely  [in]  Burma as well as in Indochina. In 1997, the baht could be a  currency for the region and in the near future foreign  corporations would certainly issue baht-denominated bonds. We  have to lay down necessary rules and look for measures to help  keep the baht from excessively fluctuating," Somchai said.    He said the government's further financial liberalization is  contingent upon an assessment of the past impact.    On revenue, three departments are involved. And their role  from now on will be changed, Somchai said.    The Excise Department will have to enhance its operational  efficiency as it has to collect taxes on consumption of  gasoline, some electronic items, liquor, cigarettes and  automobiles. The revenue from these tax items tends to rise  along with the pace of economic growth.    The Revenue Department is expected to have a higher  proportion of total government revenue as the base for  value-added tax has expanded along with the economy trade and  investment. And the department already has a policy to improve  efficiency in tax collection.    The revenue of the Customs Department is expected to fall  due  to international economic obligations. But the department may  have to collect tax from a larger amount of merchandise as the  tariff rate will fall.    Treasury Department Secretary General Niphat Phukkanasut  said  the department would shift its attention to property  development. It would adopt the private business concept and  would propose that government agencies pay rental fees for the  use of land which belongs to the Treasury Department.    In the seminar, Tharin said the ministry would help local  government to have at least twice the current revenue. This  will come from fees on land transfer, estimated to be at least  Bt10 billion a year.    "Local government which sees active trading in land will  also  have higher revenue," Tharin said.    To privatize education, Tharin said he would propose to the  Cabinet some tax, incentives, including allowing schools to rent  land from the Treasury Department at concessional rates.</p>

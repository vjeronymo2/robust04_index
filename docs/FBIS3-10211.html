			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish of 9  February 1994 on pages 1 and 8 reports that Sandinist Air Force  (FAS) pilots are leaving the Air Force because of opportunities  to receive higher salaries working as helicopter and airplane  pilots in Costa Rica and other Central American countries.  According to the article, the number of requests to leave the  FAS has been so great that some pilots have been incarcerated in  order to prevent desertions. The Sandinist People's Army (EPS)  has requested the assistance of the National Police in arresting  deserting pilots, the article reports. Because so many pilots  are leaving, the FAS is unable to provide enough crews for all  of its aircraft. Captain Eduardo Medina of the EPS Office of  Public Relations confirmed that the police had arrested FAS  pilots but denied any knowledge of why they were detained.</p>

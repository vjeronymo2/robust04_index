			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Rehder] </F>   [Excerpt] Sao Paulo -- The rule to convert prices into  URV's [Real Value Unit] is not being taken into account in  negotiations between industrialists and supermarkets. According  to Firmino Rodrigues Alves, vice president of the Association of  Sao Paulo Supermarket (Apas), since 18 April, 80 percent of the  products already are being billed in URV's with prices between 8  and 12 percent higher than the last quarter of 1993.  Provisional Measure No. 457, however, is quite clear: The  conversion must be based on the average price of that period.    In March the supermarkets suspended purchases from the  industrial sector in URV's. Since then they have been getting  their supplies from the wholesale market or from the industries  that continue to sell in real cruzeiros. The supermarkets  started running out of this alternative two weeks ago when the  wholesale market's stocks started running low.    Alves stated: "Now they [wholesale dealers] also will have  to negotiate with the industrial sector." [passage omitted]</p>

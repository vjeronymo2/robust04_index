			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Companies win over rental VAT GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group, and Thorn EMI, the electronics group, yesterday won a joint appeal at a Customs and Excise tribunal that they will not be required to pay value added tax on insurance premiums for rental equipment. The two companies had made no provisions in their accounts because they believed they were confident of winning, but an adverse ruling would have cost them more than Pounds 50m.

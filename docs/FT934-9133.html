			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK bucks trend of plunging sales of new cars WEST European new car sales fell by an estimated 15.1 per cent in October to 902,000. Demand has dropped sharply for 10 months in succession, as the European motor industry suffers its steepest sales decline of the post-war period. New car sales in the first 10 months of the year declined by 15.3 per cent to 9.8m, according to industry estimates, with 1.76m fewer cars sold so far this year than in the corresponding period of 1992. Much of the industry is operating at a loss as carmakers take drastic action to reduce production and cut jobs. New car sales in October were lower than a year ago in 13 of 17 markets across western Europe, with demand growing only in the UK and in Scandinavia. In the first 10 months of the year sales were lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe, with demand growing only in the UK and marginally in Norway. There was little sign of the recession easing in any of the large volume markets with the exception of the UK. New car sales in Germany fell by an estimated 18.7 per cent in October compared with the decline of 18.6 per cent in the first 10 months. In Italy sales fell by 19.7 per cent in October compared with a decline of 22.1 per cent in the first 10 months of the year, while in Spain a decline of 22.8 per cent in October compared with a drop of 25.1 per cent in the first 10 months. The pace of decline in France was little changed, with a drop of 17.6 per cent year-on-year in October and of 17.3 per cent in the first 10 months. The UK remains the only significant market in west Europe, where new car sales are rising - albeit from a depressed level - with an increase year-on-year of 15.5 per cent in October and of 12.1 per cent in the first 10 months. Sales in the UK are being boosted by the most aggressive marketing campaigns ever mounted, as carmakers seek to gain a larger share of the only growth market. Among the volume carmakers, the Volkswagen group of Germany and the Fiat group of Italy have lost most ground this year, with sales plunging by around 21 per cent in the first 10 months. Rover group, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is the only significant carmaker in Europe to have increased its sales volume. It has been helped by the increase in the UK market and a strong performance - albeit from a small base - in the contracting markets of Germany, Italy and France.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- January-October 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          Volume       Volume    Share (%)    Share (%)                         (Units)   Change (%)   Jan-Oct 93   Jan-Oct 92  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET          9,796,000        -15.3        100.0        100.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURERS:  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Volkswagen group      1,600,000        -20.6         16.3         17.4  - Volkswagen         1,059,000        -20.5         10.8         11.5  - Audi                 271,000        -24.9          2.8          3.1  - Seat                 226,000        -19.2          2.3          2.4  - Skoda*                44,000         +4.9          0.4          0.4 General Motors**      1,269,000        -11.4         13.0         12.4  - Opel/Vauxhall      1,222,000        -10.9         12.5         11.9  - Saab***               34,000        -23.1          0.3          0.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen   1,193,000        -14.6         12.2         12.1  - Peugeot              723,000        -14.7          7.4          7.3  - Citroen              470,000        -14.4          4.8          4.8 Renault-Volvo ****    1,172,000        -15.7         12.0         12.0  - Renault            1,029,000        -15.5         10.5         10.5  - Volvo                143,000        -16.9          1.5          1.5 Ford**                1,146,000        -14.0         11.7         11.5  - Ford Europe        1,136,000        -14.0         11.6         11.4  - Jaguar                10,000         -0.1          0.1          0.1 Fiat group*****       1,090,000        -21.3         11.1         12.0  - Fiat                 816,000        -20.7          8.3          8.9  - Lancia               155,000        -22.6          1.6          1.7  - Alfa Romeo           108,000        -25.0          1.1          1.5 Nissan                  346,000         -6.8          3.5          3.2 BMW                     316,000        -17.5          3.2          3.3 Rover******             306,000        +12.9          3.1          2.3 Mercedes-Benz           291,000        -17.1          3.0          3.0 Toyota                  275,000         -5.0          2.8          2.5 Mazda                   171,000        -27.4          1.7          2.0 Honda******             139,000        -10.4          1.4          1.3 Mitsubishi              123,000        -12.7          1.3          1.2 Total Japanese        1,209,000        -12.0         12.3         11.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS:  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany               2,727,000        -18.6         27.8         29.0 Italy                 1,610,000        -22.1         16.4         17.9 United Kingdom        1,577,000        +12.1         16.1         12.2 France                1,413,000        -17.3         14.4         14.8 Spain                   620,000        -25.1          6.3          7.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ** Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. *** GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. **** Renault and Volvo plan merger in January 1994.

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Pravda returns to the struggle 'WE'RE BACK,' said the headline over the front-page editorial in Pravda yesterday. After a month's ban, the Soviet Union's most famous paper, founded on May 5, 1912, by Lenin, is out again - and, says the leader: 'We're not changing our convictions.' If not its convictions, the paper has at least changed its tactics. Once absolutely required reading for 20m Soviet communists, it must now compete in a raucous marketplace of publications in which its pre-ban circulation of just under 500,000 will be hard to maintain. It has had to compromise with the authorities to get back on the streets. The former, hardline editor, Mr Gennady Seleznev, has been sent upstairs to the editorial board: in his place his former deputy and one-time New York correspondent, Mr Viktor Linnik - a clever man of 49 who has in the past year attended seminars in Moscow on press freedom and who said flatly yesterday: 'We are against extremism and violence of all kinds - on the left as well as on the right.' Nothing illustrates that better than its attitude to the parliamentary elections called for December 12. In a front-page article, Mr Viktor Trushkov says that boycotting the elections in the hope that the required number of voters would not turn out was rendered futile by the presidential decree establishing 25 per cent as the minimum turnout, down from the previous 50 per cent. 'This means that for opposition supporters to boycott these elections would have only one result: the federal assembly (parliament) would be absolutely in the pocket (of the president), and it would have no deputies committed to defending the interests of the working man. No, we must go to the elections in December.' Pravda, switching editors and eschewing extremes, is the only one of the banned papers to return: the nationalist (and more extreme) papers Sovyetskaya Rossiya (daily) and Den (weekly) are still banned, as is the popular '600 Seconds' television programme presented by Alexander Nevzorov - who has turned up among the leading candidates of the right-wing Constitutional Democratic party. While the main Communist party will take part in the elections, many of the smaller Leninist and Communist groups, some of them still banned, have refused. Pravda's reappearance has many ironies - none sharper than its eager endorsement of the complaints of foreign human rights organisations against the Russian government's bans, organisations it would, it its heyday, have dismissed as interfering in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union. A letter from Mr Jiri Leber of the New York-based Helsinki Watch Committee, expressing concern on the press bans, is displayed on the front page - and in the foreign section, correspondents from Paris, Vienna and Washington report on the support for Pravda's freedom to publish. With only four (broadsheet) pages, a restricted circulation, short of funds and newsprint and with Lenin no longer the draw he was, Pravda has returned not just to the streets, but to its origins in the opposition and in struggle. But - for now - within constitutional limits.</p>

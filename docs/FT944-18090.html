			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Cardoso's prize The first-round victory of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil's presidential elections - assuming the official count confirms exit poll results - presents Latin America's largest economy with its best chance in years to move on to a path of sustainable non-inflationary growth. This is good news not only for Brazilians, but for the rest of South America. The country has in the past five years become an open economy, and a growing Brazil could drive the growth of the whole region. Mr Cardoso, as finance minister, was the architect of the plan which has brought down Brazil's inflation from 50 per cent a month to below 2 per cent. He now has a chance to complete the job. He has been right to emphasise the end of inflation as a policy priority. Inflation has widened already extreme disparities between rich and poor, corroded the country's social and moral fabric, and grossly distorted the economy toward non-productive activities. Defeating inflation is an essential objective that will allow him to concentrate on alleviating Brazil's social miseries. A first-round victory will be helpful. It gives him a stronger mandate, strengthening his hand in the inevitable future battles with Congress, public servants and others who will resist reform. It avoids a further six weeks of campaigning. This should allow him to advance planning on economic strategy, ready for when he takes over on January 1. It will also permit him to spend more time building a political coalition. This is necessary because much essential legislation will require a two-thirds Congressional majority to change Brazil's leviathan 1988 constitution. There will be difficulties. There is no guarantee that Mr Cardoso's pre-electoral pact will survive and there is no reason to expect that Brazil's new legislators will display any more foresight than their myopic predecessors. Mr Cardoso will be assailed from many quarters. Public and private sector pay claims, pressure from industry for a competitive exchange rate and an inflation-hooked financial system in which some banks are perilously weak could all combine to shake his anti-inflation plan. Yet his economic priorities are clear. The government budget will be about balanced this year, but is still unstable. The conditions for long-term budgetary stability will require constitutional changes to ensure fundamental fiscal and social security reform. Measures are needed, too, to end state-sanctioned monopolies, to accelerate privatisation, to enhance the competitiveness of the economy and to reform the financial system - and to make the central bank independent. Brazil has a long way yet to go, but the prize is great: a country focusing on its social problems and taking its rightful place as one of the world's 10 largest economies as the economic leader of South America.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AD EXECUTIVES BACK CLIENT CLOTHESTIME BY BUYING SHARES  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles advertising executives are putting their money where their  commercials are -- Clothestime Inc.  </P> <P> Jack Roth and Robert Recht, president and chairman respectively of Los  Angeles-based Admarketing Inc., are leading a group of investors who have  acquired a 6.35% stake in the Anaheim-based discount retail chain that sells  women's clothing.  </P> <P> The group purchased almost 748,500 shares between Sept. 20 and Nov. 9,  according to a Security and Exchange Commission filing released this week. The  group now holds 895,000 shares of Clothestime, making it the company's third  largest stockholder.  </P> <P> Admarketing, one of the largest ad agencies in Los Angeles, has handled  Clothestime's advertising account for the past two years.  </P> <P> Roth said in a telephone interview that he bought the shares because he thinks  Clothestime stock is a relative bargain. He added that he started buying shares  in the company months ago at $3 and $4. The group bought its 748,500 shares at  prices between $1.44 and $1.94.  </P> <P> Clothestime's stock rallied 50 cents Tuesday to close at $2.375 in  over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> "We believe in the company and its future," Roth said. "And the price was so  low it appeared to be a good buy."  </P> <P> Roth said he has invested heavily in other clients of his ad agency as well,  including C&amp;R Clothiers and the Good Guys. He holds a smaller number of  shares in Home Depot as well.  </P> <P> Clothestime's low stock price reflects market worries about its performance and  problems.  </P> <P> The company's founder and chief executive, Michael DeAngelo, recently retired  at age 41, and the company's chief financial officer quit in September in the  wake of projections of shrinking profits for the chain of 370 stores.  </P> <P> At that time, the company estimated its earnings for the fiscal year ended Jan.  26 at $140,000 to $702,000, far below some analysts' earlier predictions that  earnings could reach as high as $2.8 million. But last week Clothestime  announced that its October sales were $13.3 million, a 10% increase over the  same month last year, and that its sales for the first nine months of the year  were $152.3 million, up 7% over the same period last year.  </P> <P> And the company was listed by Newport Securities recently as one of 15 Orange  County companies whose shares are selling below book value because of  "exaggerated pessimism" in the stock market.  </P> <P> Roth said he is fully aware of Clothestime's past difficulties, but is hopeful  it will make a turnaround. "They have learned both from the good things that  have happened to them and from the bad," he said.  </P> <P> And as far as investing goes, Roth said he's wagering that Admarketing's  commercials will make his stake in Clothestime a good investment. "If you can't  bet on yourself," he added, "who are you going to bet on?"  </P> <P> Clothestime officials could not be reached for comment about the stock  purchase.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners: As you have heard in the news  bulletin, Mr. Velayati, foreign affairs minister of our country,  returned to Tehran after visiting and meeting the authorities of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, as well as opening our country's  embassy in Sarajevo. Our correspondent has carried out an  interview with him in connection with his visit:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Please tell  us  what issues were discussed between you and the Bosnian  authorities during your visit to Sarajevo.    [Velayati] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. We wanted to go on this visit for the last few  months. But, the preparatory work that was to be carried out by  the United Nations was not done. They informed us during the  last few days that the United Nations had agreed. In our talks,  the issue of opening the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy in  Sarajevo, bilateral relations, and the recent changes between  our relations and Croatia were discussed, taking into account  the fact that the expansion of our relations with the Croatia  will make a great contribution toward our relations with Bosnia.    During the last two years, the intention of the Islamic  Republic of Iran has been to pave the way for reconciliation and  cooperation between Croats and Muslims. Today, both the Croats  and Bosnian Muslims know that the tripartite relations between  us, the Croats, and Muslims have turned into such organized and  secure relations, that the more these relations consolidate the  more the chances of our cooperation and through us, that of  other Islamic countries increases with the Bosnian Muslims.    Mr. Izetbegovic, in his talks, in his official talks,  clearly  specified and said that Iran has played a very crucial role in  the destiny of Bosnia and this will be recorded in history  later. But, Mr. Izetbegovic said, that what I can say that if  it was not for Iran, Bosnia would have had a different destiny.  The Islamic Republic of Iran's embassy was opened in the  presence of Mr. Izetbegovic.    [Correspondent] In general, how do you describe the  situation  in Sarajevo, and how much of a positive effect the assistance  given by the people of Iran will have on the spirit of the  people of Sarajevo?    [Velayati] The destruction that has remained from the  long-term aggression of the Serbs is an obvious sign of an  all-round oppression that has been inflicted on the Muslim  people of Sarajevo who up to now are under the full siege of the  Serbs. However, the people enjoy a very high spirit. One can  feel very easily the belief and devotion of the people to Islam  and freedom of Bosnia among the people of Bosnia. Concerning  Iran, as I have mentioned, the people are united in their views  that the Islamic Republic of Iran is their most honest defender  and supporter. They do not mention this from an analytical  viewpoint, but they say it plainly if anyone asks the people and  officials of Bosnia. [end recording]</p>

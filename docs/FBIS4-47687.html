			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Counting of ballot papers  at the Durban Expo Centre will start on Sunday [1 May]  afternoon, Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] KwaZulu/Natal  Commissioner Dikgang Moseneke said. Speaking at Gallagher  Estate, Midrand, Mr Moseneke said reconciliation at the Durban  Expo Centre had been delayed because of a dispute over "pirate  voting stations".    He said the dispute between the African National Congress  and  Inkatha Freedom Party was serious. Mr Moseneke said he did not  want to comment further because it was a contested issue.    Earlier he said an IEC team was investigating several pirate  polling station in KwaZulu/Natal. Initial reports had been  submitted and would be considered by the commission in its  assessment of whether the elections were free and fair. Ballot  boxes received from these "pirate" stations would be counted  separately.    Votes cast at such stations needed to be considered because  "people who voted believed they were valid stations", he said.    Counting was going ahead at a rate of about 500,000 ballot  papers an hour. The ideal target was a million an hour, Mr  Moseneke said. Counting was delayed in many areas because of  problems with the reconciliation process. Mr Moseneke said  reconciliation had been difficult because inexperienced  presiding officials had not filled out forms correctly in the  rush of voting.    He said some ballot boxes delivered to the Nasrec  [exhibition  center] counting centre near Johannesburg had not been properly  marked, but this did not amount to fraud. The ballot papers  could still be checked because they bore specific voting station  markings.    "I would have been suprised if it had gone smoothly at all  voting stations," he said. He added: "South Africans deserves  nothing less than to have all tallies placed before them in  reasonable time."    By mid-afternoon on Sunday about 5.5 million ballot papers  had been counted. Commenting on suggestions that Department of  Home Affairs officials would have been better able to run the  elections, Mr Moseneke said the commission's Electoral  Administration Chief Director Piet Colyn was a home affairs  official. Some home affairs officials were also in charge of  warehousing ballot papers, he added. Several warehouse managers  are being questioned in connection with missing ballot papers.  Hundreds of thousands of unused ballot papers have been found  in two warehouses in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] region.    IEC Adjudication Division head Mojanku Gumbi said the run-up  to the elections had been free and fair. Only four of the 60  cases before the adjudication division remained unresolved, he  said.</p>

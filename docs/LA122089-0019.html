			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> This continuous spraying of our population with poisonous substances is like  killing the chickens in order to keep the coop clean!  </P> <P> Granted, the Medfly infestation is a serious problem. But if we possess the  technology to land men on the moon, surely we can devise a less-hazardous  method of eradication. Any politician supporting aerial spraying of malathion  will certainly not get my vote.  </P> <P> VIVO BENNETT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Defence of the nation THE UK government's defence white paper, published yesterday, is useful as far as it goes. Despite criticism from some backbench Tory MPs, nothing in the document, Defending Our Future, should come as a surprise. Since cutbacks in defence spending of Pounds 1bn over two years were announced last year, all that remained was to choose where the axe would fall. The decision to cut conventional submarines, frigates and Tornado aircraft is sensible given the reduced military threat following the end of the cold war. The criticism of Defending Our Future is not that cuts are too savage, but that it fails to undertake a root-and-branch examination of Britain's defence commitments. This is not simply because of budgetary constraints, though they certainly cannot be ignored. At a time when other parts of the public sector - in particular, social security, health and education - are having to justify their programmes from first principles, defence commitments costing Pounds 24bn a year should not be immune from similar scrutiny. A review is also necessary because Britain has yet to make a full adjustment to the changed economic and geopolitical realities of the past 50 years. Given that Britain is no longer a rich imperial power, it is not clear a priori that it should spend 4.1 per cent of its GDP on defence, while France spends 3.4 per cent, Germany 2.2 per cent, Italy 2.0 per cent and Spain only 1.7 per cent. Nor is it clear that taxpayers could not enjoy a more generous peace dividend than that so far delivered following the end of the cold war. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, says a defence review is inappropriate because the international scene is changing so quickly that the conclusions of a review would be out-of-date before publication. But if ministers applied this judgment widely, they would not undertake fundamental reviews in any policy area. In defence, there are many pressing questions. Should Britain always be among the first to volunteer its services as a global policeman when its interests seem no more at stake than those of other nations less eager to become involved? Could the number of troops in Northern Ireland be cut, as Mr Archie Hamilton, the former armed forces minister, argued at the weekend? And does Britain's defence force, including its nuclear deterrent, need to be independent or would there be advantages in pooling some defence roles with other European Community members of Nato? It may be argued that Britain's permanent seat on the UN security council depends on maintaining a nuclear capability and being willing to become involved in global operations. But if this is so, the question remains whether the advantage of sitting at the top table is worth the price. Such questions are controversial. But that is no reason to avoid them. In addressing them, the guiding principle should be a hard-nosed assessment of Britain's realistic ambitions rather than a romantic view of its past.</p>

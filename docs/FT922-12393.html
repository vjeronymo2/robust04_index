			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: Maniacal iconoclast of film convention / Nigel Andrews talks to the Danish film director Lars Von Trier about his latest film, Europa - Screen SAY 'Danish cinema' to most cinephiles and their eyes glaze over. They think of farming families pounding butter in Nordic Technicolor or grim, impenetrable tales of 17th century religious persecution in black-and-white. Yet director Lars Von Trier had a different, de-glazing effect on last year's Cannes prize night audience. He won two awards for his spectacular film Europa and even these, it was clear, were not enough for Denmark's new Wunderkind. The first prize for Superior Technique he disdainfully handed to a colleague saying 'He has worked on all my films and is very technical'. For the second, grander Prix Du Jury he thanked 'the midget', by which we all realised with a shock that he was referring to jury president Roman Polanski. But what would you expect from a man whose movies - from the Borgesian thriller The Element Of Crime to the Nazi-era film noir Europa opening in Britain this week - place a bomb under film convention? Not since Citizen Kane, has more maniacal fun been had with cinema's visual possibilities. Multiple exposure, colour mixed with monochrome, 3D deep-focus effects, cameras passing through solid objects, back-projected dream images. . . 'I don't like Citizen Kane,' insists Von Trier in a sunny Cannes garden. 'I like Welles very much, but Citizen Kane is too obvious. I prefer The Lady From Shanghai and Touch Of Evil.' But he clearly shares Welles's 'best ever train set' view of cinema. Indeed Von Trier has a different analogy. 'I am a simple masturbator of the cinema,' he told one bemused French reporter. Meaning? 'The only thing I have in mind when I make a film is my own enjoyment.' He also enjoys kidding people along: not just interviewers but audiences. Europa winds us up with its violations of stylistic orthodoxy and also with its plot about an idealistic American (Jean-Marc Barr) arriving in Germany after the war and falling in love with a beautiful Nazi sympathiser. The terrorist group called the 'Werewolves', who carry the Third Reich flame into acts of postwar sabotage, are depicted with alarming sympathy. In Cannes a well-known left-wing daily viciously attacked the film. 'Liberation, which supported me before, was quite negative about Europa. This was an expensive multi-country co-production, so they don't like the commercial aspect. But also they think I am siding with the Nazis, which I am not. The film is seen through Leo's (the hero's) eyes: the Germans are victims at the beginning, but by the end that has changed. We had a joke, though, that I would win the Iron Cross for the film]' People have been shot for jokes like that. Still, Europa's provocateur political postures are half its fun. The other half is its delirious mise-en-scene. 'The camera moves were so elaborate we had to plan and storyboard almost the whole film. The shooting script was 1,000 pages long. The whole film was made in the studio, except for some Polish location scenes we used for backgrounds. 'Some of the shots which look impossible, like the camera going down through two floors to the bathroom where a man cuts his wrists, were quite easy. We used dissolves that the audience can't see. But some difficult shots were done for real. 'When the camera passes out from the attic room through the roof of the house and then into a train passing by, that we actually did. 'Also we used a lot of back-projection, because I love the way Hitchcock used it in films like Vertigo. Back-projection creates a dreamlike effect because it's so unreal. It divides the image into different layers, which in Europa we exaggerated by using colour and black-and-white. When we wrote the script we spelled it out in terms of 'close-ups', 'long shots' and so on. And whenever we used colour we called it a 'super close-up'.' The film has conjuring tricks a-plenty, but also real magic. Most of all in its weirdly satisfying pot-pourri of influences, from British TV (Von Trier stole the post-WW2 'innocent abroad' idea from A Family At War) to Franz Kafka. Europa's humour, especially the scenes in which two eccentric railway examiners put the train-guard hero through his paces, is pure Kafka. 'I love Kafka. He was a great infuence on my other films and I chose the title of Europa as an echo of Amerika. It's really the same story told in reverse. This time the innocent American comes to Europe. He enters a chaos of different lives, different traditions, loyalties and opinions, which I think is the charm of Europe.' Seeing Europa, with its marriage between (almost) traditional plot and go-for-broke stylistic experiment, one realises how visually tame most feature films are. 'Cinema is so expensive, that's why it's so conservative,' says Trier. 'At the beginning of the pop promo era, I was very hopeful. I thought film was becoming more experimental and that this would feed through into mainstream cinema. That hasn't happened. Today you still sell a feature film on its story, whereas a rock video can be sold on its images.' Trier is about to take another bash at the frontiers of convention. His next project is an epic thriller which will be shot over 22 years. 'I wanted to do a 'monument'. We can't afford Lawrence Of Arabia, so it's a crime story that will end in 2024] I can tell you what the first scene is, because we're shooting it today. It's Eddie Constantine helicoptering over Cannes and delivering a parcel to Udo Keir, who's waiting in a Mercedes. We haven't decided what's in the parcel, so we're shooting with five different parcels. Oh here they come now]' (Enter man bearing parcels). 'We don't know the ending yet, but I can tell you the first line. Eddie Constantine says 'This will be my last delivery.' That's all I can tell you. Now I must go.'</p>

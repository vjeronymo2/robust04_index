			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Summary] According to V. Konovalov, Russian deputy atomic  energy minister, France now occupies a special place in the  struggle for world atomic markets and nuclear fuel quotas. It  has been striving to supply even atomic power stations to the  Czech Republic and Slovakia. For this reason, the agreement of  the European Union to our atomic exports is important.    Konovalov said prices for low-grade material are falling  sharply. This is connected with a surplus and free capacities at  most enterprises.    Since the collapse of the USSR, the fuel and nuclear complex  has been concentrated in Russia. We are now producing  everything including atomic fuel, highly sophisticated equipment  for atomic power stations, and the cheapest energy. We are not  building new stations but we are completing the construction of  a number of uranium units and making some things for China and  East European countries. According to the deputy minister, we  are not purchasing anything abroad. However, four conversion  production lines have been delivered and they have made it  possible to convert the parts of the Krasnoyarsk chemical  combine which once carried out military atomic orders into one  of Europe's largest production facilities for audio and video  cassettes. The Germans are taking uranium rods for their  nuclear power stations in payment. Because of a failure to pay,  we are unable to supply our fellow-countrymen, and this  threatens our own nuclear power stations with closure.</p>

Quoting an official working with the Japanese delegation to  the talks, the paper said that if the meeting were actually  resumed, the time would most likely be some time in February  shortly before or after the third-round U.S.-North Korea  high-level talks expected to take place next month.    The report said North Korea expressed the willingness to  return to the talks during the visit to Pyongyang by Hajime  Fukata, a Dietman and organization director of the Japan  Socialist Party, late last year.    Fukata had talks with Hwang Chang-yop, North Korean Workers'  (Communist) Party international affairs director, during his  stay in Pyongyang.    The normalization talks were last held in November 1992 in  Beijing when the meeting broke up after Japan demanded a probe  to determine whether a woman named "Yi Un-hoe" who allegedly  taught Japanese language to terrorist Kim Hyon-hui was a  Japanese woman.</p>

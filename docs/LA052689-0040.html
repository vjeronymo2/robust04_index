			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE RUNNERS GEAR UP FOR IMPORTANT MASTERS CONTEST  </P> <P> The Hawthorne High boys track team, fresh from winning their seventh divisional  title in eight years a week ago at the CIF-Southern Section 4-A finals, still  have unfinished business.  </P> <P> The Cougars, who set a state record in the 400-meter relay in 40.36 at Cerritos  College last Saturday, will attempt to qualify for the state championships  tonight at 6:30 in the Masters meet at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> The Cougars may have another record on their minds when they take the track.  They are attempting to become the first high school 400 relay team to break the  40-second barrier. The top five finishers in each event will qualify for the  state championships.  </P> <P> The Masters is an important tuneup for the state meet, according to Hawthorne  Coach Kye Courtney, whose club compiled 80 points -- 40 more than its closest  competitor, Long Beach Wilson -- in the 4-A finals.  </P> <P> "This week we're working a little harder," said Courtney, whose team performed  well in the 4-A finals despite having practiced only two days because of minor  injuries.  </P> <P> "I can't run them hard before the state meet, so we're working for that this  week," he said.  </P> <P> But he insists he's not taking tonight's field lightly.  </P> <P> "We can't look ahead," he said. "We're concerned about the meet because they  squeeze a 6 1/3-hour meet into two hours, so kids like (sprinter Curtis)  Conway, who runs in a lot of events, will have their hands full.  </P> <P> "But Curtis has done it every year he's been here, so I don't think he'll have  any trouble."  </P> <P> Conway will compete in the 100, 200 and the 400 and 1,600 relays. He won both  sprints and was a member of the winning relay teams in the 4-A finals despite a  sore hamstring.  </P> <P> Hawthorne sophomore Anthony Smith, a 400 relay team member and 4-A champion in  the long jump with a mark of 24-2 3/4, was also hampered by a sore hamstring  but should be ready.  </P> <P> "We're not taking a chance on him pulling it again by putting him in the pit  during practice," said Courtney, "but he will be jumping."  </P> <P> Keith Pouncey and Dean Dunbar, who finished first and third in the 110-meter  high hurdles, will also attempt to qualify, as will Cougars Erik Allen (100)  and Chris Alexander (100).  </P> <P> The Hawthorne girls team will try to qualify in the 400 relay after an upset  win over Muir of Pasadena on Saturday. Kesha Marvin, the 4-A champion in 400  meters, and sprinter Danika Conwright (100 and 200) are two of Hawthorne's  standouts.  </P> <P> Other South Bay schools represented tonight include St. Bernard, whose girls  relay teams won the 400 and 1,600 relay championships. St. Bernard is led by  Kerri Pegues, who won the 200 and 400 sprints last week.  </P> <P> Greg Wiler of Rolling Hills, the 4-A pole vault champion at 15-0, will try to  advance, along with Tim Camillo of Leuzinger, who finished second to Wiler at  14-6.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery's Pete Hargraves, who finished second in the 2-A 100 and took  third in the 200, will attempt to advance in both sprints.  </P> <P> Lisa Leslie of Morningside, Jenifer Tully of Torrance and Bonnie Jones of St.  Bernard will compete in the girls long jump.  </P> <P> Laurie Lucas of Palos Verdes will be in the 3,200 and Marilyn Cragin of  Miraleste will compete in the high jump.  </P></p>

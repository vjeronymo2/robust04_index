			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Ferranti-Thomson wins Pounds 180m sonar contract A battle for dominance in the dwindling UK market for naval sonar equipment has been won by the Franco-British joint venture Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems with the award of a Pounds 180m contract to equip Royal Navy submarines. The decision, announced yesterday in a Commons written answer by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, brings to an end a three-year contest with GEC-Marconi, the other main British company in the sector. It is likely to accelerate moves towards the reorganisation of the sonar sector into a larger Franco-British grouping. The contract covers development of a new sonar system for nuclear-propelled 'hunter-killer' submarines and the supply of equipment for four of the Royal Navy's Trafalgar class vessels. The Ministry of Defence has abandoned plans to fit the new sonar on its five older Swiftsure class submarines. However, a further order is expected for other Trafalgar class boats. The navy has seven in total and a decision is awaited on plans to produce more. The submarines currently rely on a Plessey 'search and attack' sonar. Plessey's naval business is now part of GEC-Marconi. Yesterday's decision tilts the balance in a UK market in which Ferranti-Thomson and GEC-Marconi have had roughly equal shares, and is expected to herald a merger of the two operations. Ferranti-Thomson's UK shareholder, Ferranti International, has been in receivership since December. Negotiations have been under way on a plan to sell its 50 per cent share to the French partner, Thomson-CSF, which would then sell the holding to GEC-Marconi. Ferranti-Thomson's activities could then be pooled with GEC-Marconi's and with those of Thomson-CSF's French subsidiary Thomson Sintra Activite Sous-Marines. Thomson-CSF took its share in Ferranti's sonar business four years ago after the UK group was rocked by fraud in its US subsidiary International Signal and Control. The French company has first refusal on the holding, but the Ministry of Defence wants to maintain a UK partner. If the plan goes ahead as expected, GEC-Marconi would in effect recover the sonar business it has lost in recent years, including the latest submarine contract, Sonar 2076, and the Sonar 2050 being fitted to Royal Navy frigates. GEC-Marconi's expected move closely resembles its takeover in 1990 of Ferranti's airborne radar division. A Ferranti-led consortium was at that time on the point of clinching the radar order for the Eurofighter project.</p>

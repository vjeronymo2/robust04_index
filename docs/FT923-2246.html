			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble to quit pure fruit juice business PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the large Cincinnati-based consumer products company, is pulling out of the 100% fruit juice business by discontinuing its Citrus Hill orange juice business and selling three other fruit juice brands. The move will halve the number of jobs in P&amp;G's US juice products business, which stands at 2,300. P&amp;G is taking a Dollars 200m charge to cover the costs of the move, although it stressed that some staff could probably be absorbed into other divisions. P&amp;G said yesterday the withdrawal was designed to 'help get our food and beverage house in order', but it stressed again that it was 'in the food business for the long haul'. The relatively weak performance of P&amp;G's food division has prompted speculation that the unit might be sold. Last year, the unit made pre-tax profits of Dollars 126m (before an asset sale gain) on sales of Dollars 3.71bn, compared with a Dollars 2.88bn pre-tax profit on sales of Dollars 29.4bn for P&amp;G overall. The 100% juice business has been unprofitable for P&amp;G, although the company declined to specify the size of its losses. It explained that the decision to discontinue Citrus Hill, but seek offers for the other brands, reflected the likely possibility of finding buyers. The three brands which P&amp;G plans to sell are Speas Farm apple juice, Texsun orange/grapefruit juices, and Lincoln apple juice. Also up for disposal are a juice processing facility and separate fruit sectioning plant, both in Florida. Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank, is handling the disposals. P&amp;G said it remained committed to its juice drink brands, which include Sunny Delight and Hawaiian Punch in the US, as well as Valensina and Punica in Europe. It plans to replace its Citrus Hill Plus Calcium brand with a calcium-fortified version of its Sunny Delight juice drink product.</p>

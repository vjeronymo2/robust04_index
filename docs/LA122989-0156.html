			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DRESSER NOT MERGING WITH SMITH  </P> <P> Dresser Industries Inc., a major energy services concern, has called off a  merger pact with Smith International Inc. that would have given Dresser more  than a third of the domestic market in oil field tools and services.  </P> <P> Dresser did not disclose why the planned merger, which valued Smith at about  $465 million, was terminated late Thursday. Stock arbitragers speculated that  the deal was derailed on worries that Washington would block the merger for  antitrust reasons.  </P> <P> In early afternoon trading today, Dresser fell $1.25 to $44.50 and Smith fell  87.5 cents to $12.50. Asked why both stocks dropped, an arbitrager said, "It  (the merger) would have been ideal for both companies."  </P></p>

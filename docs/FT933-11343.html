			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Italy still backs Amato in EBRD leadership contest THE Italian government yesterday denied that the 12 EC nations had agreed that Mr Jacques de Larosiere should head the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and said Italy was still backing the candidature of Prof Giuliano Amato, the former prime minister. According to Italian officials, the government is anxious to see Italy play a more prominent role in international institutions and has decided to press the point following the resig-nation of Mr Jacques Attali. In pushing Prof Amato's candidature, the Italian government has also pointed out discreetly that France already occupies sufficient top positions in European and international organisations. The German government has been sympathetic to the Italian view, but is motivated primarily by its need to secure French support for the siting of the future European central bank in Germany. In Paris, the French government yesterday expressed confidence that Mr de Larosiere, the governor of the Bank of France, would be selected by the EC as its candidate to head the EBRD, despite signs that a consensus had not yet been reached. 'We remain sure that he is the best candidate for the job,' said a spokesman at the foreign ministry in Paris. 'We are sure that he will be the EC's candidate.' French officials have been lobbying hard for Larosiere's selection. But the Italians, angered by what they see as the over-hasty action of the Belgian finance minister in sending a letter to EC governments on Wednesday night announcing that a consensus had been reached, are continuing their diplomatic offensive.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Bank threatens to seize Tapie's furniture Mr Bernard Tapie, the French politician and entrepreneur, yesterday came under mounting financial pressure when Credit Lyonnais, his bank, threatened to seize his furniture and Paris townhouse unless he repays FFr450m (Pounds 52.4m) of his FFr1.22bn debts. The threat follows a farcical sequence of events last week after the bank announced it was terminating its five-year debt repayment agreement with Mr Tapie, a member of parliament whose political star has risen with the success of Energie Radicale, his populist left-wing movement, in the European election campaign. Credit Lyonnais last Friday sent a bailiff to make an inventory of the contents of Mr Tapie's townhouse, only to be informed by its own private detectives that some of the most valuable objects had been removed the previous day. Mr Tapie claimed that he had lent his mother-in-law a few favourite pieces of furniture. However Mr Tapie's problems mounted this week when a Paris court asked for his parliamentary immunity to be lifted so he can be investigated for tax fraud concerning the purchase of his luxury yacht, the Phocea. The tax investigation was the final straw for Credit Lyonnais, which said it feared that its claim on Mr Tapie's assets could be weakened by calls from other creditors, notably the tax authorities. The bank demanded that Mr Tapie by next Thursday repay FFr450m of his debts, FFr100m of which was lent to him to buy the Phocea. If he fails to pay, Credit Lyonnais will on the following day start legal proceedings to seize his furniture and to order the sale of his opulent townhouse off Boulevard Saint-Germain. Mr Tapie has described Credit Lyonnais's threats as part of an establishment plot against him. He said yesterday he had instructed his lawyers to 'do everything possible to protect my legal rights'. So far Mr Tapie's financial and legal problems have helped, rather than hindered, his progress in the opinion polls. Energie Radicale has continued to gain ground from the established left-wing parties and now commands 10 per cent support.</p>

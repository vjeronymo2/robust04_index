			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TAMMY DENIES DIVORCE REPORTS  </P> <P> Tammy Faye Bakker, in a letter from Florida to the folks back home, denied  tabloid reports that she is planning to divorce her imprisoned evangelist  husband.  </P> <P> Jim Bakker, 50, is serving a 45-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy stemming  from the way he raised and spent money at PTL, the television ministry and  Christian resort he founded in Ft.  </P> <P> Mill, S.C.  </P> <P> Tammy Faye visited him last week at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester,  Minn.  </P> <P> In the letter, Tammy Faye rambles on for 3 1/2 pages on the subject of fear,  before getting around to what inquiring minds really want to know.  </P> <P> "There is absolutely no truth to the latest tabloid story which says Tammy is  divorcing Jim," she writes. "It saddens my heart to see the number of  Christians who buy and read and believe the lies of these destructive  publications."  </P> <P> A tabloid recently reported Tammy Faye was seeking a $50-million divorce  settlement from Bakker, who, according to the report, had squirreled away that  amount in a Swiss bank.  </P></p>

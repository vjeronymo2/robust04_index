			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Issing firm on targets THE Bundesbank will not be deflected from its policy of pursuing firm monetary targets by outside criticism or failure to meet these in the short term, Mr Otmar Issing, a director of the German central bank, said yesterday. He told economists in Hamburg the Bundesbank's concept of setting medium-term goals in line with expected growth in production was founded in solid theory and had helped achieve the monetary stability to which the Bundesbank was committed by law. This strategy would not only be appropriate as part of a European monetary union, he added, it was 'without any convincing alternative'. Mr Issing spoke as financial markets continued to be nervous ahead of the French referendum on Maastricht and as speculation continued about the Bundesbank's intentions. In a magazine interview, Mr Eberhard Martini, head of the German Banking Association, said he expected the high discount and Lombard rates to be cut at the start of 1993 at the latest and 'perhaps already in December'. He cited signs of moderation on the wage front, notably union concessions to help Lufthansa master its current crisis. The Bundesbank has lifted German interest rates to present record levels - the Lombard rate is at 9.75 per cent - to curb inflation and dampen monetary growth. Mr Issing said domestic influences on inflation, expected to average 3.5 per cent in 1992, showed 'anything but cause to sound the all clear'. Inflationary relief came almost wholly from abroad; in July, import prices were 4 per cent down on a year ago. He denied the Bundesbank was operating too rigid a policy based on 'sticking blindly' to monetary targets. The central bank also considered other factors. That a monetary target could not be achieved in a particular period did not render the bank's concept obsolete.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Maroni: "Things Could Not Have Gone </F> Better"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] At Botteghe Oscure  [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, headquarters] they had not  cherished any false hopes about the results in the Senate. On  the contrary, as PDS Secretary Occhetto explained: "We were  ready to be in the opposition, we expected Berlusconi to obtain  a majority eventually, in the same way that he managed to obtain  one when [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio was elected. However, a  month after that vote was taken, the result is an unexpected  confirmation of the opposition's resilience in the face of the  intense maneuvering that has taken place. It was clearly  apparent from Berlusconi's speech (you could tell from the tone  he used) that he believed he had a safer majority in the bag.  The situation, however, is rather different: The newly formed  government is the expression of a slender majority, and it will  not have an easy life."    Occhetto had no doubt. As he got ready to put the finishing  touches on his contribution to today's debate in the lower  house, he confidently expounded a line of reasoning which was  both a "What is to be done?" for the PDS and a polemic against  those who had been tormenting him over the past few weeks:  "This vote," he explained, "represents a twofold advantage for  us. On the one hand, it sanctions the transition to a democracy  based on alternation: We have witnessed the formation of both  an executive which has the mandate to govern the country, and an  opposition which has the duty to control the executive's  performance. On the other hand, the vote confirms that the  government has come into being in a situation of serious  numerical, as well as political, weakness. The opposition can  rely not only on the 60 percent of Italians who did not vote for  the right-wing coalition, but also on a strong, solid base in  parliament. This confirms that the Left's great and shattering  defeat which is being spoken and written about is not, after  all, so great and shattering. This much is apparent from the  figures, and only the majority's rhetoric and self-flagellation  which some people indulge in on the Left," Occhetto added with  his numerous critics in mind, "can lead anybody to believe the  contrary."    The PDS leader was thus pleasantly surprised and doubtlessly  satisfied at what he defined as "the Italian Popular Party's  [PPI] resilience." He stressed that this was an important fact,  "an encouraging factor for those who aim to open a new political  stage in our country." The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] did not  win over the center, and this "highlights the element of  political weakness in the Right." "Clearly," Occhetto argued,  "the Right is beset by serious political and programmatic  contradictions. During the debate, Berlusconi unsuccessfully  tried to overcome them by means of rhetorical and propagandist  subterfuges, instead of providing politically convincing answers  and clear indications about his platform. But probably there  was little else he could do."    However, Occhetto was very cautious when it came to  suggesting any political indications from the PPI's confirmed  intention not to join the Knight's bandwagon: "After this  vote," he explained, "we will be able to do whatever can rightly  be done with the PPI. Overall, the opposition's strength and  solidity have been confirmed. However, it is important for us  not to get jumbled together in a single melting pot -- which  indeed the PPI is not prepared to do -- and to fully respect  each party's identity and autonomy while developing a rigorous,  serious, and purposeful opposition. This, of course, does not  rule out the possibility of finding important areas of agreement  with the center. In particular, I hope we can agree on  institutional matters and on the equally decisive issue of  safeguarding democratic guarantees."    From Palazzo Madama [Senate], Cesare Salvi [progressives  floor leader] and [PDS Senator] Claudio Petruccioli echoed the  secretary's words: "The government only made it by one vote,  the usual single vote," remarked Calvi. "But, despite the  resources at its disposal, the majority will find it  increasingly difficult to find such a vote every time a vote is  taken in the Senate -- which basically means always..."  Petruccioli also referred to "a second edition of  Scognamiglio's election," but he added that "the government must  become aware that it does not have a majority here, and that it  cannot seriously contemplate continuing to resort to this kind  of expedient in the future, as it has done once again on this  occasion. Above all," the PDS senator concluded, "the  government must renounce the arrogance of believing that it owns  the assembly, which, as mater of fact, it does not, because it  does not have a majority..."</p>

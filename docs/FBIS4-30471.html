			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 28 Jun Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 27 June, Prime Minister Hata called senior  Foreign and Finance Ministry officials to the prime minister's  official residence to hold a summit study meeting, on the eve of  summit talks of the industrialized nations (the Naples Summit)  scheduled to open on 8 July.    The Hata cabinet is no longer in a position to make any  major  policy decisions since Prime Minister Hata announced his cabinet  would resign en masse. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara  told a news conference, however, that "the Hata cabinet is  responsible for making preparations for the Naples Summit and it  is a matter of course for the cabinet to make those  preparations." Aides to the prime minister have stressed:  "Prime Minister Hata is not making preparations for the Naples  Summit on the premise of his attendance at it." But speculation  is spreading in Nagata-cho that "the prime minister is showing  extraordinary eagerness for reelection and attendance at the  Naples Summit" as he is working hard on the preparations for the  summit.    At the end of the study meeting which lasted about one hour,  the prime minister told a group of reporters: "If Japan skips  the Naples Summit, it will be left behind by the international  community and give the impression that its politics is in a  shambles. Japan should attend the summit no matter what  position it is in." In this way, the prime minister's statement  can be interpreted as his eagerness to attend the Naples Summit  or as his lingering attachment to it.    The prime minister is taking a wait-and see position on his  reelection. During a meeting with a group of reporters, one  reporter told the prime minister: "Many people appear to be  hoping for your reelection as prime minister." In response, the  prime minister said: "I have left the question of my reelection  as prime minister to the Diet." On the evening of 27 June, the  prime minister returned in a happy mood to the prime minister's  official residence after attending a meeting at a Tokyo  restaurant. A reporter told the prime minister: "The political  situation appears to be in turmoil." In response, the prime  minister said: "I do not know; I know nothing. I think that I  had better fall from power once. Many are moving to become  prime minister out of conscious for their reputation."</p>

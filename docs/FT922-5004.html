			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh 'mad cow' study urged MR DAVID Clark, the UK shadow agriculture minister, is to call for an independent report into 'mad cow' disease, saying that the incidence of infection is continuing to rise. According to Mr Clark, there has been a weekly average of 631 new cases in Britain in the four months to end-April 1992, compared with 437 last year. This constitutes an increase of 45 per cent. He plans today to table a parliamentary written question asking Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, to convene a committee of independent scientific experts to publish a report on the disease. 'In the pre-election period, the government was trying to con us that the disease would start declining soon,' he said. According to Mr Clark's figures, a total of 55,300 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (as the disease is more properly termed) has now been diagnosed, with the heaviest concentration in south-west England. The ministry of agriculture yesterday did not dispute that the incidence of infection was continuing to rise but said the number of new cases was expected to peak very shortly.</p>

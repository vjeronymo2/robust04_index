			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Vulnerable rating angers insurance companies LIFE INSURANCE companies have reacted with anger to a report by Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit-rating agency, which classified four of them as 'vulnerable'. Actuaries and analysts generally supported its broad conclusions that financial strength had declined considerably over the last five years of poor market performance, and that solvency levels were likely to remain low. But many attacked S&amp;P's attempt to classify companies' claims-paying ability into three categories of 'good', 'adequate', and 'poor' on the basis only of published information. Actuaries said the task was impossible without a detailed actuarial investigation, and that differences in accounting and valuation policies had been ignored. The four companies with the vulnerable rating, which all of them contest, were: Guardian Assurance, a subsidiary of Guardian Royal Exchange and the only UK-quoted company affected. GRE said that S&amp;P had failed to take into account the fact that the company had stopped offering 'with-profits' contracts, which require strong reserves, and that it should now be regarded as a 'unit-linked' office. National Provident Institution, a mutual office which concentrates on 'with-profits' business, and relies mainly on independent financial advisers for its business. NPI was the first to react. By 10 o'clock yesterday morning it reported that its London office alone had received 20 calls asking to surrender policies following the S&amp;P survey. Mr Bernard Brindley, its chief actuary, pointed out that its conservative valuation basis had been ignored and that it retained a 65 per cent holding in equities, in the region of the industry average and allowing it room to increase financial strength by switching into fixed interest securities. Prolific Life &amp; Pensions, which is owned by Hafnia, the Danish insurance company, and is in negotiations to be acquired by Scottish Provident, the mutual life assurance group. Prolific said the statement that 50 per cent of its policies lapsed before maturing was misleading, and that the true figure was 17 per cent. Windsor Life, now a subsidiary of New York Life, said the report was based on 'out-of-date information'. It said it had not been consulted by S&amp;P before the report was published, and expected to discuss and then contest the rating with S&amp;P.</p>

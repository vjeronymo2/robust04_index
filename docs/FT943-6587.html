			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / US and Cuba to hold talks on refugees The US has agreed to hold limited talks with Cuba over the refugee problem but will not discuss the trade embargo and the US presence on the island at Guantanamo Bay. Meanwhile, Cuban president Fidel Castro made a small concession to the US over the refugees by ordering his police and coastguards to stop unsafe boats and rafts carrying children from leaving the country, according to a Cuban Sunday newspaper. The numbers of refugees has fallen in the past few days as stormy weather in the Straits of Florida deterred many Cubans from attempting the crossing. The US coastguard picked up 130 people on Saturday and by midday yesterday reported they had found no more refugees. The dramatic fall in numbers comes at the end of a month that has seen 17,100 Cubans flee for the US. Administration officials acknowledged that the weather had contributed to the drop, but also said Cubans had come to understand that they would not get into the country if they fled by boat. US secretary of state Warren Christopher said more than 200 refugees being detained at the Guantanamo Bay naval base had asked to be returned to Cuba. Report, Page 3</p>

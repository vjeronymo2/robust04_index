			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Yeltsin crushes Moscow revolt: Rebel leaders jailed - President bans opposition groups and closes newspapers FORCES loyal to President Boris Yeltsin took the Russian parliament yesterday in a brutal battle that ended with many of its rebel defenders dead and their ringleaders in jail. The death toll remained unclear last night as a Yeltsin aide retracted a claim of 500 dead, but dozens were reported killed and more than 100 wounded. After the 10-hour assault by troops with tanks, sporadic shooting continued for hours as soldiers hunted snipers in and around the shattered parliament building, the White House. Mr Yeltsin followed up his victory by banning a number of opposition groups, issuing a warrant for the arrest of two of their leaders, closed several hardline newspapers including Pravda, and imposed an overnight curfew on the capital. Western leaders voiced support for Mr Yeltsin, who also received backing from the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Belarus. President Bill Clinton said he now expected Mr Yeltsin to build democracy and validate his own leadership again at the ballot box. Foreign ministers of the European Community, meeting in Luxembourg, elicited a promise from Mr Yeltsin's office that his leading opponents would not be harmed. The EC ministers were drawn into the fray when Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliament's leader, and former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi voiced an appeal to them to guarantee their safety before giving themselves up. Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Rutskoi, stripped of his general's rank and his vice-presidency, were driven away from parliament in a bus and herded with others into Moscow's notorious Lefortovo jail. A Yeltsin aide said they might face trial. When a truce was agreed, some 300 deputies, supporters and staff filed out of the smouldering parliament building between lines of soldiers. Their surrender to the army's ruthless assault on the White House ended 12 days of defiance of Mr Yeltsin's decree dissolving parliament ahead of elections to a new-style body in December. The rebellious deputies initially won some support for their defence of the constitution in the face of Mr Yeltsin's decree. But anti-Yeltsin groups, including communists and nationalists, lost sympathy by launching violent attacks on Sunday on the mayor's office and the TV centre. Last night the 19-storey white marble parliament was left burning, with black holes torn in its facade. Inside parliament in the early evening, bodies still lay on the glass-strewn floor as soldiers searched the building for pockets of resistance. Fresh troops were sent into the area around parliament as fighting broke out from unidentified defenders. In the streets of Moscow around the building, which were cleared of traffic, knots of people gathered, many of them voicing strongly anti-Yeltsin sentiments. In one side street, a group - unarmed - was formed into a detachment and marched off, its leader warning them to 'watch out for the paratroopers'. With passions still running high, gunmen early today unleashed automatic fire on the headquarters of the Itar-Tass news agency, but troops killed one of the attackers and arrested eight others. Besides the two leaders of the parliamentary revolt, troops seized ex-General Albert Makashov, the leader of Sunday night's attack on the Ostankino television centre. They also took into custody the three 'power ministers' appointed by parliament: Mr Viktor Barannikov, security; Mr Vladislav Achalov, defence; and Mr Vladimir Dunayev, interior. Mr Yeltsin, who returned to his state dacha late yesterday afternoon after two days in the Kremlin supervising the attack, promised that leaders of the 'communist-fascist' uprising would be harshly dealt with. His first real test of public reaction comes today, when he meets regional leaders in the Federation Council - the body he has named to be the upper house of a proposed new parliament, or Federal Assembly. The first reactions from the regions were cautious, as their leaders called for order to be maintained - although Irkutsk's council blamed the 'tragic events' on the 'irresponsible actions of both levels of power', a formula that may be widely copied. Mr Yeltsin has already decreed that the Federation Council must be subordinate to him.

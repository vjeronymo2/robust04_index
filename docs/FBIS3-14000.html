Bhatt] </F>   [Text] So long, the security forces have borne the brunt  of the low-cost proxy war that Pakistan has been waging in  Kashmir. They have shown exemplary patience and restraint in  dealing with criminal elements trained, armed, and funded by  Pakistan. Unfair and false accusations have been flung at them.  The tragedy overall was that some elements in our own country  were oblivious of the tremendous burden on the security men and  were willing to be taken in by the untruthful propaganda. Now  the answer to Pakistan and its supporters has come from the  august Parliament of India.    Both houses have adopted with unanimity a resolution warning  Pakistan against aiding and abetting the terrorists in Kashmir.  The people's representatives have demonstrated that India  stands completely united as one man on preserving her integrity.  The Parliament has also shown that when the time comes  democracy can prove stronger that the plutocracy that our  neighbor seems to have and stronger than any other form of  government. We may have our differences on many issues.  Different parties have different views on how and when the  political process in Kashmir should be restarted. Differences  persist on who would be the best persons to run the state in the  meanwhile. But on the integrity of the nation, on Kashmir being  an inalienable part of India and the need to drive out the  terrorists sent from across the border, there are no two  opinions.    One wishes this warning to Pakistan had come somewhat  earlier, but it has been satisfying to note that lately there  has been the much desired clarity and firmness of resolve in the  government's utterances and actions. The government seems to  have grasped the meaning of the disturbing statements emanating  from Washington which have given some strength to Pakistan's  reckless actions in Kashmir. In a way, therefore, Parliament's  resolution is a warning to both Islamabad and the United States.    By a fortuitous and fortunate coincidence, the European  ambassadors who recently toured Kashmir also spoke through a  representative on the issue of terrorism in Kashmir. Their  evaluation is of importance because they had complete freedom to  observe whatever they felt they should see to form an opinion.  They have found evidence of the terrorists, including foreign  mercenaries, operating in strength. They also saw that the  people are fed up with the prolonged militancy supported by  Pakistan. India has also to be vigilant against any excesses and  ensure that the people in Kashmir are protected and not allowed  to come to harm. The voice of the people of India expressed by  Parliament must serve as a strong warning to both the  perpetrator of the armed intrusions and its long distanced  supporter.  *</p>

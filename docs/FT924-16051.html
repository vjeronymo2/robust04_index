			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The clear-up after the party: Collor's heirs inherit a strengthened democracy but a fragile economy People poured onto the streets across Brazil on Tuesday night to celebrate the congressional vote which looks set to finish the political career of President Fernando Collor de Mello and end four months of economic and political paralysis in Latin America's largest country. Their joy may be short-lived. When they wake up after their impeachment parties, Brazilians may well reflect that they have taken a leap into the unknown. They have ditched the devil they know - an apparently corrupt politician from the north-east - for one of which they know almost nothing. Mr Itamar Franco, the 62-year-old vice-president, takes over, but only for a maximum 180 days while the senate puts the suspended Mr Collor on trial. But nobody is betting that Mr Collor would win the senate impeachment vote. In all likelihood, Mr Franco will be president until the end of 1994 when the next president will take office. Mr Franco, a former senator, has not made a huge mark in his political career to date; he stayed discreetly in the background throughout the impeachment battle. In the 1980s, he made nationalistic speeches suggesting hostility to the modernisation of the economy, but at that time most Brazilian legislators were doing the same. More respected for his apparent moral qualities than for his political vision, Mr Franco looks staid when set against the jet-skiing Mr Collor. He does have some things going for him, however. He is likely to enjoy a honeymoon period: many of the 441 deputies who voted for Mr Collor's impeachment are likely to support him in Congress, at least initially. Mr Pedro Simon, a senator and one of Mr Franco's main advisers, said yesterday: 'Never in the history of Brazil has there been such an opportunity for national understanding.' There will also be support among the millions who took to the streets to urge the ousting of Mr Collor. Mr Albueno Averedo, governor of Espirito Santo, says: 'People took to the streets not just to change the president but to change the country.' In fact, Mr Franco takes over a country which has already changed by demonstrating a new-found political maturity. In the run-up to this week's vote, constitutional propriety was strictly observed; the ever-watchful military, which ran the country until 1985, did not intervene; nobody was killed in the thousands of street protests all over the country and the press strengthened its reputation as the freest, and most responsible, in the region. However, removing the president does not remove Brazil's pressing social and economic problems. First, Mr Franco takes over a government in desperate financial straits. Next year's budget will require swingeing cuts to compensate for a 25 per cent real fall in tax collection since Mr Collor took office and to pay a court-ordered 147 per cent increase in pensions, delayed by the Collor government. Government spending has already been cut to the bone. The federal government payroll has fallen from 62 per cent of the overall budget in 1988 to 25 per cent for the past two years, largely through keeping public sector pay at low levels. There has been little investment in roads and infrastructure, and the health and education sectors are in crisis through lack of funding. To make things worse the last weeks of the Collor government were marked by big hand-outs to politicians for pet projects in a crude and expensive attempt to win their support. Interest rates - which have been kept at more than 30 per cent a month to keep a control on inflation - are pushing up the government's domestic debt, and causing interest payments to mushroom. Mr Mailson da Nobrega, a former economy minister, warns: 'The situation is dramatic. If an emergency tax reform is not passed immediately next year's budget will be unmanageable.' On the revenue side, the government has been unable to crack down on tax evaders, partly because Mr Collor's moral authority was so eroded. An inland revenue study in July found 76 per cent of big companies were not paying any tax at all, while the informal 'black' economy is estimated to be at least half as big as the formal economy. With the political support he is likely to command initially, Mr Franco could push through some form of fiscal reform, critical to imparting order to government finances. If he succeeds in this, Mr Arminio Fraga, international director of the Central Bank, believes there are reasons to be bullish about economic prospects. 'We are handing over a good ball. We have no price controls, no foreign exchange problem, a competitive exchange rate and have brought privatisation under way. It would be shame to see all this groundwork wasted.' This is undeniably true in Brazil's international financial relations. Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the internationally respected economy minister, has transformed his country's former image as the black sheep of the international financial community since he took office in May last year. He has signed accords with commercial banks and the Paris Club of official creditors and secured an accord with the International Monetary Fund, though Brazil has subsequently failed to meet the targets and will have to renegotiate this. He built up reserves from critical levels of Dollars 7bn to today's record of Dollars 22bn. However, domestically, Mr Franco is facing a macroeconomic picture which in some respects is in no better shape than that which Mr Collor inherited in 1990. Inflation has been stuck at more than 20 per cent a month for more than a year and a fast-growing public sector borrowing requirement is heading for 20 per cent of GDP. Industry is in its third year of recession and wages are at their lowest real level for 12 years. Most industry is operating with 30 per cent idle capacity and unemployment in Sao Paulo is at record levels of 16.2 per cent. Brazilians joke that Mr Moreira has been 'standing on the right road', rather than moving along it. A recent report from one World Bank economist describes the policy as a 'lukewarm gradual strategy'. It also criticises the minister for a costly strategy of using government debt to offset the inflationary impact of hefty inflows of foreign capital, attracted in part by high interest rates. Where Mr Franco's government will stand or fall will be on inflation. Fears persist that he will be tempted to try a populist measure such as the kind of shock plans - including confiscations of financial assets and price-wage freezes - employed by Mr Collor early in his term, though his aides rule this out. Economists say such schemes would be bound to collapse quickly unless the government's fiscal house was put in order. The Franco administration will also come under great pressure from industrialists, trade unions and state workers to relax some of Mr Collor's more radical reforms such as the abolition of quotas on imports and tariffs. For Mr Collor carried out some of his promises to modernise the economy: he ended 30 years of price controls and 50 years of protectionism, reducing tariffs and lifting bans on the import of items such as cars and fax machines. He took on powerful cartels in areas such as cement and aluminium, prompting price wars rare in Brazilian history, and changing public opinion in favour of privatisation. Mr Collor's allies in the impeachment battle tried to portray Mr Franco as a retrograde nationalist who would undo all his good work, and claimed that the campaign against him was a direct result of his attack on vested interests. Mr Franco is very sensitive on this point and his advisers are anxious to spread the word that he has changed since the days when he voted in favour of nationalistic projects. Mr Mauricio Correia Lima, who is expected to become justice minister, says: 'He's prisoner of the fact that he was in Congress in the days when everyone was a nationalist.' Mr Orestes Quercia, leader of the PMDB, the main party supporting Mr Franco, insists the modernisation programme has nothing to do with Collor's downfall and that it will now move ahead more smoothly. 'There were good things in the programme. The problem was that Collor had no political or administration skills. He was like an architect with a great design but no possibility of building it. Now this ability exists and we intend to use it.' The first test of Mr Franco's commitment to modernisation will be in the ministers he appoints. The second will be whether he maintains a further import tariff reduction due today to bring average tariffs down to 17 per cent. This could be difficult to alter because the country is locked into external agreements such as that with Mercosul, the proposed customs union also comprising Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which promises common external tariffs by 1995. Mr Franco's task will become more difficult the longer he is in office. He cannot expect to keep a wide political coalition together over the long term, and he lacks the authority of an electoral mandate. Moreover, Mr Collor plans to hang around and fight out the senate judgment over the next six months, hoping that he could still make a comeback, as unlikely as that seems. The attention of congressmen will soon be distracted once more, with next April's crucial referendum to decide the country's future political system - monarchy, presidential or parliamentary. If, as expected, a parliamentary system is chosen, new laws will be required to strengthen the fragmented party system which has made the country difficult to govern. There are already mutterings of a return to the dark days of former President Jose Sarney. Another vice-president propelled unexpectedly to high office, Mr Sarney took office in 1985 after President Tancredo Neves died before he could assume office. Beholden to too many parties and interests, the Sarney administration was marked by constant squabbling and paralysis and degenerated into a spending spree which caused inflation to hit 84 per cent a month. Mr Franco's administration risks a similar fate. Brazilians expect him to crack down on corruption and tax evasion to prevent a repeat of the Collorgate scandal. Mr Aristides Junqueira, the attorney-general, comments: 'I think Tuesday's vote will mark the end of impunity for corrupt politicians in Brazil, but it will not be easy and we must not let Collor's ouster be a mere panacea.' It sounds good. But Brazil has a history of disappointing optimists. The fact is that Mr Franco will have a lot of hopes to fulfil in his two years and three months in office and no money in the coffers with which to do it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COLLOR FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 15 1990: Collor takes office.

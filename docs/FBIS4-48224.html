			<p>BFN     [Text] Dakar, 15 May (MENA) -- Senegalese press reports say  the Iranian Embassy in Dakar is involved in financing some  Islamic fundamentalist movements in Senegal. This has prompted  the Senegalese authorities to ask Iran to withdraw its  ambassador from Dakar as soon as possible. However, official  Senegalese sources have declined to comment on these reports.    Observers believe the Senegalese Government is trying to  deal  with the situation calmly to avoid any complications that might  compromise Senegalese-Iranian relations.</p>

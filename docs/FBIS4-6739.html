			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Bilateral trade between  China and North Korea reached 900 million dollars last year, a  50-percent increase over the previous year, indicating the  latter's growing economic reliance on Beijing amid Pyongyang's  increasing isolation due to its nuclear program, according to a  report by the Chinese Embassy here.    The report, obtained by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and  Industry Friday, showed that China exported 600 million dollars  worth of goods to North Korea, up 11.3 percent from 1992, with  crude oil accounting for 240 million dollars followed by grain  (100 million dollars) and electric and electronic products (20  million dollars).    In particular, North Korea's grain imports recorded a  44.1-percent increase last year from 1992, showing the North  suffered greatly from food shortages caused by cold weather.    The statistics also show that Pyongyang has switched to  China  from Russia for oil and ore imports since the collapse of the  former Soviet Union.    Meanwhile, North Korea shipped 300 million dollars worth of  products to China last year, a 91.2-percent rise compared with  the previous year, the report said.    The total amount breaks down to 210 million dollars in  steel,  20 million dollars in cement and 10 million dollars in sea  products.</p>

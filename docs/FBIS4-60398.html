			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tunis, 16 May (KUNA) -- The Embassy of the State  of Kuwait in Tunis today denied that there are Algerian good  offices for what is described as clearing the air between Kuwait  and the Iraqi regime, on the occasion of a tour to the recent  Maghreb countries by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first deputy prime  minister and foreign minister of Kuwait.    In a statement, a copy of which was received by KUNA, the  Embassy expresses "Kuwait's rejection of the attempt to link  Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's tour and the message which the head of  the Iraqi regime sent to the Algerian president." [passage  omitted] The Embassy statement affirms that relations between  the State of Kuwait and the Iraqi regime are ruled by  international legal resolutions which Iraq must observe, instead  of making open attempts to contain them and evade implementing  them.</p>

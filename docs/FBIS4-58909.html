			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Caroline Faraj] </F>   [Excerpts] AL-RA'Y -- Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali has said that the Palestinian brothers achieved a  major step in Cairo. [passage omitted] This came in a joint  news conference held at the Prime Ministry yesterday by Prime  Minister Dr. al-Majali and Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi at the conclusion of the meetings of the Joint  Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee. [passage omitted]    Asked about Egyptian-Palestinian relations and the news  reports that Egypt should first approve of any Palestinian  decision before it is announced, Dr. Sidqi denied these reports,  saying: Egypt places itself, its resources, and its experience  at the disposal of any Arab country. Therefore, it is natural  to place our resources and experience at the disposal of the  Palestinians, particularly the PLO.    Dr. Sidqi added: However, it is incorrect to say that no  Palestinian decisions are made without referring to Egypt.  Palestinian decisions are made by the Palestinians themselves.  We only help and express our opinions, which are sometimes  taken into consideration and sometimes not. We have never  imposed anything on the PLO since the time it was recognized as  the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  inside and outside [the occupied territory].    Dr. Sidqi indicated that Egypt has been maintaining good  relations with the PLO for a long time. He said: Relations  between us and the PLO have never been completely severed. Even  during times of disagreement, contacts were held. The Palestine  question is the heart of the Middle East issue. Therefore, it  is in our common interest that we hold almost daily talks and  consultations. [passage omitted]    In response to a question on whether Jordan has asked Egypt  to intervene with the United States to lift the al-'Aqabah  siege, Dr. Sidqi said: There is no mediation in this regard.    He added: We do, however, welcome the recent developments  aimed at finding a solution to this problem because it harms  Jordan. Egypt is ready to intervene and mediate should the need  arise. However, the current proposals respond to most of  Jordan's wishes and legitimate demands. This fact is supported  by Egypt. [passage omitted]</p>

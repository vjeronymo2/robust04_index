			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Commission clears bid for Perrier NESTLE, the Swiss foods group, has won European Commission approval for its FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.58bn) bid for Perrier, the French mineral water group, but will have to give up several brands to a new 'third force'. It has agreed to sell the Vichy, Saint Yorre, Thonon and Pierval brands, as well as an unspecified number of other unnamed sources to a single buyer to create a viable competitor. The brands - which have to be sold before a set deadline - represent some 20 per cent of French mineral water capacity. Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, yesterday hailed the Commission's decision as 'a considerable victory for the consumer' and a landmark in Brussels' rapidly evolving merger control policy. The decision establishes for the first time that the EC merger control authority can take into account the impact of duopolies and oligopolies  - where more than two groups dominate a market - in its investigations. But sceptical competition lawyers pointed out that the decision still leaves more than two-thirds of French mineral water production in the hands of a duopoly - Nestle and BSN, the French foods group which will buy the Volvic brand from the enlarged group. 'This is yet another 'deal' (between the Commission and companies),' said Ms Diana Good, a partner with the law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines in Brussels. 'There's no doubt that the time is ripe for one of these merger regulation cases to be challenged before the European Court. The question is who is going to do it?' Source of change, Page 16</p>

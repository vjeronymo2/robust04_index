			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DAILY NEWS JOURNALISTS REJECT OFFER  </P> <P> Averting a split among the Daily News' newsroom employees, a group of reporters  and photographers decided to remain on strike today rather than take up an  offer to cross picket lines and reclaim their jobs.  </P> <P> "We're willing to give the strike more time," reporter Paul LaRosa said.  </P> <P> "There's no point in going back now."  </P> <P> The News, hit by a walkout last week by nine of its 10 unions, had said  striking workers were welcome to return to their old jobs at any time as long  as permanent replacements had not been hired.  </P> <P> A group of 40 reporters and photographers belonging to the 750-member Newspaper  Guild sent a delegation to discuss the matter Sunday with guild President Barry  Lipton.  </P> <P> Some complained that the strike was called on the basis of a false report that  replacements had already been hired to fill reporting slots.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of anger at the guild leadership," striking reporter JoAnne  Wasserman said.  </P> <P> But after the meeting, the group decided to stay on strike. The guild  represents reporters, photographers and office workers. It could not be  immediately determined how many guild members are honoring the strike.  </P> <P> No new talks are scheduled. The News has said it plans to replace the strikers  permanently.  </P></p>

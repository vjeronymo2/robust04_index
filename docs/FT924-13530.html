			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Truck and van sales drop sharply HOPES raised in August of an end to the decline in sales of UK commercial vehicles have been dented by a further sharp fall last month. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that total commercial vehicle sales were down 14.22 per cent to 15,548 from September last year. Sales in the first three quarters, at 157,646, were 6.85 per cent lower than the 169,233 in the same period last year. However, one possible sign that parts of the market may be showing signs of recovery was provided by registrations of new trucks - vehicles over 3.5 tonnes - and buses and coaches. Truck registrations rose 2.13 per cent to 2,738 from 2,681 in September last year, the third successive monthly rise. That meant sales in the third quarter were 5.4 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year, at 8,308 units. For the first three quarters of the year as a whole, they remained 5.1 per cent lower at 23,371, down from 24,625. The recovery is concentrated in the heavy truck sector - those over 15 tonnes. Sales for the year so far are only 0.9 per cent below last year, while those under 15 tonnes are down 9.1 per cent. The much smaller market for buses and coaches saw an increase of 26.6 per cent in sales last month, to 157 from 124, lifting sales in the first three quarters to 1,644, up 5.65 per cent. Anecdotal evidence is starting to support the evidence of sales indicators that the worst may be over in the heavy trucks sector. For example, Lex Service's truck-leasing subsidiary is reporting a recovery in short-term truck rental business. It believes that is a consequence of cautious hauliers experiencing an increase in demand but not yet wishing to commit themselves to purchases of new trucks. Leyland DAF won back leadership of the truck market last month from Iveco Ford, with 28.7 per cent to Iveco's 24.6 per cent, and is marginally ahead for the year so far. Hopes of an end to the slide in the commercial vehicle market, which began in the third quarter of 1989, were raised in June when sales rose 5.2 per cent after 32 consecutive months of decline. In July, though, sales dropped once more - by nearly 21 per cent. All other categories of vehicles saw their sales fall steeply last month. Sales of light vans, mainly derived from cars, fell 12.31 per cent, to 4,782 from 5,453, while those of medium-sized vans such as the Ford Transit fell by 20.01 per cent, to 6,794 from 8,493. Sales of four-wheel-drive utility vehicles dropped 21.68 per cent, to 1,077. Motor industry analysts said the weakness of van sales reflected a continuing lack of confidence across the economy. Many such vehicles are bought by retailers and other small traders, sectors facing record levels of bankruptcies. Ford is to suspend production of Transit vans at its Southampton plant for a week from Monday.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------       UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-SEPTEMBER 1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              Volume   Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                              (Units) Change (%) Jan-Sep 92  Jan-Sep 91  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                 157,646   -6.85      100.00      100.00 Imports                        56,472   -4.59       35.82       34.97  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                          49,594   -8.00      100.00      100.00 Imports                        11,052  +16.56       22.28       17.59 Ford                           22,224   -6.99       44.81       44.33 Vauxhall (GM)                  15,850   +4.88       31.96       28.03 Rover (British Aerospace)       3,504  -42.73        7.07       11.35 Peugeot (incl.

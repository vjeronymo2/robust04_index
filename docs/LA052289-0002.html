			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOSEMITE PARK  </P> <P> In response to "Developments at Yosemite Park," editorial, May 8:  </P> <P> I would agree that a serious reassessment of park policy be a top priority for  this national treasure. What are we looking for when visiting this scenic  valley? An escape from city congestion and stress? I've seen that same  atmosphere on a crowded summer weekend at Yosemite. Some pure air and majestic  scenery? If you can see through the smog that often hangs in the valley you may  realize that the pollutants which are destroying our local San Bernardino  forest will work just as well in a Sierra forest.  </P> <P> A chance to "get back to nature?" A questionable request from the visitor  booked in at the Ahwahnee Hotel and traveling in air-conditioned, 8-cylinder  style. Why must so many people insist on making the environment play by our  rules? Instead, Yosemite visitors should be educated and encouraged to adapt to  the rules of nature. Let's camp out, dirty our clothes, shiver during a late  April snow flurry, and sweat on a hot August afternoon.  </P> <P> Let's lose our car keys for a day (as a start!) and introduce our sedentary  bodies to other forms of transportation. As the late Edward Abbey said, "A man  on foot, on horseback or on a bicycle will see more, feel more, enjoy more in  one mile than the motorized tourists can in a hundred miles." I think when  discussing future policy regarding Yosemite that focusing on the best interests  of the environment will ultimately serve all of us best in the quality and  longevity of this national park.  </P> <P> JOHN R.

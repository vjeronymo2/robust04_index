			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY ALL-STARS TO VIE IN BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Tim Bednar does not need a chalkboard when dissecting the Ventura County  Basketball Coaches Assn. boys' all-star game.  </P> <P> Bednar, the coach at Moorpark High who will lead the South squad, simply says  that the team with the most talent will win tonight's contest, which features  graduating seniors from Ventura County.  </P> <P> "That's usually the case because you're not going to throw anything like a  press or something that will offset the talent," Bednar said. "You really can't  work on the team concept."  </P> <P> The boys' game will immediately follow the girls' 6:30 p.m. game at Ventura  High.  </P> <P> The teams will have had only five practice days to prepare for the game. The  North leads the series, 8-5, and Bednar places the favorite's mantle squarely  on the shoulders of the North team.  </P> <P> The North will be led by Shon Tarver of Santa Clara, a 6-foot-5 guard who  averaged more than 30 points in leading the Saints to their second consecutive  state Division IV championship. He will be joined by Jeff Oliver, a 5-11 guard  from Buena who averaged nearly 30 points, and Eric Thomas, a 6-6 post player  who will play at New Mexico in the fall.  </P> <P> Russell Myers, Royal's all-time leading scorer who averaged 28 points last  year, will be counted on heavily by the South.  </P> <P> The South girls will be led by Nichole Victoria, The Times' county player of  the year who averaged 22.8 points, and Melissa Gische of Westlake, a Times  first-team all-county selection.  </P> <P> In the North camp will be Hueneme's Edith Young, a point guard who averaged 13  points, eight rebounds and six assists.  </P></p>

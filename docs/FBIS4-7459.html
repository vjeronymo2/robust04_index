			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 30 Mar (TANJUG) -- ISKRA [Serb Krajina news  agency] has been authorized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  to publish the full text of the cease-fire accord between the  republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and the Republic of Croatia,  signed at 0430 on 30 March 1994 in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb.    The following is the full text of the accord:    The signatories accept that all armed hostilities between  the  two sides should cease immediately and that total observance of  the cease-fire along all confrontation lines [linija dodira]  (henceforth the confrontation line), as they were on the day of  29 March 1994, should begin at 0900 on 4 April 1994.    To achieve and maintain a permanent cessation of  hositilities, the sides agreed to accept, and act in accordance  with, the letter and spirit of the following points:    1. All armed hositilities to cease immediately and the  cease-fire along the confrontation line to begin at 0900 on 4  April 1994.    2. From the day of the signing, the tactical deployment of  the forces along the confrontation line and within 10 kms from  the confrontation line to be frozen on both sides. There will  be no movement of units within this zone except for the purpose  of implementing this accord or with the prior authorization of  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. UNPROFOR will be informed of  the passage of units with more than three vehicles through the  zone during the first 14 days from the signing of the accord.    3. By 0900 on 5 April 1994 at the latest, all indirect  weapons [indirektno naoruzanje] to be deployed beyond the range  of the confrontation line (as defined in Point Four) as follows:  mortar launchers and anti-aircraft guns at least 10 kms away and  artillery weapons and tanks at least 20 kms away. In an  exceptional situation, the sides can store some of the indirect  weapons within the 20-km zone, as provided for in Point Four,  Annex B, "The Rules of Disengagement."    4. By 0900 on 8 April 1994 at the latest, all units along  the confrontation line will be disengaged. On the basis of the  disengagement, both sides will pull back to at least 1,000  meters from the confrontation line to their line of separation  (henceforth the line of separation) [linija razdvajanja]. The  lines are as marked on the maps endorsed by the sides and  attached in Annex D. The units are to withdraw to a distance  from where the sides will not be capable of targeting each other  from direct firearms [direktno vatreno oruzje]. The separation  line should be easily indentifiable (preferably to run along a  geographic feature such as a road, a river, a pass, and so  forth). The zone between the separation lines will be under the  exclusive control of UNPROFOR, and except for the personnel  identified in Annex B of the Accord, no military, paramilitary,  militia, or police personnel from either side will be allowed to  remain in the zone. The sides will, however, be obliged to help  UNPROFOR in preventing crime and upholding law and order between  the separation lines, as specified in Point 9 and 10 of Annex B.    5. UNPROFOR and the ECMM [EC Monitoring Mission] will  supervise the cease-fire. UNPROFOR military observers will be  granted full freedom of movement on both sides of the separation  lines to enable them to check that the weapon systems as  specified in the Accord are deployed beyond the minimum distance  from the separation lines. Freedom of movement in the areas as  defined above implies the right to inspect all military and  paramilitary units and facilities, provided four-hour prior  notice is given. In accordance with the Memorandum of  Understanding, the ECMM will be given full freedom of movement  in all areas covered by the Memorandum. UNPROFOR, which is to  operate in accordance with its mandate, will be granted full  freedom of movement in all relevant areas and the right to  inspect all military and paramilitary units and facilities as  described. The freedom of movement in the above areas implies  the unlimited use of helicopters in those areas.    6. Joint commissions will be established at all levels.  Their first task will be the demarcation of the line of  separation on the ground, in keeping with the principles set out  in Point Four. This should be achieved by 13 April 1994. Their  main task is to investigate immediately any cease-fire  violation. The aim of an investigation is to establish  responsibility for such a violation. The commission  investigating a cease-fire violation will be informed -- by the  side which is deemed responsible for the violation -- of all  disciplinary measures or other actions undertaken in connection  with the incident.    These commissions will be established before the cease-fire  comes into effect. The commissions will be chaired by an  UNPROFOR representative who will -- at his or her own  initiative, or at the request of the sides -- schedule meetings  for the participants. Meetings will begin, with all sides  attending, in the shortest possible time after receipt of a  request from the headquarters of the members. Details  concerning the composition, the venues for the holding of  meetings, and documentation are, as agreed, to be found in Annex  B.    7. If any violation of the cease-fire or other provision of  this agreement comes about, neither side will return fire;  instead, they will rely fully on the procedures envisaged in  Point Six above.    8. The participants are agreed on the opening of a specific  number of crossing points along the confrontation line. These  new crossing points, as well as those which already exist, are  listed in Annex A. UNPROFOR will have its own checkpoint on all  these crossings. All the checkpoints or other positions of the  two sides must be located sufficiently far from the UN  checkpoints as to render sniper fire or fire from heavy machine  guns ineffective. At all the checkpoints UNPROFOR will specify  facilities for the holding of meetings of the joint commissions.  All crossing points will be opened at the latest three hours  after the cease-fire comes into effect.    9. The sides will meet and agree on ways to reduce their  forces within a 10-km zone, stretching back from both sides of  the confrontation line, by 0900 on 19 April 1994 at the latest.  This reduction in the forces will be completed within five days  of reaching agreement.</p>

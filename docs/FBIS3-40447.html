Seven A340's (three versions of the 200 and four of the 300)  in service with Air France, 9,125 flying hours with 9,309 stops,  a technical on-time departure performance of 94.9 percent  compared to Air France's objective of 97.5 percent, and 25  flights canceled for technical reasons. Those are some of the  figures taken from the talk delivered to some 500 members of the  AIR &amp; COSMOS Club last 11 December by Roger Doguet, A340  division chief in Air France's Directorate of Air Operations.    With Albert Ducrocq, president of the AIR &amp; COSMOS  Subscribers Club, presiding, the General Conference of the  Cosmos Club of France was held on 11 December 1993, its topic  being the Airbus A340.    The first lecturer was Pierre Baud, Airbus Industrie's  director of flight tests, who summed up the history of the  development of the A340 in its two versions and drew the  conclusion that in terms of technical specifications, the A340  has always performed better than required by contract,  especially from the standpoint of everything having to do with  fuel consumption.    Baud also emphasized the reasons for having fly-by-wire  systems on board the family's most recent models--that is, the  A320's, A340's, A330's, and A321's--pending the arrival of the  A319. There are two reasons: first, their presence results from  recourse, as is proper, to an ultramodern technology that has  now been completely mastered by Airbus Industrie, and second, it  constitutes a fantastic commercial argument in that it helps  reduce by a very considerable amount the time required by a  pilot qualified on one type of aircraft to also qualify on  another type when both are produced by Airbus Industrie. This is  because thanks to the fly-by-wire controls, the flight  characteristics of all aircraft in the same family are so  similar that a pilot who passes from one type of aircraft to  another does not at all feel "like a fish out of water."    For his part, Roger Doguet discussed the A340's strong and  weak points after nearly 10 months of service with Air France.  Among the strong points: everything having to do with  electricity, hydraulics, and instrumentation. Among the weak  points: the fuel gaging system, among other things, since it has  neither the reliability nor the accuracy required. Baud  explained that its poor performance in that respect was due  essentially to an FAA decision that was made when the A340 was  already on the assembly line. That decision had to do with the  installation of additional bulkheads in the fuel tanks. The  problem is being solved.    Other very acute problems: the poor functioning of the  toilets (with all the consequences that the lack of such a  convenience can have during a 13-hour flight) and of the  on-board intercom system (CIDS (Cabin Information Data System)).  It is becoming very urgent to find permanent solutions to  replace the temporary solutions that had to be come up with very  quickly.    The addition of more A340's to Air France's fleet in 1994  will make it possible to use the aircraft on routes to Cayenne,  Quito, Lima, and Caracas and to begin service to the Far East:  to Hong Kong, Osaka, Singapore, Djakarta, and Noumea.    Marc Dubois, who is in charge of the A340's commercial  development, announced that 202,000 passengers had been carried  on A340's by Air France, and he discussed ways of responding in  the future to the wishes expressed by most of the passengers:  those in business class are very demanding from the standpoint  of comfort, while those in economy class want access to a video  system even if they have pay for it. And many passengers want  space on the aircraft for a "sociability" area, a "tranquillity"  zone, or a real smoking room. The three-class formula might also  be called into question.    Gerard Guyot, Airbus Industrie's chief flight engineer for  flight tests, spoke at length about the record-setting  round-trip flight between France and Australia that took place  on an A340 last June during the Le Bourget Air Show, and he  disclosed that originally, the plan had called for attempting a  record-setting flight between Papeete and Paris.</p>

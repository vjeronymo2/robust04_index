			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH-CARE CRISIS  </P> <P> Thanks to Jonathan Freedman for his two-part series, "No Care Mothers -- No  Hope Babies," (Commentary, May 15-16). It was a good start at touching on the  health-care crisis we presently have in this state, as well as country. What he  failed to point out was that even insured babies can be doomed by the system.  </P> <P> My children were planned and born into an insured, loving environment. When my  eldest daughter was 3, she was operated on for a blocked kidney. One can hardly  find the words to describe the range of emotions a parent goes through when  something of that magnitude happens to her child. The only thing that allowed  us some peace of mind was that we had good health coverage, which enabled her  the best care available. Little did we realize that the true crisis was yet to  begin.  </P> <P> Today, four years later, our daughter happily runs and plays, her world filled  with kittens, school and friends. Today, we, her parents, face having her  uninsured. Our insurance company has raised our rates 100% every year, to the  current rate of $9,000 a year. And looming ahead -- $18,000?  </P> <P> We have a stack of rejection letters from other health insurers. They will  insure everyone but our eldest. She cannot qualify for Medi-Cal because they  take into account her parents' salary. Ironically, our taxes help fund this.  Unfortunately she (we) are neither rich enough to continue paying what amounts  to blackmail, nor poor enough to qualify for assistance.  </P> <P> Health rights are survival rights. There are no easy answers. Politicians often  use the phrase "the children are our future." But where is their future without  the right to medical care? We need to be advocates for the basic rights of all  children or we end up with a separatist, discriminatory state. Children caught  in the bind of "pre-existing" conditions face a dark, uncertain future.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN RENSHAW-HARVEY  </P> <P> Leucadia  </P></p>

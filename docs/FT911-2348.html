			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: NCR enlarges board to keep its chief executive NCR, the Ohio-based computer manufacturer engaged in a multi-billion dollar bid battle with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), has moved to enlarge the size of its board, thus allowing its chief executive, Mr Charles Exley, to remain on it. In March, NCR shareholders voted in favour of an AT&amp;T motion which sought to replace Mr Exley, together with three other NCR directors, by four AT&amp;T representatives on the board. As result, Mr Exley and his three fellow directors were due to leave the board tomorrow when four AT&amp;T nominees would take their places. However, the NCR board decided at a meeting on Sunday that it would increase the size of the company's board to 14. It would reappoint Mr Exley to one of the new vacancies, while Mr Gilbert Williamson, NCR's president, would fill the other. Mr Exley would continue as chairman of the board, NCR said. There was no immediate response from AT&amp;T, and it declined to say whether it had been warned of the changes. After further talks at the weekend, both companies said they were making progress towards an agreed deal, although AT&amp;T yesterday described the state of play as 'delicate'. AT&amp;T offered to increase its bid price to Dollars 110 a share earlier this month, but only in an all-paper deal.</p>

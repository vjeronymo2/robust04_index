The final decision on a  possible government reshuffle will depend also on these  demarches that result from the political dialogue but, first, it  will depend on the decision to make or not make a reshuffle and  on establishing the persons to replace the present dignitaries.  As long as I am the prime minister I am not starting from the  idea of a reshuffle for the sake of reshuffle."    Referring to the government's reform program, he said that  "the strategy we have articulated, including the program of  measures and actions for 1994 has an anti-crisis character. It  has nothing new, actually stemming from the government's  strategy. "Sure," he added, "it is a program of the (ruling)  party of Social Democracy of Romania, on which all ministries  worked, especially that most ministers are members of this  party. Besides, the problem of a dialogue was posed and this  seems very fair to me, with the parties that backed the  government in 1993, concerning a string of objectives included  in this program. The outlook differs in some respects.  However, there is a point that unites us and on which we can  agree, I mean especially the social protection."</p>

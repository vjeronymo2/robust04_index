			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPEAU'S '89 LOSS BALLOONS TO $1.7 BILLION  </P> <P> Financially distressed Campeau Corp. lost $1.7 billion last year, a huge  deterioration from 1988's deficit of $34 million, the Canadian company reported  Wednesday.  </P> <P> A large portion of the firm's loss -- $958 million -- resulted from writing  down the goodwill of one of Toronto-based Campeau's U.S. retail divisions,  Federated Department Stores Inc.  </P> <P> Federated and Allied -- whose stores include Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp;  Straus and Jordan Marsh -- have been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in  the United States since January. The companies have a combined debt load of  $7.7 billion, most of which was incurred when financier Robert Campeau took  them over using high-interest junk bonds.  </P> <P> With their heavy interest payments suspended under Chapter 11, pressure on the  Cincinnati-based units has eased and they reported stronger than expected  first-quarter results Tuesday. Pretax losses were lower than last year on flat  year-to-year sales in the quarter ended May 5.  </P> <P> Last year's revenue gain for Campeau mainly was because of a contribution of a  full year's results from Federated and Ralphs Grocery Co., bought in May, 1988.  </P></p>

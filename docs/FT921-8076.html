			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BT concerned over union link with Mercury BT is threatening to withhold corporate information from its main union, the NCU, because the union has started to recruit workers at Mercury, BT's main competitor. BT has said it is concerned to protect confidential company information which is given to union officials as part of normal consultative processes. Mercury does not recognise any union, but the NCU has begun to recruit Mercury clerical workers. The union claims a recent recruitment drive in Birmingham netted 102 members. It has written to Mr Robert Johnston, Mercury's director of personnel, raising issues connected with pay, training and health and safety. As employee rights to corporate information become an increasingly important industrial relations issue - not least through the European Community's social legislation - the issue of confidentiality could worry some large employers. In many industries one union has often represented workers in competing companies. An AEU engineering workers' union official said, for example, that senior officials covering the car industry were often trusted with confidential corporate information. 'They trust us not to pass on the information and we don't,' he said. 'When confidential information does leak out it is more likely to come from managers in the industry who tend to meet socially.' Mr Peter Jeffers, a BT manager, says in a letter to Mr Alan Harley, an NCU national official: 'Over the years there has been a tendency for BT, and previously the Post Office, to provide union reps with information of a nature which we would not willingly provide to an 'external' union (ie one representing people not employed by the company) especially if there was a possibility of access by employees of a competitor. 'In the light of current developments the company will need to review its present practices.' BT is also concerned that NCU officials may be using time off granted by BT to run recruitment drives in Mercury.</p>

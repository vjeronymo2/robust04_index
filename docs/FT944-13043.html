			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hindsight not best basis for pensions compensation Sir, In considering the question of compensation for 'wrong' advice in personal pension purchases, the Securities and Investments Board surely has a duty to those insurance policyholders who largely will foot the bill for compensation ('The high cost of bad advice', October 26). 'Best advice' is given at a particular moment in time and requires a careful assessment of present circumstances and future prospects. It cannot, however, require prescience. If, years later, it appears that the outcome is poorer than if an alternative course had been taken, this in itself is far short of sufficient basis for concluding that the advice was not 'beat advice' at the time given. In the late 1980s: 1) Some company schemes were (and still are) badly run, with high costs and poor investment performance. 2) Most schemes had no guarantees of pension increments. 3) Many schemes had disadvantageous early retirement conditions. 4) Defined benefit schemes were dependent upon increasing employer contributions, which in turn were dependent upon continuing profitability. 5) Unit trusts, unitised pension funds and the underlying equities, despite October 1987, had shown consistent long-term growth patterns. 6) Personal pensions offered control, visibility and direct investment into a booming UK economy. All this made the background to forming a view of 'best advice' different from the one now being used with the benefit of both hindsight and subsequent legislation improving company schemes' benefits and accountability. For compensation to be due, it should be necessary to demonstrate conclusively that the original advice cannot have been 'best advice' in all the circumstances extant at the time it was given. I trust that the investigations will not sanction compensation deemed to be due by simplistic performance comparisons made with the benefit of hindsight.

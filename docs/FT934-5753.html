			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Deadlock in Hong Kong talks China and Britain remained far apart on the vexed issue of democracy in Hong Kong after the first day of the 17th round of talks on arrangements for forthcoming elections, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. Mr Christopher Hum, Britain's negotiator, said there was 'still a wide gap' between the two sides. He would not be drawn on whether the talks were nearing collapse. The latest round will conclude in Beijing today.</p>

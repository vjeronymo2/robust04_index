The first six weeks of our  difficult work are ending, the hopes people have pinned on us  are great, and these hopes have been vindicated. Russia's Fifth  State Duma is swiftly and confidently joining in the country's  political life: motley, not entirely intelligible, with its own  complex and sometimes audacious character.    What do people expect of it, what are its intentions and  commitments? Do they match society's mood and aspirations?  What place will the State Duma occupy in the Russian system of  power and what will be its fate? After all, the fate of its  four prerevolutionary predecessors was not always enviable, and  the same goes for its immediate predecessors -- the Russian  Federation Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies.    Newspapers, the radio, television, analysts, and political  scientists are edgy, voters are perturbed, and deputies  themselves are suffering. Today we must provide direct, frank  answers to these questions. And above all, the Duma has no  intention of merely being an observer of the course of events,  the Duma intends to work.    Point one. The Duma is completing its organizational process  and would already have completed it were it not for certain  difficulties with the "Procrustean bed" of the site of its  residence. It is an impermissible luxury now to lose tempo in  work, to waste the time allotted to the Duma, and, most  importantly of all, to waste the mighty human and intellectual  potential of the deputies elected with hope and great belief by  Russians 12 December last year by failing to call upon it.  Nevertheless, the deputies' factions and groups and the 23  committees have joined in work on the key spheres of creative  lawmaking -- the urgent problems of the economy and domestic and  foreign policy -- with unhurried expert analysis, open  parliamentary hearings, and pithy and turbulent debates.    Point two. The State Duma publicly says today that it does  not see the separation of powers as meaning alienation between  them, still less rivalry, bitterness, and even hostility. It is  firmly convinced that in order to emerge from the crisis our  motherland Russia needs civil peace, accord, tranquillity, and  creation. It is precisely this kind of accord and collaboration  between the president, government, Federation Council, State  Duma, and Constitutional Court that Russians expect today, and  keenly expect. They are waiting for the accord and interaction,  mutual support, and respectful relations announced to the whole  country and the whole world and professed in everyday work.  Without this our presence here, in the country's highest power  structures, becomes simply meaningless.    The first weeks of joint work are encouraging and inspire  confidence, because this work has been supported by the common  will of the president, the chairman of the government, the  Federation Council, the State Duma, and the Constitutional  Court. This has been noticed in Russia and beyond its borders,  noticed with joy and relief, although life is still hard and  complex. And this is precious. This is perhaps the main result  of the small amount of work we have done over this short time.    Point three. The State Duma, spoiling the fun of many  observers who were ready to watch a Russian-style gladiatorial  battle, firmly intends to devote itself to legislative support  for intelligent political, economic, and social reforms. Not  much time is allotted for our lawmaking. Unfortunately, it runs  to barely 20 calendar months. The stock of social patience is  small and is running out. We have made our first stab at  preparing a plan of lawmaking activity. It incorporates  legislative proposals from the president, the government, the  Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Superior Court  of Arbitration, and also legislative initiatives from Federation  components and the deputies of Russia's parliament.    What are our priorities here? First of all there is the  package of new federal constitutional laws based on developing  Russia's new Constitution, without which election of the next,  sixth Duma and the other branches of power, and also their  functioning and collaboration are inconceivable.    The second package is the package of economic laws along  with  strict control of the budget and the elaboration of a program of  priority anticrisis measures in order to emerge from the  all-embracing crisis. Progress along the road of significant,  productive reforms understood by every Russian involving a  change in ownership relations and the formation of a government  for people is impossible without them.    At the same time the two packages of laws create the  framework of a rule-of-law federative state -- the basis for the  activity of the next, sixth Duma -- and affirm the rights and  freedom of the individual as the supreme value of the state and  society on the basis of the unshakability and state integrity of  the Russian Federation. The latter must be stipulated firmly,  confidently, and calmly in order not to create the slightest  illusions in all manner and caliber of Russian separatists, who  have not yet received a proper political and economic caution,  and it is probably now time to do so.    In the same way it is time to adopt proper laws to curb the  aggression of the criminal world while, however, giving even  those who have once stumbled the opportunity, the chance to take  part in the difficult transformations of the country by  declaring an amnesty for persons convicted of economic crimes  and by supporting the president's legislative initiative  regarding an amnesty in connection with the adoption of the new  Russian Federation Constitution. Moreover, in order to ensure  civil peace and accord in society we should declare an amnesty  for all participants in the events of 19-21 August 1991 and 1  May and 21 September-4 October 1993. Without this it is simply  impossible to avoid suspicion and malicious, sometimes sly  waiting for certain changes and a possible settling of scores --  in order to emerge from the all-embracing crisis. We are simply  doomed to accord.    Esteemed Deputies, the crisis being experienced by the  country and society is multifaceted and all-embracing. It will  be difficult to emerge from it. We need genuine consolidation  of society and a kind of Russian social contract-accord with a  coordinating role played by President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.    A large group of young, vigorous economist deputies inside  the Duma, with the support of Russia's economic schools, have  completed in general outline the preparation of a consolidated  program of priority measures to emerge from the grave crisis.  This program is no secret to the members of the government.  The program was presented in detail at parliamentary hearings  and has been covered in the press. It would certainly become  the basis for the future reorganization of the government as a  government of people's trust and national accord, with the  president playing an active coordinating role, based on a real  and significant parliamentary majority possessing the requisite  legitimacy, professionalism, and intellectual potential. The  government's membership certainly does not necessarily have to  be expanded to include deputies. The main thing is for its  members to be professionals dedicated to the cause of reforms  for the good of Russians. This would put a stop to the  variations on the theme of what and whom the government and its  chairman rely on in forming the cabinet. This would impart the  desired stability to the executive branch of power while  restoring the controllability of the country's economy, lowering  the rate of inflation [and] carrying out a number of pressing  unpopular but urgent measures while evenly distributing the  burden of the crisis among regions and social groups.    We have no time to waste on strife or petty arguments. We  are entitled to work thoroughly and smoothly, and we must do so:  the preparation of draft laws in our committees (essentially  miniature parliaments proportionally representing all factions  and groups), the coordination of positions in the Duma Council,  where all factions and groups are also represented, the final  adoption of draw laws at plenary sittings of the State Duma  without cluttering up its time with petty, clever inessentials,  which must be examined within the text of a law or outside it  during the first two stages in preparing a draft law. Then the  remaining 94 plenary sessions of the Duma will be productive and  we will be able to fulfill our mission as a transitional  parliament.    I have one more comment. We are forming the new working  apparatus of the Russian State Duma. It must be stable  [malosmenyayemyy] and adequate. Then the sixth Duma will  inherit it in a good, effective condition. But there is one  essential condition: In the State Duma it is the deputy who  counts. This must be stated without arrogance and conceit. The  Duma's working apparatus must assist the deputy in his effective  work. If those who are seeking to join the apparatus have  anything else in mind, they had better not seek to join it.    Esteemed Colleagues! In order to implement all this, which  we have painfully arrived at and derived over these two and a  half months, it is proposed to vote on and adopt as a package a  State Duma decree on adopting a memorandum of accord on an  amnesty in connection with the adoption of the Russian  Federation Constitution, on an amnesty for certain crimes  committed in the sphere of political and economic activity, and  on deeming null and void the decision by the Russian Federation  State Duma of 18 February on setting up a commission to  investigate the causes and conditions of the events of 21  September-4 October 1994. Thank you, and I ask representatives  of the factions to speak on this topic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japanese International Trade  and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata will skip a Paris ministerial  conference of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD), the trade ministry said Thursday.    A tight parliamentary schedule has made Hata's attendance at  the two-day gathering from next Tuesday impossible, the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry (MITI) explained.  Parliamentary Vice MITI Minister Tokunosuke Kaneko and Yoshihiro  Sakamoto, director general of MITI's International Trade Policy  Bureau, will fly to Paris instead, MITI said.    This year's OECD meeting will address three major topics --  growth and employment, reinforcing multilateral trade systems  and the OECD's role amid rapid international change, a MITI  official said.    Whether the chiefs of the Foreign Ministry and the Economic  Planning Agency will attend the conference has yet to be  decided, the official said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Daniel Vernet: "Paris-Moscow Tango"] </F>   [Text] By suggesting to the United States and Russia that  they should share with the European Union [EU] the chairmanship  of the international conference on Yugoslavia and by presenting  a resolution to this end in the Security Council, the French  Government is remaining faithful to statements which have been  made with increasing insistence by [Foreign Minister] Alain  Juppe for several weeks. This is accepting a reality; it is  also an indirect way of reaffirming Europe's role in an issue in  which it seemed increasingly marginalized by the American  initiatives in favor of a Croatian-Muslim federation and by the  diplomatic activities of the Russian deputy foreign minister.  Finally, it is the expression of a deep conviction, namely that  there can be no lasting political solution to the war in the  former Yugoslavia without the involvement of Washington and  Moscow alongside the Europeans.    With regard to the United States, this stance is not new;  with regard to Russia, it may seem paradoxical to the extent  that it is accompanied by a "change," not to say a "hardening,"  of French statements with regard to Boris Yeltsin's government  and especially its behavior in what [Foreign Minister] Andrey  Kozyrev likes to call "the near abroad." Is it possible both to  remind the Russians of the need to respect international rules  when they intervene in the former Soviet republics, in the  Caucasus or Tajikistan, and hail as "very positive" the role  played by the Kremlin in the former Yugoslavia, including the  unexpected arrival of Russian soldiers in Bosnia?    It probably is in the short term. Even if they arrived  without warning, the Russians came to Sarajevo to support the  implementation of UN decisions and supported the NATO ultimatum  to the Serbian forces, willingly or unwillingly. In Krajina,  Deputy Minister Churkin helped bring about a cease-fire between  the Croatians and Serbs. He also seemed to be in the best  position to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to seek an arrangement  with the Croatian-Muslim federation, despite his apparent  failure in Gorazde, or perhaps because of that failure, to the  extent that Radovan Karadzic can come to the negotiating table  with new trump cards.    It is therefore understandable that the French foreign  minister should welcome Moscow's action. In the medium and long  terms, however, the situation is less clear. Nothing proves  that the Russians have the same concept of the Balkans' future  as the Western countries. It would probably even be tempted to  think the opposite, if there was any certainty that a clear  concept existed Europe and the United States. Whatever the  facts, Russia has returned to the shores of the Adriatic for the  first time in decades; to think that its Yugoslav policy is part  of a broader concern about regaining a position as a superpower  is not to insult it. Their well-cut suits and their impeccable  English does not alter the fact that the current leaders of  Russian diplomacy were trained in the Soviet school, brutal but  effective.    Hence the safeguards which Alain Juppe publicly defined in  his recent statements with regard to Russia and those which are  being whispered in diplomatic circles. The foreign minister  pointed out "a resurgence in nationalist spirit" and an  "undoubted hardening of foreign policy" following the December  elections. During its interventions in the former USSR, the  Russian Army must respect the international rules, and those of  the United Nations and the CSCE; it should not receive  restrospective clearance for actions decided without  consultation, nor should it obtain financial support, as Moscow  is demanding. Russia is no doubt legitimately interested in  maintaing the stability of its borders, and the Western  countries, which do not want to send troops to the Caucasus or  to Central Asia, would show bad grace in systematically  criticizing the presence of Russian soldiers. Nevertheless,  Russia should still respect the international community's  procedures.    The Baltic states are a special case; Alain Juppe reaffirmed  that their territorial integrity should be respected and that  the Russian Army should pull out of Latvia and Estonia according  to the timetable set by the agreements, without "conditioning"  the withdrawal of troops to the status of Russian-speakers  living in these countries. France quietly regrets the fact that  its EU partners are not making themselves clear enough on this  point; when Moscow showed the intention of maintaining military  bases in Latvia (before attributing this announcement by Boris  Yeltsin to a "technical error"), Paris suggested that the Twelve  should protest, but this was not followed.    The Europeans, like the Americans, do not really know how  to react to Russia; they are still afraid of encouraging the  nationalist tendencies of people like Zhirinovskiy with an  excessively hard stance, while knowing that the Kremlin is  taking advantage of this to move its pawns forward. By rash  statements (relations with the Baltic countries are an "internal  matter," the Russian defense minister said, for instance) and  decisions which are annulled if resistance is stronger than  expected, Russia is destabilizing its neighbors, testing the  Western countries, and creating faits accomplis.    Each advance does not deserve a response in itself, but  their  accumulation changes certain situations; this is the technique  of erosion, which is reminiscent of the "salami tactics" -- one  slice after another -- used after World War II. In Paris'  opinion, this new attitude by Russian diplomacy, which Minister  Kozyrev described in a fictional political scenario back in  December 1992, should lead Western countries to be more  vigilant. This does not rule out cooperation with Moscow, quite  the reverse, nor the continuation of aid given to the political  reforms and the transition to the market economy.    The policy toward Eastern Europe should be twofold:  association with the EU and the WEU [Western European Union],  its defense organization, for the states of Central Europe and  the Baltic Republics which want to become full members of the  EU; cooperation with Russia, within the scope of the Partnership  for Peace proposed by NATO and the economic partnership  agreement currently being negotiated in Brussels. This is on  the understanding that Moscow cannot be given a right of veto on  the entry of Central European states into the EU or WEU or a  special status in all-European organizations (Partnership for  Peace, CSCE, or Council of Europe), which would amount to  creating a kind of condominium by the Western countries and  Russia over the former countries of the Warsaw Pact.    Russia wants to be present everywhere but is invoking its  superpower status to bypass common rules; it is acting in the  same way with regard to Balladur's stability pact, which was  accepted by the Twelve: It wants to participate in the Paris  conference at the end of May, but it would like special  treatment so as not to be put on the same level as the small  European states with vulgar quarrels among neighbors. "The  problems of security and stability in Europe will not be solved  without Russia's participation," Alain Juppe rightly maintains.  But great progress is still needed to define clear rules of  common life, and especially to ensure that they are respected.</p>

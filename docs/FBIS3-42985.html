The  consequences of this unprecedented disaster have directly or  indirectly impacted on the destinies of entire nations and  regions, millions of people, and natural systems, and will be  felt for many decades to come in future generations. Therefore  from the very inception and up until the present our scientists  and specialists and their foreign colleagues have never ceased  for a single day their work on analysis of the causes and  consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the search for ways  to overcome them.    In the former USSR, this activity has been carried out by a  number of governmental and non-governmental organizations, among  which an important part has been played by the Commission of the  Supreme Soviet of the USSR on Examining the Causes of the  Accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant and  Evaluating the Actions of Officials in the Post-Accident Period.  Working within this Commission has been a Standing Panel of  Experts (SPE) including about 200 eminent specialists  representing many fields of science and engineering in all three  of the republics hardest hit by the disaster: Belarus, Ukraine  and Russia. This group of scientists has done tremendous work on  gathering, analyzing and generalizing a large body of materials,  most of which were scattered throughout agencies and over  territories, making access difficult. A lot of new information  was also obtained directly at the locality of the events,  including at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant itself.    Although the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was dissolved in  late  1991, the activity of the SPE nevertheless did not stop.  SENMURV, a non- governmental international society for restoring  the environment and safe habitation of man, has considered  offering support to the panel of experts as its civil and moral  obligation. Such cooperation proceeds from the logic of creation  and activity of SENMURV, as reflected in its charter and name.  How to reduce the detrimental impact of irrational human  actions, how to protect Man, his health, the health of nations,  how to restore our environment--these are the main problems that  united scientists and businessmen of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine  in the SENMURV International Society.    Over the last two decades, especially in the eighties, the  scales and depth of consequences of economic and other activity  on the territory of Russia and other CIS nations for nature and  society have reached the limit beyond which an ecological  problem has grown into a problem of national security, survival  of a nation in the long-term historical perspective.    The global nature of ill-considered human activity in  mining,  carrying out large-scale power engineering projects, development  of industry, transportation and the agroindustrial complex has  resulted in an unpredictable ecological situation. Anthropogenic  alterations of landscapes, demographic shifts, concentration of  ecologically harmful production facilities on limited areas, and  disregard for requirements of creating low-waste production  facilities have given rise to totally new ecological factors  that could lead to irreversible genetic changes in populations  and communities.    Besides the continual poisoning of nature and people with  wastes of harmful substances of existing enterprises, the  presence of a large number of burial sites of radioactive and  chemical wastes, threatening gradual exhaustion of the  ecological potential and gene pool of Russia, there has been an  increase in the risk of technogenic disasters. Damage due to  industrial accidents alone averages 1.2-1.5 percent of the GNP,  and in the most severe accidents like the one at Chernobyl, it  exceeds the given figures by nearly an order of magnitude. Last  but not least, as a result of such extraordinary situations, and  also because ecological requirements are not met in handling  radioactive (and other toxic) wastes and the acquisition of  uranium deposits, Russia and other CIS nations are now faced  with just about the worst radioecological scenario in the world.    Based on the urgency of its tasks, as well as on the  professional orientation of its specialists, the SENMURV  International Society is concentrating its activity on restoring  the environment and safe habitation of man, combining  international efforts of businessmen and scientists representing  various fields of knowledge: biotechnology, physical chemistry,  biology, biophysics, medicine, mathematics and systems analysis.  Such an interdisciplinary approach is a guarantee of rapid  advancement in problems of ecology, revealing new ways of  solving them, and especially the Chernobyl problem.    Within the framework of the SENMURV International Society,  the aforementioned panel of experts has been transformed to a  Joint Expert Committee (JEC), which can be treated as its  successor. This committee has continued work on preparation of  its chief document: the expert conclusion that is being  presented in this publication. The expert conclusion consists of  four volumes:    Part 1. ``Direct Causes of Accident at Chernobyl Nuclear  Electric Plant. Radiation Monitoring. Protective Measures and  Their Effectiveness.''    Part 2. ``Medical-Biological and Genetic Consequences of the  Chernobyl Disaster.''    Part 3. ``Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear  Electric Power Plant for the Republic of Belarus.''    Part 4. ``Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear  Electric Power Plant for Ukraine and Russia.''    The following expert coordinators guided the team of authors  in preparation of this expert conclusion:    V. B. Nesterenko--professor, associate member of Belarus  Academy of Sciences.    Ye. B. Burlakova--professor, Chairwoman of Council on  Radiobiology of Russian Academy of Sciences.    Ye. A. Yakovlev--Academician of Ukrainian Ecological Academy  of Sciences.    V. A. Shevchenko--professor.    N. A. Tsepalova--candidate of chemical sciences.    D. S. Firsova--journalist, laureate of Lenin and State  prizes  of the USSR.    A. G. Nazarov--professor, associate member of Russian  Academy  of Natural Sciences.    B. N. Profiryev--professor, associate member of Russian  Academy of Natural Sciences.    D. P. Osanov--professor.    G. S. Sakulin--professor.    L. N. Shadrin--professor.    While not all parts of this expert conclusion are of equal  significance, all experts have endeavored to be maximally  objective in analyzing events and documents, as well as in  offering differing viewpoints. This has been aided by giving  each expert creative freedom, the opportunity of setting up  creative teams and formulating conclusions without hindrance.    Considerable assistance was provided to the panel of experts  on the first stage of its work by the ``Chernobyl-Pomoshch''  Non-Governmental International Humanitarian Organization.    If this expert conclusion will attract the attention not  just  of specialists, economists and politicians, but simply the  people living on contaminated territories and the public at  large, we will feel that our labor has made its contribution to  analysis of the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl  disaster.    We hope that the number of supporters of those who have  devoted their activity and are giving their efforts and energy  to restoring our environment will increase, and then the  concepts of ``Man. Earth. Universe'' will become indivisible and  everlasting. That man might live forever and dwell on a  blossoming, beautiful earth, unique and inimitable in the  universe.

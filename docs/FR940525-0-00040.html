Waiver Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters requested guidance concerning the process for seeking a delay in or waiver from the electronic submission requirement. The commenters also wanted to know under what circumstances HCFA would grant a delay or waiver. Commenters suggested that HCFA define the term ``financial hardship'' as used in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Provider Reimbursement Manual, part II, section 130, provides the guidelines for requesting a waiver. Basically, the provider must make a written request to the intermediary at least 120 days before the close of the provider's cost reporting period. The intermediary reviews the request and forwards it, with a recommendation for approval or denial, to HCFA's central office within 30 days of receipt of the request. The central office informs the intermediary whether the waiver is approved or denied within 60 days of receipt of the request in the central office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the varying financial circumstances of hospitals and other health care providers that participate in the Medicare program, we believe that it would be inappropriate to establish a definition of ``financial hardship'' or a set of specific criteria that a provider would need to meet to qualify for a waiver of the electronic cost reporting requirement. We believe that the best method for determining whether a provider qualifies for a waiver is to consider requests on a case by case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To date, we have received only eight requests for waiver. We believe that the small number of requests indicates that the majority of providers will not experience financial hardship as a result of electronic cost reporting. In addition, in an effort to minimize the number of providers that need a waiver, we developed a software package that will enable the hospital to file an electronic data set to its fiscal intermediary in order to generate an electronic cost report. We are providing the software package to hospitals free of charge. Therefore, we believe that with the availability of the free software, it will be difficult for a provider to demonstrate financial hardship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter recommended that HCFA provide an automatic waiver of electronic cost report filing in each instance in which a waiver of standard or full cost reporting has been granted, including those cases where full cost reporting has been waived because of a low percentage of Medicare inpatients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HCFA will grant an automatic waiver of electronic cost reporting if a provider is exempt from full or standard cost reporting. To qualify for an automatic waiver of electronic cost reporting, the provider must apply and qualify for an exemption from full or standard cost reporting in accordance with the rules that provide for the exemption. For example, a provider that does not furnish any covered services to Medicare beneficiaries is exempt from filing a full cost report and instead must submit an abbreviated report under &sect;413.24(g). Additionally, a provider with low program utilization may obtain a waiver from filing a full cost report in accordance with &sect;413.24(h). When the intermediary notifies a provider that it qualifies for an exemption from filing a full cost report, the provider also will be notified of the exemption from electronic filing. Providers must apply for a waiver of full cost reporting for each new cost reporting period. Providers that are not exempt from full cost reporting must file for a waiver according to the procedure set forth in section 130 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual, part II, as discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan will work together  with a European bank to strengthen ties with East European  countries, the International Economic Cooperation Development  Fund under the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced Wednesday  [20 April].    A spokesman for the fund said that a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) between Taiwan and the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was signed in St.  Petersburg, Russia Tuesday [19 April] during the bank's third  annual meeting.    Taiwan Representative in Belgium Lu Chao-chung and Bank  President Jacques de Larosiere inked the MOU, under which the  fund pledges to earmark U.S.$20 million to help finance economic  reform projects in East European countries, he noted.    Both sides agreed to the cooperative ties in February when  Governor Samuel Shieh of the Central Bank of China met with de  Laros in Paris, he added.    The first loan project will go to an airport navigation  system in Riga, Latvia, he pointed out.    The spokesman pledged that the fund will provide more  financial assistance to East European countries in line with the  government's strategy to promote cooperation with that part of  the world.    Established in 1988, the fund plays a key role in supplying  financial and technical assistance to developing countries  friendly to Taiwan.</p>

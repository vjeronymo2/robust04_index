			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (6): Intact after the earthquake - The aftermath of the upheaval in the government bonds market Most revolutions pass Belgium by. Yet even the most conservative practitioners in the Kingdom's financial markets have understood the wisdom of Edmund Burke's dictum that it is necessary to reform in order to preserve. The changes underway in Belgium cannot claim to match the Anglo-Saxon 'Big Bang' which shook New York in the 1970s or the City of London in the 1980s. Yet they are significant in Belgian terms. Over the past five years, the country has witnessed a restructuring of the government bond market; the introduction of an active market in short-term Treasury bills; and the creation of a Belgian Futures and Options Exchange (Belfox) - all of which have increased the liquidity of the domestic bond market dramatically. 'It shows you can have an earthquake without the demolition,' says Mr Peter Praet, chief economist of Generale de Banque. Little Bang began in 1989 when Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, decided to restructure the government bond market in a fashion similar to changes already underway in neighbouring France. The reforms meant scrapping the traditional means of financing public debt through a favoured consortium of banks, along with interest rates set by the National Bank of Belgium. The old system was cosy, profitable and uncompetitive. A secondary market barely existed; and the intricate tax processing of 'classic' government bonds kept foreign investors away. And the banks themselves were lagging behind their European counterparts in innovation. Mr Maystadt, who has since become one of the most respected finance ministers in the European Union, calculated that he could get a better price for government debt by opening up the market. He was right: the new, highly liquid 20-year, 10-year, and short-term linear bonds (OLOs) have saved the Belgian government billions of francs, according to Mr Praet. With an outstanding net debt of BFr9,000bn, Belgium's public debt ratio to GDP is hovering around 125 per cent - higher than Italy's. Last year alone, the debt increased by BFr784bn, double the actual budget deficit. This makes the government bond market one of the most important in Europe. But it also explains why Mr Maystadt, a fervent advocate of European monetary union, is looking to save every sou so as to meet the demanding Maastricht criteria required to join EMU. In 1993, the state raised BFr1.530bn, while finding investors for converting BFr601bn in long-term OLOs. Mr Jean-Paul Parmentier, head of fixed income bonds at Kredietbank in Brussels, argues that the more flexible management of debt helped tide the government over a sticky summer when the franc came under speculative attack. Ms Jane Edwards, economist with Lehman Brothers in London, agrees. In her opinion, the National Bank's success in narrowing to within a hair's breadth the spread in short-term interest rates with Germany, while maintaining the currency link with the Deutsche Mark, has been 'remarkable'. Similarly, the spread in 10-year bonds has narrowed from around 100 basis points at the start of the year to between 80 and 85 basis points, while other countries such as France have watched spreads widen. Some bond market observers believe that the Dehaene government would like to exploit this new-found flexibility, perhaps by mining the short-end of the market, where interest rates are lower. The reason is that, with only two budgets remaining until the European Commission's 1996 review of EU member states' economic (and debt) performance, the government wants to produce the best debt figures possible ahead of a political judgment on EMU. Such a move could, however, strain the official policy of consolidating the debt into long-term, stable debt. It also assumes that the recent rise in long-term interest rates in Europe is temporary only. (Any further upward trend would, of course, cost the government money). Mr Maystadt insists that judgments on refinancing debt are taken according to commercial logic, and there is no special effort to move into two- or three-year covenants. In the minister's view, the second phase in Belgium's reform programme should be to promote the diversification of products and stimulate greater competition among operators. There is plenty of scope. A recent Generale de Banque study argued that Belgian investors interested in bonds still have a restricted choice in their home country, and could be wooed more effectively. The study estimated that Belgians bought an estimated BFr350bn to BFr400bn in foreign bonds, around one third of which was in Luxembourg francs (an indication of how much of Belgian savings is sloshing around in neighbouring Luxembourg, where there is no withholding tax). Small investors have been attracted by treasury certificates, but Generale de Banque still estimates that financial and credit institutions are the largest investor group with an 83 per cent share. What else is to be done? Belfox could certainly borrow some of the liquidity which the OLOs enjoy. Its average daily volume is increasing; but a range of between 2,000 to 3,000 contracts a day shows that it is much less liquid than in Germany. Second, the private bond market could be nourished. The market is small, and Belgian companies still seem wary of issuing securitised debt in Belgium, mainly on cost grounds. Third, there is more scope for innovation in the market for longer term index contracts, for example for one to two years. But Mr Maystadt argues, correctly, that Little Bang has forced the banks to come up with new derivative products. Recent changes in the law should open the door to the kind of 'securitisation' of bank loans and mortgages which is routine in the US. In short, those in Belgium who thought that Little Bang would be a zero sum game - with either the government or the banks losing out to competition - have been proved wrong. Belgium's quiet financial revolution, as far as it goes, has paid off for both sides.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Beni Begin] </F>   [Text] During yesterday's cabinet session, the prime  minister described the results of his talks with 'Arafat in  Cairo as a "grave crisis," and spoke mainly about the questions  of control of the border checkpoints and the size of the  "Jericho region," which will be turned over to the PLO. These  are important topics, but the real problem Israel is facing is  much deeper than this.    Three months have passed since Yitzhak Rabin and Yassir  'Arafat shook hands on the White House lawn. Many grasped then  at the straw of confused hope that the Middle East would be able  to adopt the type of relations that exist between France,  Belgium, and Luxembourg, but they, too, knew the history of the  leader of the PLO murder organization, so that in their hearts  they gave the PLO a trial period, as we would with a dangerous  convict freed on parole.    In the three months that have passed, all the warnings have  been proven true, and not one of the hopes has come to pass. In  a great engineering innovation, Shimon Peres suggested that we  stop a rising flood by blasting streams of water, while Yitzhak  Rabin suggested an innovation in physics: fighting fire with  fire. The innovation of the Israeli left, of curbing terror  against Jews by using an anti-Jewish terror group, has been  repudiated by reality. There is not a single sign, as of now,  that supports any possibility that this theory can be put into  action, and, indeed, signs are multiplying that say precisely  the opposite.    Unlike the accepted theories, the basic problem is neither  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] nor the little PLO  rejectionist groups, but the main rejectionist group--that is,  Fatah and its never changing leader. In 1974, the Palestinian  National Council [PNC] decided upon its famous policy of moving  in stages. Old hat, right? Why be so small and narrow-minded as  to bring it up today, three months after the handshake in  Washington? The answer can be found in Arafat's speech that was  broadcast on Jordanian television at the same time as the  ceremony at the White House. While the Biblical verses poured  from the mouths of the prime minister of Israel and his  second-in-command, the chief of the PLO band said the following  words in Arabic: "Oh my beloved, do not forget that the PNC made  this decision in 1974. It called for establishment of a national  entity on some portion of Palestinian land that would be freed,  or which Israel would withdraw from. This is the fruit of your  struggle, your sacrifices, your jihad...this is the moment of  return, the moment of setting foot on the first Palestinian  territory to be freed...this is an important, definitive, and  basic step.... May Palestine live, free and Arabic."    Slowly, as is his fashion, Yitzhak Rabin is apparently also  beginning to understand that there will be no security for  Israel if the "freed" territory is handed over to the PLO and  Hamas. Last week, the prime minister said in the Knesset that  after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has withdrawn from the  Gaza and Jericho regions, Israel learns that terrorist squads  are preparing themselves to attack Israelis, Israel will stand  on its right of hot pursuit, "and hot pursuit, for us, means not  only during an incident, but also to prevent an incident."    This new condition of Israel's completely contradicts the  Oslo accord, which stipulates that in the hands of the PLO will  be both authority over the territory Israel has withdrawn from,  and responsibility for the war against terror ("internal  security"); while the IDF will have freedom of movement on the  highways alone. If Mr. Rabin follows through with his  announcement, there will be no agreement: either it will not be  signed, or it will explode after the first foiling hot pursuit.  In any case, it is clear today that Mr. Rabin already  understands that carrying out the agreement as it is written  would completely abandon the security of Israel and her citizens.    This is the time to stop, think, and look at the Oslo  agreement dispassionately and without illusions. To those who  approve of the agreement, the PLO is being given a trial period.  The gang and its leaders have failed this trial. Calling off the  process now will avert serious perils in the future.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: New computer trade association A GROUP of small UK personal computer companies yesterday launched a new trade association with the object of improving the reputation of suppliers who sell 'direct' - through newspaper and magazine advertisements, writes Alan Cane. Mr Keith Warburton, a personal computer consultant and founder of the Personal Computer Direct Marketers' Association said it had been formed after the failure of a number of direct marketing companies in recent months. The PCDMA will not reimburse customers for money lost if a company fails but it insists that its members meet minimum standards including a two year track record. The larger personal computer companies have shown little interest in joining the association.</p>

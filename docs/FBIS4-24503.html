The trade deficit of US$40 million resulted from increasing  imports from and decreasing exports to the EU, customs officials  said. Taiwan registered a US$543 million trade surplus with the  EU in the first four months of 1993.    During the January-April period, Taiwan imported US$3.596  billion worth of products from the EU, a growth of 8.7 percent  from the first four months of last year. Taiwan's exports to  the area totaled only US$3.556 billion, a 7.7 percent decline,  the statistics showed.    The US$7.153 billion in two-way trade between the two was a  0.1 percent decline.</p>

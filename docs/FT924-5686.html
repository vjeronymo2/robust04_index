			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report NICKEL prices resumed their upward trend at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, though never challenging the highs reached on Monday. The three months position, which touched Dollars 5,650 a tonne before selling set in on Monday, closed yesterday at Dollars 5,557.50 a tonne up Dollars 30 on the day. ZINC prices, having absorbed early stop-loss selling, found good mixed buying interest. Three months zinc hit Dollars 1,051 a tonne at one point before recovering to close at Dollars 1,064.75 a tonne, up Dollars 2.50 on the day. It moved further ahead in kerb (after hours) trading to Dollars 1,068 a tonne. Three months ALUMINIUM continued Monday's rally to reach Dollars 1,213 a tonne at one stage, but by the end of the kerb session hedging sales and profit-taking had pulled it back to Dollars 1,200 a tonne, down Dollars 6. LEAD prices softened initially in response to a 4,350-tonne LME stocks rise, believed to represent arrivals of CIS metal. But once the three months price had dipped to Pounds 312 a tonne, trade buying and short-covering saw last business at Pounds 315. Compiled from Reuters</p>

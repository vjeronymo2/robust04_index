			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: John Lewis down 15% as recession continues SALES AT the John Lewis Partnership's department store chain have been 'encouraging' since the beginning of August adding to the accumulating evidence that retail sales have strengthened over the past few weeks. However, the employee-owned retail group, which runs 22 department stores and 99 Waitrose supermarkets, yesterday reported a 15 per cent fall to Pounds 20.2m in interim pre-tax profits, reflecting the effects of recession and Sunday trading by rivals and increased interest costs. Announcing his last set of results before retiring as chairman, Mr Peter Lewis took the opportunity to condemn the government's continued failure to intervene to prevent unlawful Sunday trading. 'It must be the first sales tax ever exacted for keeping the law and handed over for the benefit of the delinquents,' he said. In the half year to July 25, JLP's sales were 2 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.09bn. However, department store sales declined a shade to Pounds 501.2m - 'a result the like of which I do not think I can recall,' said Mr Lewis. Waitrose came under pressure from competitor openings but pushed sales up 4 per cent to Pounds 573.9m. The company said there had been some sharp falls in some food prices which had lowered cash takings. The wholesaling and manufacturing businesses recorded a more encouraging performance with a 13 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 19.7m. Trading profits fell 5 per cent to Pounds 38m, but were further eroded by a higher interest charge of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 10.8m). Costs were reasonably controlled but continued to rise faster than sales. Mr Lewis said he did not think it was likely that there would be a general economic boost before the end of the year, but thought there was room for profits improvement through the individual efforts of JLP's employees.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON MUST TRIM PLANS, DARMAN SAYS  </P> <P> Incoming President Bush's designated budget director bluntly warned the  Pentagon on Thursday that it will have to slash its spending plans to meet  Bush's budget goals.  </P> <P> In his first public comments since being nominated by Bush, Richard G. Darman  told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee at his confirmation hearings  that he believes that Congress and the White House are not prepared to give the  Defense Department any money beyond what is needed to keep up with inflation.  </P> <P> As a result, he predicted, there will "be a defense squeeze."  </P> <P> Darman's comments are likely to set off alarm bells throughout the vast defense  contracting industry, much of which is concentrated in California. Although  Darman did not name any particular weapons programs that might be cut back,  budget analysts have suggested that such programs as the B-2 stealth bomber  built by Northrop Corp. in Southern California, additional aircraft carriers  and two advanced fighters planned by the Navy and the Air Force might be  targets for postponement or elimination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Higher Spending Planned  </P> <P> The Pentagon, which receives about $300 billion a year, plans to spend over the  next five years about $95 billion more than the amount that would be required  just to keep up with inflation. Moreover, most analysts believe that the  Pentagon could not maintain its current force structure even if it receives the  annual 2% real budget increases it projects.  </P> <P> Yet, "as a matter of realism," Darman said, those increases "won't be ever  funded."  </P> <P> Darman also said he is opposed to any relaxation of the Gramm-Rudman deficit  targets, which require Congress and the White House to reach agreement by  October on a budget blueprint that would cut next year's federal deficit to  $110 billion. If they fail to agree, the law would impose automatic spending  cuts -- split between defense and domestic programs -- that would reduce the  projected deficit to $100 billion.  </P> <P> Although saying he vastly prefers to reach a negotiated settlement with  Congress that would avoid the automatic cuts, Darman said the Pentagon should  not rule out the possibility of failure and "should be prepared to take the  (automatic cuts)."  </P> <P> During an intense 4 1/2 hours of questioning by senators, Darman also sought to  "close the door" to any impression that Bush would accept higher taxes.  Although he acknowledged that he probably would adopt a number of  revenue-increasing measures included in President Reagan's last budget, Darman  told reporters during a break that "there will not be any new taxes in Bush's  budget, as defined by any reasonable observer."  </P> <P> In what may well be an early negotiating ploy designed to force Congress to go  along with Bush's no-tax vow, Darman said that, if faced with the choice  between automatic cuts and a tax increase, he would favor the spending cuts.  </P> <P> Darman said Bush expects to submit a relatively detailed budget proposal by  mid-February that would outline his own priorities and show where he differs  from Reagan.  </P> <P> But Darman said Bush probably will rely on Reagan's economic assumptions, which  many lawmakers have criticized as unrealistically optimistic.  </P> <P> Darman also suggested that the Bush Administration's plans to resolve the  savings and loan industry crisis are likely to require about $45 billion to $50  billion in public spending to close insolvent thrifts. He downplayed some  estimates that the additional cost to taxpayers of a thrift bailout would  exceed $100 billion by arguing that many of the worst thrifts already have been  merged or sold to investors by regulators.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIONS QUARTERBACKS WARE, PEETE SCRAMBLE  </P> <P> Andre Ware is making the big bucks, but Rodney Peete appears to have the edge  in the Detroit Lions quarterback battle and hopes that he'll be rewarded if he  becomes the starter.  </P> <P> Peete, a second-year pro out of Southern California, where he was runner-up in  the Heisman Trophy balloting in 1988, was the Lions' sixth draft pick in 1989.  He signed a two-year contract worth $250,000, then became the Lions' starting  quarterback.  </P> <P> Ware, who won the Heisman Trophy last season at the University of Houston, was  the Lions' No. 1 draft pick in 1990 and received a $2-million signing bonus to  go along with a four-year contract worth $4.6 million.  </P> <P> Now, this is where the fun starts.  </P> <P> Ware wants Peete's starting job and Peete wants some of Ware's money.  </P> <P> According to the NFL Players Assn., the average salary for a quarterback last  season was $638,000. Peete might even settle for that, for now.  </P> <P> "When I start the season," Peete said, "it would be a nice gesture on their  part to come to me and say, 'Rodney, we realize you're underpaid and making  much, much, much less than what the average starting quarterback in the league  is making. So, we want to get something done.' "  </P> <P> Peete realizes that when the contract was signed last year, the money he  received was in accordance with his status as a sixth-round pick.  </P> <P> But now he has led the Lions to a 3-0 preseason record. He wants to be  rewarded, although he promised he won't walk out, no matter what.  </P> <P> "I understand that being a sixth-round pick, you're only going to get so much  money," he said. "That's the way the system works and I'm just a victim of the  system. But when it's my turn to be on the other end, hopefully it will work  out for me."  </P> <P> Meanwhile Ware, who ended his holdout Monday night, drew a large crowd for his  first practice session.  </P> <P> "I think he's way behind," Lions Coach Wayne Fontes said. "He thinks this is  the same offense he ran in college, but it's only similar. It's not the same. I  would think right now he's got an uphill battle. It's unfortunate, but he'll  have to sit a while."  </P> <P> Fontes said Ware will have to show he is better than Peete if he wants the  starting job.  </P> <P> "The best player will play for the Detroit Lions, regardless of position and  regardless of where they were drafted," Fontes said. "You can put that in big  print."  </P> <P> Fontes said Ware will see some action Friday night when the Lions play their  fourth and final exhibition game at Cincinnati.  </P></p>

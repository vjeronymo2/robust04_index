The preferred alternative is the ``No Action'' alternative. Under this alternative, Naval spent fuel removed from nuclear powered ships would be retained in specially designed shipping containers at five shipyards: Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine; Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia; Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia; Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington; and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Naval spent fuel also would remain in the Surface Support Barge at Newport News Shipbuilding. The Department of Energy (DOE), with the Navy as a cooperating agency, is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement on longer-term storage of all DOE spent fuel, including Naval spent fuel. The time period evaluated in the short-term storage Environmental Assessment is the period through implementation of the Record of Decision for the DOE Environmental Impact Statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Environmental Assessment discusses alternatives to the preferred alternative and evaluates the environmental impacts of both the preferred and other alternatives. The Environmental Assessment concludes that the environmental impact of any of the alternatives would be very small. Therefore, there is no basis for determining that any of these alternatives would be environmentally preferable to others. The No Action alternative, which is the preferred alternative, would allow all shipyard work, including refueling and defueling of nuclear powered ships, to continue unimpeded by the short-term accumulation of Naval spent fuel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program provided a draft of this Environmental Assessment to officials of Virginia, Maine, New Hampshire, Washington, and Hawaii for review and comment. Letters were received from Congressman Norm Dicks of Washington and Mr. T.R. Strong of the State of Washington Department of Health, both of whom agreed that the No Action alternative is appropriate, and Mr. Brian Choy of the State of Hawaii Office of Environmental Quality Control, who had no comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the analysis in the Environmental Assessment, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program concluded that the preferred alternative was not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and issued a Finding of No Significant Impact. In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations which allow agencies to determine circumstances under which public review of Finding of No Significant Impact are appropriate, the Program made this Finding available for public comment for a period of 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sixty-eight comment letters were received. The comments contained in these letters and the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program responses are presented in a new Appendix 5 to the Environmental Assessment. The Appendix has been placed in libraries near the shipyards or mailed directly to commenters not located near a shipyard. A summary of the comments and the responses have been included at the end of this notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FINAL DETERMINATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  After reviewing and analyzing the comments received, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has concluded that the Finding of No Significant Impact remains valid and the proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). Therefore, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has determined that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES AND FURTHER INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Persons requesting copies of the Finding of No Significant Impact for short-term storage of Naval spent fuel or the Environmental Assessment should contact Ms. Lisa Megargle, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, Code NAVSEA O8U, Naval Sea Systems Command, 2521 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22242&hyph;5160 (703&hyph;603&hyph;6126).

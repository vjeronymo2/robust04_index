			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STILL KICKING;  </P> <P> AGE IS NO FACTOR WHEN THIS DANCE TROUPE STRUTS ITS STUFF  </P> <P> It started with the Rockettes, a slick kick-line of long-legged dancers who  performed precision movements at New York City's plushest movie palace, Radio  City Music Hall. Then it was the scantily clad glitz-and-glamour showgirls of  Vegas.  </P> <P> Now we have the Rockerettes, an unlikely ensemble of senior citizens who  shimmy, shake and tap their toes in unison. This far-from-over-the-hill gang of  hoofers, led by Joan Settle, is also known as the Las Vegas Girls of North  County, and its members show no sign of losing their verve.  </P> <P> During 12 years at the helm of the Rockerettes, founder Settle has learned a  thing or two about leading a dance troupe culled from the ranks of Social  Security.  </P> <P> "If you don't use 'em, you'll lose 'em," the spunky show-biz veteran said.  Three of Settle's "girls" are octogenarians, and the spring chick in the  company is over 60. Settle herself is pushing 78. But age doesn't interfere  with the activities of the Rockerettes.  </P> <P> "We haven't had any accidents," Settle said. "I'm the only one who's ever been  injured -- I hurt my knee."  </P> <P> "What we do is not real strenuous stuff," she said. "We do kicks, but they're  only hip high. I work the girls pretty hard, but when they need to rest, they  can always stop. I don't push them."  </P> <P> Settle said she has been in show business most of her life. "I toured in the  road company of 'Desert Song' way back when. I was teaching an aerobics class  in our mobile home park (in Vista), and we decided, why not put our routines  together and perform?"  </P> <P> The rest may not make show business history, but it has made Settle and her  10-member troupe a red-hot number on the local touring circuit -- especially  with other members of the senior set.  </P> <P> "Most of the women had never danced before," Settle said. "But we practice  three or four hours a week, and we've been together so long they're really very  good. We do chorus line kicks, that kind of thing. We do a complete variety  show -- tap-dancing, the cancan, soft shoe -- about 16 numbers in all."  </P> <P> The majority of the Rockerettes may be late bloomers, but there is one seasoned  trouper in their midst: 62-year-old Gerry O'Dwyer, a former member of the Radio  City Rockettes.  </P> <P> "That was a long time ago," O'Dwyer said. "I danced with the Rockettes from  1948 to 1953 -- until I got married -- and I loved every minute of it. We did  four shows a day, seven days a week in those days (with one week off every  month), and we were punchy at the end. But I would have paid to work there. We  really had precision, because you did it over and over. And it was always  corrected."  </P> <P> The Rockerettes may not deliver drill-team precision, but the group does focus  on the same style of dancing. And it comes close to replicating the lavish  costumes seen on big-time stages.  </P> <P> "We don't do too many high kicks, but we do line work, and the costumes are  just beautiful," O'Dwyer said. "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would  be performing again like this. But then I found Joan 2 1/2 years ago, and it's  like I died and went to heaven."  </P> <P> Most of the audiences for the Rockerettes are seniors themselves. The troupe is  accustomed to getting a rousing response, Settle said, and it was a hit on TV's  "PM Magazine." They show up regularly on public broadcasting's KOCT-TV in  Oceanside as well. The station uses a Rockerettes video two to three times a  week and all during December with a Christmas show.  </P> <P> "We all love our work," Settle said, "and everyone says we look like we're  enjoying it."  </P> <P> Added O'Dwyer: "We're still little old ladies, but we're a good group."  </P> <P> Additional information on the Rockerettes is available from Joan Settle,  726-3566.  </P></p>

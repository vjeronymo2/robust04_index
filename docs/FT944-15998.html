			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: New Look to join market with forecast Pounds 150m tag New Look, the rapidly expanding women's wear chain that already has almost as many shops as Etam - albeit much smaller - is planning to float early next month. The group hopes to have a market value of more than Pounds 150m. Profits for the six months to September 24 are expected to be about Pounds 10m on turnover of Pounds 59m. New Look has 221 outlets, including 10 in France, but opened its first London branch, in Oxford Street, only last week. It has grown from a single shop in Taunton, opened by Mr Tom Singh, founder and deputy chairman, straight from university in 1969. The company is wholly owned by the Singh family. About 35 per cent of the equity is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer. Mr Singh, who will have about 9 per cent of the company after flotation, will not be selling any shares. He explained that his family wanted to realise some of their investment, most of which will go into family trusts. The flotation will raise about Pounds 10m of new money. Of this Pounds 6.5m will go on freeholds, including Pounds 5m for the Weymouth distribution centre opened in April. Flotation fees will account for Pounds 2.5m, and the remaining Pounds 1m will be added to working capital to cover seasonal trading. This will leave the company virtually debt free. Mr Singh plans to add 40 shops a year to the chain for the next five years, doubling the number of shops and tripling the sales area. He attributes the group's growth to such factors as prime sites, a broad customer base of 15 to 50-year-olds, prices 10 per cent below the competition, a high stock turn rate and well developed electronic information systems. The group expects its strong cash flow (Pounds 13m last year) to fund its Pounds 7m a year capital expenditure programme. Over the last four years operating margins have improved from 4 per cent on sales of Pounds 17.5m to 12 per cent on Pounds 88.5m. Sponsors are J Henry Schroder Wagg and brokers James Capel. The pathfinder is due on Monday.</p>

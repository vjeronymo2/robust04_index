			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Subsidies urged for coalmining THE Coalfield Communities Campaign, a local-authority pressure group, yesterday called for European Community subsidies to keep the UK coal industry alive. The group wants a moratorium on pit closures while ways are found to support the industry. MEPs with coalmining interests have joined forces with the local authorities in seeking a moratorium on closures in the face of continued threats of more closures. Mr Stephen Fothergill, the campaign's national director, said: 'UK mining communities deserve a breathing space and the miners themselves deserve recognition for their magnificent achievement in doubling production.' This is the last full year before the expiry of a contract between the electricity generators and British Coal, which gave the industry a guaranteed market. There is concern that the end of the contract will lead to a switch to coal imports.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, April 21 (XINHUA) -- An expanding radio and  TV network has brought a more colorful and better informed life  to herdsmen in Alxa League in the remote western part of the  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to local officials.    The officials said radio broadcasts now reach 80 percent of  the league's population, and TV programs 75 percent.    With an area of 270,000 sq km, mostly desert, the league's  major transportation means used to be camels and horses. So the  herdsmen lived an isolated life until the early 1980s.    Since then, the league authorities have invested 50 million  yuan building 38 relay stations and 49 satellite ground  stations, bringing 14 TV channels to the local people.    According to the officials, some small towns and villages  have even set up their own cable TV networks.</p>

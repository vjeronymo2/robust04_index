			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert Barnett] </F>   [Text] A large-scale mobilisation of troops is taking  place in Tibet, according to reports from the region. The troop  movements, the largest reported from the area since 1989,  appeared to be concentrated around the Tibetan border with India.    The Tibetan government-in-exile reported yesterday that  30,000 soldiers in three divisions of the People's Liberation  Army had been moved from inland China into Tibet. One division  had moved from Lanzhou in Xinjiang and two from Chengdu in  Sichuan. The influx would nearly double the normal troop  garrison in Tibet, estimated at around 50,000 four years ago.    According to the reports, the movement began in late March,  matching reports from tourists in Yunnan Province that a large  contingent of troops accompanied by helicopters had been seen  around April 1 moving towards southern Tibet from Dali in  northern Yunnan.    Western government sources confirmed that there were  large-scale troop movements going on in Tibet.    There has been no visible troop activity in the Tibetan  capital Lhasa and troop movements appeared to be focused on the  sensitive border areas of Drayul and Dromo which face India's  northeast frontier in Arunachal Pradesh, according to the  government-in-exile.    In Lhasa, officials were said to have been compiling lists  of  military reservists and of people under the age of 40 who have  done military service.    Procedures at road checkpoints have been tightened and one  Tibetan arriving in India said that, from early this month,  police checkpoints on the road from Lhasa to the border have  been taken over by the military.    Increased security controls are expected in China in the  run-up to the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square killings  on June 4 and to U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision on  China's most favoured nation trading privilege in less than five  weeks.</p>

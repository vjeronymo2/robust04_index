			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before discussing the pricing principles and specific new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodologies that may be acceptable, there are several points we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would like to make. First, the Commission believes that improving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price signals is an important goal, but recognizes that trade-offs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between improved price signals and simplicity are inevitable. On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one hand, transmission service is typically a small component of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total cost of electric service and, therefore, arguably does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not merit overly complex pricing methods. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  On the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand, in many cases transmission capacity is a scarce and valuable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource, and its pricing can send signals that promote the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient siting of generation facilities and efficient decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as to the dispatch of generation. In addition, new technological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advances, particularly in computer technology, have made certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovative pricing methodologies workable in practice. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore must balance the sometimes competing goals of better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price signals and simplicity when evaluating any new pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, transmission plant has represented less than 12 percent of total electric plant in service for major investor-owned Electric Utilities and generally less than 6 percent of the cost of electricity to end users. (Derived from cost data in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 1992 Energy Information Administration Financial Statistics of Major Investor-Owned Electric Utilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the Commission also recognizes that it must move  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond certain precedent in order to entertain alternative pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals. For example, instead of requiring a single postage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stamp rate for transmission over the integrated transmission system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a corporation, such as a holding company system with several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affiliated operating companies, <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  we will now entertain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals such as zonal rates <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  that take distance within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation into account, provided that such proposals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the pricing principles that we adopt today. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Having analyzed new methodologies presented in the record, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that some departures from our traditional integrated system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing requirement will be supportable under the FPA if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Southern Company Services, 55 FERC &para;61,173 (1991),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> order on reh'g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 58 FERC &para;61,093 (1991),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> aff'd <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Alabama Power Company  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> FERC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 993 F.2d 1557 (D.C.

The total cost assigned to any request for transmission service would depend on the number of zones traversed and the rate for each zone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If a utility, or public utility holding company system, proposes to disaggregate its integrated transmission system into distinct components (or zones) for purposes of developing transmission rates for third parties, it must apply the same approach consistently and uniformly across the entire system for all uses of the system, including its own uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We caution that any such zonal approach or other disaggregated approach would also need to appropriately recognize all flows on the system. For example, if flows are used to allocate costs on some lines, flows should be used to allocate costs for all remaining lines in the same way;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  it would not be acceptable to presume that each transmission customer proportionally uses and relies upon all remaining lines of the integrated system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, as previously noted, several commenters urged the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission to provide a framework for reforming pricing that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement the Commission's RTG Policy Statement. The Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continues to believe that it would be appropriate for RTGs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address transmission pricing. We anticipate that the pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility provided herein, and our willingness to give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate deference to RTG decisions, will not only encourage the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of RTGs, but will also encourage RTGs to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission pricing, including regional issues affecting such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, we do not want our policy to be so rigid that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilities will be prohibited from proposing pricing alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may deviate from the traditional revenue requirement. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission remains a natural monopoly, we believe it will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult for transmission owners to support such pricing under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FPA, particularly market-based transmission rates. However, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that it would be shortsighted to foreclose completely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of such non-conforming proposals. The electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility industry of today is very different from the electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility industry that existed only 20 years ago and even five years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ago. Just as we today change our policies to reflect recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes, we must remain flexible if we are to respond to future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes. Accordingly, we detail procedures and standards below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will be used in evaluating transmission pricing proposals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not conform to the traditional revenue requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We now turn to the requirements of the FPA and the pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles that we have developed consistent with those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

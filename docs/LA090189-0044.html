			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Oscar-winning actor Marlon Brando says he's made his last movie -- and it's a  dud. "It's horrible," Brando said in Toronto of "The Freshman." "It's going to  be a flop, but after this, I'm retiring. I'm so fed up. This picture, except  for the Canadian crew, was an extremely unpleasant experience. I wish I hadn't  finished with a stinker." Brando, 65, who has been shooting the movie in Canada  for the last 12 weeks, also told the Toronto Globe and Mail that he's fed up  with kowtowing to the Hollywood publicity system, detests New York and adores  Canada.

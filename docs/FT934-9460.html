			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Twin boost for Euro-insurers in 1993 - Portfolio gains and rate increases have combined impressively Investors who spotted the potential of European insurance shares towards the end of last year have seen their holdings appreciate impressively over the past 12 months. Shares in some companies, such as Germany's Aachener &amp; Munchener (AMB), have almost doubled, and across the Continent insurance issues have outperformed local stock markets. Between September 15, 1992 and November 5 this year, insurance shares have risen by 57 per cent, a gain of 13.2 per cent relative to the FT-Actuaries Europe index as a whole, according to figures produced by BZW Securities. Since the end of June, insurers have continued to outperform, registering a 14.4 per cent rise compared to a relative gain of 2.5 per cent. Italian and French companies led the way earlier this year but, over the last four months, German, Swiss and Dutch insurers have performed more powerfully, with the prices of German companies up by more than 30 per cent since the end of June. Third-quarter figures released recently by NatWest Securities show that insurance stocks in three smaller territories also performed well, with prices up by 17.2 per cent in Spain, 28.2 per cent in Sweden, and 25.7 per cent in Finland. Investment arithmetic has been one important factor. Falls in interest rates have increased the value of bond portfolios, and insurers have also benefited from increases in the value of their equity and property investments. Mr Bob Yates, an analyst with Fox Pitt Kelton, explains that since insurers hold large amounts of equities, property and bonds in their technical reserves, their portfolios tend to be 'highly leveraged'. In addition, however, insurers have also been helped by rises in premium rates following two to three years of heavy claims from theft and fire. In most countries, rates for both personal insurances - such as home and motor - and commercial lines have risen. Mr Tom Bennett, an analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, points to Germany, where motorists, especially in the eastern German states, are facing rises typically of 50 per cent. Commercial buyers, too, are facing increases. 'Virtually every day the newspapers are full of reports, with companies squealing about their rates going up. This has to be good news for insurers,' says Mr Bennett. Mr Angus Runciman, an analyst with BZW Securities, says the hardening in rates has been an important factor in Scandinavia, where insurers have been forced to take tough action to restore the strength of their balance sheets, following the turmoil in local stock markets last year. 'The region now comes close to offering a competitive vacuum,' says Mr Runciman, who predicts that rating discipline should be maintained there longer than anywhere else in the region. Reinsurers - such as Germany's Munich Re and Switzerland's Swiss Re - have been helped by a hardening in international reinsurance markets, where rates have risen and terms tightened for high level catastrophe covers. However, the currently bullish trend for insurers may have a limit. Mr Runciman also suggests that 'the likelihood of lower interest rates will sooner or later result in reduced streams of investment income'. There are fears, he says, that having repaired their balance sheets some companies, especially the French, will be prepared to forgo further premium rate increases in favour of raising market share. 'It is worrying,' he concludes, 'that even before the publication of (their) 1993 results, there are already suggestions that rates have risen sufficiently and it is time once again to focus on market share.'</p>

It is assumed that the mechanical control object f(x(t))  has a vector of independent first integrals which obeys  Pontryagin's principle condition and that the control vector is  subject to an upper-bound constraint on its Euclidean norm. With  x(t(0)) and x(t(1)) given in the phase space, the problem is to  find the structure of operator u[.sup]0[/]=  u[.sup]0[/](x(t)) which will minimize the time functional  = [.sup]t0[/]Int[.sup]t1[/] dt= t(1) - t(0) to min=  T[.sup]0[/](x(t)). The solution to this variational problem  is sought on the basis of the characteristic optimality  condition in the quick-response problem. That minimum and thus  optimum value is shown to depend not only on the vector of  optimal control but also on the intrinsic motion of the control  object (solution to the problem) under specific initial or  current conditions in phase coordinates. The characteristic  optimality condition is applied to the case of an object either  in intrinsic motion or at rest, with a zero Euclidean norm of  the control vector and no a'priori information about control of  the object before time t[.sup]0[/]. A partial differential  equation of the Hamilton-Jacobi kind and the solution to its  Cauchy problem with a zero boundary condition are obtained for  T[.sup]0[/]. For autonomous systems that equation is a  quasi-linear first-order partial differential one solvable by  the method of characteristics, the latter being solutions to a  system of ordinary differential equations. In the particular  case considered here the integral surface degenerates into an  integral curve, the tangent plane into a tangent line, and the  Monge cone into a Monge axis. As a specific example is  considered motion describable by the system of two equations  dx(1)/dt= x(2) + u(1) and dx(2)/dt= -x(1) + u(2) with the same  upper-bound constraint on the norms of both control vectors.

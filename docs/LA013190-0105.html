			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> FAMILY PLANNING BILL PUTS HEAT ON GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Under pressure from Sen. Pete Wilson and other Republicans to defuse a volatile  political issue, Gov. George Deukmejian today will announce the fate of a  $20-million family planning bill that has caused him deep anger and  frustration.  </P> <P> The GOP governor has until midnight to act on a handful of options involving  the popular legislation, which would restore money he previously vetoed for 500  clinics serving mostly poor women.  </P> <P> Deukmejian can fan the political fires by either vetoing the measure or using  his gubernatorial blue pencil to pare the $20 million to a lower figure. Both  courses, Republicans fear, could expose them to the attacks of increasingly  vocal abortion-rights activists, because critics of family planning have linked  the clinics with abortions.  </P> <P> The way for Deukmejian to please most Republicans running for office this year  -- including the pro-choice Wilson -- is either to sign the bill or allow it to  become law without his signature.  </P> <P> "He's just fed up with the whole thing," said one Deukmejian aide, who like  most insiders did not want to be quoted by name.  </P> <P> Deukmejian has publicly voiced his anger at a lawsuit challenging his authority  to cut money for family planning clinics.  </P> <P> A San Luis Obispo County Superior Court judge ordered restoration of the funds,  but the governor has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court. To now  sign a bill restoring the money would make him look as if he were surrendering  to the plaintiffs and set a bad precedent for future governors, he believes.  </P> <P> Deukmejian also has publicly attacked the family planning clinics themselves,  declaring they provide far more medical services than the Legislature  originally envisioned. He insists that these benefits are available separately  from the Medi-Cal program.  </P> <P> More than 31,000 low-income women in Orange County use family planning  agencies, according to Margie Fites Seigle, executive director of Planned  Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> Seigle said the state provides $1.4 million a year to six family planning  outlets in the county. The outlets include the Planned Parenthood system, the  Huntington Beach Community Clinic, Laguna Beach Community Clinic and the Orange  County Center for Health.  </P> <P> Privately, according to people close to him, Deukmejian also thinks the whole  issue has been greatly overblown by the Legislature. The program represents  just a minuscule part of a $50-billion state budget, he reasons. And Deukmejian  really resents being pressured.  </P> <P> But politically, Deukmejian's arguments will not wash with middle-of-the-road  voters, many leading Republicans contend. They fear -- and they have told the  governor -- that Democrats will have a field day accusing the GOP of  insensitivity for cutting back such services as birth-control advice and  prescriptions, gynecological examinations, pregnancy tests, and screening for  venereal disease and AIDS for the 470,000 people who used the nonprofit clinics  last year.  </P> <P> "The governor ought to get rid of this thing. It's a loser," said one  strategist for Wilson, the probable Republican nominee to replace Deukmejian  next January. "The governor knows where we're coming from on this. Pete feels  he ought to restore the family planning money. We're not seeking fights with  Duke, but Republicans are getting killed with this kind of stuff."  </P> <P> The Wilson adviser, who requested anonymity, added that if Democrats attempt to  tar Wilson with an anti-family planning brush because of what Deukmejian does,  "Pete can always say, 'Well, this candidate would be a different kind of  Republican governor.' But he would prefer not to have to say it. So there's  been a lot of communication" with Deukmejian aides.  </P> <P> What makes family planning especially volatile politically is that it is linked  indirectly with abortion, perhaps the hottest campaign issue of the last few  months, at least in California.  </P> <P> Conservative Republicans in the Assembly originally opposed the family planning  programs because they believed many clinics promoted abortion. During a budget  crunch last July, Deukmejian went along with their objections and vetoed $24  million from the state's $36-million funding package for the clinics.  </P> <P> But his action was taken before voters began seriously contemplating a landmark  U.S. Supreme Court ruling, just a few days earlier, that gave states greater  leeway to regulate abortion.  </P> <P> "This whole abortion issue is like a dagger at Republicans," said former  Deukmejian chief-of-staff Steven A. Merksamer, who now is a private attorney  and a part-time Wilson adviser. "The Supreme Court made it a real issue. A lot  of people who were indifferent before the ruling have become activists.  </P> <P> "I can't think of another issue that tends to make politicians throw up as fast  as abortion, because whatever position you take you are going to alienate a  vociferous single-issue constituency and do political damage to yourself,"  Merksamer said. "And that's something politicians try to avoid at all cost."  </P> <P> Merksamer, like most of Deukmejian's advisers, hopes the governor somehow can  protect the constitutional separation of powers, rid himself of the political  issue and also save face.  </P> <P> "I understand the governor's concern about his line-item veto authority," he  said. "But, hopefully this issue can be resolved in a way that preserves his  authority and at the same time gets this issue behind him and the Legislature  so they can get on with the broader issues that confront this state."  </P> <P> That is the message Republican legislative leaders have been sending  Deukmejian. They also have been reminding the governor that GOP and Democratic  legislators negotiated the compromise family planning bill under the  cooperative, watchful eye of his Administration. And now they feel the governor  has pulled the rug out from under them.  </P> <P> "But sometimes you can push the governor too much," noted Senate Republican  Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno.  </P> <P> Assemblyman William J. Filante (R-Greenbrae), one of the GOP legislators  pushing for family planning funds, said he admires the governor for being "a  very straight person, squeaky clean, who has the guts to look at something and  give it his best shot and do what he believes in. . . . He's not acting on the  basis of who's for it and who's against it."  </P></p>

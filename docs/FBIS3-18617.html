			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandr Vladimirov, military adviser to the </F> Russian presidency: "A Partnership for Peace or for NATO?"]    [Excerpts] It is quite likely that 1994 will go down in  history as the year of the Partnership for Peace. It is equally  likely that this initiative will promote an integrationist idea  capable of shaping a new greater Europe which is both stable and  democratic. But this idea could amount to no more than good  intentions which, as we all know, pave the road to hell.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Uncertainties </H5>   We have tried objectively not only to study the concept of  the Partnership but also to understand the spirit it embodies.  It is this in particular which has given rise to the first  uncertainties and the following essential questions:    1. What is the initiative's objective?    2. What is the aim of the progressive enlargement of NATO?    3. What is "real partnership" and how much does it cost?    4. How do the NATO leaders see the borders of the  "Euro-Atlantic region," the security of which they are saying  must be consolidated?    5. What exactly are the "new security relations between the  alliance and its partners for peace?"    NATO documents give no or incomplete answers to these  questions. However, we believe that the essential thinking  behind the Partnership for Peace and the political conditions  which determined the birth of the concept can be summarized as  follows:     -  the capability of the United Nations is  insufficient;    -  NATO, while remaining the most powerful military  organization, has lost the very reason for its existence;    -  Russia  is at present so weakened that it can no longer control its  former Warsaw Pact allies or the former Soviet republics;    -  the  political leaders of Central Europe have chosen "a national  flight from Russia to NATO;"    -  European diplomacy in Yugoslavia  has reached the deadlock of a crisis at the European level which  is burdened with spilled blood.  <H5>  The Choice of Mechanism </H5>   The conclusion is clear. Given the above conditions, the  only possible remedy lies in a unification of the efforts of the  whole of Europe with the precise aim of guaranteeing its  security on the basis of partnership. The problem thus lies in  the mechanism to be used in order to achieve this goal.    NATO has chosen the type of mechanism in proposing the  Partnership for Peace plan, which is not bad in principle as it  is only the Atlantic alliance which has real force and  structures in Europe. However, this would create the danger of  "progressively" pushing Russia out of this European process and  of seeking European security without her. This brings us to the  first illogical points which have served to over-simplify the  model proposed.    All that NATO has seen in the Partnership for Peace is a  mechanism for self-preservation and the creation of its new  image. It is in this way that the idea of a Partnership for  Peace has been transformed into that of a partnership for NATO.  The euphoria was so great that it prevented NATO from noticing  that the Russian bull was on the doorstep of the European china  shop. This is the only way we can explain the later decisions  of NATO which have harmed the idea of the Partnership for Peace.  <H5>  The Revelation of Bosnia </H5>   This lies in NATO's ultimatum to Serbia with the threat of  air strikes against Serb positions in the region of Sarajevo.  This decision, reached without taking into account Russia's  opinion, suggests that NATO is anxious to establish its own  importance, already inflated by an obstinate inflexibility.  Moreover, the experts in Moscow were surprised by the rigid  stance of France which, after having restricted itself for so  many years to the confines of its "national trench," has  suddenly decided to make a big show for all to see. The general  impression is that Partnership slogans are replacing any real  partnership, that NATO has little interest in a partnership with  a strong and active Russia, and that the mentality of the  Atlantic alliance is, and let us pray to God that this does not  last, every bit as resistant to change as communist ideology.  However, Russia's Serbian initiative proved both a cold shower  for NATO and also something of a salvation as any bombing of  Serbian positions would have inevitably posed the question:  What now?    The fact that Russia made its position known firmly and in  time and that this position has been accepted by NATO is, of  course, very positive. We now have a good chance of achieving a  peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis. It is therefore  important for NATO to refrain in the future from decisions  likely to divide Europe and to discredit the ideas of the  Partnership for Peace.    The above reasoning may be summarized under two key  themes:     -  it is impossible to ignore the evidence that Russia  is a major Euro-Asian power which has its own national  interests. No one is in a position to "push it out" of either  Europe or Asia as it covers large areas of both these  continents;    -  the United Nations must see NATO not as a cure for  all but as just one security instrument among others.    The UN peacemaking efforts must be based on the  determination of the international community to make, over a  very long period, substantial material contributions to, if not  sacrifices for, the cause of peace. This means that politicians  from all countries concerned must understand that sporadic and  cheap military actions such as air strikes have no chance of  solving peacemaking problems which require a systematic approach.</p>

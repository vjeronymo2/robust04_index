			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] The number of persons captured by the National  Police in connection with "Operation Nortenito" has risen to 10.  This operation made it possible to discover half a ton of  cocaine ready for shipment to the United States.    The last three to be arrested are Hugo Segura Hurtado and  Oswaldo William Rivera Cabezas, both corporals in the Customs  Military Police [PMA] on active duty, and the civilian, Jaime  Oswaldo Suarez Valencia.  <H5>  They Were Evading Immigration Inspection </H5>   The Interpol chief in Guayas, Lieutenant Colonel Abraham  Correa, claimed that both Segura Hurtado and Rivera Cabezas were  working at the Guayaquil airport, and had connections with the  drug trafficking ring. They were linked, in particular, with  Kleber Delgado Delgado (also in custody), who was responsible  for delivering the drugs to them, concealed in various export  items.    According to the investigations, both members of the Customs  Military Police were assigned to prevent drug shipments from  getting through the immigration screening process. However, they  had managed to put shipments aboard airplanes bound for the  United States.    Interpol agents, who were pursuing the drug traffickers,  discovered Delgado delivering several packages to the corporals.  Consequently, Interpol coordinated its action with the  headquarters of the Customs Military Police, an agency that  arrested Segura and Hurtado. Both were turned over to the  National Police last Wednesday morning.    The two subjects in custody were moved to the Second Guayas  Command, where they are being held along with the Colombians,  Alfredo Arturo Benavidez Coral, Juan Carlos Gamba Garcia, and  Mario Fernando Jurado Portilla, as well as the Ecuadorians,  Kleber Eudoro Delgado Delgado, Ivan Gerardo Pineda Flores, Luis  Fernando Mejia Tarupi, and Nelson Orlando Benavidez Medina.  <H5>  Another Arrest </H5>   Finally, last Thursday morning, the Interpol agents captured  Jaime Oswaldo Suarez Valencia at the Guayaquil airport. In the  statements made by several of those implicated who were  captured, it was claimed that Suarez played a part in the drug  trafficking crime under investigation.    It was also learned that the counternarcotics agents are  tracking at least six more persons said to be seriously  implicated in the drug traffic.  <H5>  Confiscated Assets Shown </H5>   Yesterday morning, the National Police organized a tour of  the properties confiscated from the drug traffickers captured in  "Operation Nortenito."    These assets include a residence in the Los Albatros housing  complex owned by Kleber Delgado Delgado; a warehouse located at  Km 4 of Juan Tanca Marengo Avenue, where the drug dealers had  been storing and packing the drugs brought from Colombia; and an  office located on the second floor of the building at 418  Chimborazo and Clemente Ballen Streets, where the Intersis  office, owned by Delgado, is operated.

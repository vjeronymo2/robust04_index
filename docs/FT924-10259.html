			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Employers warned over safety audit rules ALL EMPLOYERS will be required to detail health and safety risks to their employees from the beginning of next year, the Health and Safety Commission said this week. Employers were warned at the launch of the HSC's guidance on how to comply with new regulations, which might cost industry up to Pounds 120m in the first year and Pounds 70m a year in continuing costs, that inspectors would take firm action to enforce the requirements. The provisions implement the European Community Framework Directive and are the first in a series of UK regulations drafted to meet the requirements of eight directives that must be incorporated into domestic law by the end of this year. The Health and Safety Executive, the enforcement arm of the HSC, last year set the maximum cost to industry of implementing all eight directives at Pounds 300m in the first year. Mr Alan Tuffin, member of the Health and Safety Commission and chairman of the UCW communications workers' union, said: 'It will now be more difficult for anyone to claim that they misunderstood the law, as the management regulations - in giving more detail - make much clearer what the law requires.' Employers will have to appoint 'competent persons' with 'sufficient training and experience or knowledge' as well as enough time and information to assist them in complying with the regulations. Emergency procedures will have to be set up and employees trained 'adequately' in health and safety. The HSE said that although inspectors understood that employers needed time to take sensible actions where requirements were completely new, 'Where we find the law is deliberately being ignored or flouted, inspectors will take firm enforcement action,' it said. The commission said if only 5 per cent of all accidents at work were prevented as a result of the measures, the additional costs of implementing the framework directive would be covered. The HSC said the action required by employers would vary according to the level of risks at work. The detail required in the 'risk assessment' would be determined by the level of risk.

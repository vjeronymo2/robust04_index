			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: South Africa It appears there was some limited intervention by the Reserve Bank of South Africa yesterday to support the financial rand. Those responsible, though, probably felt as helpless as if they had been using a pea-shooter to attack an elephant. Prompted by the formal suspension of the country's peace process over the weekend, the investment currency for foreigners slid 7 per cent in early trading, ending the day at a 27 per cent discount to its commercial counterpart. That means it is weaker than at any point since the March referendum, eloquently reflecting foreigners' worsening perceptions of political risk. The reality is that the central bank's surprise decision earlier this year to start intervening in the financial rand market - hailed as an important milestone in exchange rate policy and a step towards ultimate abandonment of the two tier system - is a policy for more stable times. Mr Mandela may be forced in the end to return to the negotiating table; in the meantime markets are bound to take fright from his rhetoric and the graphic television pictures of township violence. The Reserve Bank can smooth short term fluctuations - and even nudge the discount in the right direction - but it cannot halt the underlying trend. It is always possible that Swiss and German investors will be tempted back into high yielding bonds at current levels. But the appetite for South African equities will surely be dulled. By all accounts the recent Liberty Life and Sappi placings in Europe went reasonably well. They may be the last for some time.</p>

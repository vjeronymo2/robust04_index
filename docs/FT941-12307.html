			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Soros and GE join forcesto finance power plants: Dollars 2.5bn venture for projects in developing world Mr George Soros, best known as the currency speculator who made massive profits betting against the pound during the 1992 sterling crisis, is joining forces with GE Capital, the financial services arm of America's General Electric, to raise Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to invest in power projects in the developing world. The fund should give a strong boost to General Electric's power plant manufacturing business as it fights for global market share against rivals such as Europe's Asea Brown Boveri. Cash-strapped governments in developing countries, particularly in Asia, are increasingly willing to allow private sector capital to finance new electrical power plants. The venture represents a further shift in Mr Soros's investment strategy which has been mainly concentrated on volatile debt, equity and currency and commodity markets. Last year he moved into property. GE Capital and Quantum Industrial Holdings, a new fund to be managed by Soros Fund Management, will each invest Dollars 200m in the new venture, called Global Power Investments. The International Finance Corporation, the private financing arm of the World Bank, will be the third founding partner. The IFC's planned Dollars 50m investment is awaiting formal approval. The partners plan eventually to raise Dollars 2.5bn in equity finance from a wide variety of investors, ranging from businesses with interests in the construction or operation of power projects to passive investors. The initial focus will be on Asia - particularly China, India and Indonesia  -and on Mexico. GE Capital and various partners are in advanced discussions about projects in these countries. The fund is believed to be the first of its kind, although vehicles have been formed before now to invest in individual developing world power projects. Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, said the venture was an outgrowth of GE Capital's existing power financing business, which has focused mainly on the US market where it has financed more than Dollars 7bn of projects through a mixture of debt and equity. Mr Wendt said Mr Soros's involvement stemmed from a friendship between a senior GE Capital executive and an associate of Mr Soros. 'Mr Soros has not only a large amount of money at his disposal but a keen understanding of the rest of the world,' Mr Wendt added. 'He is a true international investor. Marry that with GE's international activities and we think we have an excellent combination.'</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Birse to bolster balance sheet via Pounds 24m placing Birse Group, the building and civil engineering company moved yesterday to strengthen its balance sheet through a share placing to raise Pounds 24m. The move was supported by Midland, its banker, which will take a minimum stake of 15.1 per cent in the company. This could rise as high as 26.2 per cent depending upon how much of the 125m share placing is taken up by existing shareholders. Under clawback arrangements shareholders will be offered 1.89 new shares at 20p each for every share held. The shares rose 4p to 27 1/2 p. Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the German construction group, is subscribing for Pounds 1.8m of new shares. Even so, its stake will fall from 14.45 per cent to 9.7 per cent. Family interests of Mr Peter Birse, chairman, are subscribing for Pounds 2m shares, reducing the family stake to 21.3 per cent (46.4 per cent). The restructuring was supported by investment institutions which previously had no holdings in the company. These will now be left with a stake of between 16.9 and 29.3 per cent depending on the extent of the clawback. It is the second time this year Birse has reorganised its finances with the aid of Midland. In February it announced it had rescheduled its borrowings 'on a committed three year basis to May 1996'. Its borrowing position has deteriorated since then. At end-November net debt stood at Pounds 46.5m, compared with shareholders' funds of just Pounds 12.4m. After the placing the company will have net borrowings of Pounds 22.5m with shareholders' funds increased to Pounds 36.4m. Mr Birse said borrowings, which were Pounds 27.2m at the April 30 year-end, traditionally peaked at this time of year. Nonetheless, the pressure on the balance sheet had made it difficult for Birse to persuade customers it had the necessary financial strength to undertake large projects and break into new markets. 'The equity injection should alleviate this problems. With increased opportunities to tender for work we should be able to turn down some of the lower margin jobs we have been required to take,' Mr Birse said. COMMENT Yesterday's share placing, together with the debt rescheduling announced in February, should end speculation about Birse's future. The seriousness of its situation is emphasised by the decision of Midland to take a stake in the company. Birse, to have continued as it was, ran the risk of withering away as customer confidence evaporated. It can take comfort from the fact that institutions which previously did not hold the stock now feel sufficiently confident to take a stake in its future. UK contracting margins, however, are likely to remain meagre and new and old shareholders may still have to wait some time to see a return on their investment.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Polish finance minister quits THE Polish government's economic policies suffered an embarrassing blow yesterday with the resignation of Mr Karol Lutkowski, the finance minister. Mr Lutkowski, who has only been in office for two months, cited 'significant differences' between himself and the rest of the government's economic team as the reason for his 'irreversible' move. The resignation came as Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister, unveiled the controversial economic programme which switches emphasis from the anti-inflationary line of the last two governments to one of stimulating the economy to overcome recession. Mr Olszewski declined to comment on the reasons for the resignation but said it had not yet been accepted. Mr Lutkowski saw the premier yesterday morning - only a few days after the government accepted the plan. It was presented to parliament over the weekend but has not been debated. The finance minister said yesterday he felt there had been insufficient support in the cabinet for his policies and efforts. He also expressed his fear that moves to change and tinker with monetary controls 'signified a threat for Poland's transformation to a free-market economy'. Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the minister responsible for the new plan, said yesterday he intended to keep this year's budget deficit to within 5 per cent of GDP. 'We are fully aware that allowing hyperinflation would wipe out any effort to reverse the recession'. Mr Eysymontt announced that the government intended to concentrate on boosting exports and investment, adding that he did not see 'any possibility of increasing consumption over the next three years'. He said the government target was to reduce inflation to between 40 and 45 per cent by the end of the year, against 60 per cent in 1991, while the growth in money supply would 'slightly exceed prices growth'. The minister added the government intended to stabilise the level of unemployment next year. A government policy document said recession had to be overcome for reform to continue and that the pace of privatisation would be maintained. Political quagmire, Page 20</p>

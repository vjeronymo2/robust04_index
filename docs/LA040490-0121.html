			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFERENCE CHAIR DESERVES CREDIT  </P> <P> Thank you for your coverage of the Pasadena Women's Conference, sponsored by  the Commission on the Status of Women, in the San Gabriel Valley View section  of the L.A. Times on Wednesday, March 21. This year's conference was attended  by over 350 women, more than in any past year.  </P> <P> While your article was excellent, I feel compelled to point out one major  omission: the name of the Chair of the 1990 Pasadena Women's Conference, Emily  Ballance, was not mentioned.  </P> <P> A conference of this size required a tremendous amount of work and Ms. Ballance  put in hundreds of hours of volunteer time to make the event a real success.  </P> <P> A newcomer to the Commission on the Status of Women, she worked with a Planning  Committee of 18 members, beginning in October, 1989. She led this group in  obtaining financial support from co-sponsoring organizations, deciding what  issues to address in the 21 workshops, contacting and confirming 43 workshop  leaders and panelists, coordinating arrangements for 32 display tables for  community groups, writing the brochure, securing keynote speaker (state)  Senator Diane Watson (who was excellent!) and many more tasks demanding time  and expertise.  </P> <P> When anyone works this hard on a volunteer basis -- and has such success -- she  (or he) should be recognized! I saw first-hand the contributions Ms. Ballance  made to this year's conference.  </P> <P> Again, we appreciate the excellent coverage, but I hope The Times will join us  in giving credit where credit is due. Thank you.  </P> <P> REBECCA CHAPMAN  </P> <P> Member, 1990 Pasadena Women's  </P> <P> Conference Planning Committee  </P></p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Air France under attack for 'favouring' Boeing AIR FRANCE, the state-owned airline, yesterday came under attack for allegedly favouring Boeing, the US aircraft maker, over Airbus, the European aircraft consortium, William Dawkins reports from Paris. Mr Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse, where Airbus's main assembly plant is based, warned Mrs Edith Cresson, French premier, that a decision by Air France to buy three Boeing 767-300 medium-sized carriers would have 'regrettable consequences'. The amount at stake is less than the Pounds 4bn (Dollars 7.24bn) order British Airways placed with Boeing last year, which triggered an Airbus complaint to the European Commission. But it is a further example of the political sensitivities behind aircraft purchasing. Air France was puzzled by Mr Baudis' objections as the group has been buying Boeings, alongside Airbuses, for years. The latest order simply replaces a cancelled order for two Boeing 747-400s. French industrial output in the third quarter of 1991 rose 0.9 per cent over the previous three months, Insee, the state statistics body, said, Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRESSING WELL  </P> <P> Regarding "Dressing Well Is the Best Revenge," by Karen Stabiner (Dec. 11): For  the past 45 years I have lived and worked in Beverly Hills. My friends are  people dedicated to various charitable, cultural and political causes. We have  tried to teach our children sensitivity for others in an attempt to counter the  "hedonist" image we have as a community.  </P> <P> Your vacuous piece on Wanda McDaniel and Armani was an embarrassment to us as a  community.  </P> <P> BOBBI ELLIOTT  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

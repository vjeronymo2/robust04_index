			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMPLE SECRET TO CREATING AN INVITING BRUNCH TABLE  </P> <P> Martha Stewart, author and authority on entertaining in the home, advocates  using collectible china to create an inviting table.  </P> <P> For a brunch, which she describes as "a perfect way to entertain informally,"  she suggests a table of unusual china or pottery, one-of-a-kind glassware,  mix-and-match flatware.  </P> <P> "Different styles, patterns and shapes play off each other well if color and  size coordinate," she says.  </P> <P> Stewart, a member of the Great Entertainers Council formed by Champagne  Perrier-Jouet four years ago as a source of information on entertaining styles  and trends, also offers these suggestions:  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Special Touches  </P> <P>  -- Fresh flowers, whether a single perfect bloom, a spray of daisies or a  potted plant from the garden, are a must.  </P> <P>  -- Amusing salt and pepper shakers, or a trio of dainty pottery pitchers  accent a brunch table wonderfully.  </P> <P>  -- Yellow, blue and green look especially good on a breakfast or luncheon  table. Use brightly hued cloth napkins or pretty dish towels; if buffet style,  roll each guest's utensils in a napkin and tie with ribbon.  </P> <P>  -- Butter molds in interesting shapes add a special touch to the table and are  a cinch to do ahead. Maple sugar butter is delicious on French toast.  </P> <P>  -- Make one or two special breads ahead of time and freeze them until the  night before the party. Easier still, buy wonderful breads to freeze.  </P> <P>  -- Make the presentation beautiful; small details bring style to even the  simplest fare. Carefully peel 4-minute eggs and place on wedges of toast;  garnish French toast with a twist of sliced orange; serve creamy cafe au lait  for a special treat.  </P> <P> Stewart, whose most recent book is "Quick Cook Menus," espouses entertaining at  brunch because "you can have fun with a variety of dishes, you can do most of  the preparation in advance and, best of all, it's less stressful than trying to  entertain midweek."  </P></p>

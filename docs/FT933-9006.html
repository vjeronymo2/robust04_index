			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Leading Article: An entente that remains elusive ANGLO-FRENCH relations have never been characterised by undiluted sweetness and light. Yet even by historic standards the degree of mutual incomprehension after the upheaval in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) ranks uncommonly high on the Richter scale. A glance at the recent outpourings of the Fourth Estate in the respective countries  - and indeed of the press in the rest of the Community - suggests a cultural divide that will not be easily bridged as Europe takes stock after the debacle. It will not help overmuch to seek explanations in old caricatures: the Anglo-Saxon pro-market, pro-financial culture versus a French dirigiste tendency that goes back to Colbert. To the extent that they have any validity, these cultural stereotypes are anyway no longer the exclusive property of the countries concerned. Even under the socialists, France adopted an increasingly pro-business culture in the 1980s. While this may have come more than two centuries after Voltaire lauded Britain's libertarian brand of commercialism in his Lettres Anglaises, there is no doubting the belated commitment. Both the socialists and their right- of-centre successors have sought to turn Paris into a fit competitor for the City of London by deregulating its markets. Influenced by the Thatcher-Reagan model, other EC members succumbed to the liberalising and privatising tendency. Free-market British For their part, the supposedly free-market British, with Mrs Thatcher dissenting, went voluntarily into the rigid, post-1987 version of the ERM. The move was widely regarded as helpful to industry, but scarcely accorded with the view of a country that puts the interests of manufacturing second to those of the City, which thrives on currency instability. How, then, do we explain the wholly different responses of British and French politicians to their mutually shared experience of destabilising speculation? On the French side there is undoubtedly a historic preoccupation with currency strength that goes back to France's central role in the 19th century Latin Monetary Union and beyond. The measure of that commitment was seen in the 1930s when French national income declined by a third in money terms between 1930 and 1935, while the country stuck doggedly to the Gold Bloc - this, despite the apparent benefits to the economy of the earlier franc devaluation of the mid-1920s and the example of high growth in Britain after sterling parted company with gold in 1931. Economic costs Equally striking is the French readiness to incur large economic costs in pursuit of foreign policy goals, as in the ERM. The British antipathy for such an approach is partly explained by the historically larger role of trade in relation to GNP. But nor is the German appetite for economic and political linkage on a par with the French: it was, after all, the reluctance of the Bundesbank to jeopardise its own monetary policy by supporting an ailing franc that disabled the ERM. That reluctance enjoys ample support from German public opinion. Yet the most striking area in which the French and other continental Europeans differ from the Anglo-Saxons concerns speculation. To many Britons, with a very open economy and the highest portfolio percentage of overseas investment in the developed world, so-called speculation appears to be a legitimate means of protecting the interests of pensioners and policyholders; and of protecting the finances of employers in the tradeable goods sector. In contrast, much comment in France treats speculation as immoral; and such is the respect for the state that the idea that the French may have been saved by the markets from an appallingly deflationary policy blunder is wholly alien. Nor is it a coincidence that 'new right' critiques of majoritarian democracy have been slower to take root in France than in the US and the UK. The notion that government needs to be fettered by more constitutional constraints and market freedoms is simply incompatible with the elitism that has accompanied France's recent economic success. Such cultural differences do not preclude forward movement in the Community. But they need to be explored and understood.</p>

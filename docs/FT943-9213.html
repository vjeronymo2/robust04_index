			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Dishonest directors worsen Russia's debt crisis Corrupt factory managers are exacerbating the debt among Russian business enterprises which is threatening to paralyse the country's economy, a government report has warned. The mountain of debt, now estimated at nearly Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.8bn), has built up as businesses fail to pay suppliers, creating a knock-on effect that has left some companies unable to pay their employees. The debt levels are seen as so dangerous that a government commission was convened last week to address the problem and is reporting weekly to the president and prime minister. The government report, written by Mr Petr Karpov, deputy director of Russia's Federal Bankruptcy Agency, and based on a detailed financial study of 15 Russian enterprises, alleges that a small number of corrupt factory directors are helping to undermine Russia's financial system. The report names Russian enterprises and accuses some factory directors of shipping goods without receiving payment, in exchange for kick-backs. 'Immoral business is now a widely spread norm of economic behaviour, because it is profitable,' the report concludes. It urges the government to curb these corrupt business practices by forcing loss-making companies into bankruptcy. Inter-enterprise debt poses one of today's biggest challenges for the Russian government and is a test of Moscow's commitment to economic reforms. The arrears, which have worsened since the Russian government tightened credit after its spring agreement with the International Monetary Fund, are affecting even the most sensitive sectors of the Russian economy, including the nuclear power industry. Now the government is facing a choice between bailing out factories and perhaps triggering a new wave of inflation, or taking the political risk of forcing bankruptcies.

"Tension increased with heavy shelling in the morning and in  the afternoon" of Wednesday, said the sources in central Bosnia.    Some 250 shells exploded over the worst-hit area, the  Bosnian  army-held Gradacac and Brcko zone, 40 kilometers (25 miles)  north of Tuzla, while 190 shells rained down on a "confrontation  line" about five kilometers (three miles) east of Lukavac, near  Tuzla. Automatic gun fire and and mortar fire was reported at  the front lines, the sources added.    In central Bosnia, the ceasefire signed Friday by Bosnian  Croats and Moslems appeared to have been generally respected.  In the southern city of Mostar, the truce was "almost  respected." Five shells hit the Croat-besieged eastern part of  the town, where some 50,000 Moslems are holed up.    A joint Croat and Moslem committee is to meet around midday  Thursday at Gornji Vakuf, 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of  Sarajevo. It will be their third meeting since the truce was  signed a week ago.    Gornji Vakuf marks the front line between Croat forces and  the Bosnian Army in southern Bosnia and is where the situation  is considered "most volatile," the sources said. However the  sources were unable Thursday to confirm a report that the  Bosnian Army had launched an offensive Wednesday in the east of  the war-torn town.    The sources said they believed the Bosnian Army might try to  grab more territory before the joint committee, presided over by  the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), firmly established where the  front lines lay.</p>

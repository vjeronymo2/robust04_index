			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Dealers switch focus to euroyen Activity in the eurobond market yesterday was quiet in the run-up to Christmas, with only a small number of deals in Europe and a Dollars 100m floating-rate note signed in Asia by the Bank of Seoul. Attention is now turning to the new year, when dealers expect the euroyen market to provide most excitement. 'The bid for yen is still strong,' said one syndicate manager. He said that the two-tranche Y120bn six and 10-year offering launched last week by the Republic of Austria had been extremely well-received by investors. He expected 'that sort of demand to continue both on an institutional basis and on a retail basis'. 'There are a lot of borrowers looking at the yen market  - such as Spain and the EIB (European Investment Bank),' said another syndicate official. 'The swap levels there are attractive, particularly when other markets are less receptive,' he said. The prospect of increased yen-issuance was boosted by comments made by a Japanese Ministry of Finance official that Japan is considering either easing or abolishing the 'lock-up' period for euroyen bonds issued by non-sovereign foreign borrowers. This move would help the distribution of eurobonds to investors in Japan. However, the official told Reuters that no specific timetable had been set. Restrictions on the purchase of euroyen bonds issued by sovereign borrowers were abolished in January this year. Dealers also expect to see greater activity in the eurodollar sector early next year, particularly in the five-year area of the yield curve. 'We are seeing consistent interest in the dollar sector, and recently there has been a lot of switching out of three-year and into five-year bonds,' said one trader. Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, increased its DM750m five-year offering launched last month to DM1bn, due to 'exceptional demand from European retail and institutional investors,' joint lead manager Commerzbank said. Colombia's state Institute for Industrial Development is to issue a Dollars 100m eurobond in February 1995, via Citibank, a finance ministry official told Reuters. The proceeds from the offering would be used to make long-term loans to industrial companies, he said.</p>

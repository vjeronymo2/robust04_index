			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Milk quota penalties THE European Commission yesterday agreed to claw back Ecu2.3bn (Pounds 1.73bn) in unnecessary subsidies to Italy, Greece and Spain which systematically failed to enforce milk production quotas in the 1980s, writes Lionel Barber. The penalties, although severe, fall short of the original Ecu5.38bn in excess spending incurred by the EC between 1984 and 1992. The reduced penalty was settled upon because the three states have pledged to respect new rules to curb overproduction, and partly because the EC is offering an extra Ecu240m of special assistance to Italy and Spain to remove 2m tonnes of excess milk capacity. Both Italy and Spain face net payments this year of Ecu100m and Ecu50m only. However, Italy faces a total bill of Ecu1.345bn - which it will 'pay' through a reduction in EC subsidies. The EC will recover Ecu960m from Spain, but only Ecu5m from Greece.</p>

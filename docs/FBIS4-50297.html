			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, May 16 (XINHUA) -- High-tech industry has  been expanding rapidly in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region.    According to local officials, the autonomous region has  undertaken 10 projects listed under the national "Torch Plan".  All of the 10 projects have now entered the production stage  and have developed 70 kinds of high-tech products, which sell  well in both domestic and overseas markets.    The Torch Plan is aimed at promoting the development of new  and high-tech industries in China. The program was inaugurated  in 1988 and is now focused on the microelectronics, computers,  information, laser, new materials, bioengineering, new energy,  energy-efficient, machinery-electronics integrated technology  and products sectors.    The Tianshan Boiler Plant has developed a series of boilers  which have improved thermal efficiency by five percent and  reduced production costs by 30 percent.    The technology for producing such new boilers has been  transferred to 42 factories in 16 provinces and municipalities,  and earned 20 million yuan for the province.    The Urumqi High-Tech Development Zone, which was approved by  the State Council as a state-level high-tech development zone  and is home to 194 enterprises, realized 110 million yuan in  total earnings last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gerald Braunberger: "The Money Supply Put to </F> the Test"]    [Text] Hardly anything occupies financial markets as much  as the monetary policy of the large central banks. Today,  specialists in large and small commercial banks and securities  dealers are busy monitoring it. Whoever assesses well the  monetary strategies and measures can make much money for his  firm. For in the international trade with foreign currencies,  shares, bonds, and precious metals, prices usually react  strongly to changes in monetary and currency policy.    For some weeks now, individual large central banks have been  a cause of worry for traders and analysts. While in February it  was the U.S. Federal Reserve ("Fed") which upset market  participants with its albeit slight, yet unexpected, raise in  short-term interest rates, these days the German Bundesbank is  the center of attention. Since publication of a 20.6 percent  growth rate of the money supply for January--evidently distorted  by some special influences--banks and stock exchanges are  questioning whether the money supply figures are still a valid  indicator for the future attitude of the Bundesbank. And not a  few contemporaries are advising the Bundesbank to act as other  central banks, such as the Fed, are doing and to finally give up  the attempt to regulate the money supply.    From the viewpoint of a trader or capital investor acting in  the short term, this conclusion is not illogical. Market  participants, who on occasion do transactions in a matter of  seconds, want reliable information whose significance does not  depend on subsequent long explanations in the media. A trader is  hardly served by the statement that the money supply figures at  the beginning of the year are basically less important than  those at year's end, but that nonethless one must not neglect  the figures at the beginning of the year. He wants to know  unequivocally: Is this figure correct and important?    But the approach to a money supply policy is not of a  short-term, but rather of a long-term nature. The doctrine of  money supply policy, the so-called monetarism, is based on two  tenets: There is a long-term, parallel connection between the  money supply of an economy and the inflation rate. This is  largely undisputed and proven by a great number of examples.  That it is usual for prices to rise if the bank note press had  previously rotated too fast, is also not particularly surprising.    The practical difficulty for a central bank is to define  precisely what is to be included in the money supply in view of  the speed with which ever new products are being created in the  financial markets. In Germany, in addition to cash, are included  sight deposits, time deposits with a life up to four years, and  savings deposits with three-months' withdrawal notices  maintained in domestic banks and savings banks by private  households and enterprises. This demarcation has proven itself  all in all. But in other countries, such as the United States,  this has not functioned nearly as well. The second basic tenet  of the monetarists, according to which a central bank can  reliably control the money supply, is therefore very  controversial. Many monetarists have evidently underestimated  the complexity of modern financial markets.    Nevertheless, a farewell to monetarism would be premature  for  two reasons. Namely, the most important reasons for the  sometimes strong short-term fluctuations in the German money  supply can be found in a misguided policy by the governments.  This thesis is permissible: With more appropriate actions by  governments, money supply statistics would send less confusing  signals. The crises of the European Monetary System have  sometimes inflated the German money supply. But the currency  crises occurred only because the governments of the EU members  previously had not been in a position to make the adjustments of  the exchange rates which, from an economic aspect, had long been  overdue.    A sad chapter, not only for monetary policy, is the tax  chaos  following an interest discount. Among other reasons, the money  supply grew so strongly in December 1993 and January 1994  because irritated investors, primarily for tax reasons, sold  shares in investment funds and stashed them--probably only  temporarily--as bank deposits. Furthermore, the government's tax  policy promoted increased use of cash--actually an anachronism.  And lastly, a change in the rules of the already totally  overdrawn subsidy of the housing market set off a rush on  building loans, which further inflated the money supply.    A further strength of the monetarist money supply policy  consists in tying the central bank to a long-term policy  orientation. Economists have shown in a great number of works  that a long-term orientation of monetary policy can produce  better results than measures motivated by the short term. And  lastly, one must also ask the critics of a money supply policy  what then should take its place.    Now and then, it is being proposed that the Bundesbank  manipulate the interest structure, i.e., the ratio of short-term  and long-term interest rates. True, this idea has theoretical  merits. But in practice, the recently observed fluctuations of  long-term interest rates, effected by enormous capital  movements, make such an idea appear not very practicable. And it  is also not possible to return to a global currency system with  the U.S. dollar as the key currency, in which the other central  banks are only concerned with keeping the dollar exchange rate  stable.    The money supply policy is a concept with strengths and  weaknesses. It may be quite possible that, due to changes in the  financial markets, it will suffer further damage in Germany  also. For the time being, however, there is no alternative to  it. It is uncertain whether one will ever be found. For, as  economist Juerg Niehans once wrote, money supply policy after  all is not a science, but an art.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the regulations at part 113, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``processor'' also includes persons engaged in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of foods that are to be used in market or consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests. FDA has tentatively concluded that HACCP controls are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed for such products because the hazards associated with them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are no different from those that can affect other commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are, however, certain handlers of seafood that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the coverage of the proposed definition. Fishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels that essentially only harvest are not covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed HACCP regulations. As explained earlier, FDA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditionally refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency anticipates that the regulations being proposed here  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would affect vessels indirectly through processor and importer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls over raw materials and imported shipments, e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventive controls such as the purchasing of raw materials only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from fishing vessels that engage in proper sanitation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time/temperature practices and that harvest only from approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation companies that carry, but do not otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, fish and fishery products are also outside the scope of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed definition, although the agency expects that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transporters will be affected indirectly in the same manner as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishing vessels (see also &sect;110.93). FDA invites comment on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspect of the coverage of the proposed regulations. Proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration during transport is important for the safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scombroid species products and of cooked, ready-to-eat products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Time and temperature conditions during shipment can also affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decomposition related to other factors bearing on seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality. These proposed regulations will affect transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies indirectly through the preventive controls the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor or importer will need to impose to ensure that the raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials or imported shipments that it receives are free of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant hazards and have been appropriately handled. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites public discussion on whether this approach is adequate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, if not, whether HACCP requirements should be applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly to transportation companies. This issue is complex,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially because it is not unusual for transporters to deliver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a variety of food products, including seafood, to several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consignees during a single shipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has also tentatively decided to exclude retail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishments from the definition of ``processor.'' As with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishing vessels, FDA has traditionally exercised enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion with regard to retail establishments. The number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail establishments in this country_literally in the hundreds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of thousands_would totally overwhelm any rational Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection system. FDA has traditionally provided training and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other forms of technical assistance to States and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments to inspect retail food establishments through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's retail Federal/State cooperative program. A major part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that cooperative program involves the development of model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codes, some of which have been widely adopted by State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments. FDA is now consolidating those model codes into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single, updated food code for the retail sector. Appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP-based controls are included to address seafood hazards at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail. Consequently, FDA will continue to operate through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal/State cooperative mechanism and has not included a retail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component in proposed part 123. FDA requests comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentative approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States are strongly encouraged, however, to consider how the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles in these regulations could be applied to seafood at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail and to shift to HACCP-type inspection systems as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. Because of the high perishability of fresh seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the sometimes lengthy and complex distribution chain, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products can have relatively short shelf lives by the time they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reach fresh fish counters and restaurants. In addition, seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be subject at retail both to cross-contamination because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poor handling practices and to species substitution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improper handling of seafood and other problems at retail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been documented in recent years. NAS has concluded that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant number of reported acute health problems were likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> linked to handling and preparation practices in food service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishments (Ref. 7, p. 27). The February, 1992 edition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consumer Reports magazine reported on a number of such problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with regard to seafood that were observed in retail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishments. A number of studies have found lack of adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature controls in retail facilities (Ref. 48, p. 75).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing to define ``shellfish control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority'' in &sect;123.3(p) as the government entity responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing a comprehensive shellfish sanitation program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish control authority, among other things, is responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for classifying shellfish growing waters, performing inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of shellfish processors, and issuing certification numbers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish processors. FDA relies on recognized governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health and food control agencies, both domestic and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign, to carry out these functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing to define ``shellstock'' in &sect;123.3(q)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as meaning raw, in-shell molluscan shellfish. This specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product form designation is needed because the applicability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tagging, labeling, and recordkeeping requirements proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.28(b) and (c) is determined by whether the product is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellstock or shucked product, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

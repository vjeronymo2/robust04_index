			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURAL CONSERVATION  </P> <P> The July 25 Morning Report incorrectly reported we said the work on the  Siqueiros mural has been delayed by the city's uncertainty surrounding future  plans for Olvera Street. The plans for building a location for public viewing  are necessarily delayed, but not the actual conservation of the mural. We are  proceeding with the chromatic restitution in January, 1991.  </P> <P> MIGUEL ANGEL CORZO  </P> <P> Friends of the Arts of Mexico  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

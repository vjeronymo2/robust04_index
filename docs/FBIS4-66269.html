			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the State Economic and Trade Commission: "Ensure </F> Success in Stopping Losses and Increasing Profits"]    [Text] Since 1993, all localities and departments have  continually strengthened their leadership over the task of  stopping losses and increasing profits for enterprises and done  a great deal of hard and meticulous work in this respect. Thanks  to their efforts, the task across the country has produced some  results.  <H5>  I. Major Steps Taken To Stop Losses, Increase Profits </H5>   In 1993, all localities and departments continued to  implement the State Council's "Circular on Launching an In-Depth  Campaign To Stop Losses and Increase Profits for Enterprises" in  accordance with the arrangements made by the State Economic and  Trade Commission and the Ministry of Finance [ETC]. They have  accumulated some quite successful experiences and methods in the  following six main areas:    First, they implemented a system for key leaders to  undertake  responsibility as well as a responsibility system to meet preset  targets for stopping losses. The former system, which held key  leaders at all levels personally responsible for stopping losses  and increasing profits, was an organizational arrangement to  guarantee that this task received unremitting attention at all  times. Under this system, leaders undertook the responsibility  for improving the operations of big loss-suffering enterprises.  They reached deep into the reality and conscientiously helped  the enterprises solve the difficulties and problems encountered  in production and operations. Meanwhile, based on the  loss-stopping work assigned by the state, all localities and  departments instituted a system where work targets were set up  for fulfillment at prefectural and county levels and by the  trades and enterprises concerned. As a result, all levels were  required to meet certain targets. Their work was reviewed  periodically, and an evaluation report was published every  month. Successful units in meeting the targets were given  awards, while those failing to do so were penalized. And each  level was accountable to the next higher level.    Second, efforts were made to increase the internal reforms  and strengthen the management of enterprises. While implementing  the "Regulations on Transformation of Operational Mechanism of  Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People," all  localities and departments tried to learn from and popularize  the Handan Steel Plant's experience, namely, to put the stress  on tapping potentials within the enterprises as a way to stop  losses and increase profits. More efforts were devoted to cost  control and quota management. Separate accounting systems were  carried out for different levels. Each unit within the  enterprise was held responsible for the effect of its work on  the enterprise's profits and losses. Attention was paid to  reducing material consumption and minimizing loss and waste. In  addition, the three systems within enterprises were reformed,  while a risk-protection mechanism and an incentive mechanism  were set up to improve the efficiency of management. As to those  enterprises that had long been in the red and whose assets could  not cover the liabilities, action was taken as the case  required--this included closing down the enterprises, suspending  their operations, merging them with others, switching them to  other lines of production, and adjusting their production,  product mix, or organizational structure.    Third, particular attention was given to improving big  loss-suffering enterprises and dealing with their problems on a  case by case basis. Based on investigations and studies, all  localities and departments classified the loss-suffering  enterprises into different groups according to the nature of  their problems and decided on the priority in dealing with them.  They worked out a list of big loss-suffering enterprises and  made diagnostic plans after consulting with the parties  concerned. Different measures were taken for different  factories. Specific support was given to certain enterprises  with a view to helping them stop losses and increase profits. In  addition, the state and local economic and trade commissions (or  economic commissions or planning and economic commissions in  some localities; the same below) paid particular attention to  the work of stopping losses and increasing profits for 300  selected enterprises in various parts of the country. They  conducted follow-up checks on these enterprises and monitored  their operations on a periodical basis.    Fourth, a loss-stopping fund was set up to help  loss-suffering enterprises to stop their losses. In many  localities, the financial department or the bank set aside a  certain amount of money to establish such a fund. Its purpose  was to assist hopeful enterprises in developing new products and  conducting low-cost technological upgrading. Sometimes, the  fund was used to fill up a temporary shortage of working capital  or to pay interest on loans. This provided a favorable condition  for loss-suffering enterprises to stop their losses.    Fifth, efforts were made to increase production and boost  revenue by relying on advance in science and technology. Some  localities and departments, on the one hand, pooled financial  resources to help loss-suffering enterprises to upgrade their  equipment and manufacturing processes with a view to fully  tapping their own potentials. On the other hand, they encouraged  loss-suffering enterprises to benefit from advanced science and  technology, adopt new manufacturing processes, use new  technology and equipment, and speed up the development of new  products and the adjustment of their product mix. This way the  enterprises could turn out quality and marketable products to  compete with others so as to achieve the objective of stopping  losses.    Sixth, all-out efforts were made to develop the tertiary  industry and diversified operations.    Apart from the above, the state adopted a series of new  policies and measures to help eliminate losses suffered by some  trades because of certain policies implemented in the past. This  assisted greatly in promoting the 1993 work of stopping losses  and increasing profits for enterprises.  <H5>  II. Plan for Stopping Losses and Increasing Profits in 1994 </H5>   The 1994 target for stopping losses and increasing profits  for enterprises is to bring down the percentage of  loss-suffering enterprises among the industrial enterprises  contained in the state budget by 5 percentage points and to cut  their total amount of losses by 10 percent compared with the  1993 records.    To ensure the success of the 1994 work, all localities and  departments are requested to do the following:    A) It is imperative to stress the responsibility for  stopping  enterprises' losses and continue to give them proper guidance  according to the nature of their problems. All localities and  departments should strengthen their leadership in organizing the  work of stopping losses and increasing profits. They should  continue the target responsibility system and set specific  targets for the above-mentioned work to be met by various units  and enterprises. They should see to it that clear-cut targets  are assigned, and the individuals concerned are held responsible  for the fulfillment of these targets. The management of all  enterprises should make a list of their big loss-suffering  units, investigate and study the problems in each case, and work  out solutions. Different solutions should be used for different  factories, and deadlines should be set for them to correct their  problems. All loss-suffering enterprises are required to form a  loss responsibility mechanism and link the interests of their  staff members and workers to the results they achieved in  reducing and stopping losses as a way of reward or punishment.  In addition, the economic and trade commissions, financial and  audit departments, and the enterprise management should conduct  periodical supervision and inspection of the work of stopping  losses and increasing profits. Regarding those loss-suffering  enterprises whose performance is being followed up by the State  Economic and Trade Commission, key leaders of local economic and  trade commissions should be personally responsible for helping  them solve practical problems and prompting them to stop or  reduce losses as soon as possible.    B) More efforts should be devoted to operational management  and to the tapping of potentials within enterprises. All  localities and departments should make further efforts to learn  from and popularize the Handan Steel Plant's experience and  continue to gear up and improve the operational management of  enterprises. It is important at present to beef up basic  management, cost control, and the improvement of work shifts and  groups. All localities and departments should institute a sound  quota management procedure as well as other regulations, rules,  and standards, and implement a strict performance evaluation  system, using the management standards of domestic and foreign  advanced enterprises as a reference. In addition, they should  seriously implement the "General Financial Guidelines for  Enterprises" and the "Guiding Principles for Enterprise  Accounting," improve the economic accounting within enterprises,  strictly enforce the budget system and financial work  discipline, and lower all costs and expenses.    C) Enterprises should be dealt with on their merits. Those  hopeful of improvement should be given support. In the first  place, where conditions permit, local authorities and  departments in charge of the specific trades should continue to  put money into and make proper use of the loss-stopping fund.  The fund should be used mainly for construction of small  technological upgrading projects that can be applied to  production within this year, are suited to small- and  medium-sized enterprises, and can yield quick economic results.  It should also be used to support loss-suffering enterprises in  developing new products and to meet their needs for short-term  working funds. Second, in budgeting and using various  technological-transformation funds, the economic and trade  commissions, as well as financial and banking departments,  should set aside a certain amount for supporting loss-suffering  enterprises in stopping their losses. Third, based on the  inventory of the assets held by loss-suffering enterprises,  plans should be worked out to solve the lingering problems left  from the past. Fourth, after adopting the measure of granting  loans to enterprises based on their asset-to-liability ratio,  banks should make some interim arrangements to support those  hopeful enterprises in improving their production and operations  and to assist certain loss-suffering enterprises in accelerating  their product-mix adjustment. Presently, the State Economic and  Trade Commission is consulting with the departments concerned in  formulating concrete measures for loss-suffering enterprises to  obtain working-fund loans during the transitional period.    D) Transformation of the enterprise operational mechanism  should be put in high gear. Continued efforts should be made to  implement the "Regulations on Transformation of Operational  Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People"  and "Regulations on Supervision and Management of Industrial  Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" to breakthrough adjusting  the enterprise structure. Enterprises that conform to the  state's industrial policy, are hopeful of improvement, and have  a good market for their products, can be leased or sold to  others, or merged with others. For those that have suffered  losses for a long time with no hope of improvement, having more  liabilities than assets, resolute action should be taken to  allow them to apply for bankruptcy. In this way, we will be able  to adjust our enterprise structure and fundamentally correct the  mechanisms that cause losses to enterprises.    E) All-out efforts should be made to promote technological  progress and further improve product quality. All localities and  departments should energetically assist loss-suffering  enterprises in importing advanced technology, improving  manufacturing processes, using new materials and substitutes,  achieving more effective utilization of energy and raw  materials, and minimizing the material consumed for making each  unit of product. Meanwhile, they should make positive efforts to  organize and mobilize all staff members and workers to join the  qualify control campaign and see to it that quality control is  conducted at every step of the production process. For this  purpose, strict metrological controls, acceptance tests, and  quality-monitoring procedures should be put into effect at every  link of production and operations. Loss-suffering enterprises  should be encouraged to develop competitive and quality products  so as to achieve the goal of stopping losses and increasing  profits.    F) A wide-scale and in-depth campaign for "double increase  and double economy" [campaign to increase production and  practice economy and to increase revenues and retrench  expenditures] should be launched. All enterprises are requested  to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, diligence, and  frugality. Party and government departments, trade unions,  Communist Youth League organizations, and women's federations  should all make concerted efforts with one mind, rely fully on  the masses, and arouse their initiative and creativity to  develop extensive and in-depth activities to "increase  production and practice economy and to increase revenues and  retrench expenditures," so as to achieve substantial results in  stopping losses and increasing profits for enterprises.    This year, the deepening of enterprise reform and the  implementation of various reform measures will bring a drastic  change to the external environment and the operational mechanism  of enterprises. This will have a positive effect on improving  the operations of our state-owned enterprises. On the other  hand, however, enterprises will be confronted with new  questions. In particular, those enterprises with more problems  left from the past and greater difficulties in their operations  will find it hard to completely adapt themselves to the new  economic system and the new changes in the market. Thus, all  localities and departments should proceed with enterprise reform  in a deep-going and down-to-earth way as required by the  "Resolution" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee. They should guide enterprises to gear their  operations to the market, beef up their management, make  internal improvement, and quicken their pace of structural  adjustment. In addition, they should lead enterprises to raise  economic efficiency, improve quality in every respect, and  strive hard to intensify the campaign for stopping losses and  increasing profits.</p>

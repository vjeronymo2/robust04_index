			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Roni Daniyel] </F>   [Text] Over the past few days the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] in Gaza has completed all preparations for the  evacuation of bases from the Gaza Strip. The Southern Command  can evacuate the region in less than a week from the moment the  agreement with the PLO is signed. Our military correspondent  Roni Daniyel has the details:    Everything which is not vital has already been removed from  the Gaza Strip, and the Southern Command can carry out the task  of evacuation, if and when the agreements are signed, by the  middle of April. We are not fully packed, it was stated in the  Southern Command, but what is left can be evacuated in only a  few days. There are detailed plans for overlapping with the  Palestinian security forces, including a joint command for the  days of the evacuation which will begin in Rafah and end in Gaza.    The security system which will be in effect after the  evacuation is also already in operation in the Qatif Bloc. The  usual security activity, including the chasing of armed wanted  people, continues, but the IDF is surely waiting for the signing  of the agreement and the evacuation.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE BETWEEN U.S., MEXICO  </P> <P> President Salinas' free trade agreement initiative is not the product of vision  and courage, but rather a desperate attempt to find an overnight solution to 60  years of neglect, incompetence and abuse that has produced discontent among  Mexican people and has seriously undermined the ruling party's (PRI) grip on  power.  </P> <P> Salinas' failure to properly address grave domestic problems ranging from an  exploding population growth (expected to double by the year 2010) to widespread  corruption, nepotism and inefficiency in government and industry makes his free  trade proposal questionable at best.  </P> <P> The unprecedented challenge by the opposition during the last presidential  election sent a clear and sobering message to Mexico's power structure to begin  producing positive results. The desired results will only come about with good  judgment, integrity and hard work, and not by a single stroke of the pen.  </P> <P> JULIO C. ZAMARRIPA  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Late rally ends dismal month in Sweden  -A rates cut boost to equities hit from home and abroad THE Swedish stock market rallied 6.5 per cent yesterday after a reduction in domestic interest rates and an announcement of new measures to improve the country's industrial competitiveness. The rise, which saw the Affarsvarlden general index close up 42.5 at 696.6, was a welcome boost for a market which has had its worst year since the 1930s. Until yesterday, the index had fallen 28 per cent since the start of the year, and 35 per cent since its peak in May. September was a particularly dismal month because of financial turbulence in Europe and soaring interest rates at home. All sectors have been down. By far the worst performers have been the bank/finance and real estate/construction sectors, both of which had declined more than 70 per cent since the start of the year before yesterday's rally. Since September 8, when interest rates were first pushed up sharply after the effective devaluation of the Finnish markka, the bank sector had fallen by 30 per cent. Yesterday the sector improved by more than 12 per cent. Crisis measures to reduce the growing budget deficit, announced by the minority centre-right government and opposition Social Democrats on September 20, have done nothing to improve confidence. The market remains preoccupied by international and domestic concerns. The single most depressing influence is the level of the central bank's marginal overnight lending rate which looks set to remain at high levels for some time. The rate climbed as high as 500 per cent last month as part of a determined (and so far successful) government effort to stave off devaluation. Yesterday it was reduced to 24 per cent from 40 per cent after a series of new measures to calm the markets was announced. One important effect of such high rates has been to make high-yielding fixed-rate securities seem much more attractive and less risky than equity investments. In recent days, the glum mood has been exacerbated by pessimism about when the domestic business cycle will turn up. Two of the leading banks, Svenska Handelsbanken and S-E Banken, have predicted that Swedish gross national product will fall again in 1993, making it the third consecutive year of decline. The corporate sector has also been making gloomier predictions about the earnings outlook. 'There is increasing concern about the overall business cycle, and worries that 1993 is going to be a tougher year than companies and investors had been expecting,' says Mr Johan Strandberg, an analyst with the Stockholm-based Haeggloef and Ponsbach securities house. There was still no sign of an upturn in either banking or construction until yesterday. The government has promised to put a safety net under the banking sector, although details are not yet clear. Meanwhile, the market is taking its cue from developments in the financial arena, such as the bankruptcy of the Swedish holding company Gota, the owner of Gota Bank. A market revival might be more in prospect if international events were more encouraging. But sluggish economic growth, high interest rates in Germany, problems in other Scandanavian economies and volatile currency markets have not helped. mood. Given this uncertainty both at home and abroad, few analysts will make firm predictions about where the market is heading. At the same time, the outside world is still a little hesitant about the tenacity of Sweden in pursuing its current economy policy and worries about a possible devaluation have not subsided completely. Although there is a broad political consensus behind the measures the government is taking to restore confidence in the krona, many will want to see them implemented, and interest rates down, before they are confident enough to become significant buyers of equities again.</p>

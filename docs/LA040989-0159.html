			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: "SURELY YOU'RE JOKING, MR. FEYNMAN!" ADVENTURES OF A  CURIOUS CHARACTER BY RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, AS TOLD TO RALPH LEIGHTON; EDITED BY  EDWARD HUTCHINGS (BANTAM BOOKS: $8.95)  </P> <P> When Richard P. Feynman, the late, world-renowned physicist with a passion for  puzzle-solving and for making mischief, received the call at 4 in the morning  telling him that he had won the 1965 Nobel Prize for physics, his reaction was  to say, "Yeah, but I'm sleeping !" By the fifth or sixth call he told the  reporter from Time magazine, "I don't know how to get out of this thing. Maybe  I won't accept the prize." But the combustible curmudgeon eventually relented.  </P> <P> In "Surely You're Joking," Feynman tells stories of his childhood in Far  Rockaway, of his studies at MIT and Princeton, of his experience on the  Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, of his work as professor at Cornell and  Caltech and of his research in theoretical physics.  </P> <P> Feynman's indefatigable enthusiasm for solving puzzles, whether deciphering  Mayan hieroglyphics, cracking high-security safes in Los Alamos or solving the  mystery of liquid helium is consistently and utterly infectious.  </P></p>

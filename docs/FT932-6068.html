			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: The art of keeping up appearances - Wealth is determined more by image than reality NAIM ATTALLAH is wealthy. He must be. He is managing director of Asprey, jeweller to the vieux riche. He supports out of his own pocket various worthy but financially challenged ventures such as Quartet Publishing, and The Literary Review. But when, many years ago, Attallah arrived in Britain as a near-penniless Palestinian, few would have given much for his attaining wealth and influence. Then, even more than now, the English financial establishment was a closed community. But young Naim knew what to do. With his few pounds he hired a Rolls-Royce to take him around the City of London. People were impressed. A Palestinian driven in a Rolls-Royce was clearly a man of substance: who knew what Arab connections he might have? Attallah has never looked back. Of course, he could not have succeeded by surface charm alone. By all accounts he has a brilliant head for figures, the sort of man who can make a killing on the foreign exchanges without recourse to a calculator. But his story illustrates a point that has become more potent over the years: that our understanding of wealth is determined more by appearances than reality. In the old days it was not so. A man was wealthy if he had land, thousands of acres of it. It was probably inherited. At any rate it was not borrowed. If anything it was lent to tenants and others less fortunate. But now anyone of vigour, by careful wooing of banks with a strange urge to gamble, can acquire almost overnight the trappings of old money. Of course, the bankers know that those Landseers, those grouse moors, are theirs. But the public sees the borrower as the source of wealth and it is in the banks' interest not to shatter the image. These illusions of wealth have been greatly aided by the sudden proliferation of magazines purporting to list the wealthiest businessmen, with their supposititious net worth neatly printed - usually it is a nice round number - next to their shiny happy faces. The most famous in Britain is carried out by Philip Beresford, for the Sunday Times Magazine. Last year's list had the additional information, culled from US sources, that the Reichmanns were the fifth richest family in the world, alongside the Saudi royal family. When the list was published, it was already painfully clear to the Reichmanns' myriad bankers that the Canadian property dealers' net worth was substantial only as a negative quantity. They were that great invention of 20th century financial engineering, minus billionaires. In the previous year's list, Captain Robert Maxwell was up there near the very top, at a time when, as we now know, his fortune had totally collapsed. Subsequently, with disarming honesty, Philip Beresford wrote in the Sunday Times: 'We didn't take Mr Maxwell's debts into account.' This was rather like assessing the pros and cons of Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism without taking into account unemployment. But one must sympathise with the compilers of such lists. It is far easier to see a man's assets than his debts; indeed, the indebted rely on this little secret. Only the most rash and egotistical actually admit it, as Australia's Alan Bond did in the late 1980s when he stated: 'A man's wealth is measured by how much he can borrow.' But even with those who are genuinely rich, the attempt to express their wealth in a single number is fatuous. Money is only a measurement of value, and value is akin to mercury, an elusive, volatile substance which makes us look foolish when we try to capture it. It measures us, rather than the other way round. J Paul Getty understood this. Indeed, he sprang to public prominence in 1957 only because he was named as the richest man in the world in the very first such list, compiled by Fortune magazine. According to one of Getty's biographers: 'When he heard about the Fortune article Getty told his brother-in-law, Ware Lynch: 'I don't know how much money I have. I don't know how they would know'.' Exactly. It is the mystery of value. Ask any expert. Ask Attallah. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Allied Signal earnings ahead 15% Allied Signal, the diversified US manufacturer, reported record third-quarter earnings of Dollars 189m, an increase of 15 per cent. Sales rose by 11 per cent, the first double-figure increase in six and a half years. The company, which has gone through a lengthy period of retrenchment, said this confirmed its return to growth. Net earnings in the aerospace division, which makes aircraft engines, components and flight systems, were up 14 per cent to Dollars 64m on sales up less than 1 per cent. The company said this was the first quarterly increase in aerospace sales in over three years. Net of acquisitions, sales were slightly down. Profits in the automotive division, which makes car and truck components, were up 19 per cent to Dollars 56m on a 13 per cent increase in sales. This reflected strong sales of cars and trucks in North America and continued economic recovery in Europe, the company said. The engineered materials division, which makes a range of products from carpet fibres to engineering plastics, produced a 25 per cent rise in earnings to Dollars 84m on sales up 24 per cent. Operating margins rose from 8.0 per cent to 9.1 per cent. Mr Lawrence Bossidy, chairman, had set a target of 9 per cent for the year as a whole. The target for next year was now 10 per cent, he said yesterday. Productivity for the first nine months rose by 5.9 per cent, just short of Mr Bossidy's target of 6 per cent annually.</p>

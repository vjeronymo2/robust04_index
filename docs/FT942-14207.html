			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / People: 'Great survivor' steps down from Clyde Colin Phipps, who is stepping down as chairman of Clyde Petroleum after more than a decade at the helm, only went in to Britain's North Sea oil industry in the 1960s as a temporary measure. In the event he has turned out to be one of the great survivors among the bosses of the small independent oil companies spawned by the discovery of North Sea oil. Having trained as a geologist - he did his doctorate on the geology of the Malvern Hills - Phipps's early career was spent overseas with Shell. But he always hankered after politics and after returning home took a job as an oil industry consultant while he looked for a parliamentary seat. He eventually got into Parliament in 1974 as Labour MP for Dudley West. But by then he had founded Clyde Petroleum and soon fell out of step with the old Labour party. Having lost his seat in the 1979 election he helped found the Social Democratic party in 1980 and stood as an unsuccessful SDP candidate in the 1983 and 1987 elections. Although Clyde's market capitalisation is less than Pounds 150m, Phipps bows out of a company which has grown into the UK's fifth biggest oil independent and is producing a record amount of oil. Phipps' only sadness is that he is retiring at a time 'when the industry is in severe trouble because of low oil prices'. He notes that the membership of Brindex, the trade body for the small oil independents, is less than half what it was when he was chairman in 1984. Phipps is one of the last of the entrepreneurs who were in at the beginning of the North Sea oil boom. Several, such as Tricentrol's James Longcroft, Jack Pierce of Ranger Oil and John Leonard of Carless Capel Leonard, have died. Phipps could have soldiered on till in his 70s like Premier Consolidated's Roland Shaw. But he always said that he would follow Shell's retirement rule and go at 60. 'If you stay too long, it plays havoc with management succession,' says Phipps, who turns 60 on July 23. That is the date he hands over the chairmanship to his chief executive, Malcolm Gourlay, 51, who has also been with Clyde from the start. Ex-BP man Roy Franklin, 40, who joined in 1991, will become group managing director.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Personal pension plan sales tail off THE NUMBER of individuals starting personal pension plans is tapering off, with most growth in the sector stemming from people topping up existing plans, the Association of British Insurers said yesterday, Norma Cohen writes. The association unveiled its second-quarter figures for new business, showing that sales remained buoyant overall, although the pace of increase was slowing. The value of Department of Social Security rebates payable to holders of personal pension plans fell by 44 per cent in the quarter. Mr Mike Jones, association chief executive, said: 'This means that most of the people who are eligible for rebates have already used them.' Individuals topping up existing plans will not be able to take advantages of tax incentives on personal pensions. New single premium business rose 27 per cent in the second quarter with Pounds 1.45bn sold. Annual premium business, however, fell by 10 per cent with only Pounds 304m sold. Meanwhile, single premium life insurance business recorded a 28 per cent rise in the second quarter, while new annual premium business fell by 10 per cent.</p>

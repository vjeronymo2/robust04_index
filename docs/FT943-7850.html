			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dramatic turnround at Saab-Scania Saab-Scania, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group controlled by the Wallenberg family, yesterday announced a dramatic surge in earnings in the first half of the year. It posted a pre-tax profit, after financial items, of SKr1.2bn (Dollars 153.8m) after a pro-forma loss of SKr264m in the same period last year, writes Hugh Carnegy. The group said it expected earnings in the second half to be even stronger than in the first, when a leap in sales and earnings in its Scania truck division was the driving force. A return to profit at half-owned Saab Automobile will not be included until the full-year report. The results will prove encouraging to Investor, the Wallenberg holding company which took over 100 per cent of Saab-Scania in 1991 as a cash generator, but then saw its earnings subside. Investor is due to report its half-year results next week. Saab-Scania's results, which restated last year's figures to reflect accounting changes, showed that group sales rose to SKr14.46bn in the first half, from SKr11.91bn last time. Operating income before depreciation jumped to SKr2.14bn from SKr699m. Sales in the Scania division, which includes the truck operations, rose to SKr12.37bn from SKr9.26bn, as demand for trucks in western Europe grew by 10 per cent. In Brazil, the growth figure was 25 per cent and in Argentina it was no less than 80 per cent. Orders in the first half rose 50 per cent to 18,600 trucks and buses from 12,300. Operating profits for the division soared to SKr1.6bn from SKr173m. The picture was, however, less encouraging in the Aircraft and Defence division. Sales at Saab Defence, which include the new JAS 39 Gripen all-purpose fighter aircraft, fell to SKr1.56bn from SKr1.73bn. Sales in Saab Aircraft, which include the Saab 340 and Saab 2000 regional airliners, tumbled to SKr486m from SKr1.05bn. Overall, sales in the Aircraft and Defence division fell to SKr2.09bn from SKr2.64bn, and there was an operating loss of SKr200m compared with a loss of SKr156m in the same period last year.</p>

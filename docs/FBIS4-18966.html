			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Atay Ahmet Rasit, Turkish Cypriot </F> foreign minister, during a roundtable conference on Cyprus,  organized by KIBRIS in Nicosia; date not given]    [Text]  <H5>  Package of Confidence-Building Measures Must Provide Equal </H5> Benefits    First, I wish to explain the developments related to the  package of confidence-building measures [CBM's] in chronological  order and then outline the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus] Government's approach. It is common knowledge that the  CBM's package, mainly the question of the resettlement of Maras  [Varosha] and the reopening of Nicosia International Airport to  passenger and cargo traffic, has been the priority issue on the  UN representatives' agenda for some time. The list of CBM's  that the UN Secretariat submitted to the two sides in Cyprus in  1993 contains 12 other measures in addition to those on Maras  and Nicosia International Airport, measures which call, among  other things, for cooperation to improve water resources, equal  use of foreign aid by the two sides, and cooperation to improve  health services and the protection of the environment.    The introduction of the CBM's package brought to light  various shortcomings in the effort that was required to realize  it. A group of UN experts studied the situation in Maras and  Nicosia International Airport and drew up reports to remove the  shortcomings. Their reports clarified to a certain extent the  benefits the two sides stand to gain from the opening of Maras  and Nicosia International Airport. Although their reports  failed to fully satisfy the technical questions the Turkish  Cypriot side had put to the UN Secretariat earlier, it is a  clear fact that they should have been regarded as an important  resource for the effort that was made for a reconciliation  between the two sides on the matter. However, it is common  knowledge that the Greek Cypriot side said that the reports are  not binding on them in any way and that they refuse to agree to  have them either added to the CBM's package or converted into  official UN documents.    Obviously, the Greek Cypriot side's approach has had a  negative impact on the effort made to clarify administrative,  political, and technical matters related to the implementation  of the package.  <H5>  We Agree in Principle To Maintain the Talks </H5>   The Turkish Cypriot side informed the UN secretary general  some time ago that it agreed in principle to hold talks on Maras  and Nicosia International Airport. In his letter to the sides  dated 3 February 1994, the UN secretary general welcomed their  decision to agree in principle to discuss the package and called  for the commencement of talks to prepare the modalities  [previous word in English] required for the implementation of  the measures. The points the UN secretary general urged the  sides to keep in mind during that process are as follows:    1. Neither of the sides will move with the intention of  establishing political advantage over the other.    2. The sides will remain committed to the stipulations of  the package.    3. Initiatives that may obstruct the realization of the  package will be avoided.    4. The package will not be regarded as a substitute for a  comprehensive agreement.    Consequently, the two sides moved to hold talks on the  modalities. A seven-point list of provisions was drawn up  during the contacts the UN officials held with the two sides  early in February. The list would later be regarded as the  agenda of the indirect talks. It was related to matters such as  the UN administration in Maras and travel to and from that area,  the timing of the transfer of Maras to UN officials and the  reopening of Nicosia International Airport, conversion of Maras  into a special trade and contact area, establishment of rights  related to flights to and from Nicosia International Airport,  establishment of security for operations in that airport, entry  and exit of passengers and cargo, and the implementation of the  other UN measures.    As I briefly mentioned earlier, the other CBM's were  outlined  in 12 points, that is, other than those related to Maras and  Nicosia International Airport.    The objective of the indirect talks, which were initiated by  Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative, on  17 February, was to have the two sides agree on the way the  CBM's package should be realized. It will be recalled that the  UN secretary general submitted a report to the UN Security  Council informing it that the positions of the two sides were  established through the contacts that were made with them from  January to March and that the UN representatives would make  suggestions to them for the implementation of the items on the  agenda of the talks. Acting in accordance with the UN secretary  general's report, Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's  assistant special envoy, submitted draft suggestions and a  paper, which was described as a non-document, on 9 and 21 March.    The assessment that was made of the documents revealed that  the reports that were drawn up by the UN experts on Maras and  Nicosia International Airport were not regarded as a resource as  a result of the Greek Cypriot side's pressure, a deviation was  made from the essence of the original CBM's package to satisfy  Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot  side, a deviation in the form of additions to the CBM's package,  and various elements in the original package were overlooked.  For example, the gains referred to in Paragraph 44 in the UN  secretary general's report, dated 1 July 1993, were not included  in the non-document. That showed that the reference that was  made to them was merely words. While elements were introduced  to satisfy Mr. Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot side, only a  number of superficial promises were made on the question of the  registration of the Turkish Cypriot side's economic gains and  evident rights. Meanwhile, it was observed that even those  promises were conditional.    That development created a new situation which failed to  satisfy the criteria on equality and simultaneous benefits, on  which the Turkish Cypriot side has maintained a sensitive  approach right from the beginning. Obviously, the inclusion of  additional elements within the framework of the talks in order  to satisfy the Greek Cypriot side will create a difficult  situation in the negotiations process. The Turkish Cypriot side  cannot be held responsible for the present situation because the  Greek Cypriot side has indicated that it regards the CBM's  package as a process on Maras.    As a gesture of goodwill, President Denktas submitted a new  document to Gustave Feissel to prevent a deadlock in the talks  and explain the Turkish Cypriot side's stand on the matter a few  days ago. His document guaranteed that the Greek Cypriots would  be able to safely enter and leave Maras freely and without  formality or restrictions.    The Turkish Cypriot side maintains a sensitive stand on the  equal benefits and opportunities the CBM's package will provide  for the two sides. That the gains of the Turkish Cypriot side  should be equal to those of the Greek Cypriot side, that they  should be simultaneous, tangible, and durable, and that they  should be concrete and guaranteed is essential. However, the  changes that were effected in the package with a view to  pleasing the Greek Cypriots have upset the parameters of that  package both from the point of view of its contents and from the  point of view of its presentation.    Regarding the Turkish Cypriot side's gains, a promise was  made to the effect that the necessary arrangements are to be  made particularly on matters related to the airport. However,  the question of the recognition of those gains has been left to  the third countries. Those gains must be effectively guaranteed.  <H5>  The Original Spirit of the Package </H5>   The Turkish Cypriot side has stressed at every opportunity  that it is prepared to discuss the modalities related to the  application of the package, provided that the problems that  conflict with the original spirit of that package and the  promises that have been made to the Turkish Cypriot side are  resolved. We hope that the UN representatives will maintain a  sensitive approach for the successful application of the  agreement that will be reached on the basis of political  equality. We also hope that they will carefully create and  protect the sensitive balances that will enable the package to  satisfy the interests and expectations of the two sides.    Within that framework, briefly recalling the UN secretary  general's report, dated 4 April 1994, will be useful. It  outlined the Turkish Cypriot side's views on the non-documents.  That is a positive aspect in that report, regardless of the  fact that it mentioned the Turkish Cypriot side's views very  briefly. Another positive aspect is the fact that it pointed to  the need for the maintenance of the talks.    A negative aspect of that report is that it failed to  mention  that certain matters that the Turkish Cypriot side cannot accept  have been included in the non-documents, regardless of the fact  that they were not included in the original package. What have  been excluded from and added to the original package constitute  an unacceptable deviation from the promises that were made to  the Turkish Cypriot side.    I believe that reiterating the following will be useful: The  Turkish Cypriot side is prepared to hold talks on a package that  will comply with the original text, spirit, and structure of the  CBM's package and with the basic principles and concepts in the  UN secretary general's reports. The Turkish Cypriot side is  also prepared to submit the final agreement that will be  achieved after a positive result is attained through the talks  to the approval of the TRNC Republican Assembly and the Turkish  Cypriot people.</p>

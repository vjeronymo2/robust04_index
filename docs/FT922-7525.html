			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Bangkok declares state of emergency THAILAND'S government declared a state of emergency in the capital, Bangkok, and four surrounding provinces last night in the midst of the largest and most violent anti-government demonstration since the 1970s. At 4.30am local time today, gunfire was heard as troops advanced past burning vehicles in an attempt to scatter groups of demonstrators in the city centre. In one street, demonstrators pushed a blazing fire engine into a shop front while others carried their injured comrades through the streets. Dozens of protesters were injured in the clashes which began with thousands of young demonstrators hurling stones and bottles and demanding the resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister. They routed police and troops who had attempted to block an opposition march to his office at Government House and ignored pleas for calm from the organisers. They attacked police barricades and smashed police cars. Several policemen were hurt by flying glass and police retaliated with water cannon and baton charges. Unconfirmed reports said that at least one person had been shot dead. Gen Suchinda's government reacted by establishing a council of military leaders and police to enforce the state of emergency, banning gatherings of more than 10 people, closing schools for three days and preventing the media from publishing anything 'detrimental to law and order'. An official announcement on television accused Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist opposition leader, of inciting the marchers and trying to lead them to the palace of the country's revered king. Mr Chamlong and other organisers of the march had, in fact, urged the crowd not to attack the security forces. Mr Chamlong said after the state of emergency was declared that he was ready to be arrested. He said the violence was the work of 'third hands' not connected with the democracy movement. Earlier he told the rally: 'We're here to fight dictatorship. Suchinda must resign.' The clashes followed the latest in a series of peaceful pro-democracy rallies in the aftermath of a general election in March. Gen Suchinda, the former armed forces chief, took office at the head of a coalition of parties sympathetic to the military in spite of opposition demands that the prime minister be an elected member of parliament. Tension had increased over the that the coalition was backtracking on a deal to push through constitutional amendments. Middle-class residents of Bangkok have grown increasingly frustrated with continual military intervention in politics and business. The latest of 18 coups since the absolute monarchy ended in 1932 was arranged by Gen Suchinda last year on the grounds that the elected government was too corrupt. Gen Suchinda and his coalition supporters, however, went on to include several ministers accused of corruption in their new government.</p>

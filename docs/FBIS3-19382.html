			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 15 (AFP) -- France Tuesday [15 March]  welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to extend a  moratorium on nuclear tests until September 1995, a spokesman  for President Francois Mitterrand said.    The "decision by the U.S. President is one of the  consequences of our own decision (to extend a moratorium on  French testing)," the spokesman said. "We are happy to see that  this decision is confirmed."    "All this moves in a desirable direction at a time when we  are preparing to discuss the extension of the nuclear  non-proliferation treaty in 1995 and when we have begun talks in  Geneva on banning nuclear weapons," the source said.    The current U.S. moratorium was to run out at the end of  this  September.</p>

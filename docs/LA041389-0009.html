			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> IT'S AN ISSUE OF RIGHT AND WRONG  </P> <P> Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice and a philosopher of  the pro-choice movement, says that the language of women's rights, so obvious  and potent to these marchers (Mind Your Own Uterus), means something else to  the middle Americans of the late '80s: selfishness. The talk about the "right"  to abortion should turn to talk about the "need" for abortion.  </P> <P> Kissling also utters words that are taboo among some of her colleagues. "Some  abortions are indeed immoral," she says. Abortion for gender selection is one  clear example. Pro-choicers shouldn't be afraid to raise these moral issues. "I  accept abortion on every level," says Kissling, "but I still firmly believe it  would be better if women did not become pregnant when they were not prepared to  create life."  </P> <P> Those who believe deeply in the need to keep abortion safe and legal must  present their position as both caring and responsible. Responsible means that  pro-choice advocates "have to stop making excuses for women who won't use birth  control."  </P> <P> It is difficult to admit ambiguity in the face of the militant certainty of the  anti-abortionists. It is hard to expand a traditional and honorable vocabulary  of "rights" into a wider discussion of "needs." But by expressing their own  values and their understanding of ambiguity, those who support legal abortion  may well increase their standing in the eyes of the ambivalent many.  </P></p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Skills and training 'key to security' ANY workable model for full employment has to embrace the realities of Britain's increasingly flexible labour market, according to Full Employment UK, the employment think tank. In its tough submission to the Commons employment committee's inquiry on full employment it says: 'It is becoming increasingly apparent that the familiar notions of a 'job for life' and 'employment security' are outmoded. Real security lies . . . in the acquisition of skills and training.' While other submissions have concentrated on macro-economic stimulus or employment subsidies, Full Employment UK strongly advocates working with the grain of recent labour market trends. Labour market flexibility, the submission states, is bringing obvious advantages to the economy in the improved price competitiveness of UK goods and services. But, it adds, there is a disadvantage of 'widespread job insecurity'. Arguing for 'security of employability', as opposed to security of employment with a particular company, Full Employment UK says that the government must back 'supported flexibility'. That means the state must underpin the workings of an increasingly flexible labour market by supporting people with 'individual-centred' provision. People need assistance to develop 'personal financial and self-investment' strategies to overcome the irregularities in income forced on them by flexible employment, and to facilitate 'portfolio working' - juggling several part-time jobs at once. Support outside the labour market is required in the form of a work-based safety net to 'outlaw long-term unemployment' and guarantee individuals temporary work experience with the state accepting responsibility as 'employer of last resort'. The think tank urges the government to popularise the message of lifetime learning with 'individual learning accounts'. These accounts would help individuals to pay for their learning by instalments and share the costs with their employer or the government. The aim should be that within the next five years every adult should have their own individual learning account.</p>

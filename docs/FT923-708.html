			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee perks up on pact optimism THE COFFEE market moved ahead sharply on Monday as delegates to the International Coffee Organisation gathered in London for a crucial two weeks of talks about a new international pact. London's November robusta contract broke through resistance at Dollars 800 a tonne to close at Dollars 816, up Dollars 40 on the day. Dealers cited French trade house buying and the breach of Dollars 800 which pointed to chart-inspired gains. New York arabica prices also advanced on Monday, partly on optimism about the ICO talks. Throughout this week negotiations appear to have gone sufficiently well to attract the attention of the markets, which have got into the habit of expecting no progress at ICO meetings. Delegates took a big step forward in agreeing on the definition of the 'universal quota' - the foundation of any future pact. They agreed that exporting members would send their coffee to all destinations 'without distinction between importing member and non-member countries.' This would eliminate consumer fears that a two-tier market could re-emerge, with producers selling surplus coffee cheaply to consumers outside the ICO. The problems of regulating such a quota system have now become the focus of the negotiations. While traders and analysts generally concede that this week's talks have been positive, they are highly sceptical that an agreement will emerge next week. 'They are making progress, But there are still huge stumbling blocks,' said one trader. Their feelings were echoed on Thursday by Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, who said in Washington that he was sceptical that any agreement could succeed in reviving the depressed coffee markets. He blamed the 50 per cent fall in prices since the ICO pact collapsed in 1989 on a fundamental imbalance between supply and demand. His remarks certainly helped to dampen market sentiment, and the London November contract fell back below Dollars 800. Yesterday it closed at Dollars 804 tonne, up Dollars 6 on the day and Dollars 28 on the week. The strength of the dollar and an increase in warehouse stocks of all metals on Tuesday helped to keep the lid firmly on London Metal Exchange prices. The apparent fading of the nine-month squeeze on the zinc market suggested that the market was experiencing a 'return to reality', one analyst said. In heavy trading on Wednesday zinc moved into contango, where the price of metal for immediate delivery is at a discount to the three-month price. At the end of the day cash zinc was Dollars 5 a tonne cheaper than three-month at Dollars 1,320.50. Earlier this month the squeeze took three-month zinc to Dollars 1,398 a tonne, the highest level for 22 months. 'It would take a massive investment (by those behind the squeeze) to get the market up there again,' said Ms Lesley Campbell, trader at Rudolf Wolff, the metals broker. However, other analysts felt the squeeze could reappear before the year end. On Thursday the market moved into backwardation again and yesterday cash zinc closed Dollars 47 down on the week at Dollars 1,335 a tonne, Dollars 6 ahead of three-month metal. Behind the squeeze are thought to be a small number of producers and one trader with control over about 1m tonnes of annual refined zinc - between 15 and 20 per cent of western world production. The physical market is likely to be oversupplied by 100,000 tonnes this year and 150,000 tonnes next year, according to Mr Graham Deller, of Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services. 'There is no shortage of metal so the price should continue to fall until producers cut back.' Cominco - one of the world's biggest zinc producers - said this week it was seeking tax cuts to secure the future of the Trail smelter in British Columbia. The smelter, which has reported operating losses of CDollars 98m over the last two years, produced last year 242,000 tonnes (about 5 per cent of western production). Gold has tried again this week to move above Dollars 350 a troy ounce, spurred on by rumours on Tuesday of a realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and by the dollar's weakness against the yen on Wednesday. But any movement near Dollars 350 continues to attract producer selling. Gold closed in London yesterday at Dollars 349.35, down Dollars 2.65 on the week. In contrast, platinum has moved ahead, lifted by the rise in the New York futures market, where speculation on improved demand in Japan has emerged on the performance of the Nikkei stock index.  ---------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  ---------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium   -3,200  to  1,366,150 Copper      +1,375  to    288,225 Lead        +4,700  to    165,075 Nickel        +378  to     45,612 Zinc        +2,525  to    357,975 Tin            -30  to     14,960  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / MPs attack 'Pounds 100m fees' over Maxwell collapse FEES LEVIED by accountants, lawyers and financial advisers working on the Maxwell collapse could exceed Pounds 100m, a committee of MPs will suggest today. The Commons social security committee is expected to use a report on the Maxwell pensioners to criticise the fees being charged by advisers and the slow progress in retrieving funds on the pensioners' behalf. Total fees charged have already exceeded Pounds 50m, the report will indicate. According to Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover and a committee member, MPs expressed concern about fees and difficulties in tracing ownership of missing pension-fund assets while hearing evidence. Goldman Sachs, the US bank which dealt extensively for Robert Maxwell's family and its companies, may be criticised. It emerged last week that the bank had been asked to pay up to Pounds 56m to two pension schemes formerly controlled by Maxwell. The requests relate to transactions in 1990 in which Goldman acted as purchaser for shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation from the Mirror Group Pension Scheme and the Maxwell Communication Corporation Staff Scheme. In May, the committee was told that two City investment banks were blocking efforts by liquidators of the Maxwell pension fund management company to trace the ownership of nearly Pounds 130m in missing assets.</p>

On Tuesday  [22 March] Turkish Government officials complained that  unsuccessful attempts at provocation by German journalists in  the provinces of unrest in the country's east and southeast,  which are mainly inhabited by Kurds, have been registered "with  great regret." According to their own statements, the Germans  want to observe the local elections and the Nevruz celebrations  on Sunday.    According to diplomatic circles in Ankara, the 17 members of  a Hamburg group in Batman, in southeastern Turkey, accompanied  their interpreter to the police station out of solidarity, and  returned to their hotel on Monday evening. The interpreter is  no longer in police custody either.    Diplomats in the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the German  groups should know that Workers Party of Kurdistan leader  Abdullah Ocalan "is no longer taken seriously by his Kurdish  fellow-citizens." Furthermore, it was said that the Germans who  want to "experience" the local elections on Sunday after the  Nevruz celebrations are considered "tourists" rather than  "observers."</p>

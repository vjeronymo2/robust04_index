The commitment was reiterated today by Luigi Amaduzzi,  diplomatic advisor to Italian Head of State Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro, in a reply to a letter received on the occasion of the  45th anniversary of the Human Rights Charter, from the president  of the Italy-Kuwait Association, Pierandrea Vanni. The  association's letter sought to bring to the attention of the  head of state the problem of around 800 Kuwaiti prisoners still  held illegally in Iraqi territory despite the fact the war in  the area is over.    The Italian government has closely followed the evolution of  this "tragic inheritance" of the Gulf War and has worked, in all  opportune forums, to find a solution to the problem, according  to Amaduzzi in his reply. He went on to say that Iraqi  officials must understand the compelling need to respect basic  human rights.    The Italy-Kuwait Association was formed in Florence two  years  ago.</p>

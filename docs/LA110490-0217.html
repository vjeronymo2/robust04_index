			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERN POLITICS, CALIFORNIA-STYLE: I MAY BE NEW AT THIS, BUT I DON'T LIKE IT  </P> <P> At the ripe old age of 22, I have joined the legions of voters who are  apathetic about this election. My disillusionment stems from the sterility of  modern politics. In their quest for election or reelection, politicians are  telling us what they think we want to hear.  </P> <P> Our elected officials are afraid to make the difficult choices inherent in  governing, because one unpopular decision of importance may lead to defeat in  the next election. Because they play it safe, politicians have divorced  themselves from their purpose: the responsibility of leading the people.  </P> <P> The gubernatorial race exemplifies modern politics, California-style. Although  Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson may differ on some issues, the tenor of their  campaigns is shockingly similar. Each has made a great effort to demonstrate  that he or she is "tough, but caring" and the candidate for "change" --  apparently the current prerequisites for election. Both pledge to fight crime  and drugs, provide more expansive health care, clean up the environment,  support education and keep taxes low.  </P> <P> All these objectives are commendable, but they are impossible to achieve  simultaneously. It requires money to build new prisons, help the sick and  injured, reduce smog-forming emissions and attract the best teachers.  </P> <P> If we tripled our taxes, we might have enough money to fulfill all of these  goals. But nobody wants that. As a result, the candidates have declined to  state most of the specifics in their plans.  </P> <P> Feinstein and Wilson know that any definitive statement of their vision will be  attacked for either its limitations or exorbitant expense. They persist in  describing a fantasy, rather than telling us the truth.  </P> <P> Because of the lack of specificity in their campaigns, the candidates have left  us with a difficult choice -- a more cynical observer might say no choice.  </P> <P> Both were moderately successful mayors of large California cities. As a  senator, Wilson has been described as the most anonymous figure in U.S.  politics. It is unclear what he represents. Feinstein has a similar image  problem. During the campaign both have labored much harder to label one another  than to reveal themselves.  </P> <P> The propositions demonstrate a related problem. The initiative process enables  the Legislature to shift the burden for making difficult decisions from  lawmakers to voters. We entrust the power of legislation to the Senate and the  Assembly, and we pay them for that purpose.  </P> <P> Yet they require us to wade through 221 pages of material containing the 28  propositions and the explanations. Few people, much less we first- or  second-time voters, have the sophistication and patience to do so. Thus, some  of our most important legislative choices hinge on which side creates better  television advertisement.  </P> <P> Consequently, the initiative process often leads to disastrous results. For  example, the "environmental" initiatives might clog our courtrooms for years.  If Proposition 128 ("Big Green") or Proposition 130 pass, opponents will  challenge many of their provisions.  </P> <P> Worse yet, they conflict with Propositions 135 and 138. If all four initiatives  pass, state judges may never resolve the mess. As a law student, I should be  happy with the initiative process, because it virtually guarantees me and my  classmates jobs when we graduate. But as a citizen, I am infuriated with the  whole system.  </P> <P> Regardless of the results of this election, the prospects for measurable  constructive change appear dim. Neither gubernatorial candidate appears to  possess the capacity necessary to tackle the tremendous concerns we will face  for the rest of the decade. Similarly, the Legislature seems willing to pass  the buck.  </P> <P> Leadership does not require rhetoric as much as the ability to make the right  decisions under trying circumstances. For the system to change, we must  encourage people to enter office who will speak the whole truth and adopt an  unpopular position when it is necessary.  </P> <P> For the last three years, I have been a volunteer adviser for the California  YMCA Model Legislature/Court program. Each February, the program brings 1,000  high-school students to Sacramento to debate bills in the Senate and Assembly  chambers.  </P> <P> During the last conference, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown spoke to  the student delegates. He delivered the usual inspirational speech, encouraging  students to pursue careers in public service. One of his chief points was that  our government needs fresh blood. He said most politicians have lost the  capacity to deal with the tremendous problems facing California. He said the  concern with reelection has become so consuming for most politicians that it  has stifled their initiative.  </P> <P> The sad thing, Mr. Speaker, is that you do not know how right you are.  </P></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Payout omitted as Thyssen slides to DM994m loss Thyssen, the German steel and engineering group, incurred a loss of DM994m (Dollars 391.3m) for the year ended September, against a profit of DM350m the previous year. As a result, it will not pay a dividend. In 1991-92, shareholders received a payment of DM6 a share. The company said all non-steel divisions experienced a decline in sales and profits, with the exception of the US Budd subsidiary, which makes automotive parts. The steel divisions suffered massive, undisclosed losses. Although operational results improved in the second half of the year, earnings were swallowed by extraordinary expenses for the restructuring of the steel divisions, Thyssen said. Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive, launched a bitter attack against remaining state subsidies for European steelmakers, saying such hand-outs were threatening the survival of German private steel companies. 'We cannot afford a steel industry when politicians in Bonn and Brussels are unwilling to create fair competition,' he said. He was referring to German government support for Ekostahl, a loss-making east German steel mill, and to the failure of the European Commission to reach an agreement on reducing state subsidies for steel. Sales at Thyssen Stahl, representing a third of group turnover, fell 15 per cent to DM10.6bn. The group spent DM400m this year on restructuring Thyssen Stahl, including 15,000 job cuts between October 1992 and October 1994. Talks are also continuing between Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's second-largest steelmaker, on the possibility of merging special steel activities, including tin plates, non-corrosive steels and sheets for the electrical industry. Members of the board of both companies are due to meet on December 16 to discuss proposals ranging from managerial co-operation to full mergers. Thyssen warned, however, that such talks had been held in the past without yielding concrete results. Among the non-steel divisions, Thyssen Industrie, capital and manufacturing goods, recorded a 7 per cent drop in sales to DM8.1bn. Sales in the trading and services divisions were DM14.1bn, down 2 per cent. Thyssen said that despite the slowdown in economic activity, a 'declining but satisfactory profit' was recorded in this division.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Motoring: Peugeot's sedan saloon Hatchbacks with load spaces are useful but many feel saloon cars with boots have more style. Yet, Peugeot calls its latest 306 four-door a sedan. I thought low gearing made the poshest two-litre ST model I drove sound fussy at motorway cruising speeds. It was nippy in town, rode with Peugeot's usual shock absorbency, and had exceptional space inside. Prices are from Pounds 11,565 to Pounds 13,850.</p>

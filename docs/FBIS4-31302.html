			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus today met Karl  Lamers, foreign policy spokesman of the Christian Democratic  Union-Christian Social Union [CDU-CSU] Bundestag group. The  main topic of their conversation was the situation in Europe and  bilateral relations. This is what the prime minister told  journalists after the talks, when commenting on these relations:    [Begin Klaus recording] Indeed, I do not understand the  calls  for a dialogue with a capital D, because I think that the  Czech-German dialogue has been continuing on a daily basis and  that it is being carried out every day. [sentence as heard] In  the course of this dialogue, we explain specific matters to each  other. I reject the claim that there is any kind of  discontinuity. I reject the idea that up until now we have not  talked to each other and that a D-Day will come when we will  draw a new line and say: Czech-German dialogue is starting as of  this moment. That is a fiction being created by individuals on  both sides, regrettably, and I think that this kind of  discontinuity does not exist. [passage omitted] [end recording]    [Announcer] Milan Uhde and Jan Kasal, chairman and deputy  chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, met the CDU-CSU Bundestag  foreign policy spokesman, Karl Lamers, in Prague today, too.  They explained to the guest why it was impossible to fulfill  the demand that the Benes Decrees [expelling Sudeten Germans  from Czechoslovakia after World War II and confiscating their  property] be abolished. They explained that raising and  repeating this demand had a negative effect on Czech-German  relations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Lysenko, a deputy of the State Duma and </F> a cochairman of the Republican Party of Russia: "January Is a  Bad Time for Parliaments in Russia (a Pessimist's Forecast)"]    [Text] The beginnings of the new Russian parliament--the  Federal Assembly--do not provide grounds to be particularly  optimistic. Parliamentarism does not transplant well into the  Russian soil, which is so rich in totalitarian tradition. The  Union parliament already has been dissolved "early;" the Russian  Supreme Soviet has been disbanded. January is a jinxed month  anyway: It was in January 1918 that the Bolsheviks disbanded the  first truly democratically elected parliament in Russia--the  Constituent Assembly.    Will the Federal Assembly survive the winter, will it be  "luckier" than its predecessors?    I would like to be wrong, but I am afraid I am not. The new  Russian parliament resembles a miscarried fetus of a tired  country long pregnant by totalitarianism. After the tragic  September-October events, it could hope to survive only if it  grew into a quiet parliament standing ready to approve the  decisions of the president and the government--such as, for  instance, in Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan. This is what President  B.N. Yeltsin hoped for in issuing his Edict No. 1400 on 21  September. He miscalculated, though; the hypnosis of  self-deception played a bad trick on him. The people no longer  believed the promises of the president, the government, and the  ruling bloc; the credit of confidence had run out. For the first  time since 1985, the strength of the opponents of the current  reform exceeded the strength of its supporters. Holding the  course of tough economic reforms in keeping with the  Yeltsin-Gaydar formula came into an irreconcilable conflict with  the ability of pushing them through within the framework of the  new parliament as well.    The main result of the elections is that half of the popular  vote went to pro-communist and national-patriotic forces, who  are even more conservative when it comes to the transformations  under way than their predecessors in the Supreme Soviet had  been; whose modus operandi is rejection; and for whom the crux  of their political position is revanche. These forces are  organically incompatible with the president, with the current  government, and the new Constitution alike. They bear little  resemblance to the right in Hungary or the Czech Republic, or to  the left in Lithuania and Poland, who recently came into power  through parliamentary elections and who observe the commonly  accepted rules of the game. The national-communist opposition in  Russia, which draws on the marginal strata of the society--which  now includes a considerable part of the population--operates on  slogans turned toward yesterday (all power to the soviets; the  restoration of the Russian empire....); for them the parliament  is the same means of achieving their revolutionary (or perhaps  it would be more precise to say counterrevolutionary) goals as  it is for President Yeltsin to see through to the end the  "revolution from above," the revolutionary reform.    In a normal, civilized, stable society, parties of this type  draw on the support of 5-10 percent of the electorate, and as a  rule they remain on the sidelines of the political process. In a  troubled transitional time, however, on a wave of a crisis and  increasing popular discontent over the worsening conditions of  life, disintegration of authority, and the powerlessness of  immature democratic institutions, they get their historic  chance, as happened in Russia in October 1917 or in Germany in  1933.    Russia today has not yet reached a state where various  political parties could replace one another at the helm of power  as a result of elections without creating sharp cataclysms and  destabilization of the situation in the country. Its political  system is still dominated by extremes, and centrist forces are  still very weak. In the environment of the intensifying economic  crisis, this is a clear indicator of an urgent need to shift to  a "managed" democracy or an authoritarian regime. The past three  months of direct presidential rule graphically demonstrated that  the executive branch has increasingly less need for the  legislative one; that, having once tasted the "freedom" from  various checks and balances, it will not want to waste time and  effort on another round of "score-settling" with the new  parliament.    Therefore, one does not have to be a great prophet to see  that it is in the interests of the powers that be to see the  Russian parliament discredited as quickly as  possible--preferably by its own hand. At the same time, it is  necessary to stick to the rules of good behavior: The  parliament's exit from the political arena should not "irritate"  world public opinion, and neither should it produce a real  contender for the president's job in 1996. Now all sorts of  politicians and advisers are racking their brains as to when is  the best time to put into action Article 111 of the new  Constitution (on disbanding the parliament after it rejects  three times the candidacy of a new prime minister proposed by  the president) so as not to leave to the State Duma an  opportunity to make the first step of initiating the impeachment  of the president.    As to the problem of discrediting the State Duma, this is  being taken care of by the leaders of most parliamentary  factions, who are incapable of coming to an agreement on a  single key issue, with the exception of returning the White  House to the parliament. And there is little chance for reaching  such agreement given such a weak center and such strong radical  flanks. It is not accidental that the government bloc, Russia's  Choice, already has refused to participate in negotiations,  holding up its sleeve a trump card--the materials on numerous  violations of election rules--that will be used as soon as the  need arises.    It is obvious that the session of the State Duma will follow  a spontaneous scenario, without aim or direction. In 1990, it  took three days to elect B. Yeltsin the speaker of the Russian  parliament; it is hard even to imagine how long this procedure  will take in 1994, especially keeping in mind that with the  exception of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and  the RKP [Communist Party of Russia], other factions most likely  will not maintain strict discipline in matters of voting. So  while the session will be embroiled for several weeks in  attempts to resolve routine internal issues (the rules, the law  on a deputy status, distribution of portfolios....), the leaders  of the new irreconcilable rightist-leftist opposition will rock  the "foundations" of the presidential power; they will:    --demand a parliament investigation of the 3-4 October  events  and setting up a commission on investigating the circumstances  and the consequences of signing the Belovezha agreements in 1991;    --attempt to annul the results of the referendum on the  Constitution;    --insist on dismissing the cases against GKChP [State  Committee on the State of Emergency] members and the organizers  of the events of September-October 1993;    --propose to repeal president's edicts on land, on the  Ministry of Security, and others;    --express no-confidence in the government under Article  117-3  of the new Constitution;    --call for the restoration of the Constitutional Court in  its  old composition and for this court to render a definitive  judgment on the events of September-October 1993;    --come up with militant statements with respect to countries  of the near and far abroad.    All of this will be happening against a backdrop of  intrafactional score-settling, for most factions consist of  people who are not inclined to march to the same drum and listen  to one leader.    With skillful assistance, the State Duma could be turned  into  a theater of the absurd in a matter of two months. Then later--a  paralysis of the parliamentary, workers' requests, Article 111  of the Constitution, and the disbandment of the State Duma. The  president will continue to rule the country with the help of the  Federation Council--a more complaisant structure which will  convene from time to time to approve presidential decrees. Also  at "the workers' request," the parliament for the time being  will exist as a one-chamber body, and it is well known that  there nothing more permanent in Russia than temporary  institutions.    Everything above is the viewpoint of a skeptic who has spent  three years of his life trying to make the previous Russian  parliament a more civilized body by creating in it a centrist  majority. The failure of these attempts as a result of the  December elections does not make me an optimist again.    But my, how much would I like to be wrong....</p>

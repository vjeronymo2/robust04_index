			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part Five, Last Part" of the report by Deputy Prime </F> Minister Phan Van Khai at the opening of Ninth National  Assembly's Fifth Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in  Hanoi on 26 May -- recorded]    [Text] We must strive to accelerate economic reform in  close association with administrative reform.    To meet the requirements of the new development stage and  the  renovation, it is essential for us to formulate a general plan  to more vigorously accelerate economic reform, while striving to  improve the state management mechanism, especially national  administration.    Given the tasks that have been and are being done, and on  the  basis of the government's 1994 program of action, we must  concentrate efforts to carry out the following tasks to  accelerate our economic and administrative reform:    A. Formulate a plan to fundamentally reform our financial  and  banking system. Regarding the financial sector, we must  establish and apply the new accounting system to suit the market  economy within this year, while accurately presenting our assets  and business activities. We must make greater efforts to ensure  that our accounting system is a reliable inspection tool of our  state and society, while we strive to develop our auditing  system. Efforts must be made to complete draft laws and other  inventories to systematize various principles concerning the  establishment, examination, scrutiny, and approval of the state  budget. We must delegate authority in the allocation of the  state budget and set up a machinery to supervise, inspect, and  control it. It is essential to carry out the program to study  and fundamentally reform the tax collection system to suit the  new stage of economic reform. We must build a new mechanism to  manage assets at various enterprises.    We must formulate a plan to continue reforming the banking  sector and fully establish and delegate authority in  implementing a two-level banking system, namely state banking  and commercial banking. Efforts must be made to gradually  establish the money market by using various essential  apparatuses to regulate the circulation of money, while ensuring  suitable bank interest rates for the market economy. We must  strive to ensure fair foreign exchange rates, develop the  management of foreign currencies, and create a competitive  atmosphere to enhance the efficiency of banking services. We  must also strive to diversify the forms of debt by using the  most modern methods, while ensuring that the bank functions as a  reliable debt settlement center.    Plans for the above tasks are being formulated by the  agencies concerned. These plans are expected to be completed  this year and efforts will be made to amend and supplement them  during their implementation.    B. We must continue to rearrange, improve, and enhance the  efficiency of state enterprises and shift them into the business  environment of the market economy. State enterprises, in making  profits in the market system, should strive to meet public  demands, while competing with other economic establishments in a  healthy manner. These enterprises should set up a separate  state management mechanism to strengthen their operations. We  must issue guidance and implementation documents on these tasks  by this year. We must also strive to complete the second phase  of our debt settlement by this year, while continuing to deal  with enterprises that are still operating at a loss. We must  accelerate the application of the new accounting system in close  association with the effort to improve the financial system of  enterprises to enable them to take real responsibility in  managing financial matters within the framework of the law. We  must strive to limit the business monopoly of state enterprises,  while creating conditions for healthy competition. We must  improve the communications and transport network further this  year. For a number of enterprises that still need to operate in  a monopoly, the state should set up a separate management  mechanism to control them.    The above measures and the efforts to carry out the  financial  and banking reform will create conditions for each enterprise to  effectively renovate itself, while taking appropriate actions to  compete with other establishments in the market. The market  economic system will help determine the efficiency of  enterprises, accelerate and develop various forms of  cooperation, promote the spirit of self-reliance, and create  conditions for the setting up of major business corporations.  In this context, it will gradually help to improve and  fundamentally strengthen various state enterprises, promote the  share-holding system, and clearly define direct ownership of  public assets at state enterprises. It will also help form a  new management mechanism to replace the old administrative  management system at enterprises. From this juncture, we will  be able to establish a state business bloc comprising various  major business corporations to effectively carry out business  activities and truly develop the autonomy of the market system.  The state should formulate a legal framework to guide and  support the implementation of this process to help it develop  along the socialist orientation and in conformity with the law  of the market.    The efforts to carry out pilot projects in the  implementation of state policies to promote the share-holding  system and to eliminate the state managing system at enterprises  are aimed at drawing experiences from realities to correctly  apply them in the market economy.    C. While carrying out the abovementioned two tasks, we will,  at the same time integrate the economic reform with that of the  administration. Administration reform, however, requires  greater efforts because it is closely related to the renovation  of the political system. Moreover, many major and fundamental  issues in the administrative reform stem from the process of  building a law-governed state of Vietnam which we are studying  its contents for submission to the next party Central Committee  plenum to be convened at the end of this year [time as heard].    It is imperative for us to resolve now a number of pressing  issues, to create conditions for developing the relationship  between organizations and state agencies, and to enhance the  efficiency of our administrative system. Efforts must be made  to improve administrative procedures to eliminate inconveniences  experienced by the people and businessmen. The recent  government's resolution on this issue has been warmly welcomed  by the people. Various ministries, government agencies, and  people's committees of provinces and cities are dutybound to  implement this resolution. Heads of responsible agencies must  control and closely supervise the implementation of this  resolution to affect real changes. Criticism by the press,  pressure by public opinion, and action by the people aimed at  improving administrative procedures and inspecting work of state  agencies and personnel are significant factors that will help  accelerate administrative reform. At present, the government is  making great efforts to formulate regulations on civil servants,  conduct a study on public service system, and make preparations  to set up a financial-administrative agency. The government  will complete within this year the draft documents for these  tasks to solicit ideas from various sectors before promulgation.    There are still many issues to be resolved regarding the  relationship between the central and local agencies in a uniform  administrative system. Significant parts of these issues have  been raised in the draft law on the people's councils and  people's committees, the draft law on state budget, and the law  on authority to promulgate legal documents. These issues cannot  be resolved separately, but rather they must be settled on the  basis of the general lines and policies on building a  law-governed state.    The most pressing tasks at present are to restore  disciplines  in the administrative system and resolutely deal with agencies  that deliberately ignore the decisions and directives of the  government and the higher administration echelons. Chiefs of  the the higher administrative agencies must strive to supervise  and control the implementation of key decisions, promptly  commend outstanding officials, and quickly deal with cadres who  violate rules and regulations.    Dear National Assembly deputies, implementing the 1994 tasks  during the past almost six months, we have found that we now  have numerous opportunities to advance forward while facing some  ordeals. This condition will pave the way for our nation to  enter the new stage of development. Thanks to the fine  development of the socioeconomic situation, our people's  material and spiritual life has been further improved and social  activities enhanced. This has been symbolized by the creativity  and efficiency of various enterprises and businessmen, families  in the delta and mountain regions, and people in the  countryside. These sources of strength and intelligence can be  exploited more vigorously through the continuation of the  renovation process, especially in the efforts to accelerate  economic reform in close association with the administrative  reform. This will also serve as a basis for effective  competition with and exploitation of foreign resources.    In the new situation, the implementation of the policy on  strengthening great national unity has reached a new peak in  anticipation of the upcoming congress of the Vietnam Fatherland  Front. We must strive to bring into full play all capabilities  and efforts by Vietnamese at home and abroad for the great cause  of the nation. This will undoubtedly open up a new prospect for  attaining the objectives of making our people prosperous, our  nation powerful, and our society just and civilized.    In this spirit, the government, the National Assembly, the  Vietnam Fatherland Front, and other mass organizations, in their  respective role and duty will strive to organize, motivate,  lead, and assist the people to make greater efforts to fulfill  the 1994 tasks set by the National Assembly's resolutions,  thereby satisfactorily creating a firm foundation for effective  implementation of other tasks in 1995 and the ensuing years.</p>

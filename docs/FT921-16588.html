			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Appointments: Healthy move David Cavers, business manager of NORWICH UNION HEALTHCARE since it was formed last year, will become managing director next April. He succeeds Patrick Smith, who moves to assistant general manager responsible for personal insurances at Norwich Union. The arrival of Norwich Union and other commercial insurers in a market currently dominated by provident associations is among factors making private health insurance increasingly competitive. Others include rising healthcare costs and the effects of the recession on the growth of the market. Cavers was chief commercial executive at Private Patients Plan - one of the providents - before joining Norwich Union.</p>

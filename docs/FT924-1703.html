			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Owners Abroad links with Thomas Cook OWNERS Abroad, the UK's second largest tour operator, yesterday signalled further consolidation within the European holiday market by announcing a tie-up with Thomas Cook Group and its German parent, LTU Group. Thomas Cook will secure a 10.3 per cent stake in an enlarged group while Owners Abroad will have additional access to the Thomas Cook chain of retail outlets. Owners Abroad will also invest Pounds 20m in fixed-rate loan notes in Thomas Cook. The announcement places a new dimension on months of speculation that a bid was imminent for Owners Abroad. In October the company said it had received an approach from a potential purchaser. City observers said the alliance with Thomas Cook and the powerful LTU travel group was like a shot across the bow of the predator, believed to be Airtours, the UK's third largest tour operator. Owners' shares initially reacted to the deal by falling, as the likelihood of a full bid appeared to recede. But they recovered to close down only 1p at 87p as it became apparent that the tie-up with a group of Thomas Cook's stature could strongly improve its competitive position. Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, described the deal as three joint ventures or partnerships reinforced by the swap of shares and the loan notes. In addition to the increased links between Owners' tour operation and Thomas Cook retail, the groups' aircraft fleets and tour operations would be amalgamated. The three partnerships, he said, would enhance operating profits by Pounds 14m in the year ending October 1994 - half of which would be retained by Owners Abroad and half by Thomas Cook and LTU. On the retail side, there would be joint marketing of Owners Abroad holidays. Mr Rodrigues said Thomas Cook was likely to expand the retail outlets by nearly a third to more than 440. Owners Abroad reported pre-tax profits down in the year to October from Pounds 31.6m to Pounds 25.5m on sales of Pounds 772m. The total dividend is to increase from 3.2p to 3.5p. Earlier this year LTU bought 90 per cent of Thomas Cook. Westdeutsche Landesbank, which owns 34 per cent of LTU, bought the other 10 per cent and Airtours bought the Pickfords travel agency chain from NFC, the transport group.

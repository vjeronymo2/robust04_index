			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Feb 7 SAPA -- The SA [South African] Police  on Monday [7 February] and over the weekend swooped against  suspected extremist terrorists of both the far left and far  right, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said. He said in  Pretoria the arrests were made after more than six weeks of  intensive invstigations into a series of far-rightwing terror  attacks in the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal.    Police on Monday arrested five suspects linked to  far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and  others in Welkom.    The SA Police over the weekend also arrested seven people,  including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army  members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on  a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, at the weekend,  Mr Kriel said. Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were  seized when the arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni and near  the scene of the crime in Richard's Bay.    Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal  and  the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the  police.    Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress  and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said.    During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun  at  members of the police through a closed door. A policeman,  Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest but escaped death  because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr  Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was  under police guard in hospital.    "These arrests, and many others before them, explode the  myth  cultivated by Mr Nelson Mandela and the African National  Congress [ANC] that the SA Police is soft on rightwing  terrorism. "Once again the SA police have demonstrated that  they will act without fear or favour," said Mr Kriel. "These  arrests should also serve as a serious warning to both right and  left-wing extremists that the SA Police will not for a moment  hesitate to act against anyone who breaks the law, regardless of  political affiliation."    Mr Kriel believed it was time Mr Mandela paid constructive  and credible attention to his "criminal self-defence units,  which are trained by MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, [Spear of the Nation  -- armed wing of the ANC]". If Mr Mandela was interested in  fair play, he would apologise to State President F W de Klerk  and the SA Police for his recent unfounded insults. "However,  knowing Mr Mandela, this may be too much to ask, considering  that objectivity is not one of his strong points," Mr Kriel said.</p>

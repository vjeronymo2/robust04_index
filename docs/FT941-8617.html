			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Property side boosts US finance group result The rush by many US homeowners to refinance their mortgages last year fuelled a rise in net income at Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group, in the final quarter. The rush was driven by a fall in long-term interest rates. The refinancing wave boosted net income in the group's real estate services operation to Dollars 23.2m, from Dollars 17.9m the year before. This accounted for much of the rise in income from continuing operations in the quarter, which was up at Dollars 95.9m from Dollars 86.9m the year before. Transamerica also said its life insurance business had performed strongly, reporting net income (before investment gains) of Dollars 215.7m during 1993 as a whole, up from Dollars 190.8m. The growth came on the back of a larger asset base, the company said. He said it maintained its investment spreads in all product lines. Other operations reported falls in net income. Consumer lending was held back in part by a rise in credit losses, which climbed from 1.21 per cent of receivables to 1.69 per cent during the year. Commercial lending, although experiencing higher operating income, ended the year with a net loss of Dollars 4m after writing down some assets. Leasing, although slightly ahead at the operating level, recorded an 8 per cent fall in net income due to the US tax changes. For the fourth quarter, Transamerica's net income rose to Dollars 22.8m, or 24 cents a share, from Dollars 11.9m, or 6 cents, the year before. Included in this was a charge of Dollars 23m for early retirement of debt, together with a loss from discontinued operations of Dollars 50m, against Dollars 75m the year before. For the year as a whole, net income rose to Dollars 377.4m, or Dollars 4.51, from Dollars 243.2m, or Dollars 2.83, in 1992. Income from continuing operations, before investment results, was up 17 per cent on the year, to Dollars 425.2m.</p>

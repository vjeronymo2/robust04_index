			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Konstantin Subchev: "A Bosnia in the </F> Rhodopes?"]    [Text] However much the DPS [Movement for Rights and  Freedoms] as a whole wants to win for itself the humble image of  an all-national centrist party, its leaders, through their  incautious revelations, are doing everything possible to  frustrate these intentions. This time, Osman Oktay let out in  Momchilgrad that the DPS should also seize the economic power in  the region by appointing its own people as directors of the  state enterprises.    Accusations of separatism have been poured out against the  DPS for a long time now. In the beginning, they came from the  extreme nationalists and certain BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party]  leaders, so no one believed them. For too long Bulgarian  society has been living with the syndrome of guilt for the  "revival process" [forcible name-changing of ethnic Muslims in  1984-85].    However, people gradually returned to their senses,  especially following [DPS leader] Dogan's "turn to the left,"  when even in the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] people started  to see the truth.    The truth is simple. No matter what posts the DPS leaders  held in the totalitarian structures and what slogans they raised  following 10 November 1989, they still remain the exponents of  certain regional interests, and they will always act the same.  The burned Bulgarian flags and desecrated monuments in the  Rhodopes unmistakably prove this.    It now remains for them to recapture the last position held  by the Bulgarian state in this region. For the DPS, it is of  vital importance, because its electorate continues to emigrate  in a southeasterly direction. Yet the movement's leaders have  done nothing substantial to protect their social and economic  interests. Now they have decided that, by appointing their own  people to posts in the economic administration, they will manage  to deceive their electorate into voting for them again.    Of course, the crazy person is not the one who eats the pie  offered, but the one who permits this gastronomic prodigality.    For far too long, the state institutions have pretended to  be  deaf and blind to the tactics of ethnic separatism that the DPS  is to all intents and purposes practising in the mixed areas in  question. In many states that we call normal and extol as  models of democracy, Osman Oktay would have long had his  parliamentary immunity removed and been charged with treason for  making such a statement.</p>

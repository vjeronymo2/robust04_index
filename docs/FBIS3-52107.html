			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the  state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO's Executive  Committee, has stressed that this year will be the year of  revival: Here is Palestine being revived as a liberated  homeland for free men--the honorable, strugglers, and  revolutionaries; a homeland for democracy; a modern homeland and  a homeland for human and individual liberty.    Speaking on the telephone to the people of Jericho  celebrating the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Fatah  Movement and the intifadah entering its seventh year, brother  Abu-'Ammar said that no one could erase the Palestinian people  from the annals of history or the region's geographical and  political map.    He added: We have decided to make peace with our enemy, but  they are trying to prevaricate and say that deadlines are not  sacred. I am saying: No, deadlines are sacred, and he who  signs something must respect it. I am telling them that  prevarications cannot affect the determination of the  Palestinian people, because this people's determination comes  from God; God wills what His soldiers want.    Yes, they will not be able to undermine our determination  and  will not be able to outmaneuver us. We have signed an agreement  and they must respect it. The conference sponsors, Russia and  America, signed with us under the auspices of the President of  the United States and under the patronage, before the eyes, and  with the blessing of the whole world. I am saying this so that  it will be clear to those who are near by and those who are far  away.    Brother Abu-'Ammar said: By signing the Declaration of  Principles between the PLO and Israel, we brought our people to  a new and decisive historical era. This agreement, inclusive of  its contents from the start of the Israeli withdrawal from the  Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, absolutely did not mean  redeployment. Withdrawal means withdrawal. But there is  redeployment in other areas, in addition to the establishment of  national authority under the leadership of the PLO in  implementation of our Palestinian National Council's decision in  1974, which stipulated the establishment of national authority  on any part of the Palestinian soil being liberated or from  which the Israelis withdrew.    Brother Abu-'Ammar affirmed that Holy Jerusalem was in our  hearts and eyes and we would not compromise on it.    On the issue of the refugees and the settlements, Brother  Abu-'Ammar pointed out that the issue of the emigres was  entrusted to a committee from our Jordanian and Egyptian  brothers, Israel, and the PLO to arrange for their return. The  fate of the refugees would be determined in a period not  exceeding three years, that the same applies to the settlements  and their removal, and the final borders of the state of  Palestine.    Brother Abu-'Ammar affirmed that we will not live in  homelands or ghettos, and nobody can ever humiliate the  Palestinian people. If Rabin thinks that he can humiliate the  Palestinian people, he is mistaken. He can continue occupying  the land, but he is incapable of humiliating a Palestinian  child, woman, man, or youth.    'Arafat said that with this agreement we have firmly  established the Palestinian people on the geographical and  political map of the Middle East. He said: Do not forget that  the Zionists said at the first Zionist Congress in Basel,  Switzerland in 1897: A Land Without a People for a People  Without a Land. No, this land has the Palestinian people in it,  and we are planted in the Palestinian land like Palestinian oak  trees; our ancestors and their bones are in it, we are in it,  and our children will be in it.    At the end of his address Abu-'Ammar urged the audience and  all Palestinians to unite. He said: Unity, unity, unity for  all the sons of Palestine, for all the generals of Palestine,  and all the organizations of Palestine. Together we will make  the homeland and together we will build this homeland; a  homeland for all freemen and the honorable regardless of their  affiliations, parties, or identities. We have a rendezvous with  dawn; we have a rendezvous with victory.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Anglian Water warns of job losses Anglian Water yesterday announced the first stage in a restructuring of its core water business which is likely to result in a number of job losses next year. The first to go will be Mr John Simpson, group operations director and managing director of the utility Anglian Water Services. Mr Simpson, aged 54, announced his early retirement along with the company's statement that it would merge Anglian Water Engineering and Business Services - which provides billing, engineering and computing services - and 'certain support functions' into the regulated business. His responsibilities will be assumed by Mr Alan Smith, managing director of AWS. Mr Simpson's remuneration, excluding pension payments, was reported in last year's accounts as Pounds 120,000. Mr Chris Mellor, finance director, said it was too early to discuss the level of job losses. 'But clearly if we are going to constantly improve our efficiency over time then one of the ways is to gradually reduce our workforce,' he said.</p>

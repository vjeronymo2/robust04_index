			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 13 (A.A.) -- Turkey will continue to  supply electricity to Northern Iraq as soon as the lines which  were sabotaged by terrorists are repaired.    The terrorists had sabotaged the part of the lines running  into Northern Iraq and as a result no power has been sent to  that region since Sunday [10 April].    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his weekly  briefing that repair works are underway.    Baghdad has cut off power to Northern Iraq. Turkey announced  last week it will help the region to meet its needs.</p>

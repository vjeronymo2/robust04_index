Organisers were hoping for between 100,000 and 300,000  supporters on the march through Paris in a demonstration called  before Thursday's Constitutional Court ruling annulled a  controversial education bill that granted unlimited use of  public funds to the country's private, mainly Roman Catholic  schools.    The court ruled that the central article of the bill was  unconstitutional because it upset the balance between the state  and private school systems.    The protest was expected to attract teachers, students and  parents' associations, trade unionists and freemasons as well as  socialists and communists.    The court ruling was the left's first victory over the  conservative premier since its crushing defeat in general  elections last March, and the opposition Socialist party hopes  to use the march as a springboard to revive its political  fortunes.    In an effort to soothe passions unleashed by France's  long-running "school wars," Balladur indicated Friday that he  wanted to launch a public debate on "the future of the public  education system," its funding and organisation.    Socialist leader Michel Rocard is eager to capitalise on the  win as his party prepares for a series of conferences aimed at  building a broad centre-left coalition ahead of next year's  presidential election.    Rocard termed the ruling a "victory" for the left and  renewed  his calls for a big turnout on Sunday.    Balladur, who had come under fire from both left and right  after the education bill was rushed through the senate last  month in the middle of the night, beat a hasty retreat after the  court ruling.    Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said it would be  "imprudent" to submit a new education bill for the moment while  Education Minister Francois Bayrou called for "dialogue" and  said he wanted to "restore the self-confidence of the state  education system."

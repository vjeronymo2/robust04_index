			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank At one level yesterday's first-half results from Deutsche Bank are an extraordinary measure of the organisation's inherent strength. Despite a DM473m hit from the Schneider affair, the bank managed a small increase in operating profits after provisions. The release of sovereign debt provisions and the extraordinary gain from the sale of stakes in Daimler-Benz and the Karstadt store group certainly helped. Presumably, too, the bank has drawn on its hidden reserves - in this regard German bank accounts remain opaque. But the fact that, after Schneider, it was still able to report a fall in net bad debt provisions closely in line with the drop in its trading income is an indication of its ability to overcome formidable operational setbacks. Less satisfactory is what the results say about the underlying business development. The loan book is stagnating and the interest margin is coming under pressure, a trend that should continue with the introduction of money market funds. Trading income is likely to remain depressed. Also doubtful is whether commission income will continue to grow at the same pace in the second half. In short, Deutsche looks like another case of a bank facing growth constraints. Having already cut its bad debt provisions by 46 per cent, there is less room for an earnings boost from improving bad debts as the economic recovery continues. The results may have been somewhat better than the market expected but there is no longer- term reason for the shares to out-perform.</p>

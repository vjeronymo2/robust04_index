			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Brown Shipley starts proceedings against Tottenham Hotspur BROWN SHIPLEY, the merchant bank, yesterday began High Court proceedings to force Tottenham Hotspur Football Club to pay more than Pounds 408,000 in allegedly unpaid fees earned while the bank was the club's financial adviser, John Mason writes. The bank took over in September 1990 after the resignation of BZW, Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford QC told the court. At that time the club was in financial disarray. It owed Midland Bank Pounds 11m and Robert Maxwell planned to buy a 25 per cent stake in the club. The club's shares were also suspended after suggestions of concealment and secret profits, Mr Lyndon-Stanford said. Brown Shipley ceased acting as financial adviser in August 1991 when Mr Alan Sugar and Mr Terry Venables took over the management of the company. The club paid Brown Shipley only a Pounds 25,000 retainer, claiming its agreement with the bankers meant that further payments would be on the basis of success-fees for potential transactions which never took place.</p>

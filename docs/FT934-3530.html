			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Drummond picks up to Pounds 370,000 Technological and operational improvements helped Drummond Group, which makes fabrics and associated products for the clothing industry, increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 57,000 to Pounds 370,000 for the half year to September 30. These are the group's first results since the sale of its South African subsidiary and profits included an exceptional Pounds 196,000 arising from this disposal. Operating profits on continuing operations were Pounds 469,000 (Pounds 33,000 losses), on sales of Pounds 23m (Pounds 21.8m). Net earnings per share came to 1.17p (1.64p losses), but in the light of the further improvement required, the interim dividend is again omitted.</p>

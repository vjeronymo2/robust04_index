			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Luis Donaldo Colosio, Institutional </F> Revolutionary Party presidential candidate, by unidentified  reporter; date and place not given]    [Text] Mexico City (APRO) -- [EL NORTE] After (late  President) Plutarco Elias Calles, a man from your hometown,  began the maximato [the arrangement by which the former  president influenced his nominal successor], other presidents  attempted "minimaximatos," but they did not succeed because the  presidents who followed them cut the umbilical cord. When will  you cut yours?    [Colosio] I aspire to govern Mexico at the side of the  Mexicans. Let me be clear: No one but the citizens and society  will guide my work as president of Mexico.    [EL NORTE] President Salinas designated you as the candidate  of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], and he later  ratified you by saying: "Let there be no confusion." Doesn't  that weaken from the beginning the credibility you want to  secure during your campaign?    [Colosio] I would like to tackle your question with two  answers. First, regarding the PRI, I want to tell you that my  nomination took place in accordance with my party's rules,  customs, and traditions. All party members who aspire to be  candidates accept those rules. My nomination received broad  party support.    Regarding my credibility as a candidate, I want to tell you  that it is an objective of my campaign, and I intend to win the  trust, support, and confidence of the citizens. I have the best  platform to achieve results. I firmly believe that, which is  why I have called for debates.    [EL NORTE] You have said that countries are not invented  every six years. Does that mean Salinism will continue to rule  in Mexico?    [Colosio] I must explain myself. I realize that the country  and Mexican society need, want, and demand changes, but Mexicans  want to make changes without going backward. Mexicans want to  explore new roads, new opportunities, and new economic,  political, and social approaches. But they want these things  without jumping off a cliff, without political adventures. What  the people want right now, at the end of the century in an  increasingly complex world, is certainty, a real future, and  responsibility.    [EL NORTE] Your admiration for Salinas is well known, but  looking beyond your compliments in his favor, he can make  mistakes. In your opinion, what errors has the president made in  governing the country?    [Colosio] I do not believe in passing final judgment. The  president and Mexicans have made a great effort to progress.  Personally, we are united by great friendship and fondness. As  part of the government, I, in my area of responsibilities,  worked with him and shared commitments and objectives. I know  that he has always been motivated by a great love for Mexico. I  also know that some things can be done better.    It must be admitted that the government often does not do  everything it would like to do but does what it can based on the  available resources and the respect due to the citizens'  liberties and rights. In government, intentions and realities  always conflict, and difficult balancing acts result.    [EL NORTE] There will be a special period of congressional  sessions to pass reforms guaranteeing electoral impartiality.  Will this end the perfect dictatorship?    [Colosio] There will be a special period and an electoral  reform if all political parties and all candidates agree to it.  That was stated in the agreement that all the candidates signed  on 27 January. I insist: We will go to the special period and  pass legal reforms so long as this is preceded by an agreement  among the parties and the candidates. This would, of course,  contribute to a democratic transformation in Mexico.    I think everyone must place the interests of the nation  above  party or group interests. That is why I committed myself to  compliance with that agreement. I am fully committed to it.    [EL NORTE] If you won such exemplary elections, would you  be the product of a new political system? Would this be the end  of the perfect dictatorship?    [Colosio] Wait a minute. It is important to speak of  democracy all the time, not only when one wins. There are  candidates and parties that speak of democracy only when they  win. When they lose they say the elections were a fraud. I  think we must promote trust among ourselves. Trust is very  important these days.    [EL NORTE] Problems built up in Chiapas for centuries.  Statesmen have the obligation of foreseeing violence and of  warning the country about it. That was not done. How do you  interpret this possible lack of foresight or imposed silence  that was broken by the sound of gunfire on 1 January?    [Colosio] Lack of foresight and climactic situations  resulting from shortages and limitations in those communities  are two sides of the same coin. Cumulative abuse created a  situation that could not be resolved with preventive actions.  We must view this as a structural conflict that has taught the  government, society, and -- why not admit it -- the PRI some  lessons.    [EL NORTE] First as PRI president and later as social  development secretary, you said nothing about a latent war in  Chiapas for a long time. Were you unaware of what was happening  there? How did you react on 1 January? If you were aware, why  did you remain obstinately silent?    [Colosio] I visited Chiapas as social development secretary  four months before the conflict. I met in Ocosingo and  Margaritas with representatives from all regional organizations,  all of which made known their loyalties and beliefs. They  presented various demands, and we responded. The anguish and  hopelessness of those communities tell us that we arrived too  late. I admit that.    [EL NORTE] Why, if you are the candidate of hope, does hope  not go to Chiapas?    [Colosio] I will go at the appropriate time and be among the  people of Chiapas. But I will do it without acting against the  negotiation process there. I condemned violence from the very  beginning. I proposed that the various parties issue a joint  communique. I have spoke of this on several occasions.    If you mean that I have not made Chiapas the central issue  of  my campaign, you're right. I will tell you this: My decision  has been not to block, hinder, or interfere with the peace  process. No party and no candidate must make Chiapas into  political booty. I repeat: I will visit Chiapas. I will look  for the best time to do that.    [EL NORTE] [Former Chiapas State Governor] Absalon  Castellanos and [Interior Secretary] Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido  have been accused of illegal enrichment and repression in  Chiapas. The Zapatist National Liberation Army has demanded that  they face political trial. What is your position?    [Colosio] I believe in the law. There are ways to denounce  and punish crimes. I am in favor of abiding by the law. If the  people you have mentioned are guilty, let them be punished, but  I do not agree with condemning people based on unsubstantiated  accusations.    [EL NORTE] Castellanos and Gonzalez Garrido are  "distinguished PRI members." Does the PRI owe the country an  explanation? Will PRI's Honor and Justice Commission finally  function?    [Colosio] They may or may not face the commission, depending  of whether they are found guilty of the crimes of which they are  accused.    [EL NORTE] The PRI would then have to give an explanation?  (Colosio says nothing but nods)    [EL NORTE] The debate among the presidential candidates is  turning out to be just a fantasy. What is going to happen?    [Colosio] I have proposed that the candidates hold a debate  because I think that the more people of voting age are informed,  the freer they will be to choose among the various platforms and  proposals present in the national political spectrum. The  debate must mean more information available to the citizens,  information provided live to them by the candidates.    I propose two dates for the debates, one at the end of April  and another at the end of June. I have proposed that the  debates he held at the Federal Electoral Institute.</p>

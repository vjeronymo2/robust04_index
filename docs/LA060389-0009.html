			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES TEACHERS' STRIKE SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> The Times' coverage of the strike was enriched by Marita Hernandez's articles.  She helped all of us gain insight into the personal turmoils of the strike by  interviewing the administration, striking teachers, teachers who crossed the  picket lines, as well as the students of Le Conte Junior High. Her effort to  elicit all sides of a difficult issue is to be commended.  </P> <P> ANN BLAU  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

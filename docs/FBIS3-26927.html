State-owned enterprises currently  have decisionmaking powers and a more flexible operational  mechanism. The market mechanism has given the state-owned  enterprises an opportunity to compete with township and town  enterprises on an equal basis, thus weakening the flexibility of  the latter's economic mechanism. Furthermore, because their  operational mechanism has yet to be perfected, the  competitiveness of township and town enterprises has been  seriously weakened.    --Crisis of dependence. Most township and town enterprises  attach themselves to large enterprises in the cities for  coordinated or joint processing. Due to their processing  nature, their economic patterns, management methods, techniques,  equipment, and technical personnel have become fixed over a long  period. For this reason, they tend to depend heavily on others,  giving rise to the lack of competition and risk concepts.    --Crisis of management. Not having received systematic and  regular basic training, most directors, managers, and managerial  personnel from township and town enterprises cannot do as much  as they wish in the face of an unpredictable market.    --Crisis of science and technology. In the past, scientists  and technicians worked for township and town enterprises because  they were upbeat about the flexibility of the latter's  operational mechanism. After being invigorated, state-owned  enterprises have an edge over township and town enterprises in  terms of scientific research expenses and conditions. As a  result, the shortage of talented personnel facing township and  town enterprises will become worse.    --Crisis of products. Township and town enterprises are  generally plagued by problems of outmoded equipment, crude  technology, and backward techniques. Moreover, due to the  constraints of funds, technology, and other factors, they are  obviously inferior to state-owned enterprises in terms of  upgrading products.</p>

Clinton, who leaves here Saturday [8 January] night, met  Monday with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Strobe  Talbott, the would-be deputy to Christopher, on the tour that  will include stops in Brussels, Prague, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva.    The President is scheduled to meet with specialists on  European and Russian affairs Tuesday night.    At the center of Clinton's trip would be the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization's enlargement, reforms in Russia, Moscow's  outstanding nuclear differences with neighboring Ukraine and the  now-slowed-down Middle East peace process.    The strong support for Russia's ultranationalist Liberal  Democratic Party in the recent parliamentary elections has  prompted the Eastern and Central European countries to hasten  the process of joining the NATO.    Washington, afraid of putting Russian President Boris  Yeltsin  in a worse footing, is against immediately accepting countries  like Poland and the Czech Republics into NATO.    In what it calls the "partnership for peace" program, the  United States champions a gradual process in which all former  Warsaw Pact member countries could join NATO's military training  and other cooperation projects without security guarantee from  the Transatlantic Alliance.    This approach was criticized by Polish President Lech Walesa  as "short-sighted and irresponsible."    However, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General  John Shalikashvili, a former NATO commander, said "We cannot  just simply move the Berlin Wall a few hundred miles eastward."    "It is important that we are very clear that... [ellipses as  received] We are not building a system that is against someone,  because otherwise... [ellipses as received] We would just be  fueling the paranoia that might exist," the general said.    On Thursday, Shalikashvili and Madeleine Albright,  Washington's ambassador, will go to East Europe, both added  items in their itinerary, to soothe their concerns over the U.S.  plan on NATO enlargement.    Clinton will stop in Prague, the Czech Capital, and meet  with  Eastern European leaders.    His next stop is Moscow, where he will have a second summit  meeting with Yeltsin to reiterate Washington's support for  Russia's political and economic reforms.    Clinton reportedly planned a stop in Ukraine, but the former  Soviet Republic's parliamentary decision to retain the nuclear  weapons on its soil kicked the visit out of Clinton's schedule.    There has been wide reports of a three-way meeting in Moscow  among Clinton, Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk,  but the White House said that was still up in the air.    At the State Department, Spokesman Mike McCurry said a  trilateral meeting of U.S., Russian and Ukrainian officials had  started Monday on the nuclear issues.    McCurry said a meeting between Clinton and Kravchuk "depends  on the kind of progress they can make in talks on these nuclear  disarmament issues."    After a stop in Minsk, the Belarus Capital, Clinton will go  to Geneva, Switzerland, for talks with Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad to revive the Middle East peace talks.    Prior to his departure to Europe, Clinton will make a speech  on Thursday on foreign policy, raising the curtain for the  10-day five- country trip.    On Sunday afternoon, the President will make a speech in  Brussels on Washington's European policy.    "It is an important opportunity for him to articulate his  sense of U.S.-European relations and the American role in Europe  after the Cold War," a senior administration officials said last  month.    Clinton will answer "What is the new agenda for  Transatlantic  cooperation? Why do we care about each other? What do we see  as the challenges to our interests? and what he sees as the  American role in helping meet those challenges," the official  said during a background briefing to foreign reporters.</p>

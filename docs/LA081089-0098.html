			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRED DEPUTY WILL GET HIS JOB BACK  </P> <P> The Civil Service Commission found Wednesday that a former sheriff's deputy who  was fired for taking part in horseplay and pranks at the Pitchess Honor Ranch  in Castaic should be reinstated because he was singled out for dismissal.  </P> <P> Hearing officer Karen Orren found that former deputy Brent P. Talmo was treated  more harshly than other deputies who engaged in similar acts.  </P> <P> Talmo was fired three years ago after completing his probationary period.  </P> <P> Orren's recommendation that Talmo be given a 90-day suspension for three  separate incidents was adopted by the commission.  </P> <P> Talmo and other deputies at the honor ranch were accused of taking part in a  series of pranks among themselves and inmates, including putting a dead gopher  in an inmate's pocket and carrying out so-called "search and destroy" missions  in inmates' barracks, damaging the inmates' and county property.  </P></p>

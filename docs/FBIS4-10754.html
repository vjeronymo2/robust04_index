The new law, which grants special powers to the president,  allowing him to legislate economic and financial issues, will  become effective on 20 April, when it will be published in the  official gazette.    President Caldera is to discuss in full that same day the  Special Powers Law during the Council of Ministers meeting. An  official source has disclosed the Projects Concessions Law [Ley  de Obras por el Sistema de Concesiones] will be one of the first  laws up for approval. The executive branch believes this is an  important law which is expected to stimulate the economy.    [Begin recording] [Allan Viergutz, Venezuelan Oil Chamber  president] We believe the Concessions Law is very convenient.  We believe there is a need for creative measures that would  lead to new options that will benefit the country. These  measures will allow the government to deal more efficiently with  the fiscal deficit, high interest rates, and the problem of  unemployment. This law will stimulate the economy. [end  recording]    It was learned the executive branch, during the 30-day  period  the Special Powers Law allows, is prepared to promulgate all  decrees established in that law.</p>

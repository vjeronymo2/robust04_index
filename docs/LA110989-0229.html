			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MANAGER OF ASTROS INVITED TO HELP CONFUSE BENGALS  </P> <P> Houston Oilers Coach Jerry Glanville has invited Astros Manager Art Howe to  stand on the sideline during next week's game against Cincinnati in an effort  to confuse the Bengals.  </P> <P> "We're going to have Art dress exactly like (linebackers' Coach) Floyd Reese --  they look identical -- and have them both stand there and flash defensive  signals," Glanville said.  </P> <P> "The Bengals may be the greatest team in the league at stealing hand signals.  But they won't know which one's Floyd and which one's not," he said.  </P> <P> Glanville said he set up the hoax during a telephone call to Howe's secretary.  </P> <P> "We're just doing it because Art wants to come to the game. It has nothing to  do with Cincinnati, but we'll still make a big deal out of it," Glanville said.  </P></p>

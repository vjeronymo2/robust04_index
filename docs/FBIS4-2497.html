			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 22  March, a joint inspection team organized by the Xinzhou  Prefecture and Xinzhou city, Shanxi Province, price inspection  departments -- while inspecting price tags at the Guangxiu  Department Store (a large, privately run retailer) -- were  attacked by the department store's security personnel and other  employees who claimed that they were "imposters with fake  papers," according to information provided by the State Planning  Commission. They hauled one of the inspectors to the security  office and there beat him up using a baton. Two inspectors who  later entered the office to negotiate with them were also  beaten, abused, and held in custody for nearly two hours, thus  severely obstructing the price inspectors from carrying out  their official duties.    Leaders of Shanxi Province, the Xinzhou Prefectural  Administrative Office, and Xinzhou city took the incident rather  seriously. The Xinzhou Prefectural Administrative Office  instructed the Xinzhou city government to strictly handle the  incident, and the Xinzhou city Public Security Bureau has  assigned police to investigate. Guo Yuhuai, member of the  Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and  executive deputy governor, instructed the secretary of the  Xinzhou Prefectural Party Committee to take personal charge of  the matter and see to it that the offenders are duly punished.  SHANXI RIBAO was going to report the incident and express its  support for price inspectors' exercising their regular powers  and functions.    The incident is still under investigation. On 1 April, Wang  Dahu, deputy chief of the security section at the Guangxiu  Department Store and the principal offender in the attack, was  taken into custody for interrogation in Xinzhou city.</p>

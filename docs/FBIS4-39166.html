			<p>BFN     [Text] Odessa -- Ukrainian presidential candidate Leonid  Kuchma outlined his platform again at a meeting with the cadets  of a local militia school on 2 June. "Last year I signed a joint  statement with [Russian prime minister] Chernomyrdin and  [Belarusian prime minister] Kebich on the creation of an  economic union to lift customs barriers," he said. But the  Ukrainian media accused me of pro-Russian sentiments, and the  eastern and southern regions for some reason did not support me,  although they should have...."    Leonid Kuchma clarified his position on the Crimean issue:  "The Crimeans must be given greater freedom within Ukraine."    The candidate believes that everyone must take the blame for  the Belavezha "crime" [reference to the formation of the CIS],  and that the Black Sea Fleet should be sold to Russia because it  "has strategic interests in the Black Sea" which it will not  renounce, while "Ukraine is incapable of maintaining the fleet."    After the meeting, Oleksandr Mayorov, general secretary of  the Central Committee of the Renewed Communist Party of Ukraine  told UNIAN: "We communists will vote for Leonid Kuchma."</p>

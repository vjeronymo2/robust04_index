			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / Zambian troops at Angolan border Zambia yesterday said it had deployed troops along its 850 km border with Angola to prevent Unita rebels from attacking, Reuter reports from Lusaka. 'Unita has been threatening to attack us for a long time now so we have sent troops to the north-western provinces,' a Defence Ministry official told Reuters. Thousands of Angolan refugees have fled into Zambia since the civil war resumed between the Angolan government and Unita (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) after the rebels rejected their defeat in September's elections.</p>

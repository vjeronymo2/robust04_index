			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AFTER VIOLENT PARTY, HOTEL GETS WARNING ON  PERMITS  </P> <P> The Inglewood city attorney's office has sent a sharply worded letter to the  hotel where a party erupted in violence earlier this month, threatening  prosecution if hotel officials do not comply with occupancy limits or get city  permits for future gatherings.  </P> <P> Officials are still investigating whether the Days Inn Park Plaza Hotel on  South Prairie Avenue violated city law by failing to get a permit for the Sept.  1 party that left one guest dead and several injured.  </P> <P> However, city officials said in a statement that several discrepancies in the  Days Inn booking process may have contributed to the outbreak of violence.  </P> <P> Mayor Edward Vincent expressed anger at hotel manager Kay Hong's comment that  part of the reason for the violence was the neighborhood where the hotel was  located, which she called a "hot spot." Vincent said the police investigation  has found that the party-goers were from out of town.  </P></p>

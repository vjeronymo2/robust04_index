			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Property fears on Sunday trading REMOVAL OF restrictions on Sunday trading might inflict 'real and long-lasting' damage to the value of retail property and impose added pressure on town centres, according to an academic study. Unrestricted Sunday trading would raise labour and other costs more than it would increase turnover, and in consequence restrict the funds available to pay rents, according to an article in the Journal of Property Valuation and Investment. Eventually it might force weaker retailers out of business, leading to an excess supply of retail sites, which would put continued pressure on rents. Town centre shops, particularly those outside the prime shopping areas, would be most vulnerable, according to the study. They would, it is feared, lose market share to out-of-town shopping centres, which are more leisure-oriented and so would be most likely to benefit from family shopping on Sundays. Mr Richard Barkham of the University of Reading said his research showed that deregulation of Sunday trading laws was 'not in the long-term commercial interests of most retailers, insurance and property companies and the pension funds'. He added: 'A further expansion of capacity which will lead to an increase in costs but not turnover will simply prolong this depression in the retail investment market.' The effect of unrestricted Sunday trading on the spatial pattern of retail rents. Journal of Property Valuation and Investment, 2-3 Cornwall Terrace, Regents Park, London NW1 4QP.</p>

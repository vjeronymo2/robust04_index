			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Filippov, IZVESTIYA: "Journalists Are </F> Stripped of Even the Right To Own a Typewriter"]    [Text] It appears that the untiring fighters against  freedom have invented another new noose for the press.    The Government of Russia in Decree No. 1308 has transferred  27 federal enterprises and organizations to the ownership of  Arkhangelsk Oblast. The list contains this line: "Editorial  offices of the mass circulation oblast newspaper PRAVDA SEVERA."    "The way we read the government decree is that the subject  of  transfer is not the editorial collective but only the property  this collective uses," explained Grigoriy Perfilov, chairman of  the oblast committee for administration of state property. "The  editorial offices are furnished with tables, chairs, bookcases,  and typewriters, which belong to the state. The newspaper leases  this property from the Arkhangelsk Oblast administration, or to  be precise, from our committee. That is all."    An alarming detail: PRAVDA SEVERA is not a state-owned  newspaper; it was founded by the newspaper's journalistic  collective, and therefore the legitimacy of the government  degree with respect to this newspaper is questionable. According  to Grigoriy Perfilov, it was the oblast's publishing and  printing administration that added the newspaper to the draft of  this decree. PRAVDA SEVERA journalists name another "author":  The petition to the government to transfer the newspaper to the  oblast was signed by the former chairman of the former oblast  soviet, Yuriy Guskov.    PRAVDA SEVERA Deputy Editor in Chief Aleksandr Sakharov  emphasized that the oblast administration does not encroach on  the newspaper's freedom of action and even provides material  assistance to journalists of the independent publication. In  particular, it made up for the losses on discounted  subscriptions for low-income subscribers--an amount of more than  68 million rubles.    On the other hand, with this government decree in effect,  PRAVDA SEVERA could be kept in check even without interfering  with the editorial personnel. The building where the newspaper  is located is federal property, while the newspaper's equipment  belongs to the oblast. Thus, the journalists found themselves  completely dependent on a benevolent attitude of two masters  simultaneously. Either of these masters, should they decide to  hike the rent, could easily bankrupt the paper. So far, thank  goodness, there is no indication of such an intent. But the  noose has been put in place and for that reason is already  dangerous for freedom of speech. It cannot be precluded that our  bureaucrats, always active in fighting journalists, will  replicate the "Arkhangelsk noose" with respect to all the  regional publications and thus will be able to manipulate public  opinion. Today the central newspapers, because of diminishing  circulation, have little influence on public opinion in the  provinces. The authority of local publications, on the other  hand, had increased sharply. PRAVDA SEVERA has a circulation of  more than 70,000: one copy per 20 oblast residents, including  infants.    On the day I visited the PRAVDA SEVERA editorial offices  they  got a call from Moscow--from the judiciary chamber on  information disputes, and from St. Petersburg--from the regional  inspectorate on protection of freedom of the press. They  promised all sorts of assistance if someone tries on the basis  of the government decree to encroach on the newspaper's  legitimate rights. This preventive alarm is understandable.  Although the law is sacred in Russia, the lawmakers are foes.</p>

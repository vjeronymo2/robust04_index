			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Labour launches health attack LABOUR yesterday branded the government's health reforms an expensive flop as Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, prepared to announce the next wave of trust hospitals this week. Mrs Bottomley is expected to unveil the names of more than 100 new trusts to go into operation from April next year, joining 293 existing ones. She is also expected to invite applications for a fifth wave of trusts to start in April 1995. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the government had admitted that its reforms had cost Pounds 1.2bn in the first two years. Yet patient waiting lists had increased, he added.</p>

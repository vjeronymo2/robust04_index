			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Feliks Babitskiy: "Duma: Who Will Implement </F> Chaos Management"]    [Text] The State Duma devoted the whole of 12 January to  intra- and interfactional consultations. It was a kind of  time-out taken by the sides in view of the first break in their  work. And there is some consulting to be done. All the  contradictions were on display at the general sitting -- not  only the established ones, but those that were vigorously  developing in the course of the negotiating period prior to the  opening of the session.    As is known, at the very start of the process the moderate  conservative deputies' majority had the chance to organize its  faction properly. It was to comprise Zyuganovist Communists,  supporters of Travkin, Agrarians, and, perhaps, the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord, women, and the part of the body of  deputies that chooses to be nonfactional. This kind of majority  would have been able not only to block any initiatives by  "Russia's Choice," but also to implement its own. But the  alliance did not come about. Instead the four biggest factions  -- the Russian Federation Communist Party, the Agrarian Party of  Russia, Russia's Choice, and the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia -- sat down to negotiate the allotment of spheres of  influence in the Duma. At first glance this is inexplicable.  The position of Zyuganov and Lapshin enabled them to manage  without any negotiations, while Gaydar and Zhirinovskiy had  always appeared to them to be the least desirable partners  (simply odious to them). Actually, it was the quadripartite  negotiations that made the Communists' and Agrarians' potential  allies ill-disposed toward them.    What made the conservatives commit such a fatal error?    We have learned from reliable sources that information has  filtered down to the Duma from circles close to the president  that the four major factions will be authorized to participate  not only in the formation of the presidium and the committees  but also in the reorganization of the Cabinet of Ministers. If  this is to be believed, then it is clear what kind of bait the  Communists and Agrarians have taken. Actually, their  ideological inspiration -- V.I. Lenin -- taught that opportunism  would bring no dividends and that no one would voluntarily share  power. So they have themselves to blame.    The quadripartite negotiations broke down, of course.  "Choice" never really made any secret of the fact that its true  aim was not to join Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy in allotting  spheres of influence but to prevent them from exercising  influence on the Duma. The sole result of the roundtable was  that all four big factions were cut off from their potential  allies -- the small factions and independent deputies. Now the  former are obviously gravitating toward an alliance with  Shakhray, whose hopes of getting the speaker's chair have  therefore now undergone a revival. Now, that is the problem:  even if something turns up for themm, this alliance will not  have even a relative majority without the Communists and  Agrarians, but will merely be the fifth large faction. The  former will try, of course, in the very near future to return to  the original idea of creating a moderate conservative majority  faction. Except that the old confidence they used to command  will no longer be there. Things have moved on, so to speak.    It is true that Russia's Choice, as a member of the "big  four," is also isolated from its potential allies in the  reformist camp -- the Party of Russian Unity and Accord,  Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin, and the Russian Movement for  Democratic Reforms. But its leaders hardly had any illusions on  this score before. Their complaints about a lack of unity among  the democrats are clearly a pretense, except perhaps in the case  of S. Kovalev, who is far removed from the larger political  arena. Even during the election campaign they knew that this  unity would not exist, and they are merely seeking to shift  their share of the responsibility for this onto the remaining  democrats. Their real objective, at least at the present state,  is not to create a united democratic front but to prevent any of  their opponents (be they left-wing or right-wing) from forming a  Duma majority. This was the aim behind their demand for the  minimum size of deputies' group necessary for registration to be  as small as possible. This would have made it possible to break  up the body of deputies into a multitude of small groupings and  "drown the Duma's work in verbal diarrhea," as N. Travkin put it  in his own inimitable manner. These tactics have already been  dubbed "chaos management" by our political scientists. One of  the Russia's Choice leaders, Sergey Yushenkov, was blatantly  demonstrating them at his recent press conference.</p>

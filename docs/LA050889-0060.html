			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE MATTER OF LOCKE VS. EASTWOOD  </P> <P> Sondra Locke says the telephone call came early in the morning on April 3.  </P> <P> It was Clint Eastwood on the line. He said they needed to talk, and he hurried  over to the sprawling Bel-Air house that the two had shared intermittently  since 1980.  </P> <P> The couple's conversation that morning was short and to the point. Eastwood,  58, complained that Locke was "sitting" on his only real estate in Los Angeles,  and now he wanted her to move out of the house.  </P> <P> "I told him that I couldn't believe that was all he had to say to me after 13  years," Locke said in a written declaration filed 12 days ago in Los Angeles  Superior Court as part of her potentially precedent-setting palimony suit  against Eastwood.  </P> <P> Locke, in the court document, claims that his statements to her that morning  were her first notification that their increasingly troubled 13-year  relationship was ending.  </P> <P> Locke, who turns 42 this month, was in the midst of directing her second  feature film, "Impulse," and had only four hours of sleep the night before. She  says she begged Eastwood to hold off any discussions about their breakup until  she had finished the movie. "Clint told me that he understood, that I should  just 'put it in the back of my head,' and that we would talk about it again  after I finished 'Impulse,' " Locke recounted in the statement.  </P> <P> But a week later, while on the set of "Impulse," Locke received a second shock:  a letter from Eastwood's lawyers addressed formally to "Mrs. Gordon Anderson"  -- Locke's legal identity since her 1969 marriage to a childhood friend.  </P> <P> "Mr. Eastwood has asked you to vacate the premises," the letter read. "You have  refused to do so. This is to let you know that in view of your intransigence,  the locks on all the entrances to the house have been replaced. . . . Your  possessions accordingly will be placed in storage."  </P> <P> Upon reading the letter, Locke said in the statement, she fainted.  </P> <P> Locke wasn't the only person in the world shocked to learn she was breaking up  with one of the movies' biggest stars. Her April 26 filing of a palimony suit  against the intensely private archetypal macho-man of the "Dirty Harry" films  was the kind of news that sells supermarket tabloids and draws viewers to TV  newscasts.  </P> <P> The suit is a potentially precedent-setting legal case because it raises the  question of whether a woman, who is legally married to one man, can claim  palimony rights from another.  </P> <P> "It's not unusual for people to be separated from someone and living with  someone else," said Locke's attorney, Norman Oberstein. "When people live  together for 10 years, have a relationship for 13 years, share the same house  and life, there are certain things that are implied from that."  </P> <P> Although Eastwood and Locke declined to be interviewed for this story, they  have outlined their positions in sworn declarations that have been filed in the  palimony suit and ordered sealed by the court. The Times, however, has obtained  copies of Locke's entire legal declaration and a portion of Eastwood's.  </P> <P> For more than 13 years, the Eastwood-Locke union had been one of Hollywood's  best-known relationships and, by show business standards, reasonably stable. In  their time together, Eastwood's brand of wildly popular blood-splattered  action-adventure films had come to be regarded as classics; he became an icon  for a culture worshipful of his kind of rugged individualism and self-reliance.  Harry Callahan's "Go ahead, make my day" expression of supreme toughness became  so much a part of the language that even President Reagan evoked it as he  girded for a showdown with Congress.  </P> <P> As Eastwood's reputation grew -- the fan adulation, the critical acclaim,  directing such major films as "Bird," his foray into politics as the mayor of  the seaside village of Carmel -- Locke's career stayed in the shadow of his,  but recently showed signs of emerging on its own.  </P> <P> But the unusual partnership is over now.  </P> <P> Barred from her home, still shooting her movie and living with friends, Locke  is suing Eastwood for unspecified financial support, breach of contract,  emotional distress, forcible entry, possession of personal property and other  claims. She said she had to borrow clothes from friends because she hadn't had  time to get her own out of storage, and still didn't know the whereabouts of  her pet parrot Putty or her 1971 Mercedes Benz.  </P> <P> She wants the court to award her the ownership of the Bel-Air estate and  another house in the Hollywood Hills that she claims Eastwood gave her. She  also has asked the court to bar Eastwood from the Bel-Air house "because I know  him to have a terrible temper . . . and he has frequently been abusive to me."  </P> <P> The Eastwood she describes in her declaration is a volatile and distant man who  never got around to marrying her, although he frequently talked about it. Locke  claims that Eastwood persuaded her to have two abortions and a sterilization  operation known as a tubal ligation.  </P> <P> In his legal papers, Eastwood claims Locke told him on several occasions that  she never wanted to have children. "I adamantly deny and deeply resent the  accusation that either one of those abortions or the tubal ligation were done  at my demand, request or even suggestion," Eastwood stated. "As to the  abortions, I told Locke that whether to have children or terminate her  pregnancies was a decision entirely hers. . . .  </P> <P> "Particularly with regard to the tubal ligation, I encouraged Locke to make her  own decision after she had consulted with a physician about the appropriateness  of and the necessity for that surgical procedure," he said.  </P> <P> Eastwood's only public comments on the palimony suit were issued April 27  through his publicist: "I am deeply disappointed and saddened that she's  (Locke's) taken this kind of action. It will soon come to light that these  accusations are unfounded and without merit, however, this matter will be dealt  with in an appropriate legal arena."  </P> <P> That legal arena is the Superior courtroom of Judge Dana Senit Henry. Attorneys  for Locke and Eastwood are scheduled to be in court May 31.  </P> <P> Locke and Eastwood met in 1975 while making the post-Civil War-era film "The  Outlaw Josey Wales." He played a peaceful farmer who turns vigilante when Union  soldiers kill his family. She played a young girl who survived an attack  against her family.  </P> <P> Romance quickly developed between the two, whose screen personas seemed oddly  matched -- he the tough he-man made famous as the Man With No Name in the late  Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns and she the petite, ethereal-looking actress  who had been nominated for an Oscar in her first acting role, the naive young  Mick Kelly in the 1968 adaptation of Carson McCullers' "The Heart Is a Lonely  Hunter."  </P> <P> By 1976, Locke and Eastwood were living together in San Francisco while  Eastwood was filming "The Enforcer." At the time, Eastwood was still married to  Maggie Eastwood, the mother of his two children, Kyle, now 20, and Alison, now  17. In 1977 Locke and Eastwood worked together again on "The Gauntlet." That  year, after 25 years of marriage, Clint and Maggie Eastwood separated. The  couple divorced a few years later.  </P> <P> Eastwood and Locke began sharing the Sherman Oaks house that Eastwood had lived  in with Maggie, but, as Locke tells it, sometime in 1980 she had begun to grow  uncomfortable living among the family pictures and memorabilia of Eastwood's  former life. "I spoke to Clint about my feelings, and he told me that I should  find a house that I wanted and he would buy it for me," Locke said in her  declaration. The moment she saw it, Locke fell in love with the 5,000  square-foot tile-roofed Bel-Air house, although it was in need of renovation.  </P> <P> "Clint said that I should buy it, remodel it and furnish it however I wanted,"  she said. Property records show that he paid $1,125,000 for the two-story  stucco house. Locke spent about three years redecorating it.  </P> <P> Throughout this time, the couple also shared living quarters on a Northern  California ranch Eastwood bought in 1978, and at residences in Sun Valley,  Idaho, and Carmel, according to legal documents.  </P> <P> "From the start of our relationship Clint told me that he wanted us always to  be together and that he would take care of me forever," Locke said in the  declaration. "Clint repeatedly assured me that regardless of whether we were  married, everything he had was ours together. . . ."  </P> <P> It is not clear from the documents how their relationship soured.  </P> <P> "When Clint became mayor of Carmel several years ago he began spending more of  his time in Carmel, and was frequently there for periods of time when I stayed  in Los Angeles," she said. "During this same period I began to sense some  increasing tension and estrangement in our relationship. I frequently tried to  speak to Clint about these problems, but he never wanted to do so. He would  often discourage me from accompanying him to Carmel, and over the past year or  year-and-a-half he has stayed in Los Angeles only infrequently. The troubles  between us came to a head just before New Year's in 1988."  </P> <P> The pair headed to Sun Valley for the Christmas holidays, which they had been  doing for the last several years. An argument prompted Eastwood to insist that  Locke return to Los Angeles. Locke began work on "Impulse" in January, and  between January and April, Eastwood returned to the Bel-Air house only for a  few nights to attend two awards shows, Locke said.  </P> <P> Then came the letter addressed to "Mrs. Gordon Anderson."  </P> <P> Anderson, a West Hollywood sculptor, and Locke were childhood friends in their  native Shelbyville, Tenn., according to the legal documents. They married and  moved to Los Angeles together in 1969.  </P> <P> They have not lived together since 1975 and never consummated the marriage,  according to legal documents. The lawsuit describes their relationship as  "tantamount to sister and brother."  </P> <P> Repeated attempts to reach Anderson were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Eastwood knew about the marriage and accepted Anderson as Locke's surrogate  brother "and treated him like an extended family member," Locke said in her  lawsuit.  </P> <P> In 1982, at Locke's request, according to the suit, Eastwood bought a house in  the Hollywood Hills for Anderson to use, with the understanding that the house  was a "gift" to Locke.  </P> <P> Despite her promising film debut, Locke's career has long been tied to  Eastwood's. They have worked on six films together. Her biggest role was as the  artist-murderer in "Sudden Impact," one of Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" movies. She  played the gun-toting, revenge-seeking Jennifer Spencer methodically wasting a  pack of degenerate rapists who had earlier attacked her and a younger sister.  </P> <P> In addition to "Josey Wales," Locke appeared as a country-music singer in  Eastwood's "Every Which Way But Loose" and "Any Which Way You Can," a society  snob in "Bronco Billy" and a tough-talking hooker in "The Gauntlet."  </P> <P> "Because I have not worked in any capacity on any theatrical motion picture  other than with Clint since before I met him in 1975 (with one minor  exception), I had long felt that my professional career had been placed in  Clint's shadow," Locke stated in her declaration.  </P> <P> Locke's first effort at directing, in the Eastwood-produced 1986 film "Ratboy,"  met with little commercial or critical success in this country, although some  European critics praised the film.  </P> <P> "Impulse," her current film, is a psychological thriller about a burned-out  female undercover cop -- played by Theresa Russell -- who works as a hooker  decoy and becomes confused about which side of the law she wants to be on. It  is being produced by the couple's friend, Al Ruddy, and distributed by  Eastwood's longtime studio, Warner Bros. Locke is scheduled to finish shooting  the film on Friday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Eastwood is in pre-production for his upcoming motion picture "White  Hunter, Black Heart," which chronicles the making of "The African Queen" and  will be shot on location in Africa. His latest film, "Pink Cadillac," is  scheduled to open May 26.  </P> <P> Ironically, Locke's first attempt to come out from under Eastwood's shadow is  being obscured by the breakup and legal wrangling.  </P> <P> Said Locke in a 1987 interview: "People have this fantasy that it's all just an  easy ride if you know someone important. Well, it's not. I've known lots of  people in this business -- and it hasn't really done anything for me. . . . In  a way, my association (with Eastwood) may even work against me."  </P></p>

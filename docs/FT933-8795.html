			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Royal returns With the proceeds of May's rights issue safely tucked away, Royal can enjoy the UK insurance recovery without worrying about its capital position. Having cut the pay-out too, it should even be able to cover the dividend and retain profits at the current modest level of profitability. The likes of Commercial Union will have to wait for the next leg of the UK underwriting upturn to flow through to the bottom line before such financial balance is achieved. Yesterday's large loss in reinsurance is a reminder that past mistakes might still take the shine off Royal's recovery, even where remedial action has been taken. Given the unpredictable nature of the business, there is certainly scope for further disappointment. But while running down reinsurance at the bottom of the cycle attracted brickbats, such losses support the argument that retail insurers have no place in the wholesale end of the business. Like others in the sector, Royal is coy about how its new financial freedom will be used. Price rises in the UK should underpin premium growth for perhaps another year. By then, the US underwriting cycle may at last be turning. Royal is already reversing the steady shrinkage of its US operations. But while big US insurers such as Chubb are showing decent profits at current rates, price rises cannot be taken for granted. The immediate outlook in Europe is equally uncertain. Since investment returns are also likely to be lower than in the 1980s, insurers may have to content themselves with squeezing the most out of existing business.</p>

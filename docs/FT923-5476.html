			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Brussels shake-up likely when MacSharry quits MR Ray MacSharry, the EC's Irish agriculture commissioner, has decided to step down when the current Commission's four-year term expires at the end of December, increasing the likelihood of a thorough shake-up in Brussels. Naming his successor will be tricky for Dublin, where Mr Albert Reynolds' coalition government will be constrained by its one-seat majority as it searches for a commissioner who will wield comparable Irish influence. Mr MacSharry's decision means three members of the 17-strong Commission are now certain to be replaced, but the number of departures could rise to 10. This could clear the way for a regrouping of functions, as well as a reshuffle of portfolios. Commission president Jacques Delors wants to streamline the Brussels executive, officials close to him say, but, like much else in the EC, such plans depend on the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht. Mr MacSharry, 54 and twice a finance minister under Mr Charles Haughey, was asked to stay on by Mr Reynolds. But on Saturday he announced he was retiring from public life altogether, as he has long insisted he would, despite constant speculation he wished to return to Irish politics and challenge Mr Reynolds for the premiership. Mr MacSharry this May steered through the most radical overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy in its 30 years. Obstinate and canny, with thorough mastery of a complicated brief, Mac the Knife - as he was known in Ireland when he resolved a national debt crisis with draconian budget cuts - persuaded farm ministers of the 12 into accepting a package all of them had rejected as unthinkable. His tactics also drew the US much closer to the EC position on farm subsidy cuts in the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation negotiations, although a conclusion to the long-stalled round is now more likely under his successor. Favourites to replace him in the Commission - though not in the same portfolio - are Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, transport and communications minister, Mr Padraig Flynn, justice minister, and Mr Michael Woods, minister for the marine. Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, 42, is the favourite. But the Fianna Fail-led coalition fears her Dail seat would be lost in a by-election, bringing down the government. Mr Reynolds already faces a rough autumn, as jobless totals mount, an abortion referendum approaches, and the public inquiry into government and party relations with the beef industry, which resumes this week, dredges up more controversy.</p>

It observes in particular that the peoples of the  North Caucasus and the south of Russia have greeted the end of  the war with Abkhazia with great satisfaction.    At the same time, the letter says, the threat of a new  spiral  of conflict has recently risen sharply. The attempt by certain  Georgian forces to impose their will on the people of Abkhazia  and deprive them of the opportunity to control their own lives  as they see fit may bring to naught all that has been done by  the joint efforts of the peoples of Russia, and lead to a new  war which may prove to be even more embittered.    At the same time numerous rallies are being held in the  cities and settlements of Abkhazia. Its population is alarmed  at the imminent signing of a treaty between Russia and Georgia  which envisages the strengthening of Georgia's national army.  The rally participants believe that this will create new  preconditions for an escalation of hostilities.    The quadripartite meeting on the problem of  Georgian-Abkhazian relations, planned for this week in Sochi,  has also been frustrated. It was planned that representatives  of Russia and delegates from the office of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees would take part in it. According to  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, the reason for  the cancellation of the meeting is that it has not proved  possible to sign in Moscow a multilateral agreement on refugees.    The possible conclusion of a military alliance between  Russia  and Georgia is generating alarm in a number of regions of the  Caucasus. As has become known from confidential sources close  to the leadership of Abkhazia and the Confederation of Caucasus  Peoples, if strong-arm pressure is applied to Abkhazia, the  Confederation of Caucasus Peoples is prepared to send  approximately 5,000-6,000 of its volunteers to defend it.  Roughly the same number of volunteers may be activated on  Russia's borders with Georgia which pass through the North  Caucasus.</p>

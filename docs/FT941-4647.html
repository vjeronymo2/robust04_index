			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Observer: Xhosa poser In the chic environs of Johannesburg - yes, there are some - there is an upsurge of interest in South Africa's two main native tongues, Xhosa and Zulu. The twist of course is that Nelson Mandela is a Xhosa and Mangosuthu Buthelezi a Zulu. Inhabitants of the exclusive Rand Club divide between the self-proclaimed pessimists, learning Zulu, and optimists, who are taking Xhosa lessons. A small minority is learning Mandarin, on the grounds that since no one seems to be listening to anyone else you may as well learn something useful.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FIGHT AGAINST REDISTRICTING DECISION  </P> <P> In light of Judge Kenyon's decision regarding redistricting of county  supervisor seats, the fight-to-the-end-at-all-cost attitude of the board's most  recalcitrant member, Pete Schabarum, is as desperate as it is appalling (Metro,  June 6).  </P> <P> The time has long since passed for a more culturally diversified board;  unfortunately, it will cost the county $3 million in legal fees (and more if  they appeal) to do something it should have done voluntarily -- draw up  districts which are not deliberately dissected to dilute the voting strength of  any group.  </P> <P> Schabarum's stubborn desire to appeal this case is sadly reminiscent of Gov.  George Wallace's standing in front of the schoolhouse door in Alabama many  years ago. Only now the words should be "gerrymandering today, gerrymandering  tomorrow and gerrymandering forever!"  </P> <P> DONNIE G. WALLACE  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

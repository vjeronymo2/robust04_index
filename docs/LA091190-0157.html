			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> MARCHERS PROTEST MAN'S DEATH IN JAIL  </P> <P> About 100 people turned out for a march in Santa Paula during the weekend to  protest the death of 23-year-old Daniel Guajardo, who died in a Santa Paula  jail cell last week.  </P> <P> "We held the vigil to let everyone know that the Hispanic community is tired of  being harassed by Santa Paula police," said Frank Gaona, Guajardo's uncle.  </P> <P> He and other relatives and friends of the dead man suspect foul play on the  part of officers in the death.  </P> <P> But police officials deny the accusations and say Guajardo probably died of a  delayed reaction to cocaine or that he may have smuggled drugs into jail with  him and then overdosed.  </P> <P> Guajardo was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of cocaine  Sept. 4. Ten hours later, he was found dead in his cell.  </P> <P> Toxicology reports that might verify whether he died of an overdose may not be  finished for more than seven weeks.  </P> <P> "Police said my nephew died at 3:15 Tuesday morning," Gaona said. "But no one  called my niece, his wife, until 6 in the morning. And then they wouldn't let  anyone, not even his wife or mother, see his body for the next two days. Why?  Reports show they never took him to the hospital, they just rushed him straight  to the coroner. My nephew's death was totally out of hand."  </P> <P> Police Chief Walter H. Adair was unavailable for comment Monday. MAJA RADEVICH  </P></p>

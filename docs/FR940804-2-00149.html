			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the equities markets, quotations, trade prices and volumes are reported publicly for all securities listed on the exchanges and in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (``Nasdaq'') System. The Commission has noted at least three benefits to the equities markets from transparency: enhanced investor protection, market liquidity, and market efficiency. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The Board believes that these same benefits would be desirable in the municipal securities market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> SEC, Division of Market Regulation, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (January 1994), at IV&hyph;2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Pilot Program for Transaction Reporting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In 1993, the Board announced its plan to undertake a pilot program to collect and publish information on transactions occurring in the inter-dealer market for municipal securities (the ``pilot program''). The Board has designed the pilot program to take into account the distinctive aspects of the municipal securities market that distinguish it from the exchange-listed and Nasdaq markets. A primary distinguishing characteristic of the municipal securities market is the large number of outstanding issues. There are approximately 1.2 million municipal securities that are distinct, non-fungible entities for purposes of trading and reporting. In addition, the municipal securities market lacks any core group of issues that trade frequently and consistently over sustained periods of time. While, on any given day, a certain number of municipal securities are traded frequently, the identity of these frequently traded issues is continually changing over time. A third distinguishing characteristic is that, in the municipal securities market, most issues are purchased by ``buy and hold'' investors relatively quickly after initial issuance. When frequent trading does occur in an issue, it generally occurs immediately after issuance and then subsides within a week to 10 days. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has examined inter-dealer trading data provided by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') for a six-month period during 1991. During this six-month period, only 40 issues traded three or more times per day for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. It is important to note that these 40 issues did not trade frequently for the entire six-month period and that, on any given day, only a few of the 40 would be trading frequently. In most cases, frequent trading in these issues_primarily new issues_tended to trail off shortly after a 10-day run. Altogether, approximately 75 percent of all issues trading during the six-month period were traded only once or twice in a given week. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the markets covered by Nasdaq and the National Association of Securities Dealer's (``NASD's'') recently inaugurated Fixed Income Pricing System (``FIPS'') for high-yield fixed-income corporate securities, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  displays of data about a security are organized based on firm quotations. The Board believes that a different concept is needed for municipal securities, since firm two-sided quotations exist only for very few municipal securities at any given time. There are several reasons for this. For most municipal securities, there is only a small ``float'' of securities available to be the subject of trading. This small ``float'' is a primary disincentive to market making. In addition, the tax treatment of borrowing tax-exempt securities (along with the small floats) effectively prevents short-sales of an issue. This denies potential market makers a technique that otherwise could be used to manage risks. Finally, the traditional ``buy and hold'' philosophy of most tax-exempt purchasers simply does to provide the incentive or create the need for continuous, two-sided quotations traditionally offered by market makers in equity securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32019 (March 19, 1993), 58 FR 12428. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has designed the transaction reporting pilot program to provide the public with price and volume information in a way that reflects the unique aspects of the municipal securities market. The pilot program will make information available in the form of a daily, public report containing volume and pricing information for the inter-dealer market (``daily report''). The issues that will be reported individually each day will be those that traded at or above a threshold number of times on the previous business day. Initially the threshold will be four trades per day. As trading in an issue increases, it will be reported; as an issue's trading frequency decreases, it will be replaced by others that are trading frequently. In this way, the daily report will reflect the ever-changing pattern of trading activity in the universe of some 1.2 million municipal securities. The pilot program will make information on all inter-dealer trades in municipal securities available to the Commission and other regulatory agencies to assist in the inspection for compliance with and the enforcement of Board rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

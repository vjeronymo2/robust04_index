			<p>Article Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 4 November Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU  SHIMBUN in Japanese, page 1, carries an article by reporter  Sadaharu Shimizu noting that the large Japanese banks operating  in the United States have begun to expand financing activities  to U.S. companies.    The article notes that last year, in the United States as  well as in Japan, Japanese banks "gave priority to the disposal  of nonperforming assets," and thus were generally cautious about  increasing their loan assets, But as of the end of September  1993, the capital adequacy ratios of the top-tier banks rose  above 9.5 percent "across the board," so that the "specter"  presented by the 8-percent capital adequacy ratio set by the  Bank for International Settlements [BIS] has "faded away."  This, coupled with the fact that the demand for capital in  Japan is sluggish due to the prolonged recession, that "the  amount of financing per deal in the rapidly growing Asian market  is small," and because the banks seek to "maintain their  earnings in the international sector," has led the Japanese  banks to shift toward the U.S. corporate market for new lending  opportunities.    According to the article, Sanwa Bank has set its goal for  the  second half of FY93 to increase financing in the U.S. "by just  over 6 percent compared to the first half of FY93." The  Industrial Bank of Japan [IBJ] is also proceeding with plans to  expand American corporate lending by about 6 percent in FY93,  while the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan [LTCB] plans an  increase of "5-plus percent" in FY93.    Major Japanese commercial and long-term credit banks are  participating in corporate financing deals led by banking  groups. Two banks, Sanwa and Mitsubishi, are participating as  "co-lead managers" in the bank financing of Viacom in its  attempted buyout of Paramount Communications. IBJ and the Bank  of Tokyo, which are usually "aggressive" in financing corporate  takeovers, are also backing Viacom. Financing for QVC, Viacom's  opponent in the struggle to take over Paramount, is being led by  the LTCB. Several banks, including Sanwa and Sumitomo, are  anticipating loans to Eastman Kodak's chemical subsidiary. And  six banks, including Fuji and LTCB, are expected to join "core  banks" in extending the "enormous sums" IBM will require for its  corporate restructuring.</p>

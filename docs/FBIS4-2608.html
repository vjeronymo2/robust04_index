			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin said the U.S. has no right to unilaterally decide to  bomb Bosnian Serbs positions.    Yeltsin made this remarks in response to the U.S. bombing of  the Bosnian front near Gorazde on Sunday [10 April].    Before leaving for Spain today, Yeltsin said that the U.S.  has no right to make such a decision without consulting Russia  first.    The Russian president added that he had a telephone talk at  6:00 this morning with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Clinton did  not answer whether the U.N. General Secretary [as received] had  agreed to the attack, he added.    According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, Yeltsin insisted  that  all issues be solved according to U.N. resolutions, and demanded  that the U.N. Security Council discuss the issue.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning Peru" newscast] </F>   [Text] There could be cabinet changes, Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori has hinted by failing to discard this  possibility after promulgating Peru's new Constitution.    [Begin recording] [Fujimori] We have concluded a first  phase.  There is stability; inflation is well under control, and we have  access to international credits, and conditions have been  created--it is not that broad exonerations have been granted--so  that certain sectors may contribute to vitalizing the economy.    In 1994, we are going to give priority attention to  reactivating the economy. Two sectors can contribute to this  right now: the construction and tourism sectors.    There is good development already in the agriculture,  fishery, and mining sectors.    [Unidentified reporter] Will there be cabinet changes after  the promulgation of the Constitution, or will all the ministers  be maintained?    [Fujimori] I evaluate the situation every six months, but  you  have seen that all of the ministers have managed well the  government programs.    [Reporter] Could there be some changes?    [Fujimori] This possibility can never be discarded, but I  repeat: The ministers have done an excellent job.    [Reporter] The general sales tax [IGV] will be maintained at  18 percent?    [Fujimori] The IGV will be maintained, with the exceptions  established by the Constituent Congress, especially for  foodstuffs.    [Reporter] The government will not object the law approved  by  Congress and will promulgate it? [sentence as heard]    [Fujimori] We fully agree with its essence. [end recording]</p>

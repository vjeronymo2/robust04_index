			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Correspondent P. Korovyakovskiy] Lots of secret  things have become known in recent years.

The journalists that were  invited to today's news conference in the former CPSU building  were promised access to all the sub-departments of the service  and to all officials. Petr Filippov promised that those  officials of the presidential staff that refuse to give an  interview will be made to do it, but not by using methods  favored by the former owners of these halls.</p>

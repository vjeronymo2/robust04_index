			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions THE MARKET has inched its way up again and some directors have been tempted to take profits. Michael Slade, managing director of property group Helical Bar, sold 245,000 ordinary shares at 250p and a further 260,000 of the convertible preference at 91p. Helical Bar has been beset by a high level of debt, but substantial sales have been made and borrowing reduced. The market has already begun to discount this, with the shares outperforming by at least 250 per cent over the past 12 months. William Adsetts, chairman of Sheffield Insulations, and his managing director, William Forrester, have sold a significant lump of shares. Adsetts disposed of 1.15m at 230p, which leaves him with a holding of over 4m. Forrester, on the other hand, exercised an option on 50,000 and sold the lot, again at 230p. This building materials group has shown a big increase in profitability. Recent interim results showed earnings doubled at 5.5p. Improved profitability was largely discounted by the shares, which have outperformed during the year. Charles Greigson, director of money broking group MAI, has sold 175,000 shares at 228p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 No of Company                    Sector      Shares    Value      directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BICC                        Elec       43,291     188            2* Bluebird Toys               Misc       60,500     296            2 Bodycote                    Cong      250,000     700            2* British Gas                  Oil       90,429     295            1* Burmah Castrol               Oil       42,124     323            1* Capital Industries          PP&amp;P      100,000     190            1* Clayhithe (CULS)            EngG      100,000      92            1 Fired Earth Tiles           Stor       30,000      18            1 Frogmore Estates            Prop       50,000     244            1* Hanson                      Cong       20,000      51            1 Helical Bar ConvPrf         Prop      505,578     850            1 IOM Steam Packet            Tran        5,000      10            1 Legal &amp; General             InsL       70,000     339            1* MAI                         OthF      175,000     400            1 Reckitt &amp; Coleman           Hlth        4,000      25            1 RTZ                         Mine       50,760     357            1* Sears                       Stor      245,000     274            2* Sheffield Insulatn          BdMa    1,200,000   2,760            2* Shoprite Group              FdRe       50,000      89            1 Ticketing Group              H&amp;L   40,000,000     800            1 Trinity Intl                 Med       40,940     158            2 Weir Group                  EngG      100,000     303            1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Banks (Sidney)               FdM        5,000      11            1 Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold        H&amp;L        5,000      26            2 Bostrom                     Motr          800      13            2 Cresta Care                  H&amp;H      250,000      90            1 Crown Eyeglass               USM       12,000      17            3 Drummond Group              Text       36,940      35            1 Gibbs Mew                   Brew       55,000     181            1 Global Group                 Oil      100,000      15            1 Invesco                     OthF       25,000      45            1 JIB                         InsB        6,887      12            2 OMI International           OthI       41,545      13            2 Radius                      Elns      250,000      85            1 TLS Range                   Motr       50,000      14            1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

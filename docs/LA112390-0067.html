			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER STEPS DOWN; THREE VIE FOR HER POST;  </P> <P> BRITAIN: THE PRIME MINISTER HAD NEVER LOST AN ELECTION. TORIES WILL CHOOSE A  NEW LEADER AS EARLY AS NEXT TUESDAY.  </P> <P> Margaret Thatcher, beset by a challenge from within her own ruling party,  stunned Britain on Thursday by resigning as prime minister.  </P> <P> Thatcher's decision to step down under fire came during a fractious fight for  the Conservative Party leadership -- and only a day after she had vowed in the  House of Commons: "I fight on. I fight to win."  </P> <P> In the end, her own closest aides convinced her that the challenge mounted by  former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had left her seriously wounded, and  they warned her that Heseltine could defeat her in the next test for the party  leadership.  </P> <P> The feisty, right-wing Thatcher has been prime minister longer than any other  British leader in this century and has never lost an election.  </P> <P> Her decision threw wide open the contest for the leadership of Britain's ruling  party -- and, automatically, the prime minister's post. By the noon Thursday  deadline for entering the race, three prominent Tories -- Heseltine, former  Deputy Prime Minister Douglas Hurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major  -- had declared their candidacies.  </P> <P> Technically, Thatcher will remain prime minister and party chief until the  Tories elect a new leader, who will then become prime minister. That could come  as early as next Tuesday, when the party gathers to vote on its leadership.  </P> <P> When news of her resignation swept through the houses of Parliament Thursday  morning, some of her supporters were seen to be in tears.  </P> <P> One of those, Home Secretary David Waddington, said: "I have never been sadder  in all my life. She was a great leader, and the last thing I wanted was to see  her step down in this way."  </P> <P> But in the afternoon, Thatcher -- whom some have dubbed "the Iron Lady" --  demonstrated that she was still the head of government, giving a bravura  performance in the House of Commons as she argued against a no-confidence  motion introduced by Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party.  </P> <P> Speaking of his motion, Kinnock said, "There isn't much of a government to have  no confidence in."  </P> <P> But buoyed by her tough, effective speech defending her government's record,  the Tories roundly defeated the no-confidence measure, 367 to 247.  </P> <P> Thatcher then summarily rejected a call by Kinnock that new national elections  be called immediately. The next general election must be held before mid-1992,  but the precise timing is up to the prime minister. Thus, considering their  comfortable majority in Parliament, the Conservatives will remain in power for  another 18 months.  </P> <P> In the raucous Commons session, Thatcher seemed relaxed, winning both laughter  and applause, even from some of her longtime critics. Wearing her trademark  bright blue suit, she castigated the opposition with a vintage performance and  at one point declared, "I'm enjoying this."  </P> <P> "You can wipe the floor with these people," interjected one of her supporters,  and Thatcher responded with an elaborate bow.  </P> <P> She was relentless in defending her policies. "We are no longer the sick man of  Europe," she declared to the lawmakers.  </P> <P> At one point, after she commented on the notion of a central European bank,  which she has long opposed, Laborite Dennis Skinner jokingly called out that  she herself could become the bank's governor.  </P> <P> She did a double take, then exclaimed, "What a good idea!"  </P> <P> Thatcher's agonizing decision was prompted by the challenge of former Defense  Secretary Heseltine, who ran against her in the first ballot for party leader  last Tuesday and succeeded in forcing her into a runoff. The second round now  will be held without her.  </P> <P> After Thatcher's resignation, two of her Cabinet colleagues announced their  candidacy for the party leadership: Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, 60, and  Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, 47, both viewed as "stop-Heseltine"  men.  </P> <P> If none of the three candidates gains a simple majority of the 372 Conservative  members of the House of Commons on Tuesday, a final election will be held two  days later.  </P> <P> Thatcher's dramatic announcement came a day after she had participated in the  34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which she was  the senior major national leader in attendance.  </P> <P> Hearing the news, her fellow world leaders expressed their sorrow at the  prospect of her leaving the world stage, one on which she played a powerful  role during her three consecutive terms and 11 1/2 years in office.  </P> <P> In all, she spent a total of 4,220 days at 10 Downing St., a time in which  Britain's first woman prime minister led the country in the 1982 Falkland  Islands War and survived an assassination attempt in 1984 when the Irish  Republican Army bombed the site of a party conference in Brighton.  </P> <P> President Bush, who counted Thatcher as one of his staunchest allies, said in  Saudi Arabia, where he was visiting U.". troops:  </P> <P> "Margaret Thatcher was an outstanding prime minister and an outstanding ally  for the United States. You always knew where she was and what she believed.  I'll miss her."  </P> <P> A U." Marine was overheard telling the President: "I thought she'd duke it  out," and Bush replied, "So did I."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, former President Ronald Reagan, who was always grateful for  Thatcher's support of his conservative stance in foreign affairs, praised her  "bold and visionary policies," which he said restored Britain to greatness.  </P> <P> In Baghdad, Iraqi government spokesman Naji Hadithi declared: "This is most  welcome news. Anyone who replaces her would be better than she was."  </P> <P> Thatcher was notable in her support for Bush's military commitment against Iraq  in the Persian Gulf. And, holding true to form, she had Defense Secretary Tom  King announce Thursday that Britain was sending an additional 14,000 troops to  the multinational force in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Thatcher was the first among Western leaders to welcome the advent of Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to prominence. It was the Russians who  christened her "the Iron Lady."  </P> <P> She was first elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, deposing  defeated Prime Minister Edward Heath. In 1979, she led the Tories to victory  over Labor, then beat the opposition again in 1983 and 1987. She was Britain's  first prime minister since the 19th Century to win three national elections.  </P> <P> Opinion polls showed that the party was generally more popular than she -- due,  political commentators said, to her often abrasive and authoritive manner,  which she carried into relations with her Cabinet members.  </P> <P> Her decision to push for the so-called poll or head tax as the basic community  fund-raising device was widely unpopular. And inflation and mortgages were  recently at a near high for her government.  </P> <P> But the immediate events leading to her downfall began with the summit meeting  of the 12-member European Community in Rome late last month, when she found  herself, as usual, as the odd leader out -- the lone objector to proposals for  a common currency.  </P> <P> On her return to London, she gave a reasoned defense of her policy to the House  of Commons but then, in the give-and-take of questioning, sounded particularly  shrill in her comments against the Common Market.  </P> <P> This upset Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe, whom she had removed from the  foreign secretary's post. On Nov. 1, Howe resigned over Thatcher's lack of  commitment to a strong British role in Europe.  </P> <P> On Nov. 13, Howe, who had been regarded as a dedicated Thatcher loyalist,  electrified the House of Commons with a scathing speech giving his reasons for  his resignation. He openly criticized Thatcher and, in the view of many  observers, inflicted irreparable damage to her.  </P> <P> That opened the door for Heseltine, 57, who has long been regarded as the  strongest potential challenger to her leadership and who had resigned from the  Cabinet as defense secretary in 1986 over his differences with Thatcher.  </P> <P> Heseltine announced his candidacy for the leadership, and last Tuesday, while  Thatcher was at the Paris summit, ran well against her, holding her lead to  only 55%.  </P> <P> Under the party's complicated rules, Thatcher needed a majority plus 15% of the  votes of the 372 Tory members, which she narrowly failed to get, in part  because of the poor performance attributed to her campaign leaders in the  contest.  </P> <P> At first, the prime minister reacted in typical fashion: In Paris on Tuesday  and back in London on Wednesday afternoon, she vowed to fight Heseltine to the  finish.  </P> <P> But late Wednesday, a steady stream of ministers and aides -- dubbed the "men  in gray suits" -- called at 10 Downing St., most of them warning her that she  might lose next Tuesday's second ballot against Heseltine. Her husband, Denis,  also reportedly urged her to step down.  </P> <P> Rather than face the humiliation of defeat against a "backbench" member of  Parliament -- one who is not a party leader -- the prime minister reflected  long and hard and then, on Thursday morning, decided to step down, political  sources said. She was driven to Buckingham Palace to inform -ueen Elizabeth II,  who ultimately appoints prime ministers.  </P> <P> Her official announcement said: "Having consulted widely among colleagues, I  have concluded that the unity of the party and prospects of victory in a  general election would be better served if I stood down to enable Cabinet  colleagues to enter the ballot for the leadership."  </P> <P> In effect, Thatcher was forced from office -- a development that has surprised  and confused many observers abroad, since she still has not lost any election.  </P> <P> The question raised in political circles Thursday was whether Heseltine's  action would help or hurt the party in the run-up to the next election.  Heseltine has run well ahead of Thatcher in nationwide opinion polls, but his  opposition to the prime minister will be held against him by many colleagues.  </P> <P> Thatcher's daughter, Carol, spoke for many loyalists when she said of the  actions that forced her mother's resignation: "I think it is the most gutless  act of treachery -- after all she has done."  </P> <P> Member of Parliament Alan Clark declared of the Tories' leadership vote last  Tuesday: "It was a cowardly act to save their seats. They hid behind a cloak of  anonymity and voted against a leader who had run three elections.  </P> <P> "She was elected by 30 million people and tossed out by 150."  </P> <P> Ex-Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit, a Thatcher loyalist, said, "I think this was  a dreadful mistake, dumping the prime minister."  </P> <P> Novelist Jeffrey Archer, a former deputy Tory chairman, said, "For all the  wrong reasons, we have lost the greatest peacetime leader of this century."  </P> <P> Party Chairman Kenneth Baker, who urged her to stay in the race, said: "I am  very sad. It was a typically brave and selfless decision. She was an  outstanding leader of our country and the world. I do not believe we will see  her like again."  </P> <P> Former Deputy Prime Minister Howe, who began the erosion of her position, said,  "She will always be remembered as one of the greatest political leaders in our  history."  </P> <P> Of the three candidates for the Conservative leadership, there is still no  clear favorite.  </P> <P> Heseltine, who ran so strongly against Thatcher last week, would seem to be the  front-runner, but some Tory lawmakers are thought to have voted for him mainly  as a way of casting a ballot against Thatcher.  </P> <P> For his part, Heseltine said of the resignation, "She has made a remarkable  contribution to Britain's history and has led the country with great  distinction in the 1980s."  </P> <P> Hurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer Major, who are friends, said they both  decided to join Heseltine in the race so that their colleagues could choose the  candidate most likely to unify the party and take it into the next general  election.  </P> <P> As Hurd put it, "We could have done this in a smoke-filled room, but this is  the more open way for the party to make a decision."  </P> <P> Both he and Major have wide appeal among their colleagues in Parliament.  </P> <P> Hurd is the most experienced in tough jobs. He was a secretary for Northern  Ireland and the Home Office before becoming foreign secretary.  </P> <P> Major, 47, is the bright young man of the party, who seems to have few enemies.  However, some of his colleagues suggest that because of his youth, he may  comfortably be passed over for now.  </P> <P> Edwina Currie, a controversial member of Parliament who was forced out of the  Thatcher government and is a Heseltine supporter, argued Thursday that the  three-man race is an "undignified scramble."  </P> <P> "At a time like this, the Cabinet should be sticking together and putting  forward one name," she said.  </P> <P> For Thatcher's supporters, her bold handling of the Laborites' no-confidence  motion Thursday made her departure from government even more difficult to  accept.  </P> <P> But, as one said, "there are no happy endings in politics."  </P> <P> Worldwide reaction to Thatcher's announcement reflects admiration for her  achievements.

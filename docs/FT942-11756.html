			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Elswick focuses on core areas Elswick reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.48m in a year of increasing focus on its core areas of specialised print and packaging and agrochemicals. The outcome for the 12 months to end-January, struck after a restatement of Pounds 5.59m of goodwill written off in prior years, came from turnover up by Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 54.2m and compared with a profit of Pounds 1.91m. The restatement of goodwill arose on the disposal of Bomford Turner, sold for Pounds 7.7m last November, which helped to eliminate net borrowings. At the operating level, profits rose by 23 per cent from Pounds 2.88m to Pounds 3.55m, of which Pounds 1.35m came from discontinued operations. An exceptional provision of Pounds 400,000 was made at the year end in connection with surplus leasehold properties, compared with a Pounds 248,000 gain last time. Interest charges were cut from Pounds 971,000 to Pounds 536,000. Losses per share emerged at 1.14p (0.78p earnings) and a final dividend of 0.18p is proposed, making 0.33p (0.3p) for the year.</p>

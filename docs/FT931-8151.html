			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat near to franchise agreement with Holiday Inn QUEENS MOAT Houses and Holiday Inn, the Bass subsidiary, are close to concluding a new franchise agreement, but the number of hotels involved is smaller than expected. The agreement being discussed would result in a handful of Queens Moat hotels in the UK and on the continent adopting the Holiday Inn name. The total number involved is thought to be fewer than 10. It had been thought that the two companies were considering a more wide-ranging agreement with a larger number of Queens Moat hotels becoming Holiday Inn franchises. Although the deal being discussed could be extended to involve a greater number of hotels, this is unlikely in the immediate future. Queens Moat already runs one Holiday Inn in Newcastle and 19 on the continent. The agreement under discussion would only partly compensate Holiday Inn for the loss of 15 of its UK hotels last year to the Marriott chain. The hotels are owned by Scott's Hospitality, a Canadian company. Scott's switched to rival Marriott after its request to become Holiday Inn's master franchisee in the UK was rejected. Holiday Inn Worldwide plans to double the number of its hotels in France to about 40 by the mid-1990s, mainly by taking over existing hotels, Philip Rawstorne writes. The Holiday Inn brand will also be extended to seven hotels owned by the French Alliance group in which Holiday Inn has a 54 per cent stake. The expansion is part of a programme to lift the number of Holiday Inns in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from 125 to more than 200. See Markets</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by a Joint Investigative Group comprised of the </F> Party Central Committee Political Research Department's Rural  Group, the State Council Research Department's Rural Economy  Group, and the Ministry of Agriculture's Rural Research Center:  "Investigative Report on the Rural Shareholding System and  Shareholding Cooperative System"]    [Text] Different forms of the shareholding system and the  shareholding cooperative system have been spreading rapidly in  China's rural areas in recent years. This is a reorganization  and a new breakthrough in the system in the aftermath of the  family-based, output-related contract responsibility system as  the rural management organs adapt to the market economy and the  development of the productive forces. What is the future of the  development of this management style? What intrinsically brought  on this new style? What general and specific policies should we  adopt now? We brought these questions to Guangdong, Shandong,  Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Hebei as we conducted our  investigations and studied other typical local examples. In  association with NONGCUN TONGXUN ZAZISHI [RURAL COMMUNICATIONS  MAGAZINE PUBLISHER], we invited comrades from relevant research  units to a symposium in which the following basic viewpoints  were developed:  <H3>  Various Forms of the Shareholding System and Shareholding  Cooperative System Are Becoming an Important Management Style  and Organizational System in the Rural Areas </H3>   1. Like the family-based, output-related contract  responsibility system, the rural shareholding system and  shareholding cooperative system are chosen from among mass  practices and are the peasants' own magnificent creation.  In recent years, especially since Comrade Xiaoping's  southern-tour speech and the 14th National Party Congress, in  the wake of the development of the rural productive forces and  the growth of the market economy, the development of different  forms of rural shareholding system and shareholding cooperative  system has gained momentum, and they have become increasingly  widespread. Among industries, not only have they appeared in  many township enterprises but they have become popular in the  forestry and fishery industries and are gradually spreading to  the planting and breeding industries. Regionally, not only have  they developed quickly along the coastal areas and the suburbs,  but they are also growing in the central regions and showing up  in many western areas. In many localities, what used to be the  spontaneous action of the peasants and the grass-roots cadres  has turned into deliberate decisions at the leadership level. In  the wake of this vigorous development, these systems have taken  on many forms, and it has become difficult to use one name to  cover all of its rich contents. For simplicity's sake though, we  will temporarily call them rural shareholding systems.    2. The rural shareholding systems of different trades  have some common characteristics but also have their own  features. Township enterprises' shareholding system is  primarily a way to pool capital to set up factories. In some  cases, the collectives contribute land, buildings, and  equipment; the villagers contribute funds, technology, and  labor; and shares are calculated based on the price of factors  of production contributed. In other cases, it is not only a  joint effort between the collectives and the villagers but units  and individuals and even foreign businesses are also invited to  buy shares. And there are cases which started out with  collectives and peasants in individual townships and villages  pooling resources to set up factories, using labor to attract  capital or capital to attract labor. Everybody had the same  number of shares, giving each person one vote. But as those  enterprises developed and exceeded the share quota and the  community-set limit on the public's share participation, the  system was changed to give one vote to each share. We  encountered a typical example of this kind in a shareholding  enterprise in Laiyang City's Rulinbo Village in Shandong  Province. The village set up the Terrazzo Company, Ltd. in June  1992. Each share was worth 100 yuan, and a total of 29,700  shares were sold, generating share capital of 2.97 million yuan.  There are four kinds of stocks: One, collective shares -- the  village itself bought shares using its houses and land-use  rights and its own money; there are 13,420 such shares. Two,  workers' shares -- the workers bought 3,400 shares with their  own money. Three, public shares -- enterprises, institutions,  and groups bought 1,000 shares. Four, foreign-invested shares  --Hong Kong's Huayi Industrial Development Company bought shares  with their transportation equipment, office equipment, and spot  exchange, which converted to 11,880 shares. It took only four  months for this enterprise to go from preparation to production,  and it has already produced 10,000 sq m of terrazzo flooring  material.    The planting and breeding industries' shareholding system is  similar to those of the township enterprises. Here we will use  another example in Laiyang to explain the basic approach. A  prototype is Tuanwang Township's method of pooling resources to  build large, hothouse-type vegetable barns. Each share is worth  100 yuan, and there are 10,114 shares, generating 1.0114 million  yuan in capital. Specifically, the township government bought  2,000 shares; two villages bought shares with their land and  water conservancy facilities, which converted to 6,070 shares;  the peasant households that contracted to work the barns bought  1,330 shares; the villagers' labor input converted to 714  shares. The township used this method to build 102 large  vegetable barns which went into production last winter, and  today, they are generating nearly a million yuan in income.  Another typical example is the dairy cow farms set up in  Tangezhuang township under a joint stock system. Each share is  worth 1,000 yuan, and there are 271.1 shares, raising 271,100  yuan in capital. Specifically, the township's improved-breed  farm contributed the dairy cows, land, and equipment and has 105  shares; two villages used their dairy cows and cash to buy 163  shares; the workers' cash input converted to 3.1 shares. This  method brings into play not only the improved-breed farms' land,  equipment, and technological superiority but also the two  village's fund superiority and promotes the development of the  cattle industry.    The forestry industry's shareholding system primarily uses  stock conversion and resource-pooling to develop tree farms. In  Fujian's Sanming City, 80 percent of the villages use the  shareholding cooperative system to set up tree farms.  Specifically, one, the collective rights to the hillsides are  converted into shares, known as hillside shares; two, trees,  which are assets created by the villagers' labor input, planted  after the cooperative effort began are converted into shares,  known as basic shares; three, the villagers' input of cash,  technology, and labor are converted to shares, known as  investment shares. This approach is called "allocating shares  but not the hillsides; distributing dividends but not the  forests." Some localities have even crossed community  boundaries and let the state-run units, village collectives,  peasant households, and the general public set up tree farms and  develop forestry resources. As for orchard management, the  shareholding system is even more popular.    For the fishery industry's shareholding system, collective  fishing boats were converted to shares in the early days of  reform, but it has since developed into a system where the  fishermen pooled their resources to buy large fishing boats or  used their boats to buy shares into fishing companies. These  methods are constantly being developed in the coastal regions.  Using the shareholding system to set up fish farms and develop  fresh-water aquatics is increasingly popular in the interior  provinces. Some fishermen pool their resources with other  fishermen to set up joint operations; others pool their  resoruces with the village collectives, and some ignore the  boundaries between regions, trades, and ownership systems to  pool their resources in their operations. In localities rich in  fresh-water resources, such management styles have spread very  rapidly. Hubei Province's Hanchuan County alone has 79  shareholding fish farms.    Some production links have also adopted the method of  raising  capital and labor input as a way to pool resources and set up  service projects and operate them like enterprises. Inner  Mongolia's Qahar Qianqi has been using the shareholding system  to run their electric motor-pumped wells since 1988. They have  converted into shares their hydroelectric equipment purchased as  collective investment or with state-support funds and the  peasants' labor spent on drawing water, and the wells are  managed like enterprises. Whoever water the land must pay, and  the income earned is distributed according to the number of  shares. Some localities pool their resources to set up  farm-machinery service teams, repair services, and gas stations  to serve the peasant households. The results have been very good.    3. The shareholding system not only has spread to many  rural trades but has become a part of many different economic  components. Many localities' village collective enterprises,  community collective economic organizations, and individual  private economies have introduced the shareholding system or  have restructured themselves under the shareholding system.  To reorganize themselves under the shareholding system, rural  collective enterprises first sort out their assets and have them  assessed. Equity rights are drawn up according to the primitive  sources of the existing stock of assets; meanwhile, enterprise  workers and the general public are invited to buy shares with  cash. Generally, equity shares are divided into the following  types: Village collective shares -- they are created by the  village collective economic organizations' direct investments,  and the shares belong to all members of the community;  enterprise shares -- they are created by the enterprise's own  profit retention, and the shares belong to the entire enterprise  staff; staff allocated shares -- they are accumulated by the  workers' labor and are only the basis for distribution and  cannot be redeemed, transferred, put up as collateral, or  bequeathed; workers' investment shares--they are newly created  by the workers' cash input; public shares--they are created by  group or individual investors; foreign-funded shares--they are  created by foreign investors. The last three kids of investment  shares can be redeemed, transferred, collateralized, and  bequeathed.    As far as we know, the earliest example of introduction of  the shareholding system into the community collective economic  organizations is in Zibo City's Changxing Village in Shandong  Province. When this village was implementing the output-related  constract responsibility system in the early 1980's, it already  had five enterprises and more than 3 million yuan in fixed  assets. In the course of promoting the separate household  contract responsibility system, only the cheap, consumptive farm  tools were distributed on the first day, and it went smoothly.  On the second day, they simply could not find a way to allocate  the village's nine cows: If several households shared one cow,  it would be difficult to raise, and it would be of little use.  Some people suggested slaughtering the cows and selling the meat  for money. The party branch secretary halted the allocation  process, and upon giving it a lot of thought, he came up with  the idea of allocating shares but not the assets. After a  thorough discussion by the villagers, this method was applied to  most fixed assets. Subsequently, this village's economy really  took off, and today, it has 15 industrial enterprises and has  become the first village in the area to generate more than 100  million yuan in output value. In the wake of very rapid economic  development, the collectives in Shenzhen City's Baoan District  and Guangzhou's Tianhe District, which are at the leading edge  of reform and opening up, have become increasingly wealthy, and  the villagers are increasingly more vocal about participating in  management and sharing in the profits. The collectives have also  brought in the shareholding system. Their common approach is to  assess the value of the communities' collective properties and  convert them into shares. Some become collective shares, and  some become personal shares. The collective shares' dividends  are used on expanded reproduction and collective welfare;  personal shares are only basis for dividend distribution and  cannot be redeemed, transferred, put up as collateral, or  bequeathed.    Examples of individual private economies and household-run  enterprises that are linked to the collectives adopting the  shareholding system are fairly common in Zhejiang's Wenzhou,  Anhui's Fuyang, and Guangdong's Shantou. Some of their  enterprises occupy collective lands or factory buildings; some  utilize the collectives' business reputation; some are given tax  exemptions and reductions under the state's preferential  policies, and they draw up property rights by converting their  properties to shares. Perhaps it was for the purpose of  expanding the business scope or for mobilizing workers'  enthusiasm, or because of the state's preferential treatment  toward the collective economies, or because of their intention  to turn into a cooperative economy, some enterprises too have  invited their own staff and workers or the community's own  collectives to buy shares, or they sell shares to the public as  a way of converting to the shareholding system or shareholding  cooperative system and set up new operating mechanisms.    4. The different forms of rural shareholding system and  shareholding cooperative system fall into two major  categories. The first category is those businesses for  which people pooled resources to create because they were  motivated by the concentration of factors of production. In  terms of the entities that actually pooled their resource, some  are partnerships among peasants; some are partnerships between  peasants and collectives; some are partnerships of different  components, including peasants, collectives, the state's  relevant units, social groups and individuals, and may even  include foreign businesses, etc. In terms of the different forms  of organization, some are integrated shareholding entities run  by the peasants; some are enterprises whose shares are held  internally; some are shareholding cooperatives and associations;  some are shareholding companies that sell shares to the public;  and some are enterprise groups pooling their resources. Their  common characteristics are that they are all market-oriented,  and efficiency is their goal, and profit is their link, and they  put together funds, land, housing, equipment, technologies,  labor and other factors of production by pooling resources and  buying shares. They become economic communities with many  property owners [as published] and become a productive force  very quickly. Among such economic organizations, some are very  much like cooperatives; others cross the boundaries that  separate different trades, communities, and ownership systems  and give one vote to each share and implement a decision-making  system comprising of the shareholders, the board of directors,  and factory directors (managers); they are very much like a  modern shareholding system.    The second category is the restructured entities motivated  at  first by the need to resolve the internal conflict of economic  interests within the community collective economy and  enterprises themselves. The common characteristic of these  economic organizations is that they define property rights by  assessing the original assets, converting them into shares, and  setting up mechanisms to resolve the conflicts of interest among  collectives and between the collectives and individuals. After  the community collective economy and village collective  enterprises adopted the shareholding system, because most equity  shares allocated under the names of individuals cannot be  redeemed, transferred, put up as collateral, or bequeathed;  because the enterprises are managed democratically according to  the principles of cooperation which give each person one vote,  and because there is nonseverable common accumulation, it very  much resembles a cooperative system. On the other hand, in the  restructuring of the individual, private economy, some convert  assets to shares or offer shares to the village collectives or  enterprise workers while embracing the principles of the  cooperative system; they are more like a cooperative system.  Others convert assets or sell shares to the public and make  decisions and allocations according to the principles of the  shareholding system; they are more like the shareholding system.    5. Looking at the developmental trend, there is a  tendency for the restructured shareholding economy to gradually  merge with the newly created shareholding economy. While  more and more rural economic organizations are being  restructured under the shareholding system, they are also  recruiting investors and pooling capital to expand enterprise  scale and are gradually turning one-man-one-vote into  one-man-multiple-votes and one-share-one-vote, thus displaying  even more of the of characteristics of the newly created  shareholding enterprises. For various reasons, practice has  caused the rural shareholding system to resemble the cooperative  system even more, and some localities have even named all  economic alliances formed under the shareholding system the  "shareholding cooperative system." If we look at international  experiences, the cooperative system tends to have more vitality  in the agricultural and tertiary industries while the  shareholding system is more popular among the industrial  enterprises. Judging by the law of development of the modern  market economy and China's rural practices, the diverse forms of  the rural shareholding system and shareholding cooperative  system will become an important management style. As the  township enterprises and other nonagricultural sectors develop,  they may even become the primary management style in some  localities.  <H3>  The Emergence of the Rural Shareholding System and  Shareholding Cooperative System Was an Intrinsic, Objective  Inevitability; They Will Play an Important Role in Promoting the  Development of the Rural Socialist Market Economy </H3>   6. A precondition to the rural shareholding and  shareholding cooperative systems' rapid development is the rapid  development of the rural commodity economy and rapid market  expansion. In this kind of economic environment, an  economic organization must attain a certain scale, handle the  internal interest relationships properly, improve management and  administration, and enhance its own ability to adapt to changes  in order to effectively enter the market place and expand its  market share amid competition. The shareholding system and the  shareholding cooperative system have flourished in recent years  because they not only uphold the property owners' ownership  rights in and the right to the profit generated by the factors  of production but they also optimize the composition of various  factors of production to meet the objective needs of the  development of the rural socialist market economy.    7. The most striking feature of the rural shareholding  system is its ability to gather various kinds of scattered  factors of production and management quickly and create a new  productive force quickly. Marx said, "If we had to wait for  accumulation to enable a unit of capital to grow to the point  that it could repair the railroad, I am afraid we still would  not have a railroad today. But the shareholding companies can  accomplish this task in no time." This ability of the  shareholding system to raise capital is the main reason for its  rapid development. In our investigation in Hubei's Xiangfan, we  learned that the city began testing the shareholding cooperative  system last year, and by March of this year, it has raised more  than 300 million yuan and set up 1,820 shareholding cooperative  projects. This left us with a even deeper impression of the  fund-gathering ability of the shareholding system. Many  localities have been able to use the shareholding cooperative  system to block the massive flow of rural funds to the cities,  and they have turned the peasants' consumption funds into  production funds. Today, many localities' peasants not only have  money in the banks but they also have idle money under their  mattresses and in their suitcases. If we can use the  shareholding system and the shareholding cooperative system,  which the peasants are happy to accept, to gather the scattered  funds and other factors of production and set up various  production and management projects, it no doubt will have a  tremendous effect on the development of the rural economy.    8. The rural shareholding system also helps to break  the bounds of different regions, departments, trades, and  ownership systems and uses the market economic mechanisms to  optimize resource allocation and expand production and  management scopes, so that the rural economy can become an even  bigger and broader market. In our investigation, we saw an  example of "chicken wings turning into airplane wings" that  helped one rural economy take off. In 1989, Shandong's Yantai  City's Dongmotang village greatly expanded its export of chicken  wings and gained fame as a wealthy village. In 1990, it invested  12.5 million yuan and entered into a partnership with the  railroad department to build railway freight yards. At that  time, the central government leading comrades encouraged them,  saying, "Think big, do big things, and you not only can build  railway freight yards, you can even run a civilian airline."  Last September, they really pooled resources with the Great Wall  Airline Company. The shareholding company has helped this  village that sits next to the airport and the railroad "take  off." Last year, its total income topped 150 million yuan. This  year, they have set up a Sino-foreign shareholding enterprise in  a joint venture with some Hong Kong and Shenzhen companies.    9. The rural shareholding system plays an important  role in perfecting the rural collective enterprises' management  and administration system and operating mechanisms and in  setting up an enterprise system that meets the needs of the  development of the socialist market economy. In the rural  areas, many of the village collective enterprises shared the  same serious problem: they were unable to manifest all the  attributes of a collective. The cadres said that the enterprises  belonged to everybody, but the people said they belonged to the  cadres. This problem reflected the collective enterprises'  ill-defined property rights, inability to separate the  government from enterprises, and inability to straighten the  interest relationships. From the point of the relationship  between enterprises and the village leadership, enterprises were  still plagued by administrative interventions and unreasonable  burdens. From the point of enterprises' internal relationships,  there was no restraining mechanism, and the masses could not  apply effective supervision. When the village enterprises adopt  the shareholding system, property rights are defined when assets  are converted to shares to create many property owners, and  power, responsibility, and profit are integrated by share  ownership. According to the masses, "the shareholding system  links responsibility, profit, and hearts." A screw dropped on  the floor is still one's property, and it will be picked up. A  village cadre from Shandong's Laiyang said to us, "Once we  gathered some cadres to visit Yantai and wanted to use the  village-run enterprise's car. The factory director told us that  we now had to answer to the board of directors above and the  shareholders below and could no longer use the car as we  pleased. He turned us down. This proves that the shareholding  system can truly keep the village administrative organs in line  so that the village enterprises can make their own management  decisions, take responsibility for their own profits and losses,  initiate their own development, and discipline themselves."    10. The rural shareholding system and shareholding  cooperative system play an important role in stabilizing and  perfecting the responsibility system -- led by the family-based,  output-related contract system -- and in amplifying the two-tier  management system and the socialized service system that  integrate centralization and decentralization. Judging by  local practices, using the shareholding system to develop the  water conservancy project, the farm machinery service team, the  large vegetable barns, the forests and orchards, etc., we can  effectively enhance the service capability of collective  centralized management, help to tap the family-based contract  management system's potential, and solve problems individual  families and households cannot solve. In some localities, the  science and research units, the agricultural colleges, the  supply and marketing departments, and the peasants unite under  the shareholding system to form a new community that share the  same interests, and that has improved the socialized  agricultural system and has vigorously promoted high-output,  high-quality, high-efficiency agricultural development.  <H3>  Policy Suggestions for Promoting Healthy Development of the  Rural Shareholding System and the Shareholding Cooperative System </H3>   11. More and more people have come to recognize the  important role of the rural shareholding system and the  shareholding cooperative system in deepening the reform,  promoting opening up, and promoting development. Some  localities have made promoting the shareholding cooperative  system an important move in the development of the rural  socialist market economy. They provide careful guidance and  active support, and they have had good results. But many  localities are still not paying sufficient attention to the  rural shareholding and shareholding cooperative system. Today,  some problems are jeopardizing the healthy development of the  rural shareholding system. Primarily: a) There are no definitive  guiding ideology and complete policies and laws and regulations.  Many grass-roots cadres fail to hold up state policies and are  afraid to do anything. b) There is no minimum, unified  understanding of the different kinds of rural shareholding  system and shareholding cooperative system, nor is there a  proper administrative system. For similar types of enterprises,  some are registered as collective enterprises; others are  registered as shareholding cooperative enterprises, shareholding  enterprises, or private enterprises, and this makes the  implementation of the tax, credit loan, and other policies  chaotic. c) The rural shareholding system itself is  under-developed; it is not standardized and not complete. With  regard to assessing property values, determining equity rights,  verifying equity shares, distributing share dividends, and  circulating equity rights and so on, different localities and  economic organizations have different methods that can vary  significantly. For example to prove equity rights, some issue  beautiful stock certificates, some issue share certificates,  some issue receipts, and some issue no documented proof, which  often leads to disputes.    12. The development of the shareholding system and  shareholding cooperative system in essence is a reshaping of the  rural micrcoeconomic organization to meet the needs of the  market economy. In this respect, not only the masses of  peasants and grass-roots cadres but also the decision-making  strata of various levels and departments must go through a  learning, understanding, and practical process. They must not be  impatient and rush into mass action. Starting out from the  reality of China's rural areas, perhaps the general principle  for dealing with the different types of rural shareholding  systems may be to "guide the action according to circumstances  and set standards in gradual steps."    Guiding the action according to circumstances means  encouraging the peasants and using different forms of the rural  shareholding system to combine the factors of production to  promote the development of the rural socialist market economy.  Regardless of which form, so long as it helps to raise the  standard of the rural productive forces, it should be vigorously  supported. We must base the development of the rural  shareholding system on the standard of the rural productive  forces and the wishes of the masses. We should never go against  the people's wishes, even less should we use administrative  orders to force them to do something.    Setting standards in gradual steps means, as the system  develops, we should use policies, laws and provisions, and  regulations to put it on the legalized, institutionalized track.  However, standardization does not mean rejecting  diversification, even less stifling the creativity of the masses.    13. In order to promote the healthy development of the  rural shareholding system, the following points urgently need to  be further clarified:    We should advocate using the shareholding system to raise  capital to launch agricultural development, rural  infrastructure, and hydroelectric power projects and other  socialized services to stabilize and perfect the responsibility  system as led by the family-based, out-put related contract  system.    We should encourage the village households to work with the  state's relevant enterprises and institutional units and the  general public to set up different types of township enterprises  under the shareholding system.    We should use examples to guide the village collective  enterprises, delineate property rights based on their assessed  value and their sources, and accept other shareholding systems  when restructuring enterprises. Those who are not willing to  change should not be forced to do so.    We should allow community collective economic organizations  to adopt the shareholding system and turn the collective economy  into a shareholding cooperative economy.    We should support the individual, private economies in  restructuring themselves under the shareholding system. Share  conversion must be fair and equitable. Stock participation  should be voluntary. The principles of the cooperative system  should also be brought in; the essence of the shareholding  cooperative system should be recognized.    We should encourage the people to use the shareholding  system  to achieve enterprise mergers and combinations and set up  shareholding enterprises and enterprise groups.    We should encourage people to cooperative with foreign  businesses to set up "three kinds of wholly or partially  foreign-owned" shareholding enterprises.    In view of the fact that the rural shareholding system  is already fairly widespread, we suggest prompt and proper  formulation of some guiding principles and policies. This should  be accomplished before the end of the year and should best be in  the form of a central government or State Council special  document. In order to formulate practical general and  specific policies, we should do more investigations and studies  and review the masses of peasants' creations and local practical  experiences. We suggest that the pertinent departments  diligently study and formulate legislation-type regulations. We  must start out from the rural areas' actual conditions and  reference the general principles of a modern market economy when  setting legal standards. The departments should promptly come up  with some suggestions on how to deal with problems that urgently  need to be resolved -- such as assessment of the value of  properties for stock conversion, registration of legal persons,  and circulation of equity rights.</p>

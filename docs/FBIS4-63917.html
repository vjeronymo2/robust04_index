			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Threats" rubric: </F> "Military-Industrial Enterprises Could Go Bust. Defense Sector  To Mark 9 June With Whistles"]    [Text] Defense sector trade union chairmen have sent an  appeal to State Duma and Federal Assembly deputies expressing  their "concern over repeated cuts in the expenditure on weapons  and military hardware procurements, military research and  development in the draft federal budget for 1994." In the  opinion of the trade union leaders, the government should have  "canceled the state order that is already being carried out"  altogether because there will be just enough money to repay  debts for products already manufactured and to operate weapons  and equipment. In this case, however, around 80 percent of  defense enterprises will go bankrupt, 1.4 million workers will  be laid off, and it will take around 30 trillion rubles to pay  unemployment benefits alone. The spending cuts and the  cancellation of the state order, the trade union activists  think, will bring about a situation where "the country will be  stripped of its means of defense and will have to procure  armaments and military hardware abroad."    Given that, the trade union chairmen of the aviation,  defense, general-purpose engineering, and radioelectronic  industries wrote: "The workers collectives insist that the  financing for weapons and military hardware procurements and  military research and development should stay at the level  established by the 1994 state order," and also that credit lines  be opened for conversion programs and measures taken to increase  the budget revenues "by creating incentives for production  growth, fully collecting taxes, and organizing the sales of  weapons, military hardware, and civilian products to foreign  countries in the most efficient fashion with producer  enterprises being directly involved in such sales."    According to information received by your SEGODNYA  correspondent at the Central Council of the All-Russia Trade  Union of Defense Industry Workers, the trade union executive's  decision to suspend the production of civilian and non-food  consumer goods at the enterprises for 5-10 minutes on 9 June "to  support demands that wages be paid and jobs retained" still  remains valid. All trade unions of the defense industry have  given their backing to the action during which sirens, whistles,  and so forth will be switched on at military-industrial  enterprises. It is expected that on 9 June rallies and meetings  will take place at many defense enterprises to discuss whether  an all-Russia strike in the military- industrial sector should  be called in the near future.</p>

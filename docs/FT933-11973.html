			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Personal View: Gatt effort must not be wasted Seven years after the current Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade began, there are renewed hopes that the negotiations will be successfully concluded. However, before considering how this might be achieved, it is worth asking whether the circumstances of 1986 remain the same and, if so, whether the objectives are still valid. Substantial changes have taken place: The world political framework has been transformed, through, for example, the end of the cold war. Eastern European countries are being transformed into market economies and are becoming part of the world trade system, although some have not yet completed their process of integration to Gatt. Developing countries are achieving significant structural change. According to Gatt data, there are 72 governments that have adopted policies for commercial liberalisation. Regional and sub-regional integration aimed at providing better commercial conditions within member countries has made great headway. And in 1992 alone, the secretary of Gatt recorded 17 new regional agreements on trade. Growth in international trade in 1992, both of merchandises (4.5 per cent in volume) and services (8 per cent), would suggest that the conclusion of the Uruguay round has not been necessary in the promotion of the world trade. However, it would be a serious mistake to leave it like this, as the growth was due to a convergence of factors and not to a consolidated trend. The tendency since 1988 has been for trade and world production to slow down. A balanced and substantial package is needed to achieve economic expansion through world trade. According to recent studies, the opening of product markets as a consequence of the Uruguay round would inject as much as USDollars 200bn annually into the international economy. With this, trade will become the basis for the development and growth of nations. Likewise, common rules must be reinforced in the process of regional integration, enabling all parties to benefit from the expansion of world trade. This process not only has to be consistent with the articles of Gatt but also has to converge with the principles and objectives of international free trade and of multilateralism. A successful conclusion of the negotiations is essential for strengthening the economic reforms and the liberalisation processes of developing countries, which have been frequently undertaken under difficult political and social conditions. This effort should not be wasted, as it is a vital factor in integrating developing economies within the international economic trade system. As for industrialised countries, the growth of world trade within a more stable, balanced and foreseeable framework will lead to macroeconomic stability, with favourable consequences for employment and investment. At the same time, it will slow down protectionist trends and will help to eliminate commercial tensions and deter countries from introducing commercially retaliatory measures. The answer to these challenges cannot lie on technical arguments, for, after seven years of negotiations, the problems and their likely solutions have already been thoroughly identified. The Final Act Draft, presented in 1991 by Mr Arthur Dunkel, former director-general of Gatt, is an adequate basis to reach final agreements and comply with the goals of the Punta del Este Declaration. The conclusion of the Uruguay round must be regarded as the political responsibility of the participating governments which would have to be ready to assess and make the concessions which the global agreement demands. The recent Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo seems to show the clear and concise will of the principal commercial partners to conclude the negotiations. This has contributed to the round's relaunch and has given it the impulse for Gatt secretary-general, Mr Peter Sutherland, to proceed towards the final stage, one of the thorniest of the round. The responsibility of the G7 members in the conclusion of the round is undoubtedly great, but the success of negotiations will depend upon the effort and the commitment which all 113 contracting parties of the Gatt assign to this enterprise. All of them must encourage the growth, development and economic welfare of their own countries as an essential step towards strengthening the supreme values of democracy, social justice, freedom and dignity.

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: WestLB raises Thomas Cook stake to 86% WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the acquisitive Dusseldorf-based public-sector bank, has increased its stake in the Thomas Cook travel business from 10 per cent to 86 per cent. Despite investigations by the Berlin cartel office into its mounting influence over the booming German travel industry, WestLB said yesterday its holding in the former Midland Bank subsidiary was to be combined with other travel and tourism interests in a new wholly-owned subsidiary, TCT Touristik Beteiligungs. These include a 17 per cent stake in the Walter Kahn Verwaltungs group, which in turn holds 30 per cent of the equity in TUI, Europe's biggest travel agent. According to WestLB calculations, the bank's interest in Kahn gives it a 5 per cent share in TUI. The deal appears to mark the end of a complex process which started in June last year when LTU, the charter flight and holidays company of which WestLB owns 34 per cent, agreed to buy 90 per cent of Thomas Cook from the Midland Bank. WestLB simultaneously took an option on the remainder of the stock. The sale was concluded in September, when the purchasers paid Midland Pounds 200m plus an undisclosed proportion of Thomas Cook's 1992 profits. As WestLB explained yesterday, LTU is left with 14 per cent in the once British group. Meanwhile, the bank, which has built a similarly complicated web of holdings and cross-holdings in many industries, remains under close scrutiny by the federal cartel authorities which are concerned over its growing power in the travel business. They are examining its interests in Horten, a retailing group, which has a 50 per cent share in another travel-oriented holding company, HS Touristik Beteiligungs, with a further 25 per cent in TUI. Although WestLB holds only 25 per cent of Horten directly, the cartel office claims it has an indirect majority share. The authorities recently won a temporary injunction banning Horten from exercising its voting rights at TUI meetings. A full court hearing has been scheduled for January 11.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Travel: The town that lives by the gun DEALING in death has been good for Darra. At first sight, this tiny, dusty hamlet strung out along a 'main' road 35 kms south of Peshawar, in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, seems indistinguishable from all the other tiny, dusty hamlets in the area. Until one goes shopping . . . 'Kalashnikov?' smiles the gap-toothed proprietor of Ali's Arms Store. 'Very good weapon, very good. But now not so good. Now we make the barrels from poor building steel, which melts. Or this: Lee Enfield. Very good gun, very strong. Or this one: Luger, same as Germans. Very good gun, very cheap. Ammunition no problem. You want one?' Darra is the arms factory of the NWF Province, a one-stop, drive-in ammunition dump for local tribesmen (mainly Pathans), ex-Mujahideens from Afghanistan, political militants, rivals with scores to settle, people with expensive 'shipments' to protect, even the occasional foreign 'guest'. The whole village, hundreds of people, and many more in the area, is dedicated to forging - even down to the serial number - almost every type of weapon, new and old, invented in the world's munitions factories. The Pakistan police and army have no authority here. Cash is king. The Soviets may have pulled out of nearby Afghanistan, but business in Darra is still booming. In every roadside stall Lee Enfield rifles old and new are lined up in their dozens. Wicked little Uzis hang on rusty nails next to shiny M16s. World War Two Sten gun copies are tucked in every corner. Revolvers and pistols of every kind are stacked high: Lugers, Berettas, snub-nosed Mausers, Colt .45s, Walther PPKs. Bullets spill from cardboard boxes. Shells rattle on the shelves. Prices start from about Pounds 30 for a perfectly decent, perfectly deadly, Saturday Night Special. Try before you buy, everyone else does. The street echoes with gunfire as tribesmen heft a prospective purchase, swing it to their shoulders and send a stream of bullets into the hills that loom over Darra. Tight knots of men mull over the merits of stock and trigger action. Delivery is usually 'arranged' later, away from tribal customs posts. Afraid of loud noises? Silencers can be arranged. Or how about a blade? British Commando knives, SS daggers, bayonets, stilettos - all sharpened on the spot and very cheap. Brass knuckle-dusters, coshes, bandoliers, holsters: name your price. Ingenuity abounds. Rifle mechanisms are hidden in walking sticks. An officer's swagger stick conceals a needle-thin rapier. Cheapest of all - yours for Rp100 (about Pounds 2.20) - is the pen gun. Unscrew the barrel, drop in a .22 bullet, reassemble, pull back the spring-loaded barrel top, press the clip to release the spring and the 'toy' splits the air with a deafening bang. Off the main street are the gun 'factories', shacks generally specialising in one part of the production process. Here is the man who can hand-rifle a gun barrel, here the man who makes the trigger mechanism. Boys of six or seven squat in the dust polishing walnut stocks to a glistening sheen. In one shack an anti-tank rocket launcher is propped against the wall, complete with shells. Are they live? The stallholder shrugs: he knows a window shopper when he sees one. There is a small mosque off the main street. In a guest room a village elder offers us sandwiches and garish sponge cakes, and the sweetest of almonds. The Pakistani government prefers to keep Darra off the official tourist track, but the villagers are getting used to their crowd-pulling notoriety, and permits and guides can be obtained - after a little bureaucratic wrangling - through the Khyber Political Agency. Independent travellers can often get through simply by donning the 'disguise' of an Afghan hat and cloak - but it is not recommended. After high tea, more locals demonstrate their machine-guns, then it is our turn. I am too frightened, but others in my group grab the weapons gleefully. The air fills with thunder. Empty cartridge shells rain down. The locals laugh and clap. I retreat behind a pillar, feeling sick.</p>

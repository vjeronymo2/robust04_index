			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Plan Is Reportedly To `Clean Up His </F> Image' as a Candidate; Sergio Ramirez' Expulsion, A Trick?"]    [Text] The so-called "hardline" of the FSLN [Sandinist  National Liberation Front], which emerged the winner in the  party's special congress, is also seeking to topple Dr. Sergio  Ramirez as leader of the parliamentarian bloc. Monica  Baltodano, after being elected a member of the National  Directorate, said that "some decisions regarding the operation  of the Sandinist bloc will be made."    Baltodano, who is characterized by maintaining radical  positions, added that the congress did not discuss a motion  making "the Sandinist Assembly the body responsible for  appointing the head of the Sandinist bloc." Baltodano said that  "the head of the Sandinist bloc should be a member of the  National Directorate [DN]." Ramirez, the current bloc leader,  was purged from the DN.    Rumors that the removal of Ramirez from the DN could be just  another Sandinist trick to "clean his image" to be a  presidential candidate intensified today. If he wins, Daniel  Ortega and his people would join Ramirez in sharing power as in  the eighties. The two Sandinist newspapers today redoubled  their support for Dr. Ramirez despite his defeat in the party's  internal elections, and this seems to be a significant  development.    Dr. Ramirez, who headed a current that opposed Ortega,  tendered his resignation yesterday to the plenary of the  Sandinist parliamentarian bloc, but it was not accepted. "We  rejected Ramirez' resignation and ratified him unanimously,"  said Dora Maria Tellez during a news conference.    Sandinist sociologist and economist Oscar Rene Vargas told  BARRICADA yesterday that there will reportedly be purges within  the FSLN. Vargas quoted "Democratic Left" spokesman Julio Lopez  as saying that the following will be purged: BARRICADA Director  Carlos Fernando Chamorro, EL NUEVO DIARIO Deputy Director Dr.  Danilo Aguirre Solis, and Sandinist bloc leader Dr. Sergio  Ramirez. Alejandro Serrano Caldera, rector of the UNAN [National  Autonomous University of Nicaragua], will reportedly be replaced  by Javier Pichardo.    "The appointment of the Sandinist bloc leader has so far  been  an internal election," Baltadano said, suggesting that the  Sandinist Assembly will intervene in the affairs of her party's  parliamentarian bloc. "If the Sandinist Assembly has received  the mandate of electing, from among DN members, the secretary  for organization and the secretary for international relations  and propaganda, with much added reason the Sandinist Assembly  will have a much greater role in the leadership of the Sandinist  bloc," she added.    William Ramirez said yesterday, during a news conference in  which Sergio Ramirez was ratified as bloc leader, that the bloc  has its own internal rules. "There is no need to be a member of  the DN or member of the Sandinist Assembly to become bloc chief,  deputy chief, or member of a bloc committee," William Ramirez  added. He pointed out that Dr. Sergio Ramirez was not a DN  member when he became leader of the parliamentarian bloc.    At the special congress, Sergio Ramirez followers obtained  30  percent of the Congress delegates' votes compared to an  overwhelming 70 percent obtained by Ortega's supporters.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish on 26  January, on page A2, carries a 600-word article by Rafael Rey  Rey entitled "The Mote in Another's Eye," referring to the  recent visit by the U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American  affairs, Alexander Watson.    The commentary states that although the U.S. delegation had  to admit the progress made by Peru during the past few years in  various fields, it still let Peru know that the U.S. Government  and Congress "are still concerned and closely watching Peruvian  developments and have recommendations to make in the human  rights field."    It then goes on to say that it would be a good thing if  these  recommendations were directed to the human rights of the victims  of terrorism, the unemployed, the homeless, the hungry, and the  uneducated, but that unfortunately there are only 180 alleged  cases of torture reported by an unknown organization for the  defense of human rights.    Rey then rejects the so-called human rights defense  institutions that only damage the country's image with their  "distorted" reports, and notes that the members of the Peruvian  leftist, Marxist, and socialists sectors, as well as opposition  members, who used to greet U.S. representatives with insults in  the past now enthusiastically applaud the U.S. recommendations.    After explaining that a U.S. delegation member was unable to  say with what moral authority the United States, with numerous  cases of human rights violations, made recommendations on human  rights, the article ends by stating that if the U.S. Government  and Congress fail to acknowledge Peru's achievements after this  visit, it is time for Peru to clearly tell the United States  that, although it appreciates its aid and cooperation, it is no  longer willing to be humiliated.    Lima EXPRESO in Spanish on 26 January, on page A26, carries  a  1,100-word "commentary" by Federico Prieto Celi entitled "One  Should Not Wash One's Dirty Linen in Public," also referring to  Watson's visit.    The article comments that the visit has revealed that those  who followed Moscow in the past now are siding with Washington's  reports on the Peruvian Government's alleged shortcomings before  another government as if Peru were its subordinate.    The commentary says Washington has gained courage with the  USSR's downfall and feels entitled to tell Peru how to behave  when the United States itself has serious human rights problems.  The "commentary" notes that in democracy each country should  solve its own problems with its own tools, and that those who  "talk about dependency and domination are not valid  interlocutors to tell Washington today what they told Moscow  yesterday about what the Lima Government should be."    The "commentary" ends by stating that democracy is not a  product the United States exports, and that Peruvians should  calmly realize that the national problems and solutions do not  come from abroad but rather from their own roots, their current  challenges, and the democratic will of the people.</p>

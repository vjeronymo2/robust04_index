			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: Toye incurs Pounds 742,000 losses Toye and Company, a maker of civil and military regalia, fell from profits of Pounds 373,000 to losses of Pounds 742,000 pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. The loss was struck after taking account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 202,000 for rationalisation and reorganisation. Turnover fell Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 5.52m, the shortfall being blamed almost entirely on a sharp fall in profitable exports. Losses per share emerged at 24.8p (earnings 10.6p).</p>

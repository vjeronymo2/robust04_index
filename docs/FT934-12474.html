			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (8): Dollars 50bn world market in turmoil / Desk-Top Personal Computers LITTLE more than a decade after the first IBM PCs began to appear on desktops, the Dollars 50bn-a-year world personal computer market is in turmoil. Prices are falling, new and more powerful microprocessors are arriving, distribution channels are changing and the industry's customers face an unprecedented range of choices. Meanwhile, technological advances have continued to accelerate shortening product cycles and putting tremendous computing power on the desktop - Digital Equipment's new Alpha PC claims to deliver 99 per cent of the performance of a Cray-1 supercomputer. In the office, most PCs and desktop workstations are now hooked together in local area networks enabling them to share data and peripherals like high-speed printers and other sophisticated equipment including network fax machines, scanners and optical storage devices. The rapid growth of PC 'clone' manufactures in the late 1980s and a wide range of second-tier or 'no-name' players on both sides of the Atlantic selling even cheaper hardware using commodity components bought in South East Asia and the Far East has shaken the PC industry to its foundations. The new competition coupled with the general move away from proprietary hardware towards open systems and the associated trend towards 'downsizing,' eventually forced even the older established computer manufacturers to re-assess their PC strategies and go head-to-head with their new rivals. Over the past two years all the large PC manufacturers including IBM, Compaq, ICL and Olivetti have hit back at the clone makers with new low-price machines of their own. The result has been wave upon wave of price-cutting as manufacturers have sought to boost market share to offset dwindling margins. But tumbling prices, slim margins and the disappearance of customer loyalty have taken their toll. A steady stream of small and not-so-small clone makers on both sides of the Atlantic have failed or been forced to pull out of the PC market leading to speculation that the market will be dominated by a handful of super-efficient players by the turn of the century. Even Dell, one of the most successful of the new breed of PC manufacturers, has stumbled and been forced to adjust its strategy and undertake a significant restructuring following 10 years of explosive growth. Many other big manufacturers including Olivetti in Europe admit they do not make money on their PC business. Some manufacturers have responded to these competitive challenges by developing their systems integration and computer services businesses, aiming to deliver to customers what Mark Churchward, divisional manager for Olivetti's UK document management division, describes as a 'business process engineering approach.' Others computer groups have built strategic alliances to share costs and minimise the risks. Nevertheless it is difficult to remain a serious player in the data processing industry and ignore the PC sector. According to Dataquest, the information technology consultancy, the PC accounted for about 45 per cent of world-wide computer industry revenues last year - almost as much as mainframe and mini-computers revenues combined. The rapid changes in the PC industry have however shifted the balance of power towards other players like Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer whose microprocessor chips power the vast majority of PCs, and the software companies such as Microsoft with its MS/DOS operating system, highly successful Windows 'environment' and wide range of business software packages, and Novell, which sells the most popular networking software. Over the past 18 months, Intel has delivered a raft of new processors including low power versions its top selling chips and a range of upgradeable 'clock-doubled' processors built around its 80486 microprocessor as well as its new high power Pentium processor. But Intel no longer has the PC processor market to itself. New chips from its rivals, AMD and Cyrix, have added to the recent proliferation of 32-bit PC processor types. Meanwhile, Digital Equipment has delivered the first of it 64-bit Alpha AXP chips based on 64-bit RISC (reduced instruction set computing) technology and IBM has launched the first PC workstation based on the PowerPC microprocessor jointly developed by IBM, Apple and Motorola, the second largest chip manufacturer. The first PowerPC chip, the 601, has been priced at about half the cost of Intel's Pentium processor, signalling what some believe will be the start of a 1990s 'chip war' as rival manufactures and technologies battle for control of the desktop. But do customers need the additional processing power of Pentium, Alpha and PowerPC? Mr Mike Glennon of Dataquest is in no doubt that there is a place for Pentium, the more difficult question he says is how big a place. He sees applications like image transmission, PC-based video-conferencing and high speed networking creating the demand for these more powerful processors. PowerPC chips will be used in future generations of Apple machines but Mr Glennon is less convinced about the Alpha chip which is very powerful but expensive. The biggest customer for Alpha outside of Digital Equipment is expected to be Olivetti which has a strategic partnership agreement with the US group. Digital Equipment and IBM also both stress that the 'downsizing' trend away from large mainframes towards client/server network systems has also created the need for powerful machines which can be linked together using high speed networking technologies like ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode.) In its briefing paper on the PowerPC, IBM notes, 'the introduction of faster and more cost-effective microprocessors means that tasks once thought suitable for mainframe and super computers can now be carried out at the mid-range and personal workstation level, allowing greater devolution of data processing down towards the desktop.' But despite the trend towards 'downsizing,' IBM and most independent analysts believe that the mainframe will continue to play an important role, even though, as IBM and Cranfield University School of management discovered in a study published earlier this month, many chief executives compare their mainframe to the boiler in the basement- essential but dull. For many smaller businesses the issue is not which computer platform to use, but whether computers provide any benefits at all, according to a survey undertaken for Sage Group, the leading UK accounting software producer. The recent UK-based survey revealed that many small and medium sized businesses see computers as offering little or no value to their operation and discovered that as many as 1.5m non-computerised small businesses do not intend to buy computers in the next two years. The main barrier to purchasing a PC was identified as lack of understanding of the advantages of computers in business by 67 per cent of small businesses (1-19 employees) and by 52 per cent of medium-sized businesses (20-120 employees.) In addition a majority of small businesses profess to have little or no knowledge of computers. When small businesses do buy a computer the most common reason is to computerise their accounts. In total 57 per cent of companies with computers use accounting software like Sage's products which include Sage Moneywise which is particularly aimed at small businesses. Other software companies including US-based Intuit have also recently begun to target this sector. Intuit's product called Quicken is designed to be simple to use and runs under Microsoft Windows or Dos on a personal computer. Intuit has also recently added an add-on product called Quickinvoice which helps the small business - typically employing one to five people - automate its invoicing procedures.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Japanese government bonds can expect continued support this week from increases in money market liquidity as the Bank of Japan attempts to stem deteriorating investor confidence in the financial system. Worries about the banking system have pushed the leading Nikkei 225 index down through the psychologically important level of 17,000 for the first time since March 5. Investors expect further technical selling to depress the index ahead of the settlement of stock futures and options contracts on December 10. Bond investors expect continued efforts by the Bank, which last week supported the Tokyo market by adding liquidity to the money markets and allowing short-term interest rates to fall. Investors will also focus on talks in the upper house over the political reform bill. Although the bill passed the lower house on November 18, talks in the upper house look as if they could drag on. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, has indicated that he would resign if the bill did not pass this year. If the upper house fails to vote on the bill, decision-making on fiscal stimulus, including an income tax cut, is likely to be postponed, severely damaging business sentiment. A spate of economic figures, scheduled to be released on Tuesday, are likely to confirm further economic weakness.</p>

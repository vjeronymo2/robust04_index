			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TV MAKERS GEAR UP FOR THE BIGGER PICTURE  </P> <P> With television sets getting increasingly larger and cheaper, major  manufacturers are gearing up to meet what they expect will be intense demand  for sets with large screens.  </P> <P> Toshiba, Matsushita, Thomson Consumer Electronics and, most recently, Sony each  have announced plans to build new plants or expand existing plants in the  United States to supply demand for large TVs, which are defined by industry  observers as those with screens 30 inches or larger. French-owned Thomson makes  RCA and General Electric brand TVs.  </P> <P> At the heart of the large-TV phenomenon is consumers' desire for better picture  quality, particularly to watch videocassettes. And technology called Improved  Definition Television, now available, delivers roughly four times better  resolution than older sets, said David Lachenbruch, editorial director of  Washington-based Television Digest, an industry newsletter that follows TV  sales trends.  </P> <P> Price is still a barrier, with top-of-the-line Sony 32-inch sets retailing for  $2,600. But those prices are partly a function of low availability. Lachenbruch  and other industry observers expect those prices to drop substantially once  supply increases after the new facilities begin operating.  </P> <P> According to Television Digest, sales of televisions with large screens will  total only about 300,000 units this year, less than 2% of the 22 million TV  sets that will be sold in the U.S. But, by 1995, large TVs will represent 15%  to 20% of all TVs sold and half of dollar volume, Lachenbruch said.  </P> <P> Television sales in the U.S. now are dominated by 19-inch and 20-inch models,  which are expected to account for 48% of the TVs sold in the United States,  Lachenbruch said.  </P> <P> Last Friday, Sony announced plans for a $100-million addition to its San Diego  TV manufacturing complex in order to transfer production of 32-inch Trinitron  models from Japan. The highly automated addition will employ 220 workers and  begin operations next summer, Sony spokesman Stephen Burke said.  </P> <P> Sony now employs 3,600 at its San Diego and Tijuana plants, where the Japanese  consumer electronics giant makes the bulk of its 13-inch, 19-inch, 20-inch and  27-inch sets sold to the U.S. market. Sony will ship up to 1.7 million sets  locally this year.  </P> <P> Although Sony introduced its 32-inch model just one year ago, it now claims a  20% to 25% share of the large-TV market, Burke said, or 60,000 to 75,000 sets a  year. On Friday, Sony Corp. of America Chairman Masaaki Morita said the San  Diego plant will be producing 32-inch sets at a rate of 250,000 to 300,000  units a year by the end of 1990.  </P> <P> Toshiba previously announced plans to expand its Horseheads, N.Y., plant to  produce 30-inch and 32-inch sets, Lachenbruch said. A joint venture of  Matsushita Electric and Philips of The Netherlands is building a plant in Troy,  Ohio to make 31-inch TVs. Matsushita makes Panasonic and Quasar brand  television sets.  </P> <P> Thomson is expanding its plant in Marion, Ohio, to make 32-inch and 35-inch TV  sets.  </P> <P> Thomson is the leading manufacturers of television sets in the United States,  controlling  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F> reporter]    [Excerpts] The Prime Minister today welcomed yesterday's  NATO decision to establish an exclusion zone around besieged  Sarajevo as a means of reinforcing the peace process. But at  Commons question time he ruled out the use of ground troops in  other areas of strife-torn former Yugoslavia as "not a practical  proposition."    Mr Major said there would be renewed diplomatic efforts to  end the conflict following the NATO ultimatum.    "No course in Bosnia is free of risks. That has been the  case from the beginning and it is now," he admitted. But to do  nothing in the face of mortar attacks on Sarajevo was not an  option.    Shortly after, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, reporting to  MPs on the latest NATO initiative, said: "No one would pretend  this was an easy decision. The risks are clear. So are the  advantages if it succeeds."    He called on the Bosnian Serbs to respond: "Their aims  cannot  be achieved on the battlefield nor by killing and mutilating  civilians." [passage omitted]    Mr Major said the measures agreed yesterday were intended  "primarily to reinforce the peace process."    He said: "There will be renewed diplomatic efforts to  encourage all sides to reach agreement and stick to it. But I  do not myself believe that doing nothing in the circumstances  that have now arisen is an option that would be right for this  House to adopt, or right for NATO. We do not favour purely  punitive action. Force should not be used unless it is  genuinely necessary and helps the chance of a peaceful  settlement."    Mr Major said NATO had warned all sides to cease the  bombardment of Sarajevo. It has taken specific and carefully  constructed decisions to reinforce the efforts of commanders on  the ground. But the objective is to help the civilian  population without changing the character of the UN role."    Later he told Calum Macdonald (Lab Western Isles) that there  was no "feasible or certain means of resolving the problem from  outside. But the NATO decision of yesterday will put all  parties under heavier pressure to stop the bombardment and make  peace."    Mr Macdonald said there could be no moral or logical  justification for distinguishing betwen Sarajevo and other "safe  areas" in Bosnia. "Will you undertake to work to extend the  ultimatum issued in respect of Sarajevo to other safe areas?" he  demanded.    The Prime Minister replied: "We have to determine what is  practical. To follow to its logical conclusion the concern you  have set out would involve us becoming involved, very probably,  with troops on the ground right across the whole area of the  conflict. However strongly you may feel about the matter, that  is not a practical proposition."    In his statement, Mr Hurd told the House that the war would  not end by military victory.    He added: "A lasting settlement cannot be imposed. It can  only be achieved by agreement between the parties." The  Government now looked to the parties involved in the conflict,  particularly the Bosnian Serbs, to respond.    He insisted: "Their aims cannot be achieved on the  battlefield, nor by killing and mutilating civilians. They  should end the siege of Sarajevo to hand it over to UN  administration. Such an agreement would mark a real step  towards peaceful settlement."    On NATO's move, Mr Hurd added: "No one would pretend that  this was an easy decision. The risks are clear -- so are the  advantages if it succeeds." It was the job of government "to  test and retest options of this kind," said the Foreign  Secretary. There is a strong British interest in maintaining  the strength and solidarity of NATO. "In Bosnia, our interest  lies in preventing the war from spreading, in helping forward  the work for a peace settlement and in relieving the suffering  of the Bosnian people. We judge that these interests are best  sustained by supporting the NATO decision and working for its  success."</p>

			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: BCE warns of loss at Nortel BCE of Canada has warned that Northern Telecom is likely to record an operating loss for the 1994 first quarter, AP-DJ reports. For Northern Telecom, 52 per cent owned by BCE, 'the effect of pricing pressures, product mix, and traditionally lower first-quarter volume is expected to have a significant impact on gross profit and will likely generate an operating loss in the first quarter of 1994,' BCE says in its annual report. 'The annualised effect of improvements in the cost structure and volume growth from a strengthened portfolio of products is expected to become evident in the second half of the year.' BCE says its Bell Canada unit's earnings target for 1994 'is at the low end of the 11 per cent to 12 per cent range of regulated rate of return' set by Canadian authorities.</p>

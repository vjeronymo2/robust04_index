			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Single agency proposed for rivers and pollution OFWAT, the water industry's economic regulator, believes that the National Rivers Authority and the pollution inspectorate should be combined in a single organisation under the government's plans to form a national environmental agency. The government has outlined several alternatives in a consultation paper on the proposed agency, which would be launched in the autumn if the Conservatives are returned in the general election. One of the elements to be decided is the role of the NRA. As part of the consultation process Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat (the Office of Water Services) has written to the environment department supporting the idea of a single organisation as a way of achieving quicker and more cost-effective decisions. Mr Byatt considered it essential to retain the current approach of river-basin management for both resources and quality of water supplies, 'which suggests that most of the current functions of the NRA would need to be transferred to the new agency'. Ofwat considered it essential that the costs of proposals for environmental and other quality improvements should be properly understood before decisions are taken. Mr Byatt writes: 'The terms of reference of the agency should therefore include the analysis of the financial implications of proposals.' As most proposals for environmental improvements entailed increased costs that were eventually borne by customers, it was essential that the new agency was required to consult with economic regulators such as Ofwat. Further advantages of a single 'quality regulator' for environmental and public health issues arising from pollution would be and increased ability to attract specialists, and a 'one-stop shop' for industry and the public.</p>

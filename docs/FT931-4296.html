			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Europe eases rates BELGIUM, the Netherlands and Denmark followed the latest round of monetary easing by the Bundesbank with rate cuts of their own yesterday. Denmark was the first to act. The central bank cut  1/2 point off its two-week rate to 11 1/2 per cent, saying the move was made possible by continued currency inflows, a strong krone and lower market rates. Later in the day the Bundesbank gave further confirmation of the direction in which its lending rates are going by reducing the lowest accepted rate on its 28-day repo funds to 8.25 per cent. The move followed a cut in the 14-day repo interest rate to 8.25 per cent on Friday. Many saw yesterday's reduction as a clear signal that the German central bank would lower its officially posted rates next week. Not all, however, are convinced. Some analysts expect the German authorities to wait until real progress has been made on the so-called Solidarity Pact before bringing down official interest rates. In the meantime it will act to ease strains in the European Monetary System by slicing repo rates. The Belgian and Dutch rate cuts were widely expected, but the market was pleasantly surprised by the extent of the reductions. The Belgian central bank announced that it was cutting its discount rate by 25 basis points to 7.25 per cent and its key money market central interest rate by 20 basis points to 8.10 per cent. The Belgian authorities also cut their end-of-day rate to 9.10 from 9.30 per cent but left the emergency lending rate, equivalent to Germany's Lombard rate, unchanged at 9.75 per cent. In the Netherlands, the Dutch central bank said it would cut its three official interest rates by  1/4 percentage point and lower its special advances money market rate to 8.10 per cent from 8.30 per cent. It reduced the discount rate to 7.25 per cent from 7.50 per cent. French franc and Euromark futures advanced strongly, although dealers reported that prices were moving up before the announcements of the various European rate cuts. Interbank rates in the UK money markets barely changed in a dull day's trading. Although conditions were tight at the start of the day, the shortage was eventually relieved by late assistance from the Bank of England.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Catholic training agency closes The government said yesterday it was 'disappointed' that a Roman Catholic training organisation in London had gone into liquidation. Cathedral Employment Enterprises, which had more than 100 employees and annual turnover of about Pounds 3m, ran job clubs and similar work-search schemes. The Department of Employment denied that the government's output related funding system was the cause of Cathedral's collapse.</p>

Talking to our correspondent, Mr. Narasimha Rao said the budget  will mark another step toward achieving social justice. He said  the fourth successive budget of Dr. Manmohan Singh is a soft one  with no additional burden on the common man.    The former finance minister, Mr. Madhu Dandavate, said that  the budget will provide uninhibited access to multinationals  leading to greater unemployment. He said it will also harden  the decentralized sector. Mr. George Fernandes, Janata Dal,  said the budget is for the 3 percent rich and there is nothing  for the poor. Mr. K.P. Unnikrishnan, Congress-S, said that the  budget is an excellent exercise to keep the reforms on the  track. Mr. Indrajit Gupta, CPI [Communist Party of India], said  it is oriented to provide the growth of the private sector only.  The CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] leader, Mr.  Somnath Chatterjee, has said that the poor will suffer more by  the proposals and the finance minister has given self-reliance a  go-back. The Janata Party president, Dr. Subramaniam Swamy,  felt that the budget will lead to a setback to the reform  process because of fiscal indiscipline. The Janata Dal has  termed the budget as a sugar-coated one and said it will further  squeeze the pocket of the common man.    Talking to our correspondent, the finance minister, Dr.  Manmohan Singh, said the main goal of the budget is removal of  poverty and strengthening of the agricultural sector. It is  toward this end the outlay on antipoverty programs have been  stepped up by 40 percent and an additional 2,000 crore rupees  has been provided. Dr. Singh asserted that the budget will not  have any negative impact in inflation.</p>

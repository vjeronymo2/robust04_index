			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia announces fresh sale to India THE AUSTRALIAN Wheat Board yesterday announced its second ADollars 100m (Pounds 42m) sale to India in two months, suggesting that demand for Australian wheat remains strong in spite of competition from subsidised US and European Community exports. The announcement brings sales to India to 1m tonnes this year, and will raise hopes of spin-off benefits for Australian grain legume growers, who could benefit from sharing transport costs. The sales mark the resumption of large-scale Australian wheat exports to India after a gap of 10 years, in spite of competition from subsidised exports, which Canberra claims have corrupted world markets. The US recently announced the sale of 1m tonnes of subsidised wheat to India under its revised Export Enhancement Program, announced by President Bush earlier in the US presidential election campaign. India has bought 3m tonnes of wheat this year from Australia, the US and Canada following a disappointing harvest. New Delhi has been a small net exporter of wheat in recent years. The US is believed to have allocated a further 500,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat for sale to India, but Australian officials said it was unclear whether the offer would be taken up. 'I would expect that the Indian authorities will now wait to gauge the size of their domestic crop before committing themselves to further imports,' said Mr Ron Storey, AWB marketing manager. Australia has been strongly critical of the impact of EEP sales on its markets, although the federal government has accepted US arguments that the programme is aimed primarily at competing with EC subsidies.</p>

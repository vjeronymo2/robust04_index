			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY RESUMES FLIGHTS NEAR CRASH SITE  </P> <P> Jets resumed flying from Dobbins Air Force Base north of Atlanta on Sunday,  three days after an attack plane crashed into an apartment complex short of the  runway, killing two people.  </P> <P> Petty Officer Linda Herring said the Navy considered Thursday's crash an  isolated incident and was not suspending any flight operations.  </P> <P> "If an investigation indicates that changes should be made, we will of course  make them," she said.  </P> <P> The investigation of the crash is expected to take at least 30 days.  </P> <P> Officials at Naval Air Station Atlanta, next to Dobbins, said earlier that  pilots were taking a few days off from training flights in the wake of the  crash.  </P> <P> The pilot of the A-7E Corsair II, Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr., 37, remained  in critical condition Sunday. Conlyn was the only person aboard the unarmed  plane and ejected just before it crashed into the apartment complex.  </P> <P> Jacquelyn Padovani, 5, who suffered burns over about half of her body, was in  critical condition. Her pregnant mother, 28-year-old Margie Padovani, died  Friday night at the hospital from burns, and Richard Dick, 24, died in his  incinerated apartment.  </P></p>

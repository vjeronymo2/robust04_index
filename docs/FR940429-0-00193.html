			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary would like to clarify that any ``special arrangements, agreements, or limitations'' included in an institution's program participation agreement by the Secretary should apply only to those special arrangements, agreements, or limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA. Considering that the language for this section of the regulations is for the most part statutory, institutions have had access to this information since July 1992 when the Amendments of 1992 were enacted. The Secretary believes that institutions have had adequate time to set in place any policies or procedures to comply with this section. A ``phase-in'' period is unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.14(b)(1) has been amended to clarify that an institution must comply with all special arrangements, agreements, or limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA. Corresponding changes have been made throughout the sections of 34 CFR 668 and 34 CFR 682 contained in this regulatory package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter agreed that a mechanism was needed to ensure that an institution's fund requests meet only its immediate Title IV, HEA program needs, but suggested that such a mechanism should accommodate institutions where funds must first pass through a State agency, adding to the time frame for expenditure. Four commenters indicated that the proposed regulations may necessitate changes in institutions' methods of accounting, programming, banking, fund monitoring, etc. and recommended that institutions should be allowed a reasonable ``phase-in'' period for the requirements, during which the Secretary should provide significant guidance regarding implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department's requirements regarding immediate cash needs have not changed with these proposed regulations. They have simply been restated as a criterion of the program participation agreement. These long established rules are explained in many Department publications, and are included in annual Department training sessions. A ``phase-in'' period for these requirements is unnecessary. As for institutions that must wait for funds to pass through a State agency, these institutions should have already addressed this issue in an effort to comply with existing Title IV, HEA program guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A large group of commenters was concerned that the information provided to the Secretary, SPRE, guaranty agency, accrediting agency or State licensing agency relative to an institution's administrative capability and financial responsibility may be disclosed to the public, and recommended that the Secretary provide a guarantee that such information must be kept confidential by the above-listed parties. Three commenters suggested that the Secretary develop a specific format for the reporting of data and that the data be sent directly to the Secretary for dissemination to any of the above organizations that might need it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary does not have the authority to create or supersede laws that may relate to disclosure of potentially sensitive information. Such laws vary from State to State and from agency to agency; it would be inappropriate for the Secretary to address such an issue. As for data provided directly to the Secretary, if that data were discloseable under a freedom of information request, the Secretary would have no choice but to release the information if it were requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note that the provision only requires institutions that have been selected for review under the State Postsecondary Review Program process to provide the above-referenced information to SPREs. By the nature of the selection procedures and because of the limited number of institutions which the Secretary anticipates will meet review-triggering criteria, the Secretary believes most institutions will not be requested to provide this information and therefore will not need to worry about potential public disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes a specific format for reporting and a centralized location for collection of data are unnecessary at this time. As the information must only be provided upon request, each organization can specify exactly what information is needed from an institution and in what time frame. A format specified by the Secretary might cause some institutions to be burdened with providing information that is not needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.14(b)(4) has been amended to provide that an institution must provide information relating the administrative capability and financial responsibility of the information to a SPRE if the institution was referred by the Secretary under 34 CFR 667.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four commenters recommended that SPREs and guaranty agencies be added as parties to whom institutions must submit reports of information required by the Secretary. Four commenters also suggested including Federal consolidation loans in the list of loan programs described in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other provisions in the regulations require reports to be provided to SPREs and guaranty agencies. To restate those requirements here would be redundant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal consolidation loans are not a Title IV, HEA program in which an institution must be certified for participation and consequently should not be included in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters indicated that the proposed regulations placed responsibility on institutions for knowing how much money students may have borrowed while attending other institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenters are correct. Institutions do have a responsibility to determine the amounts of Title IV, HEA program funds students have received attending other institutions by obtaining financial aid transcripts from those schools. Past abuses with this system, caused chiefly by institutions which did not recognize the importance of financial aid transcripts, have created the need to tie this requirement to an institution's continuing participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. While the Secretary does not anticipate that an institution would be penalized for information of which it was not aware, it must be stressed that an institution must do everything in its power to ensure that no loan is certified for an amount in excess of a student's allowable limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters recommended that applicable institutions not only be required to make graduation and placement statistics available to prospective students, but also to publish the information in their catalogs. One commenter suggested that an institution only be required to provide to prospective students the job licensing requirements for its programs relative to the State in which the school is located. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes the regulations go far enough in requiring the institutions to make graduation and placement rates available to prospective students. While some institutions may elect to publish this information in their catalogs for convenience, such a measure is not required. Concerning the comment on State licensing requirements for jobs, neither the statute nor the proposed regulations indicate that an institution must provide the criteria for any State other than that in which the school is located. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters are concerned that early deadlines for applications for State grants may affect an institution's ability to inform eligible student loan borrowers about the availability and eligibility of those borrowers for State grant assistance in the State in which the institution is located. Two commenters are concerned that in having to inform students from other locations of State grant information pursuant to their States, institutions will be required to be aware of State grant information for a large number of States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

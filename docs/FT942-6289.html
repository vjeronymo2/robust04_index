			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses hold steady Market holidays in London and New York kept volume low yesterday, and exaggerated some share price movements, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's fall of 22.84 to 2,118.15 in the Dax index over the official session obscured the fact that it was mostly higher, and at times a good deal above the 2,112.80 level at which it closed in the post-bourse last Friday. It hit 2,133 during the session and, Ibis indicated, recovered again to 2,129.76 yesterday afternoon. Dealers said the trend was of limited relevance as turnover slid from DM7.3bn to DM5.1bn. Carmakers and most engineers and steels were weak, but Preussag recovered DM6.50 to DM466 in the post-bourse on higher first-half profits, supporting Commerzbank's earnings projections of DM14.50 for 1993, rising to DM21 this year and DM29 in 1995. ZURICH extended Friday's gains, with buying, mainly in financials, led by domestic institutions. The SMI index finished 31.00, or 1.1 per cent, up at a session high of 2,742.90. Some analysts felt that the market's positive start was a good omen for the week and, barring any significant downturn in the US, expected the trend to continue, helped along by last week's encouraging inflation data. Strength was seen in Roche and UBS, the former up SFr110 at SFr6,720 and the latter gaining SFr29 at SFr1,199. PARIS found little reason to change direction one way or the other and, having managed a modest gain in the morning's session, eased back gently later on. The CAC-40 index ended the session up 1.84 at 2,052.51 in turnover of just FFr1.7bn. Investors took another look at Schneider, which had dipped 5.6 per cent on Friday on news that Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, the chairman, had been arrested and jailed in Belgium pending a court appearance tomorrow. The shares rallied FFr9.90, or 2 per cent, to FFr399.90. Total, which reported that 1994 first-half 1994 operating profit would be similar to that seen in the same 1993 period, rose FFr2 to FFr314. Eurotunnel was the most active stock, moving up FFr1.60 to FFr32.85 as traders covered short positions. MILAN saw advances in the construction sector following the government's announcement late on Friday of a package of measures aimed at encouraging new building projects. Incorporating a rise in Fiat, the Comit index was 4.81 higher at 735.50. Among the construction stocks, Italmobiliare put on L300 at L44,900, Italcementi L320 at L16,400 and Cogefar L60 at L2,500. Fiat added L130 at L6,785 on expectations that the new administration will also introduce plans in the near future to stimulate the vehicle sector. Fondiaria declined L320 to L14,480 after the insurer reported a 1993 loss of L465bn. STOCKHOLM slipped back on a rise in bond yields, a 1.5 per cent fall in banks and a 2 per cent decline in the construction sector. The Affarsvarlden general index shed 13.0 to 1,506.1. Turnover amounted to SKr989m. Volvo 'B' was the day's most active issue, closing SKr6 down at SKr734, while Astra 'B' eased SKr3 to SKr168 as profits were taken following last week's SKr15 gain. AMSTERDAM's Aex index firmed 0.79 to 402.42. KLM and ING, both due to report earnings later in the week, were sought, the former rising 40 cents to Fl 52.20 and the latter unchanged at Fl 76.00.

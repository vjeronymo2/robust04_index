			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: Tom Stoppard's Travesties - Theatre The relentless punning, literary allusiveness and political disquisitions of Tom Stoppard's Travesties, written 20 years ago, is still perhaps a bit much for West End audiences. The loudest laughs for Adrian Noble's Royal Shakespeare Company production, which arrived from the Barbican at the Savoy Theatre last week, were certainly reserved for the clowning, the gimmickry and song and dance routines. A speech that quotes or deliberately misquotes TS Eliot, Wordsworth and Churchill in the space of a few sentences is doubtless unlikely to get belly laughs; but the theatrical appeal of he who quotes - British consular official Henry Carr, confusedly reminiscing about Joyce, Lenin and Tristan Tzara in the Zurich of the Great War - is large enough to carry away any audience. As played by Antony Sher with a perfect feeling for the character's magnificent vague magniloquence, his old man's disinclination to tie up a sentence or stick to a fact, his sheer joy at swimming in cliche, Carr is an irresistibly naughty old blunderer, grinning with vivid schadenfreude as he holds on to one fact, at least: that Joyce is dead while he himself isn't. And he's not just an old blunderer, but a young one too; for he must slip continually between his dusty anecdotage and his dapper heyday, a feat Sher performs with easy brilliance. In his younger incarnation Carr, along with most of the other characters, is presented in terms of his role in an actual production by Joyce's English Players of The Importance of Being Earnest. This rendering of Joyce through the framework of Wilde is a marvellous basic image for the play, which not only offers actors acting real-life people acting (Carr, too, is based on fact), but with its stopping and starting and repeated versions of the same scene nicely dramatises the very act of remembering. To angle the historical drama through insignificant Carr's eye is Stoppard's most poignant and Joycean invention. Great art may perfectly well be a 'celebration of nonentities', or of tyrants, Joyce informs the Dada-ist poet Tzara (the spiffy David Westhead). A pity that, as Alastair Macaulay found, reviewing the production's Barbican opening on this page last September, Lloyd Hutchinson isn't commanding enough as Joyce. He looks right, but lacks the true top o' the morning brio. The tyrant Lenin fits more problematically into Stoppard's scheme, but even he - in this recension of the published text - has the Wildeanism of: 'To lose one revolution is a misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness.' Geoffrey Freshwater - a fine portrayal of uncanny physical likeness - cracks that one from a high orator's platform cleverly cut into the backdrop by designer Richard Hudson. Amanda Harris, Rebecca Saire and Trevor Martin as Wildean women-folk and manservant give immaculate support. Adrian Noble's staging - which fits its new home pretty snugly - is intelligent, vigorous and sometimes touching. Savoy Theatre until June 4</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Court to rule on mushroom row THE Court of Appeal will decide today whether sacked workers are free to urge shoppers to boycott their former employers' mushrooms. Middlebrook Mushrooms, a North Yorkshire subsidiary of food group Booker, will argue that by urging shoppers not to buy its product, its former employees were inducing a breach of contract between the supermarkets and their mushroom supplier. They argue that if shoppers boycott the product, the shop will cancel its contract with the producer. Middlebrook Mushrooms dismissed the 89 women mushroom pickers after a breakdown in talks over pay for weekend shifts.</p>

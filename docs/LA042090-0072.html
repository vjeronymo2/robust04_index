			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCINDING OF CAL STATE RAISES URGED;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: SYSTEM CHANCELLOR W. ANN REYNOLDS APOLOGIZES FOR HER HANDLING OF THE  MATTER.  </P> <P> A committee of California State University trustees on Thursday recommended  rescinding large and controversial raises given in January to 27 top  administrators but did not call for the firing of system Chancellor W. Ann  Reynolds.  </P> <P> However, Reynolds' hold on her job won't be certain until the full Board of  Trustees meets today.  </P> <P> Headed by Trustee J. Gary Shansby, the special committee on the raises met  Thursday at the Oakland Airport Hilton Hotel. In unusually strong language,  panel members sharply criticized Reynolds and her staff for their secretive  handling of raises, which has caused an uproar among faculty and legislators.  During the tense hearing Thursday, Reynolds apologized.  </P> <P> The six-member committee unanimously called for an immediate suspension of the  raises, which ranged between 21% and 43% and upped Reynolds' pay from $136,248  last year to $195,000. Instead, the panel recommended temporary cost-of-living  increases of less than 5% and also called for further study of the issues. The  full Board of Trustees appears likely to adopt those proposals today.  </P> <P> Trustee William D. Campbell was the most aggressive in grilling Reynolds and  her staff Thursday. Campbell focused on why Reynolds, in pushing for  closed-door discussions of the raises last fall, seemed to break a 1984 promise  to legislators that any such debate would be open.  </P> <P> "We look stupid and I hate that," said Campbell, visibly angry that he had not  known about such a promise until last month. "I feel embarrassed as a trustee."  </P> <P> Reynolds said she had forgotten about that pledge. "I have indicated my most  sober apology," said the chancellor, who has headed the university since 1982.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Reynolds said she agreed with the salary rollback. She  declined to comment on widespread speculation that her job is on the line  because of the salary controversy.  </P> <P> In response to reporters' questions, Shansby said his committee was not  empowered to discuss the possible dismissal of any employee. Asked what might  happen today, he replied: "Anything is possible."  </P> <P> The chancellor and her staff contended that they wanted to avoid faculty and  other staff unions from using top administrators' salaries as a weapon in  contract negotiations. So, Reynolds said, it became standard practice for the  Board of Trustees to give general guidelines for top salary increases but to  delegate final decisions to the trustees' chairman and the chancellor.  </P> <P> Caesar J. Naples, Cal State vice chancellor for faculty and staff relations,  told the committee that the initial goal was to raise salaries of the 20 campus  presidents because their pay was falling behind national averages of comparable  schools. Then, he said, the staff used a private consultant study of  universities nationwide to see how much more vice chancellors and chancellors  should earn.  </P> <P> However, Shansby and other trustees complained Thursday that they were given  only a summary of the consultant's report. In addition, they said they were  upset that they had not known until recently that Reynolds earned, in addition  to her Cal State salary, more than $90,000 last year by serving on corporate  boards.  </P> <P> Campbell asked Naples if he had been aware that only 68% of UC President David  P. Gardner's salary of $230,600 came from state funds and the rest from  donations and grants. Naples said he hadn't known that. That point is important  because some trustees felt that Reynolds and Gardner should be paid the same,  although all of Reynolds' salary is state-funded.  </P> <P> The Jan. 1 pay increases pegged annual salaries of the 20 campus presidents at  $130,000, of five vice chancellors at $145,000 and of the executive vice  chancellor at $150,000. Meanwhile, professors' pay rose 5.7% to a top of  $58,100.  </P> <P> The trustees are under intense pressure from the Legislature to roll back the  raises. On Wednesday, the Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee on education  said the raises should be only 4.7%.  </P> <P> Cal State's general counsel, Mayer Chapman, faced particularly tough  questioning Thursday as he insisted that open public meeting requirements had  not been violated in the salary discussions last fall. Shansby's committee  showed a lack of confidence in Chapman by recommending that the full board  today appoint an independent attorney to advise them on the salary dispute.  </P> <P> In other testimony Thursday, Cal State Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Carter  denied that he wanted to avoid state scrutiny in the university's purchase of  six cars, with take-home privileges, for himself and the five vice chancellors.  Legislators are suspicious because the total price of those Ford Tauruses was  slightly below the $100,000 ceiling that would have triggered outside review.  </P> <P> Last month, the trustees revoked the take-home privileges and placed the cars  in a general auto pool. Still unresolved is how the money spent on them will be  returned, as legislators demand, to the employees' benefits fund surplus from  where it was taken.  </P></p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: New look for tax forms MANY taxpayers can expect to receive a new, multi-coloured tax form inside their traditional buff envelopes from the Inland Revenue at the end of this tax year in April. Around 8m self-employed people, and others who get the form 11 personal income tax return, will be the first to experience the results of the Revenue's comprehensive overhaul of layout. After months of work with Wolff Olins, the design and corporate identity consultants, the Revenue is about to start circulating the first of its new-style forms. It is starting with Form 11 in its eight variants - including versions for the clergy, Britons resident abroad, members of the armed forces and Lloyd's underwriters - which will be sent out from April 6. Those who have all their tax deducted automatically through pay-as-you-earn  -the majority - will not be affected. The old, dull brown form had eight pages that were two-thirds the size of an A4 sheet. The new version is full A4, in two-tone peach and blue-grey on white. But it also contains far more text and runs to 12 pages. 'My initial impression was that it looked horrendous,' says Martin Donn, personal tax manager at accountant Blick Rothenberg. 'But, in fact, it is jolly good. It will be much easier to complete. It is much more user-friendly.' Erica Stary, from tax lawyer Taylor Joynson Garrett, adds: 'I take my hat off to the Inland Revenue for trying, but I'm unhappy with the consequences. It will help the Revenue more than the taxpayer.' The Revenue says the aim is to allow taxpayers to understand and complete the form more easily, while also cutting its costs in having to deal with incorrect returns. The form attempts to introduce a more logical format, with instructions down the left-hand side and columns for figures to be completed on the right. The language used is more helpful and consistent in style, and less authoritarian. Many see it as the start of a move towards self-assessment, by which taxpayers will estimate their own tax and send in the amount to be paid with their form. This could be introduced as early as 1996. If the form turns out to be as easy to complete as the Revenue hopes, it certainly should reduce the scope of work for accountants and other tax practitioners. It will also pave the way for 40 other forms and documents, scheduled for the new tax year, which have been re-designed as part of a wider programme to update all 800 official forms now in use.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) The NSEP will use a two-stage review process in order to evaluate a broad range of proposal ideas. In the first stage, applicants will submit a five-page summary [double-spaced] of their proposal. An institution may submit more than one proposal, but each proposal should be submitted and will be evaluated separately and independently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) NSEP expects competition for grants to be intense. By implementing a two-stage process, potential grantees are given an opportunity to present their ideas without creating a paperwork burden on both the proposal authors and the reviewers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The preliminary review process <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The review of preliminary proposals will be undertaken by panels of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> external <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reviewers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  members of the NSEPO. Panels of not less than three will be assembled to review preliminary proposals. Panel members will be drawn primarily from faculty and administration in higher education but might also include representatives from the research, business, and government communities. Every effort will be made to ensure balance (geographical, ethnic, gender, institutional type, subject matter) across the entire competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Panel members will reflect the nature of the grants program. Each panel will include a recognized expert in a field of international education. Other panelists may include experts in area studies, foreign language education, and other fields and disciplines with an international focus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Preliminary proposals will be reviewed according to a set of criteria developed in consultation with representatives from higher education, and provided to the panels. The applicant shall, at a minimum, deal with the following issues in the preliminary proposal: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) How the proposal addresses issues of national capacity in international education. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) What area(s), language(s), and discipline(s) the proposal addresses and the importance of these to U.S. national capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) What the applicant is proposing to do. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) How the proposal deals with the key characteristics of the NSEP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Demonstration of thorough knowledge of the state of the art in the particular area of the proposal and how this proposal develops or builds capacity, not duplicates existing capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The applicant must also include a budget estimate. This budget estimate, for the first year of the proposal, must include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A summary of anticipated direct costs including professional salaries, funds for students, travel, materials and supplies, consultants, etc., and how or why these costs are needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An estimate of institutional indirect costs. The budget estimate must also indicate whether funding is also being requested for a second year and, if so, an estimate of the amount to be requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Panelists will review and rank proposals and forward their recommendations to the NSEPO. NSEPO will review and analyze these recommendations and inform all applicants of decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;206.5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Final proposal process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSEPO will provide detailed comments on proposals to all applicants who are invited to prepare a final proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Final proposals should be limited to no more than 25 double-spaced pages. Proposals will be reviewed by national panels constructed similarly to those designed to review preliminary proposals. In addition to a field review process, panelists will be assembled in Washington D.C. to discuss and review the independent and competing merits of proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Proposals will be evaluated in two basic categories: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Proposals that address study abroad infrastructure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Proposals that address domestic infrastructure. Should proposals deal with both of these issues, they will be evaluated in a third category. This grouping of proposals will ensure that all categories of proposals receive funding consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In general, final proposals will be considered on the following selection criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Importance of the problem <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Each proposal will be evaluated according to the merit of how it addresses issue(s) of national capacity. The proposal must articulate the importance of the problem it addresses, how the proposal addresses issues of national capacity in international education, and how it is consistent with the objectives of the NSEP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Importance of proposed foreign language(s), foreign area(s), field(s) or discipline(s) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The proposal will be evaluated according to how well it articulates the need for programs in the proposed areas, languages, fields, or disciplines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Identification of need and gaps/shortfalls <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The proposal will be evaluated according to its persuasiveness in identifying where the needs exist and where serious shortfalls exist in the capacity to fill the need. The proposal should clearly identify why these gaps exist and provide a strong indication of familiarity with the state of the field in the proposal area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost effectiveness <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of ``educational value for the dollar.'' NSEP is interested in funding proposals in areas where other funding is limited or in areas where NSEP funding can significantly augment or complement other sources. NSEP is not interested in replacing funds available from other sources or in duplicating other efforts. Also, NSEP is interested in projects whose dollar levels and long-range budget plans provide for realistic continuation by the grantee institution and adaptation by other institutions. NSEP is interested in proposed approaches to leveraging other funds against the proposed project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation plans <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Proposals will be evaluated on their approach to measuring impact. What impact will the proposed program have on national capacity? How will the proposed program deal with assessing language and foreign cultural competency? In the case of study abroad programs, how will the success and impact of study abroad experiences be assessed. Proposals should not defer the consideration of these issues to a latter stage of the effort. Evaluation and assessment should be an integral part of the entire proposal effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Prospects for wider impact <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Proposals must address national needs and will be evaluated according to how well they are likely to address these needs. What component of the higher education community does the proposal address? How diverse a student population will the proposed program address? What applications to other institutions will be made available, either directly or indirectly, because of the proposed program? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Capacity and commitment of the applicant <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The proposal will be evaluated according to the evidence provided on the commitment of the institution, and other institutions, to the proposed project. What other institutions are involved and what is their commitment. If there are commitments from foreign institutions, what is the evidence of this commitment? Are their plans for the institution to integrate the efforts of the proposed program into the educational process? What plans are there for eventual self-support? As with many other similar programs, NSEP is particularly interested in the degree to which the institution is willing to bear a reasonable share of the direct and indirect costs of the proposed project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Applicants should also indicate if they currently receive or are seeking support from other sources. Applicants should indicate why support from NSEP is appropriate, if other sources are also being sought.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> L.M.

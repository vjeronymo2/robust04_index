			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Johannes Rau, Social Democratic Party </F> presidential candidate, by Andrea Tarquini; place and date not  given: "My Germany Without Hate"]    [Text] Bonn -- This morning at 1045, in a climate of  tension and uncertainty, the parliament will meet in Berlin to  elect Germany's seventh president. Chancellor Kohl's candidate,  Roman Herzog, is still the favorite, but polemics have continued  to rage within the coalition: The liberals, divided between  their loyalty to the government pact and the temptation to vote  for the opposition's popular candidate, Johannes Rau, warned  yesterday that they would not give in to pressures. Absolute  solidity on the part of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] is  not guaranteed. Against this background, both candidates are  placing their stakes on a unitary approach, toning down  polemical accents. Their positions would look even more similar  if it were not for the tension resulting from the election  campaign which is already under way in view of the October  elections, and for several decades' history of almost bipolar  democracy. We listened to left-wing opposition candidate  Johannes Rau, who is the oldest of the regional  ministers-president as well as the SPD's [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] senior leader.    [Tarquini] In your opinion, what are the next president's  priority tasks?    [Rau] Above all -- I believe -- trying to bring people  together, to unite the country. Not only the citizens from the  East and the West, I am also thinking in terms of the huge  generation gap and of the growing dissension between social  groups. This will be a difficult task, bearing in mind that the  president's powers are limited. His greatest asset is the  spoken word and, in this respect, having as I do almost 40 years  of experience behind me can be an advantage.    [Tarquini] Do you believe Germany requires a new awareness  as  a nation?    [Rau] Richard von Weizsaecker said that we had to settle  accounts, in particular, with our history, and he was not alone  in saying this. We cannot minimize the pain we inflicted on  other nations by offsetting it against the suffering history  then inflicted on us. Considering the last 100 years, our  national sense must necessarily be a bit fragile. As former  President Gustav Heinemann once said: "If we want others to  forget what we did to them, we must never forget ourselves."    [Tarquini] To what extent is extreme right-wing violence  dangerous for German democracy?    [Rau] There are always a few incorrigible individuals in all  countries: in France, England, Germany. However, we Germans  know -- or ought to know -- better than others where  incorrigibility leads when it becomes widespread. This is why  we must answer the challenge sensibly.    [Tarquini] Is a right-wing turn currently taking place in  Germany?    [Rau] Our country is facing economic problems and social  tensions as well as their consequences. The extreme Right aims  to win support in the hotbeds of social tension, where young  people lack employment prospects. We must combat the causes  that make young people receptive to such messages, but I do not  think that extremism is stronger in our country than elsewhere.  We need more solid barriers, because we have already been  scalded by experience.    [Tarquini] In economic and demographic terms, united Germany  is the first power in developed Europe. Should it also become  the first political power?    [Rau] I believe that we should not be seeking to fulfill a  special role in any sense. Clearly, what really matters is that  we want a European Germany rather than a German Europe. We are  bound for European integration, because such a large country  right in the center of Europe will end up being perceived and  treated as a threat unless it becomes integrated.    [Tarquini] Would you agree with your Army being given more  international responsibilities?    [Rau] I believe that Germany must take on a greater share of  responsibility worldwide, but it remains to be seen whether  assuming new responsibilities can only be done by sending out  troops. I do not think that international aid to peacekeeping  missions can be exclusively military in nature. What I would  like to see is the establishment of a European peace corps for  development.    [Tarquini] Can a German be a patriot without becoming a  nationalist?    [Rau] Yes. Despite all the tragedies in history, a natural  relationship to the nation is necessary, and this idea cannot be  left in the hands of extremists. A patriot is someone who loves  his fatherland, a nationalist someone who despises other  people's fatherlands. Being a good patriot is what I  essentially wish to be.    [Tarquini] How long will it take yet for unification to be  completed?    [Rau] Living conditions in the East and the West are still  marked by differences in many fields. Forty years of division  have left traces in people's minds and given rise to new  prejudices. I believe we still have a long way to go before  people learn to speak to each other without preconceived ideas,  and learn to understand each other. An investment campaign is  not enough. Human understanding is the real issue. If I am  elected, this will be one of my priorities.    [Tarquini] Many are demanding a stronger president for  Germany, elected by the people. Do you agree with this?    [Rau] I do not support an American- or French-type  presidential system. However, if a direct election system is  eventually introduced, it will be necessary to consider  broadening the president's authority without thereby changing  the balances provided for by the constitution.</p>

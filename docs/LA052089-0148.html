			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRMS NOT SHY ABOUT AWARDS  </P> <P> The award categories did not include best actor or best actress but, then  again, journalists weren't allowed to make the nominations.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, there were some choice trophies handed out this week by the  Public Relations Society of America -- Orange County chapter in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Take, for instance, the category of best "Feature Story for Consumer  Magazine/Newspaper-Planted." The award goes to the PR rep who "plants" the best  article in a magazine.  </P> <P> And last year appears to have been a banner one for planted articles -- there  were multiple winners in that category.  </P> <P> Of the group's 180 members, 31 received awards Thursday night at the 14th  annual Protos Awards Banquet in categories such as best press kit, best news  release/feature, best speech and the best "PR for PR."  </P> <P> The two top honorees were Laer Pearce of Laer Pearce &amp; Associates, who  received a distinguished service award for outstanding contributions to the PR  field, and Nordstrom department stores, which received a distinguished service  award for a corporation.  </P> <P> Some of the winners lost no time in spreading the word about their victories.  On Friday morning, fax machines and mailboxes were overflowing with press  releases hyping the people who write press releases.  </P> <P> "Paine &amp; Associates Sweeps Photos Awards -- Agency Dominates Two  Categories, Wins Numerous Others," read the release from one Costa Mesa firm.  </P> <P> Rolf Rudestam, the group's president, seemed slightly embarrassed by his  industry's lack of humility. "A lot of the agencies put out their own  releases," he said. "They tried to toot their own horns." GREGORY CROUCH  </P></p>

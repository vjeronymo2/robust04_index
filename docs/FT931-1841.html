			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Inflation distortions under attack COMPANIES WILL be required to eliminate distortions in their accounts caused by foreign currency transactions in high-inflation countries under draft regulations from the Accounting Standards Board. A proposed consensus from the board's urgent-issues task force recommends that companies operating in hyper-inflationary economies should remove distortions before incorporating the figures into consolidated accounts. They may either adjust the local currency financial statements to reflect current price levels or use a relatively stable currency to measure the foreign operations. The proposed regulations are out for consultation and are likely to be approved after the next meeting of the task force on May 12. If so they would become mandatory soon after. In an information sheet circulated to preparers of accounts the task force also said it was seeking legal advice on requiring companies to mark their current investment assets to market. The proposals would require companies to show at market value their highly liquid and readily marketable investments held as current assets, in the way already adopted by marketmakers and other investment dealers. Insurance companies will be temporarily exempt from some of the requirements of FRS 3, the new profit-and-loss accounting standard, under draft guidelines issued by the Accounting Standards Board yesterday. Following pressure from the insurance industry the board has said that the sector will not have to calculate gains and losses on disposals of investments by reference to the amount at which they are carried in the balance sheet. The proposals, contained in Fred 5, a financial reporting exposure draft, are out for consultation until the end of April. They have been inspired by new European Community legislation.</p>

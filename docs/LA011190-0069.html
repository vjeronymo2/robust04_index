			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE;  </P> <P> HENRY M. MORGAN;  </P> <P> NEW MEMBER HAS A CLEAR VIEW OF CHALLENGES FOR AQMD BOARD  </P> <P> Outside the steak and lobster restaurant where he had just lunched, Henry M.  Morgan surveyed the vista of what might be called the buckle of Southern  California's smog belt.  </P> <P> "Not too bad today," said Morgan, eyeing the midday haze that gave a murky  green cast to the hills of West Covina. "But, boy, do you like those days when  you can see the mountains!"  </P> <P> Last week, delegates from cities in the eastern half of Los Angeles County  elected the 62-year-old Covina councilman to the 12-member South Coast Air  Quality Management District board. The Los Angeles County branch of the  California League of Cities oversaw the election, held at the AQMD headquarters  in El Monte.  </P> <P> Morgan, who represents 61 cities from Long Beach to Pomona to Santa Clarita,  replaces Leo King, the former Baldwin Park mayor who resigned late last year to  move to Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Talking in rapid bursts and with a no-nonsense style during an interview this  week, Morgan cast himself as a can-do man who will approach air quality issues  in the pragmatic way that he handles everything else.  </P> <P> His attraction to public matters, he said, stems from an interest in solving  problems. "How you solve it or how you sell it -- that's been my business for  years."  </P> <P> Since retiring three years ago after a 35-year career in the technical,  marketing and sales areas of IBM, he has made a full-time job of being a public  official. In October, he became a board member of the Los Angeles Regional  Water Quality Control Board. A Covina councilman since 1978, he is a past  president of the Los Angeles division of the League of California Cities.  </P> <P> His resume lists affiliations with an assortment of governmental and  quasi-public groups with names such as the Waste-By-Rail Subcommittee, the East  San Gabriel Valley Manpower Committee and the Upper San Gabriel Valley Water  District.  </P> <P> As a child growing up in La Jolla, "I was always fascinated by how things  work," he said.  </P> <P> When he was a physics major at Pomona college in the late 1940s and early  1950s, atomic energy fascinated him. Even today, during his vacations he visits  unlikely spots for a tourist.  </P> <P> "My wife'll tell you that if I go within 50 miles of a hydroelectric plant, I  want to stop. I've probably visited every power plant in California. . . . I'll  go to Hawaii and try to visit the waterworks. I have a basic interest in these  things."  </P> <P> He said he pursued the job on the air quality board because it seemed like an  intellectual challenge -- not because fighting air pollution is a passionate  personal crusade. "I don't have a physical or emotional reaction to anything,"  he said.  </P> <P> Still, he recounted a story about the time 30 years ago when he had first moved  to one of Covina's new subdivisions. He was digging a trench at his new house.  </P> <P> "You couldn't work but a few minutes because the reaction to the air was so  strong," he said. "The air isn't that bad -- that often -- anymore."  </P> <P> The change has resulted from stricter regulations governing air pollution, he  said, and continued progress depends on work by the air quality board.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that he is new to the task and that he will be only one of 12  decision-makers, Morgan said he still believes that he can serve as an  important voice. On environmental issues, he said, he is middle-of-the-road.  </P> <P> "We agree with the environmentalists that, yeah, we've got to do something. But  let's make sure we don't just say: 'Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.' "  </P> <P> Wil Baca, the Hacienda Heights environmental activist who is on the board of  the Coalition for Clean Air, expressed disappointment that candidates backed by  his group were not selected for the board. Initially, Baca said,  environmentalists supported Duarte Councilman John Hitt, but then he dropped  from the race. So their backing shifted to San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple, who  lost to Morgan in the election last Thursday.  </P> <P> But Baca said he believes Morgan will be "open and available to hear the views  of the environmental groups."  </P> <P> "So I'm feeling fairly comfortable with the position he's taken and the  assurances he's given us," Baca said.  </P> <P> As a new board member, Morgan said, his job will be to be a good listener to  all points of view. And he likens the difficulty of solving the air pollution  problem to "trying to boil the ocean: It's a very tough job."  </P> <P> The L.A. area's smog solutions "will be the precursor of what happens with it  in the entire world," he said.  </P> <P> During the weekly meeting of the Covina Sunrise Rotary Club one recent morning,  Morgan said, fellow Rotarians congratulated him for a beautiful sky.  </P> <P> "I told them I couldn't promise that every day," he said. "If we get the  problem fixed in 10 years, we'll be lucky. And it won't be perfect by then, but  it'll sure be better."  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Quotes of the day Mr Norman Lamont, ex chancellor: I have always been willing to be judged on my record. I believe that the success of the policies I have put into place will become increasingly clear with the passage of time. Mrs Irene Lamont (mother): For the past three years they have given Norman a very rough ride. Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive ofthe Postel investment group and a former adviser to Mr Lamont: To blame him just for being lugubrious on television is a bit harsh. John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities: The markets have not been reacting nearly as much as the media. He was his own worst enemy but to a very large extent he was a victim of history. Lamont Holdings (no relation) annual report: . . .  this long period of depression appears to have bottomed out. Already a marked improvement in activity levels is evident.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Kmart warns of further declines in first quarter Kmart, the US discount store group that has been struggling to compete with its more successful rival Wal-Mart, yesterday warned that first-quarter earnings would be even worse than the dismal results reported for the same period last year. It said lower-than-expected sales were to blame. Its specialty retailing operations had performed strongly, it said, but not well enough to outweigh a profits shortfall in the discount store division. Earnings from continuing retail operations for the quarter to April 27 would be 'well below' the 12 cents a share earned in the comparable quarter, the company said. The latter figure has been restated to exclude the loss-making Pace Membership Warehouse and PayLess Drug Store business, now sold. Kmart said it expected to report improved earnings for 1994 as a whole. But since the company plunged into net losses of Dollars 947m last year, this failed to console the stock market, and the shares fell by Dollars 1 to Dollars 17 by the close of trade. Kmart, once the world's biggest retailer, has suffered five years of stagnant earnings largely as a result of its inability to defend its market against the rise of Wal-Mart. One of its weaknesses has been inefficient inventory control that has resulted in excess stocks of goods that customers do not want to buy. That in turn has led to the need for big mark downs to dispose of the unwanted goods. Mr Joseph Antonioni, chairman and chief executive, said one factor contributing to the poor sales figures had been inventory adjustments over the past six months, including the elimination of more than 10,000 slow-selling items in the hardline and fashion merchandise categories. Mr Antonioni said Kmart had completed a year-long assessment of merchandising and store productivity. 'We plan to begin to implement some parts of the merchandising initiatives in the second quarter, with significant implementation over the next year. We anticipate that results will become evident as the year progresses and into 1995,' Mr Antonioni said.</p>

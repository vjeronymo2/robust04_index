			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. SWAMPS POLES 128-75 AT WORLD BASKETBALL GAMES  </P> <P> The U.S. basketball team, led by Larry Johnson's 21 points and 13 rebounds and  helped by a strong bench, overwhelmed Poland 128-75 at the World University  Games today.  </P> <P> The Americans finished the preliminary round of the 16-team competition 3-0 and  will face Israel in Saturday's quarterfinals. Israel lost to West Germany 85-71  but advanced to the quarterfinals as second in its group.  </P> <P> After a slow start that saw Poland take a 10-9 lead, the U.S. team went on a  20-2 run led by its reserves.  </P> <P> That gave the Americans a 29-12 edge. With their starting five returning to the  floor, the Poles closed the gap to 42-35.  </P> <P> But the bench again helped the U.S. team take a 55-39 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> The Americans scored 18 of the first 20 points after halftime and cruised home.  </P> <P> Johnson, a power forward from Odessa Junior College who will transfer to  Nevada-Las Vegas in the fall, was the top U.S. scorer for the third time in as  many games in the tournament.  </P> <P> Turkey, already eliminated from the quarterfinals, produced the first big upset  of the basketball tournament, edging the Soviet Union 77-76.  </P> <P> Despite the loss, the Soviets, who finished 2-1 in their group, advanced to the  quarterfinals.

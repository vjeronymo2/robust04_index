			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / EU acts on Italian threat to union expansion European Union finance ministers will today try to settle a long-running row over Italian milk quotas, which threatens the planned expansion of the EU and the ratification of a new Commission in January. Ministers were forced to attend an emergency meeting after a call from the German government, current EU president, which believes it can reach a deal in Brussels. But a Commission official warned yesterday 'it is not sewn up'. Italy refuses to ratify the increase in the EU budget ceiling agreed at the December 1992 Edinburgh summit, unless it is let off a large part of the mandatory fines imposed for exceeding its milk production quota under the Common Agricultural Policy. Spain, in reprisal, says it will not ratify the planned EU entry next January of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway unless the budget increase, from which it will get nearly a doubling in EU regional aid funds, is secured. Failure to overcome the impasse might provoke a full-blown Euro-crisis, which is why 'the Germans are at last putting some pressure on', a senior EU official said. This exercise in hostage-taking across ostensibly unrelated issues will make it hard for the EU to agree next year's budget. But it is becoming clear that the new Commission, appointed by member states, may not be able to take office on January 7. The European parliament, which under the Maastricht treaty has the right to scrutinise and ratify the new Commission, wants to delay this process until all commissioners are nominated and Euro-MPs from the new entrants are in place. 'We want a parliament of 16 (member states) voting on a Commission of 16,' a senior parliament official said yesterday. But any delay in enlargement could prolong a caretaker regime headed by the current Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors. It could also lead to the unravelling of the financial and agricultural deals which have been struck with the newcomers, and inflame anti-EU sentiment in Sweden and Norway, due to hold referendums on entry next month. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, abandoned plans to attend a gathering at Dorneywood, his Buckinghamshire residence, to attend the Ecofin meeting. EU milk prices, Page 27</p>

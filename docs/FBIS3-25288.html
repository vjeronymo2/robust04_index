The day that is  was signed there was a bloody attack on a train and now there  has been another attack on public transport. From Brazzaville,  Antoine Muyambala telexed this report.    At least three people were killed when a bus was attacked  yesterday afternoon by people later identified as supporters of  President Lissouba. Opposition figures dispute the death toll  saying that at least seven died on the three buses which were  attacked. However, according to hospital sources, only one  person, a bus driver, was killed straightaway while two others,  who had been seriously wounded, later died in hospital. The  attack happened just outside the opposition stronghold of  Bacongo. According to the opposition, a number of hostages were  taken. This appears to have been in revenge for two hostages  still being held by opposition militants.    When I contacted an official from the president's party, he  confirmed that the attack had been carried out by the  president's supporters. He also explained that 18 hostages were  released later in the evening following talks between the two  sides. This is the second attack on public transport since the  cease-fire was called on 30 January. The first attack was  carried out by the opposition the day after an international  panel of judges decided that the disputed parliamentary  elections in the Congo would be rerun in only nine  constituencies.    This decision has been a source of great disappointment to  the opposition since the president's party now has that  parliamentary majority of 64 seats confirmed, about 10 more  seats than their opponents. Today, the opposition issued a  communique to announce that they accepted the outcome of the  decision.</p>

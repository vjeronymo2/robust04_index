			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has  stressed that Great Britain and Germany have a "great  responsibility" for the development of a Europe that is oriented  toward a market economy and is socially fair. This is  particularly true at the present time, which is "characterized  by far-reaching political changes throughout Europe," Kohl  underlined in a welcoming address, published in Bonn today, to  the participants of the 44th Koenigswinter conference in  Cambridge. He is sure that this German-English political  discussion will provide fresh and "forward-looking stimuli" in  both countries.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRANSCRIPT OF NORIEGA TAPES IS RELEASED  </P> <P> A federal judge Thursday released a 72-page transcript of telephone  conversations of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, tape recorded in his jail cell talking  to his wife, his daughters, his mistress and his mistress's mother. The talk is  riddled with cryptic references to the weather, food deliveries, private  messages and even Frankenstein.  </P> <P> In most of the fragmented conversations, the former Panamanian dictator does  little but listen and say yes. But in one phone call he seems to discuss  government policies in his homeland and expresses concern for former allies now  jailed. In another he complains that he jammed his fingers playing basketball.  "Damn it," he says, "my hand swelled up."  </P> <P> Release of the court transcripts followed a ruling Tuesday by U.S. District  Judge William M. Hoeveler that the tapes, obtained in Panama last month by the  Cable News Network, did not contain any conversations that might impede  Noriega's right to a fair trial. Only one attorney-client conversation is  included on the tapes, and that was broadcast by CNN Nov. 9.  </P> <P> These conversations have already been before the U.S. Supreme Court in what was  billed as a constitutional battle over freedom of the press and a criminal  defendant's right to a fair trial.  </P> <P> The transcripts were entered into the court record Thursday when CNN decided  not to appeal Hoeveler's ruling, which followed a motion by four news  organizations arguing for their release.  </P> <P> As CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said earlier this week, many of the  conversations between Noriega and family members and friends seemed to be in  code. In one conversation with a woman identified as Norma, the mother of  Noriega's mistress, Vicki Amado, she addresses the general as "little soldier,"  and then goes on to tell him that "at any given moment there we have . . . a  good towel."  </P> <P> "Ah, perfect," responds Noriega.  </P> <P> "And the important thing," adds Norma, "is that it shouldn't be a hand towel."  </P> <P> "Yes," Noriega agrees.  </P> <P> CNN has refused to say how it obtained the tape recordings, which were made at  the federal prison south of here, where Noriega has been held on drug charges  since he was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama a year ago this month.  Frank A. Rubino, Noriega's chief attorney, said that CNN got the tapes from an  official of the Panamanian government.  </P> <P> Held in a two-room cell, Noriega has full-time access to a telephone but knows  his calls are monitored and recorded. The English-language transcripts,  compiled by a Spanish-speaking court interpreter, reveal little of Noriega's  moods or thoughts. But they are filled with apparently guarded references to  those who might aid his defense against charges that he received millions of  dollars in payments from smugglers shipping cocaine into the U.S.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a co-defendant of Noriega's, former Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid,  formally agreed Thursday in U.S. District Court to testify against his former  chief.  </P> <P> Del Cid, once the commander of the Panamanian Defense Force in western Panama,  pleaded guilty to illegally transporting U.S. funds.  </P> <P> Under a plea-bargain agreement, other charges resulting from his alleged  involvement in racketeering and money-laundering with Noriega were dropped.  Prosecutors say that Del Cid, who surrendered to U.S. forces during last  December's invasion of Panama, acted as Noriega's emissary to the drug cartel.  </P></p>

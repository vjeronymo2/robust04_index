			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin has  sent a message of greetings to participants in an  interconfessional conference, which opened here on Tuesday, on  the subject "The Christian Faith and Human Animosity".    Greeting the spiritual leaders of most of Christian churches  and religious associations that traditionally exist in CIS and  Baltic countries, the president pointed out that their  "aspiration to find ways for the Christians' full-scale  participation in overcoming human animosity in the post-Soviet  space" is close and understandable to him.    "Over long years of militant atheism, the souls of many  people have become depleted and have grown hard, harbouring  indifference and hatred. All that is a nutrient medium for  social and inter-ethnic conflicts, extremism in politics,  tension in society".    Yeltsin expressed the conviction that "the involvement of  Christian communities of various confessions in the constructive  peace-making processes will be of great benefit. Religious  leaders can stay the hand of a killer by force of wise words and  by virtue of their moral prestige, help people to start dialogue  and convince them of necessity to return to peace and mutual  understanding".    "I believe that you will pool your efforts and will actively  promote the advancement of the peoples of the newly independent  states towards accord and cooperation in the spirit of freedom,  mutual tolerance and well-wishing.    "I will continue to support the joint peace-making efforts  of  CIS and Baltic Christians and your cooperation with the  believers of other religions and non-religious people in common  concern for the well-being of our states," the message said.</p>

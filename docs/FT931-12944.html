			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / MPs seek reprieve of 20 pits: All-party committee likely to recommend coal subsidy of Pounds 5 a tonne THE all-party report on the coal industry will call for a radical reorganisation of the UK's energy market with a Pounds 5-a-tonne subsidy to British Coal as the centrepiece of an ambitious plan to reprieve up to 20 of the 31 pits under threat. The subsidy would allow an extra 20m tonnes to be produced above a planned output of 40m tonnes for two to three years - a formula that will prove highly controversial for the government. In total, the cost for 60m tonnes would amount to Pounds 300m a year, although this would fall as the pits became more competitive in world markets. The House of Commons' trade and industry committee has declined to specify the precise number of pits that might be saved, although it suggests between 18 and 20 could avoid shutdown, at least in the short term. Its findings, to be finalised today, will influence Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, as he prepares his own solution to the controversy over the coal industry which began with the announcement of the closures last October. The report, due to be formally published on Friday, is almost certain to be endorsed unanimously by the cross-party committee. It represents a compromise likely to be acceptable to most of the Commons and a 'bottom-line' the government will need to meet. But for some ministers and rightwing Tories, the proposals will be seen as wildly unrealistic. They will cite last week's independent reports, commissioned by the government, which broadly endorsed last October's conclusion that output must be cut. The Commons' report starts from the premise that the market for UK coal can be expanded. It calls for a halt to new gas-fired power stations. It also suggests that, over the next three years, some Pounds 500m to fund subsidies can be found from savings made by halving the Pounds 1bn set aside in October to finance redundancies. In addition, it will propose the reduction of energy imports from France and domestic open cast coal mining, alongside a ban on imports of orimulsion from Latin America. There are no proposals to close any of Britain's nuclear power stations. Yesterday, the European Commission signalled that new temporary subsidies should be in order. But the proposal to cut French imports will almost certainly provoke protests to Brussels that the UK is breaching competition rules. Other savings could be made by delaying the deregulation of the regional electricity market, due to start next year. Postponing deregulation will extend present arrangements which give British Coal access to 70 per cent of the domestic power generation market. Under the current timetable its protected access would be reduced to 50 per cent of the market in 1994. Last night, it was still unclear what the committee is likely to propose on the relationship between nuclear power and coal, though there are no calls for closures of Britain's nuclear power stations. Many MPs have been pushing for a 'level playing field' between the two energy sources. The report is also expected to call on the government to halt any further licences for new gas-fired power stations in a bid to halt the so-called 'dash-for-gas' that has rapidly reduced coal demand.

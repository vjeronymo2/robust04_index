			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Kashmiri police set to block militants' march HUNDREDS of police and para-military troops were on alert yesterday in the state capital, Muzaffarabad, in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, as security was tightened ahead of a today's planned march by militants to cross a disputed border with India. The authorities intensified their search for the march leaders at the weekend and cut some telephone links. A special law was introduced prohibiting public gatherings of more than four people. While militants vowed to press ahead with the march, government officials were confident the turnout would be low. During a similar march last month at least a dozen people were killed and many were injured after police charged at demonstrators trying to reach the border. A similar march is planned by militants from the Indian side of Kashmir in an effort to cross the border into Pakistan, but officials believe the heavy presence of Indian troops is unlikely to allow that. Representatives of the militants said they were concerned that the turnout would be low due to the Islamic fasting month of Ramadhan. A goverment crackdown since last Wednesday has forced many of the march's leaders to go into hiding. Mr Amanullah Khan, chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), the leading organisation which called the march, is still in detention since his arrest last week. The prime minister of Pakistani-ruled Kashmir, Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan, said none of the militant leaders would be allowed to leave Muzaffarabad. Militants leaving other cities to go to the border would also be stopped. Mr Qayyum defended his goverment's position on the Kashmiri right to self-determination leading to accession with Pakistan. He said: 'The overwhelming majority of Kashmiris want accession to Pakistan. Our lifeline depends on Pakistan.' A day earlier Mr Rajaz Muzaffar, acting head of the JKLF, who plans to lead today's march, said: 'In Indian-held Kashmir, Mr Saxena, the governor, has pronounced that he will stop the march of the JKLF. In Muzaffarabad Abdul Qayyum has announced the same. What is the difference between Saxena and Abdul Qayyum?' India and Pakistan have fought three wars on the disputed division of Kashmir and many fear there could be further conflict as long as the dispute remains unresolved.</p>

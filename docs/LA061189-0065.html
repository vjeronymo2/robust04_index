			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: POOR LITTLE RICH FILM  </P> <P> Ever wonder what it takes to realize profits from a bona fide box office  blockbuster? We came by UA's first profit statement for "Rain Man" -- with  current grosses nearing $170 million in North America -- which offers a glimpse  into studio accounting procedures.  </P> <P> The document covers the period ending last February, when "Rain Man" had  grossed about $120 million in North America. Even at that point, UA figured,  the $28 million film was still almost $40 million in the red.  </P> <P> While UA listed its share of the $120 million gross as $52 million (the rest  went to theater owners), it had collected only $24.9 million of that amount.  From the $24.9 million, $7 million was deducted for the company's distribution  fee, in addition to its distribution expenses of $23.8 million -- such as $18  million for advertising and $2.8 million for 1,500 prints. Additionally,  $912,000 had been paid to gross profit participants, including Dustin Hoffman  and director Barry Levinson. All told, $31.7 million was deducted as expenses.  </P> <P> After subtracting that amount from the actual revenue of $24.9 million in hand,  a deficit of roughly $6.8 million remained.  </P> <P> Now, add in the $28 million production cost, plus 15% of the film's budget for  studio overhead, and you're left with red ink amounting to roughly $39.1  million. Mentioned but not calculated in the report were interest fees that UA  will assess against the production.  </P> <P> A company spokesman noted that, with the outstanding collections, additional  domestic theatrical rentals, plus foreign theatrical and video coin, UA expects  to see a healthy "Rain Man" profit down the line.

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: MORE WESSELMANS WOULD BRING HAPPY DAYS TO LUGINBILL, AZTECS  </P> <P> You meet John Wesselman on the street, and you think he must be related to the  Cunningham family of Happy Days days. Freckled. Sandy hair. Wide eyes. You look  around for The Fonz.  </P> <P> However, you see Wesselman in the San Diego State University football locker  room after a game and you think the guy was in a street fight . . . and won.  </P> <P> What we have here, in essence, is a baby-faced assassin.  </P> <P> What we also have here is the prototype of the kind of football player around  whom Coach Al Luginbill hopes to build a program of national consequence.  </P> <P> "John Wesselman," said Luginbill, "is the epitome of what a San Diego State  football player should be."  </P> <P> The incredible thing is that I am not even sure what position the guy plays.  After watching SDSU against Miami last Saturday, I came away wondering how many  players had been assigned No. 39. They seemed to be everywhere.  </P> <P> As it turned out, it was he rather than they.  </P> <P> Wesselman is listed on the depth chart as a nickel back, but that certainly  undervalues him. If you happen to be at the stadium for tonight's game with  Brigham Young, the only thing I can suggest is that you find Wesselman by  looking for the ball.  </P> <P> "Some guys," Luginbill said, "find a million reasons not to be there. He finds  a million reasons to be there."  </P> <P> Wesselman is neither particularly big (6-2, 210) nor fast, but he gets it done  with a combination of work ethic and instinct. The former particularly appeals  to Luginbill, but the latter is what makes it work.  </P> <P> "He has natural ability," Luginbill said, "and he plays to it."  </P> <P> Others of varying degrees of ability have abandoned the San Diego State program  because Luginbill is a particularly demanding coach, but Luginbill's approach  played into Wesselman's wheelhouse.  </P> <P> Tough? Disciplined?  </P> <P> That's Wesselman.  </P> <P> "I've been like that since I started playing football," he said, "even back  when I was playing Pop Warner. I've always had very demanding coaches."  </P> <P> He developed his idea of defense while playing at West Torrance High School,  where he was Bay League back of the year in football, a basketball player who  once scored 32 points in a game and a two-time league champion in the 110-meter  high hurdles.  </P> <P> "Our defense was called The Swarm," he said. "We had to have 11 guys on the  ball after every play or we had to run laps."  </P> <P> Consequently, Wesselman has become sort of a one-man swarm . . . or at least  the King Bee.  </P> <P> And this is the way Luginbill wants it with all of his players. He preaches  playing hard. It seems a cliche, but wanting a team to play hard and getting a  team to play hard are not the same thing.  </P> <P> That's one reason why a player such as Wesselman is so valuable.  </P> <P> "I would use him as an example of what we want here in terms of football  players," Luginbill said. "He's a leader, but not by voice. He understands what  the offense is trying to do and he understands what the defense is trying to  do. In that sense, he's like a coach on the field."  </P> <P> For his part, Wesselman does not seem to think all this is so demanding.  </P> <P> "It is a big change though," he said. "Coach Luginbill is a lot more  disciplined. He demands a lot more of you on and off the field."  </P> <P> Off the field?  </P> <P> "In studies," Wesselman said, "and conducting yourself in public. If something  happens to us, like we go out get into a fight, it ends up on the front page.  He wants to protect the image of San Diego State football."  </P> <P> In other words, Luginbill wants his tough guys to be gentlemen. There's only  one place he wants them to be tough.  </P> <P> "On the field," Wesselman said, "you have to go 100% every play. If you don't,  he'll get on you."  </P> <P> Progress has been made. SDSU is 6-4-1 going into the season finale against BYU.  For Wesselman, it is a career finale . . . at least as a college player.  </P> <P> "There are, what, 28 teams in the National Football League," Luginbill said.  "There's a place for John on one of them. He'll be playing someplace on Sunday  afternoons."  </P> <P> John Wesselman is the kind of guy who will make someone make room for him. You  name it, and he'll do it. Special teams? He's on all of them at SDSU because  they can't keep him off. He won't hear of it.  </P> <P> In style of play and attitude, there's a guy he resembles more than anyone from  Happy Days. That would be Hank Bauer, who parlayed toughness and intensity into  a rather nice professional career hereabouts.  </P> <P> That's it.  </P> <P> John Wesselman is a Hank Bauer with hair.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON PULLS AWAY FROM ST. MARY'S, 85-65  </P> <P> By any law of averages, Cal State Fullerton should have done away with St.  Mary's quickly and completely.  </P> <P> The Titans were averaging 96.5 points a game, and making 50% of their shots.  </P> <P> The Gaels were averaging 43 points a game, and hitting only 27.5% of their  shots.  </P> <P> Instead, the Gaels stayed with Fullerton for 35 minutes before the Titans  pulled away for an 85-65 victory in front of 2,025 in McKeon Pavilion.  </P> <P> Fullerton is 3-0 for the first time since the 1983-84 season after a 20-point  victory that didn't feel like one.  </P> <P> "The 20 points are a little deceiving," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said.  </P> <P> Fullerton led only 56-55 with 8:25 remaining, but then Mark Hill hit a short,  driving bank shot and then a three-pointer. Cedric Ceballos hit a fast-break  layup, and then Hill hit another off a St. Mary's turnover. Agee Ward added a  turnaround from the baseline, and was fouled. He missed the shot, but Fullerton  led 67-55, and the game was all but over with 4:24 left.  </P> <P> Ceballos, who had made only two of 11 shots in the first half, scored 21 points  in the second half and finished with 27 points.  </P> <P> "It doesn't seem like this win was that easy," Ceballos said. "But you can't  have a blowout every night."  </P> <P> Ceballos struggled in the first half but pulled his game together in the  second.  </P> <P> "I only took two bad shots in the first half," he said. "They just weren't  falling. After that things started clicking."  </P> <P> Hill added 20, and Ward had 16.  </P> <P> James Dailey led St. Mary's with 25 points.  </P> <P> The Titans had a nine-point lead with less than four minutes left in the first  half but lost it quickly.  </P> <P> St. Mary's scored six points in a row, taking advantage of two Fullerton  turnovers, the second a steal by Andre Durity.  </P> <P> "It looked like we couldn't shoot it in the first half," Sneed said.  </P> <P> The Titans made 37.5% of their first-half shots.  </P> <P> St. Mary's (0-3) is a different team from a year ago, when it made it to the  NCAA tournament with a team coached by Lynn Nance that played zone defense and  a deliberate offense.  </P> <P> This year, the Gaels have no returning starters and with a back injury to guard  Terry Burns are down to nine available scholarship players.  </P> <P> St. Mary's played the game without Coach Paul Landreaux, whose father died  Friday night in New Orleans.  </P></p>

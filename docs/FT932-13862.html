			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent features mixed fortunes MONDAY'S interest rate hopes mostly ran out of steam yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS continued its retreat for the fifth trading session with a fall in the CAC-40 index of 19.58 to 1,949.33, as investors turned away from the market on the view that there is unlikely to be any further easing in domestic interest rates until the Bundesbank moves. Since the year's high on March 30, the index has lost 4.2 per cent. Turnover was FFr2.8bn. The market had largely factored in UAP's disappointing results and dividend cut announced yesterday and the shares lost FFr10 to FFr553. Peugeot dipped FFr14 to FFr546 ahead of tomorrow's results, while Euro Disney suffered a 6.6 per cent decline, down FFr5.40 at FFr76.40, on anticipation of poor second quarter figures next Tuesday. FRANKFURT saw pressure on construction stocks as Hochtief and Holzmann announced rights issues. Turnover fell by DM1bn to DM5.1bn as the DAX index closed 6.19 lower at 1,687.11. Hochtief's one for five at DM800 came early in the day and pulled the whole sector down, Hochtief leading with a DM43 drop to DM1,127, Holzmann losing DM30 to DM1,075 and Strabag DM15 to DM640. Holzmann, which said early in February that a rights issue was on the cards, heralded a 2-for-15 after hours. It fell DM25 more to DM1,050 on the Ibis market. MILAN was in reflective mood after Monday's referendum results and some profit-taking left the Comit index 2.66 easier at 522.72. Political developments left the market cautious. Many investors are pinning hopes on the possibility of Mr Giuliano Amato continuing to head an interim government committed to pressing ahead with tough economic measures. However, privatisation candidates turned lower on the view that Mr Amato may not continue in office. Sme fell L103 or 1.6 per cent to L6,097. ZURICH saw demand for financial stocks ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting and the the SMI index added 3.9 to 2,170.8. BBC bearers held on to an early SFr80 rise to SFr4170 after news that ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, aimed to eliminate net debt through asset sales this year. Georg Fisher bearers rose SFr40 to SFr830 and Sulzer registered shares put on SFr21 to SFr743, ahead of today's annual news conference. The shares have risen by 9.4 per cent and 9.7 per cent respectively over the last week on strong local and foreign demand for some cyclical issues. BRUSSELS saw activity in Cockerill, the steel manufacturer, which put on 4.2 per cent as investors were attracted by the group's high dividend yield. The shares closed up BFr5 at BFr123, after touching a new intraday high of BFr126. The Bel-20 index closed 1.33 lower at 1,251.91 in turnover of BFr1.3bn. Among the Scandinavian markets STOCKHOLM rose on strong gains in Astra, the pharmaceutical concern. The Affarsvarlden General index closed up 4.70 at 1,010.50. Astra rose on strong sales in the US of its anti-ulcer agent, while lower domestic interest rates also supported activity. HELSINKI saw firm gains on lower interest rates, with the HEX index rising 13.6 to 1,093.0. OSLO closed mostly lower and the all-share index fell 4.39 to 446.27 in turnover of NKr491m. ISTANBUL continued lower from the start after Monday's plunge, but prices picked up late in the session. The market index ended 35.11 higher at 6,609.25 after a day's low of 6,079.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- April 20                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1163.04    1163.90    1162.45    1160.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1224.17    1223.52    1222.84    1222.90  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1161.31    1158.63    1157.70    1158.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1222.87    1220.13    1219.74    1220.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 19    Apr 16    Apr 15    Apr 14    Apr 13  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1164.59   1159.61   1156.40   1160.63   1157.54 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1221.99   1217.23   1220.62   1223.50   1220.72  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1164.28; 200 - 1224.32 Low/day: 100 - 1157.03 200 - 1218.79.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

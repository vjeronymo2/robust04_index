			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Olympia &amp; York to retire CDollars 400m of CP debt OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Canadian property group that is controlled by the Reichmann family, last night said it plans to retire all of its remaining CDollars 400m (USDollars 338.9m) of outstanding commercial paper programmes. The O&amp;Y statement came just hours after Dominion Bond Rating Service of Montreal said it was placing the commercial paper ratings of O&amp;Y on rating alert with negative implications due to 'unprecedented lack of investor confidence'. Dominion said this was making it increasingly difficult to roll over commercial paper on a continuing basis. Less than a fortnight ago, Dominion acted to reaffirm its ratings on O&amp;Y's publicly-traded securities. O&amp;Y said last night that over the past several weeks it had already reduced from CDollars 800m to less than CDollars 400m the amount of commercial paper held by investors in two programmes  - the O&amp;Y Commercial Paper II Incorporated programme and another commercial paper programme that is secured by O&amp;Y Exchange Tower in Toronto. 'O&amp;Y is actively working on several plans to eliminate these two commercial paper programmes completely.' The Canadian company did not say how it intends to finance the retiring of the remaining commercial paper. O&amp;Y's possible fund-raising methods include asset sales or the seeking of additional bank lines of credit. As part of its efforts to raise cash, O&amp;Y is believed to be considering the sale of its controlling interest in Home Oil, a Calgary-based oil and gas producer. The company may also be seeking buyers for its stakes in Abitibi-Price, the world's largest newsprint maker, and Gulf Canada Resources, an energy company. The Reichmann family has consistently refused to disclose details of the unquoted parent's financial condition and analysts are uncertain about O&amp;Y's actual level of debt. In an unusual comment, Dominion Bond Rating Service said yesterday 'there is basically nothing fundamentally wrong on a long-term basis with Olympia &amp; York or these two commercial paper programmes, but a combination of continuing rumours and negative press is making it increasingly difficult for the company to roll over commercial paper'.</p>

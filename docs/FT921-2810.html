			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel makes fresh plea for early end to Round MR Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, yesterday launched a fresh appeal for an early and successful end to the Uruguay Round of trade talks. The delay in completing the talks, more than a year over schedule, was worsening the international economic environment and threatening the reform programmes of many developing and former communist economies, he said. Introducing his annual report to Gatt's governing council on developments in world trade and the international trading system, Mr Dunkel said an open, liberal and credible trading system played a pivotal role in promoting growth and development. Economic growth was being held back by uncertainty and lack of confidence in government policy on the part of producers, investors, traders and consumers. Only modest recovery was in prospect in the years ahead. 'What we need, and urgently, is a significant boost to economic growth to generate the investment flows, jobs and technology transfers and increased earnings from trade without which the dramatic reform programmes under way in many countries cannot be sustained,' Mr Dunkel said. He urged Gatt members to seize the present 'window of opportunity' to end the Uruguay Round in the weeks ahead. The 108 countries taking part in the round aim for a final package of Uruguay Round accords by Easter, but this deadline seems unlikely to be met. Failure of the US and the EC to settle differences over farm subsidies has brought detailed negotiations on barriers to trade in goods, and pledges to liberalise services, to near-standstill. Mr Dunkel said the Round was crucial for Gatt's existing members and more than 20 potential members. The Baltic states and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to apply for observer status soon - a first step to joining Gatt.</p>

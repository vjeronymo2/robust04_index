			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Further rise in Allied ANOTHER chorus of orchestrated bid talk sent Allied-Lyons still higher yesterday. US sources spoke of an opening offer of 640p per share from either Anheuser-Busch or Philip Morris. Transatlantic analysts consider Allied to be undervalued when compared with the ratings accorded to US brewing majors. The possibility of a bid from a UK conglomerate, such as Hanson, again met with some scepticism. One analyst said: 'This is a classic bear squeeze and the result of marketmakers having sold the stock massively short.' Mr John Wakely of Shearson Lehman was of the opinion that the setback which followed disclosure of the group's large currency loss had gone too far. UK fund managers, he said, were now recognising the value in Allied-Lyons shares, which contained no bid premium. It was 'pure gravy' for investment funds. He remained a strong buyer of the stock, up 28 more at 573p after turnover of 5.3m shares. Oil find An afternoon announcement from the oil majors, BP and Shell, detailing news of a big oil find in the Gulf of Mexico, produced a surge of interest in the two stocks, among the most easily traded in the world. The two said they had found oil in their jointly controlled Mars prospect, designated Mississippi Canyon wells, 763 and 807, in the Gulf of Mexico. BP said the discovery could be the largest prospect it has participated in since its North Sea discoveries. BP has a one third stake in the find and Shell the remainder. A big oil find in the Gulf of Mexico has been rumoured in the market for many weeks, but indications that the find could contain more than 700m barrels of oil, and possibly as much as 1bn barrels if the discovery extends to adjacent areas, prompted a good rise in BP shares. They closed a net 7 stronger at 351p on turnover of 3.4m. Shell was restrained by suggestions that the stock had encountered hefty profit-taking from overseas, and finished unchanged at 525p, with strong turnover of 6.9m shares indicating aggressive trading in the stock. Mr Jeremy Hudson at Shearson Lehman said the discovery establishes Shell as the biggest single player in the deep water Gulf of Mexico, and that the Mars find would add around 2 per cent to the oil reserve bases of both companies. Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New Court said the find vindicated BP's confidence in the Gulf of Mexico programme and confirms the wisdom of its farm-in programme some two years ago. Banks diverge Share prices of the two Scottish banks moved in opposite directions, Bank of Scotland (BOS) closing higher on the day in spite of launching a near Pounds 200m rights issue and Royal Bank of Scotland down on the session after a disappointing interim dividend. The cash call from BOS, a three-for-ten at a 15 per cent discounted 87p a share, accompanied the bank's preliminary results, a one-for-five capitalisation and an agreed 70p a share offer for the 24.45 per cent of the Bank of Wales it does not own. The rights offer, the first from a UK bank since Standard Chartered's Pounds 300m issue in August 1988, had been mooted by a number of analysts and came as no great surprise to the market. It was generally agreed that the success of the BOS rights issue was assured. Standard Life, which has a 33 per cent stake in BOS, said it would take up its entitlement. BOS, initially weak at 129p, closed a net 5 better at 136p with turnover a much higher than usual 9.3m. Royal Bank's interims were described as slightly better than expected; the dividend was said to have been responsible for the shares settling a net 2 easier at 189p. Food retailers up The possibility of liberalised Sunday trading laws, and a shortage of stock, gave the food retailing sector a strong boost. The rally followed Tuesday's decision by the Court of Appeal to lift injunctions banning two home improvement stores from opening on Sundays. J. Sainsbury led the way with an advance of 18 to 383p and was helped by encouraging words from Kleinwort Benson, which expects strong final results in May. Tesco added 10 at 287p and Argyll gained 9 to 305p, although Asda firmed just a penny to 121p as worries about current trading persisted. Ladbroke rose 9 to 284p after saying it planned to open a further 20 Texas superstores following the legal decision. Sainsbury, with its home improvement division, stands to gain most from a legalisation of Sunday trading. Analysts said the benefit to other food retailers was less obvious. In any case, Tuesday's decision is due to be challenged in the House of Lords and there remains uncertainty about whether the UK government is politically committed to the changes in Sunday trading laws. Business services group BET continued to beat most Footsie stocks, in terms of both activity and performance. The shares rose 7 further, for a gain so far this week of 22, to 189p, and yesterday recorded the heaviest turnover yet of 7.3m shares. US presentations have aroused transatlantic interest in the stock, which has also drawn support from UK fund managers because of the high yield offered. But traders were beginning to wonder yesterday whether other factors, such as hopes of a takeover, were promoting the current spate of buying. Reuters continued its jittery performance over the last few weeks as County NatWest downgraded the company. Its new forecasts are in line with the rest of the market, but it accompanied the change with the view that confidence in the company had been shaken by t 13 to 798p. Standard Chartered outperformed the rest of the banks sector after a positive meeting with a City broker and closed 9 higher at 388p. Other banks were unsettled by the increases in bad debt provisions announced by the Scottish banks. Midland managed a minor gain at 216p ahead of today's annual meeting; specialists said the bank needed a rights issue of around Pounds 500m but that this was not expected today. Williams Holdings eased 2 to 292p as 5m shares were placed at 290p. SG Warburg was active in the stock. News of both sharply higher full year profits and dividend took Silentnight up 28 to 153p. Airsprung Furniture rose in sympathy to close 11 higher at 160p. Dealers were dismayed by news of Amstrad's dismissal of its head of UK operations, along with other sackings and the description by Mr Alan Sugar of current trading as difficult. 'This has done more damage to confidence in the stock,' said one specialist, who added that there has been nothing but a stream of bad news from computer companies, such as Olivetti, Compaq and IBM, in recent weeks. Amstrad ended 2 lower at 72p. Sharp profits downgrades have been instigated by James Capel, Smith New Court and Kleinwort Benson. Budgens declined 5 to 40p as the company issued a profits warning following its announcement of board room changes. The shares were also depressed by rights issue talk. A rerating of Yule Catto stock followed Tuesday's annual results and upbeat trading statement. Mr Charles Lambert of Smith New Court said Yule was one of the best value smaller stocks around. The shares responded in a thin market, rising 19 to 162p for a two-day gain of 29. Trading activity contracted dramatically in Tootal as bidder Coats Viyella was prevented from buying. The maximum price allowed for purchases is 83.05p. Coats confirmed yesterday that it had bought 10.4m shares on Tuesday and was now deemed to hold 33.7 per cent of Tootal, unaltered at 84p. Coats Viyella rallied 4 to 142p. Advertising group Abbott Mead Vickers responded positively to stronger ties with Omnicom, of the US. The latter increased its stake in AMV to 24.5 per cent through the purchase by subsidiary BBDO Worldwide of 313,000 shares at 305p apiece. AMV issued the shares in deferred consideration of an acquisition, and they were subsequently placed by the vendor. AMV closed 25 up at 303p. WPP fell 13 to 204p. The appearance of two big sellers was the cause, said traders, who emphasised that there were no developments on the trading front. Bid speculation surrounded Johnston Press and the price jumped 16 to 230p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (81).

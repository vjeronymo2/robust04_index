			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: End of silver glut forecast SILVER STOCKS, now at record levels, could be eliminated by the year 2,000. But prices would rise before then as investors saw the possibility that substantial supply deficits might build up, said Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, the US integrated metals producer, yesterday. He pointed out that 1991 was the sixth consecutive year of growth for silver consumption and the second year in a row in which consumption had exceeded supply. 'If prices stay low and if consumption and supply continue to grow at their current rates, we expect that the historically high level of stocks that exist today will be exhausted and we will begin to experience large deficits of supply,' he said at a meeting with the Association of Mining Analysts in London. 'However, it has been the role of the investor to recognise these types of trends ahead of time. We believe that the investor will recognise this trend earlier and begin the process whereby prices will rise, which will then bring the needed silver to the market place.' Western world industrial silver consumption last year increased by 2.4 per cent to 512m troy ounces while output of newly mined and recycled refined silver increased by only 0.9 per cent to 505m ounces. This left visible refined silver stocks at 293.5m ounces, equivalent to 30 weeks of consumption. Those high stock levels continued to hit silver prices in 1991 and they fell for the fourth successive year by 16 per cent from an average of USDollars 4.82 an ounce to Dollars 4.04. Asarco produced 13.6m ounces of silver last year (11m ounces for its own account) most of it as a by-product of copper, lead or zinc mining. Like many other primary silver mining companies, it closed some capacity last year. The Coeur silver mine in Idaho was shut down temporarily because of low prices, causing a 7 per cent fall in Asarco's total silver output. Questioned about the potential threat to conventional photography - which accounts for about half of silver's industrial consumption - by electronic imaging techniques, Mr Osborne suggested this had been overplayed in the past. It was unlikely that electronic still cameras would make much of an impact in the market for another ten years.</p>

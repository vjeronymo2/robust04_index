			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Publishing side boosts Thomson Record earnings from publishing and UK travel helped Thomson Corporation overcome the poor performance of its North American newspapers last year. Net earnings of the Canadian-controlled company rose to USDollars 277m, or 48 cents a share, from Dollars 166m, or 30 cents, in 1992. Revenues slipped to Dollars 5.85bn from Dollars 5.98bn. Last year's results include a fourth-quarter Dollars 75m after-tax charge for the restructuring of Thomson's North American papers, especially the five biggest dailies with circulations of over 75,000 copies. The performance of these five papers, the biggest of which is Canada's Globe and Mail, has lagged that of the group's smaller titles. In 1992, Thomson's newspaper interests took a Dollars 170m charge, mainly reflecting the reduced value of its UK community papers, most of which were sold or closed. Thomson Travel's operating earnings rose to Dollars 115m last year from Dollars 104m. The improvement was dampened, however, by the drop in sterling against the US dollar. The company said that the start of the summer 1994 booking season has been 'exceptionally strong', with bookings up 47 per cent on the same time last year. A Thomson official expressed the hope that the overall buoyancy in the UK travel market would prevent any large-scale tour discounting this year. The Lunn Poly travel-shop chain increased its market share of summer tours last year. But the cost of opening 127 new shops pushed down profits. Information and publishing results soared to Dollars 358m from Dollars 249m. The recovery of UK regional newspapers gathered pace in the second half of 1993, although circulations of daily titles remained under pressure. In the US, a strong performance by scientific and medical data services helped overcome a 'severe' decline in pharmaceutical advertising and automotive collision repair data. Thomson, which is moving its executive offices from New York to Connecticut, announced a split in its fast-growing specialised information and publishing division. The division will be separated into financial and professional publishing, with annual revenues of Dollars 1bn; and a business, education and information group, which will include the UK regional newspapers.</p>

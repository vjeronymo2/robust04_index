			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Aeroplanes do as they're told Speech recognition systems are finding their way into a number of applications, but many systems still need to be trained to recognise the voice of a particular user. The US defence contractor Teledyne Systems is investigating the feasibility of using speech to control instrumentation in the next generation of military aircraft and vehicles, and has turned to Logica of the UK for one of the first speech systems to use 'speaker independent recognition'. To test the concept, Logica has developed a demonstrator to provide voice command of graphic displays and communications equipment in a simulated avionics environment. The system extracts the common features from a wide range of accents and speaking styles, and creates a statistical model for each vocabulary word. Logica: UK, 0223 66343.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Command of the Alliance of Palestinian  Forces [APF] has been meeting since 1800 [1500 GMT] today at the  Martyr Samir Darwish Hall in the al-Khalisah building of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command  [PFLP-GC] in the al-Yarmuk Camp in Damascus in order to discuss  the situation of the sons of our Palestinian people in Lebanon  and the diaspora and confront the conspiracy represented by the  'Arafat-Rabin agreement signed recently in Cairo.    Ahmad Jibril, PFLP-GC secretary general, said in a statement  before the meeting: As Palestinian alliance forces, we will  discuss in this and other meetings the extent of the serious  impact of the treasonous 'Arafat-Rabin agreement on four million  Palestinians in the diaspora and on their future.    Jibril asserted that there are multiparty conspiracies to  dismiss the issue of the land with regard to millions of  Palestinians in the diaspora. There are also plans to evict the  Palestinians in Lebanon to states that are far away from  Palestine such as Latin and North America.    Jibril added: Here, I would like to clearly say that the  Palestinians in the diaspora were basically the backbone of the  Palestinian revolution and offered great sacrifices throughout  the past 30 years. Through the Cairo agreement, we now see that  those who signed it want to completely destroy the future of the  Palestinian sons in the diaspora.    Jibril asserted that the APF is looking into ways to  confront  the treasonous Oslo agreement in and outside the occupied  territories.    George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for  the  Liberation of Palestine, also made a statement in which he  asserted that the aim of the APF meeting is to discuss the  threats the Oslo-Cairo agreement poses against our people in  Lebanon and the dangers facing them, represented by forcing  settlement and displacement on them.    On the escalation of the heroic Palestinian intifadah,  Habash  said that the APF will work to escalate the intidafah because  what happened in Gaza and Jericho is not a withdrawal but a  redeployment of the Zionist enemy forces.    Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front  for the Liberation of Palestine, made a statement in which he  said that this meeting with Palestinian leaders stationed on  Lebanese territory is to discuss basically the bitter harvest of  the Oslo-Cairo agreement, which is now raising its ugly head in  Lebanon, and its threats to the fate of our Palestinian people  in this Arab country.    Hawatimah asserted that the Palestinian people in the  diaspora are the losers in the Cairo agreement because they are  completely excluded. The right of self-determination for the  people at home has been eliminated. Therefore, the APF in the 4  May meeting, dealt with the problems at home and the self-rule  in light of the practical application of the Cairo agreement.  Today, the entire meeting is devoted to how to contain the  Oslo-Cairo agreement's threats against our people abroad.</p>

The recognition of diplomas will be studied by the  professional associations of the two countries. If no agreement  is reached, the governments intend to draft specific legislation  that will ensure the validity of registries.    Minister Celso Amorim noted that it will now be up to the  Portuguese institutions to discuss the situation of these  professionals. He noted that the agreement applies to  professions such as attorneys-at-law, doctors, and architects.    The two ministers also signed an agreement that guarantees  the promotion and protection of investments between the  governments of Brazil and Portugal.    Foreign Minister Durao Barroso believes that this also  represents a great opening for Brazil to negotiate with other  European nations.</p>

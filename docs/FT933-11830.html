			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Greeks fight state sales GREEK public sector unions yesterday began a two-day strike in protest against government efforts to privatise public utilities, including the state telecommunications company, OTE. Banks and post offices across the country were closed, and transport workers in Athens stopped work during rush-hours. The power company, DEH, warned of blackouts in the capital. The unions, backed by the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), have stepped up their campaign against the privatisation programme as the government prepares enabling legislation that transfers management of utilities to the private sector and permits them to be listed on the Athens stock exchange. The economy ministry, which is leading the privatisation effort, is even under attack from within the governing New Democracy party, a powerful faction of which is reluctant to give up the privilege of making patronage appointments to public corporations. The ministry's attempt to counter objections to the OTE sale by offering the company's 28,000 employees free shares has had little impact.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> NEW AMNESTY RULE BENEFITS IMMIGRANTS  </P> <P> The Orange County Coalition for Immigrant Rights told immigrants at a special  community meeting Monday that they might be eligible for amnesty even if they  were previously rejected because they had received welfare.  </P> <P> Immigrants who did not apply for amnesty by the original 1988 deadline because  they had received public assistance now have until Dec. 29 to file for amnesty  under a ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia earlier this month. The  ruling also requires that the Immigration and Naturalization Service inform  previously rejected applicants about the new class of amnesty.  </P> <P> But many immigrants who fall into the extension status may not be aware of the  ruling and might miss the new deadline, said Robin Blackwell, coordinator of  the Orange County coalition. The number of immigrants who fall into this status  is undetermined, Blackwell said.  </P> <P> The coalition has scheduled another community meeting Wednesday at 6 p.m. at  the George Washington Community Center, 250 E. Cypress St., Anaheim, near City  Hall.  </P></p>

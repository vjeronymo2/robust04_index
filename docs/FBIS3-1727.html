			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee </F> Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party  Committee, in Shanghai on 10 February]    [Text] Comrades and friends:    During this traditional festival, which is being happily  celebrated by everyone and whose celebration is being shared by  the whole nation, we are getting together joyously to offer mass  Spring Festival greetings. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal  CPC Party Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's  Government, I wish you all a happy New Year! I would like to  offer my New Year's greetings to the broad masses of workers,  peasants, intellectuals, government functionaries in Shanghai;  officers and men of the three branches of the Armed Forces  stationed in Shanghai; armed police officers and men; public  security cadres and policemen; and patriotic people in all  circles. I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best  wishes to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, as well as  overseas Chinese and international friends, who show concern  for, assist in, and support Shanghai's modernization.    In the past year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, under the leadership  of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and with the  support of all people in the nation, the Shanghai people united  as one to blaze new trails and make progress. Shanghai was a  heartening scene of prosperity in economic construction, reform,  opening up, and social development. It enjoyed sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic development on the basis of market demand,  good quality, and high efficiency. Shanghai vigorously steered  reform of the economic structure toward the goal of taking the  lead in building operating mechanisms of the socialist market  economy. It scored new achievements in developing Pudong and  opening up to the outside world. The spiritual civilization was  developed coordinately. People's lives improved notably. In  particular, the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping and the convocation of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee greatly  inspired the Shanghai people to further promote the development  of various undertakings and encouraged us to confidently march  toward the coming year.    The year of 1994 is a crucial year for China's reform,  opening up, and modernization, as well as a decisive year for  Shanghai to "bring about great changes in three years." Seizing  the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the  outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability  are the major goals for the entire party this year, and we must  follow and serve these goals. According to the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, we must firmly embrace the  central task of economic construction, insist that development  is the last word, focus on the key links vital to Shanghai's  overall economic situation, and maintain strong momentum for  Shanghai's economic development. We must painstakingly organize  the implementation of various major reforms, and strive for new  breakthroughs in taking the lead in establishing operational  mechanisms of the socialist market economy. We must adhere to  the principle of "carrying out two tasks simultaneously and  proceeding steadfastly with both," continue to promote socialist  spiritual civilization, arm people with scientific theory, guide  public opinion correctly, mold people with a lofty spirit, and  inspire people with excellent works to enhance citizens' quality  and the cultural levels of the cities. We must vigorously  accelerate the construction of socialist democracy and the legal  system, further maintain and develop political stability and  unity, and promote social progress in an all-around way.    In the new year, the key to opening up a new prospect for  various undertakings is to arm ourselves and guide our actions  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. We must continue to conscientiously  study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  and the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, thoroughly master the essence of emancipating  our minds and seeking truth from facts, enhance our awareness  and determination in carrying out the party's basic line, and  improve our ability to lead socialist modernization and master  the market economy. We must be modest and prudent, make  constant progress, boldly explore new ways, courageously  practice newfound ways, and work creatively with a higher goal  in mind.    Now that the objectives and tasks for reform and  construction, as well as the guiding principles and policies,  have been formulated, we should work hard and in a down-to-earth  manner to implement them in 1994, and should earnestly improve  our work style and leading methods. We should study more often  and socialize less frequently; should conduct more investigation  and research and reduce wishful acts; and should perform more  actual work and curtail rhetoric. When facing heavy tasks of  reform and construction, we should be good at keeping the  overall situation in mind; should earnestly study new conditions  and new problems; and should promptly summarize experiences in  an effort to actively, steadily, and realistically make progress  in various tasks.    In 1994, to correctly understand the relations among reform,  development, and stability is of utmost importance for us to  accomplish various missions. Economic development is the  central task of all our work; reform is the driving force for  development; and stability is the prerequisite for reform and  development. While pursuing reform and development, we should  also correctly handle the two types of contradictions; should  safeguard social stability; and should provide a favorable  social environment for reform, opening up to the outside world,  and economic progress. We should conscientiously strengthen and  improve party building; should promote the party's fine  traditions; should foster close ties with the masses; and should  unite all Shanghai people to join in the great cause of  Shanghai's modernization drive.    Comrades and Friends:    We are shouldering heavy responsibilities in 1994. The party  Central Committee, the State Council, proletarian  revolutionaries of the older generation including Deng Xiaoping,  and people across China are holding keen expectations on  Shanghai's progress. It is our glorious historic responsibility  to continually initiate new ways of performing tasks in Shanghai  and to enhance Shanghai's vigor and prosperity. Under the  leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin at the core, let us perform realistic work with one heart  and one mind, and strive to accomplish new victories in  Shanghai's reform, opening up to the outside world, and  modernization drive!    Finally I wish all of you a happy New Year, happy family  lives, good health, and prosperous undertakings!</p>

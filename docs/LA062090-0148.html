			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LANVIN'S FEISTY CHIEF QUITTING ON HEELS OF DESIGNER BOO-BOO  </P> <P> The chairman of French fashion house Lanvin, who kicked up a storm when he  unleashed radical designer Claude Montana on the conservative world of haute  couture, announced today he is quitting.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman said that Leon Bressler will hand in his resignation after the  July shows.  </P> <P> Britain's Midland Bank bought a stake in Lanvin in March, 1989, and Bressler  was brought in from the bank's French branch to revamp the fading fortunes of  Jeanne Lanvin's fashion house.  </P> <P> His most controversial decision was to ask Montana, one of Paris' most  influential and modernistic designers, to take over the house's individually  tailored haute couture line.  </P> <P> Montana's much-trumpeted first collection, which made no attempt to mimic the  smart little suits usually favored by high-fashion stylists, was panned by  critics, who accused Bressler of making a major tactical mistake.  </P> <P> Bressler's long-term future at Lanvin appeared in doubt in February when  Midland sold Lanvin to Orcofi, a French holding company controlled by the  leather goods family business Vuitton.  </P> <P> The former managing director of rival house Chanel, Michel Pietrini, is widely  being cited as Bressler's successor, but the spokeswoman could not confirm his  nomination.  </P></p>

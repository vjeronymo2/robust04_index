			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AHIMSA'S CARING ROLE AS A SKILLED FACILITY  </P> <P> The article "Laguna AIDS Refuge Cited" (May 3) is an example of blaming the  provider who has taken the risk to provide a most needed, yet feared service.  The information provided was taken largely from three disgruntled individuals  and through innuendo constructed to paint a negative and very inaccurate  picture.  </P> <P> In the past week, I have received countless hugs and numerous calls from  angered families who know the true experience of Ahimsa. We are not a refuge  but a skilled nursing facility and in-patient hospice. As such, we are required  to maintain compliance with more than 500 regulations.  </P> <P> In that context, while the deficiencies noted require and have in fact been  corrected, it hardly warrants the printed suggestion that Ahimsa's license is  in jeopardy or that "substandard" care is provided.  </P> <P> What is truly newsworthy is that since November, 1988, we have cared for nearly  70 AIDS patients, 40 cancer patients and successfully integrated these into a  skilled nursing environment with geriatric patients.  </P> <P> Further, to suggest that the opinions of three represent a rift in the AIDS  community is absurd and destructive. Those of us in the trenches who witness  daily the assault on the bodies and psyches of people with AIDS have gotten  beyond our idiosyncrasies and egos to join hands in a united front to provide a  continuum of care to people living with AIDS.  </P> <P> Orange County has been a model community in this regard, and the media should  be applauding its efforts, not creating an artificial problem. This type of  reporting only serves to promote the stereotypes and fears, which interfere  with our progress in addressing a national health crisis.  </P> <P> SHARON JO LUCAS  </P> <P> Administrator, Ahimsa Care Center  </P></p>

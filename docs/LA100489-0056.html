			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE PLEA BY GORBACHEV, SOVIET LAWMAKERS UPHOLD RIGHT TO STRIKE  </P> <P> Soviet lawmakers on Tuesday rejected the government's proposal to prohibit all  strikes until 1991 and drafted a law that, for the first time in more than half  a century, will clearly permit workers to strike for higher wages, better  working conditions and resolution of grievances.  </P> <P> Despite a plea from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for a complete prohibition  on all work stoppages for the next 15 months to prevent his reforms from being  undermined, the Supreme Soviet agreed only to authorize the government to take  "urgent measures" to restore normal rail service and to ensure uninterrupted  operations in other key sectors of the economy.  </P> <P> Debated heatedly through most of the day, the resolution does prohibit strikes  in the Soviet Union's transport system and in the fuel, power, metallurgical  and chemical industries, but only pending the adoption of broader and probably  more liberal labor legislation.  </P> <P> The measure, a compromise worked out through intensive discussions that ran  through the night, was a major test of the independence of the Supreme Soviet  -- the new Parliament -- and of its ability to shape the laws necessary for the  reform effort.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who had endorsed the stronger government proposal as necessary to  protect perestroika, as his overall program of political, economic and social  reforms is known, in the end declared himself satisfied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support for Perestroika  </P> <P> "This is a decision in support of perestroika," he told the deputies after the  vote. Although it is a compromise, he said, the new powers would "help restore  normal life" to the country, which is beset by mounting economic problems.  </P> <P> The resolution, approved 364 to 6, instructs all government bodies in the  country to act immediately to halt the disruption of transport and the supply  of food, fuel and other essential goods.  </P> <P> It authorizes the use of troops to take over the railways in the southern  Soviet republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, where continuing ethnic  unrest has led to an Azerbaijani blockade of Armenia. The resolution sets a  Monday deadline for the takeover if the blockade is not ended.  </P> <P> But this fell far short of the sweeping emergency powers the government had  sought on Monday to deal with the deepening economic crisis.  </P> <P> Attacking the government proposal as "an illegitimate power grab," lawmakers  from across the country and most of the political spectrum repeatedly  criticized the request for emergency powers as "too sweeping, too broad" and  not justified by present circumstances and setting dangerous precedents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constitutionality Doubted  </P> <P> Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin, emerging from the debate, acknowledged to  reporters that the government proposal might in fact be unconstitutional as  liberal critics had charged.  </P> <P> "We do not have a basis for deciding what is an 'extraordinary situation,' "  Bakatin said.  </P> <P> Deputies had criticized the government's assumption of emergency powers in  sectors of the economy and regions of the country that had not been touched by  a year and a half of ethnic unrest or by the more recent strikes by coal miners  and steelworkers.  </P> <P> They also pointed out that the new labor law, likely to be adopted later this  month, would contradict the emergency resolution in fundamental ways, not only  confusing the country on what the real law was but also undercutting the new  legislative process.  </P> <P> The proposed law accepts labor disputes as part of the economic give-and-take  of the "socialist market" and recognizes that in some cases they will lead to  strikes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Significant Political Change  </P> <P> This reflects not only popular sentiment in a nation where workers have long  felt that they do not get their due, but also a significant political and  philosophical change in a nation that has maintained that the workers were the  "masters" of their enterprise and thus had no need to strike.  </P> <P> Throughout the debate Tuesday, the old and new political thinking contrasted  sharply. Conservative deputies argued that strikes are a form of economic  blackmail and in the country's current crisis they only aggravate the  situation.  </P> <P> Liberals, on the other hand, insisted that labor conflicts are inevitable, even  under socialism, and that often a strike, though its cost might be high, is the  only measure that can resolve the dispute.  </P> <P> Strikes were ruthlessly suppressed here starting in the 1930s, when the  dictator Josef Stalin consolidated his hold on the Communist Party and the  Soviet government. Over the last three years, however, workers have been able  increasingly to use work stoppages to pursue their demands for better working  conditions and higher pay.  </P> <P> As drafted, the new labor legislation would prohibit strikes for political  reasons, including those demanding changes in the constitutional system or  those that are directed against any of the ethnic groups that make up the  Soviet Union. Other sections of the bill, which still faces a full floor  debate, would ban strikes threatening human life or health.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Powerful Instruments'  </P> <P> "A strike is an economic measure," Nikolai Gritsenko, chairman of the committee  handling the bill, said, "and political disputes can be resolved through other  methods, including rallies and demonstrations. . . . Strikes are powerful  instruments in the hands of the working class, and everyone must be quite clear  about when and how they should be used."  </P> <P> Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, talking with journalists during a break in  the debate, said the government expects the new labor legislation to prohibit  permanently strikes in key sectors of the economy and thus is willing to forgo  an immediate and complete prohibition of all strikes.  </P> <P> The legislation will permit workers to strike, except in designated industries,  under a two-week procedure that first requires mediation between them and their  employers and then non-binding government arbitration.  </P> <P> Strikes will be specifically prohibited on the national railway system and on  airlines, in communications, on city transport, in the power and defense  industries and in governmental offices. In addition, the Supreme Soviet or the  parliaments of the Soviet republics could vote to suspend a strike for up to  two months.  </P> <P> The legislation first came up for debate in the Supreme Soviet in July, in the  midst of a three-week series of strikes by coal miners. While those massive  work stoppages, involving more than 150,000 miners, were directed primarily at  getting the government to honor its commitments, they forced the Soviet  leadership to reassess the role of labor in the economy and in the political  system as a result of Gorbachev's reforms.  </P> <P> During the debate Tuesday, the lawmakers approved five sections of the new law  but sent the remaining 10 back to the originating committee to discuss a series  of amendments introduced by deputies.  </P></p>

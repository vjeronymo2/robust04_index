			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Israelis urged to reach deal with Syrians PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt yesterday urged Israel to press ahead swiftly to secure a peace deal with Syria. After three hours of talks in Alexandria with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, Mr Mubarak said such progress could be vital to keep up momentum for peace in the region. The Egyptian leader said he took issue with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, on the pace of negotiations. It was wrong, he said, just to concentrate on the outline agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. He warned that the complex deal between Israel and the PLO was at such an early stage that it would be a mistake to wait for it to produce results before pressing on with the rest of the peace process. Mr Rabin was reported to have told Mr Mubarak at the weekend that he preferred to allow the Israeli public time to digest the contents of the agreement with the PLO before seeking to clinch a deal with Syria. Mr Assad is demanding that Israel must hand back all of the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 war, before he will agree to a peace treaty. The Syrian leader said yesterday there had been no progress in the bilateral negotiations with Israel, although all points were open to debate. He has also made little effort to hide his anger at Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, for reneging on a promise to maintain a common Arab front in negotiations with Israel. While Mr Assad has said he will not openly oppose the PLO deal, he will do nothing to check dissension within the Palestinian community. Arab diplomats said yesterday that future negotiations of the outline PLO-Israel agreement would stand a substantially better chance of success if Syria understood that Israel was willing to return the Golan Heights. The heated debate in the Israeli parliament continued yesterday on the terms of the Palestinian deal, with the final vote expected today.</p>

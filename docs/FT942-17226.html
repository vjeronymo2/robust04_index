			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / A bitter twist to the bar-room tale: Tony Jackson asks if inefficient pubs, owned by brewers, are increasing the price of British beer Are the British paying too much for their beer? Given that most of the big brewers are about to announce lower annual brewing profits for the second or third year running, the question might seem slightly perverse. But consider the following facts: In the past decade, the price of a pint of beer in a pub has risen 29 per cent before tax, duty and inflation. Consumption has fallen 6 per cent. By contrast, the average real price of a bottle of wine in the UK has fallen 12 per cent and consumption risen by half. The standard price of bitter in London is now about Pounds 1.80. In some pubs, a pint can be bought for 85p or less. The latest available data suggested that Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, had a fifth of its worldwide sales in the UK but more than half its profit. Stella Artois, the Belgian lager, is advertised in the UK as 'reassuringly expensive'. Last summer, the British supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury started importing Stella from France and sold it 25 per cent cheaper than the UK-produced version. Though the brewers would contest some of the details, none would deny they have a problem. The issue is not one of excess profits. It is not even - as the brewing lobby would argue - the high level of UK duty on beer. It is more a question of whether the British system of distributing beer through pubs ' mostly owned by the brewers ' is proving more expensive than drinkers will bear: and if so, what the brewers can do about it. Pubs, certainly, are at the heart of the problem. According to one big brewery chief, the real price he charges for a barrel of beer from his breweries has been falling steadily for the past 15 years. Throughout that time, the real price of a pint in his pubs has been rising. His breweries have become steadily more efficient: but as an economist might put it, his productivity in services has failed to keep pace with his productivity in manufacturing. But if pubs have failed to modernise, supermarkets are another matter. The real price of canned and bottled beer sold in supermarkets and off-licences has been falling for many years and consumption has risen accordingly. As a result, the share of the beer market sold through the off-licence trade has risen, while the pubs' share has fallen. Nevertheless, pubs still account for around 75 per cent of the beer drunk in the UK. In an international context, this remains a high figure. That fact undermines another argument currently popular with the brewing lobby: that the price of a pub pint before duty is lower in the UK than in any other European Union country except Portugal. That is only partly relevant. A glass of beer in a French or Italian bar is expensive, but does not represent the typical price of beer in those countries. Draught beer accounts for only 16 per cent of consumption in Italy and 24 per cent in France. The inefficiency of the pub network as a way of distributing beer does much to account for the high UK profitability of Carlsberg in the 1980s. Beer prices in pubs are set by the big integrated operators, such as Bass and Whitbread, which need to cover the cost of their pubs as well as their breweries. A pure brewing business such as Carlsberg, which owns no pubs, can charge the same prices and pocket the difference. Even in the off-licence trade, the case of Stella Artois suggests UK prices can be excessively high. The UK brewers insist that net of duty, the price of off-licence beer is the same around Europe. But a number of continental lagers, such as Kronenbourg and Grolsch, are dearer in the UK. This is, of course, before taking account of the abnormally high UK duty on beer. As brewers point out, the British pint in a pub may be second cheapest in the EU before duty, but is second dearest after it. The UK consumes 21 per cent of beer in the EU, but pays 55 per cent of the duty levied in the Union. Hence the hordes of transit vans now criss-crossing the Channel for cheap French beer, a trade which the brewers put at Pounds 500m a year. In this respect, brewers are at the mercy of the UK Treasury. But the basic point remains the same: the price of beer is more of an issue for the British drinker than it has been for decades - hence the price war which has broken out among British pubs. As the industry points out, discounting is not a wholly new phenomenon. One brewing chief says that, at any time in the past 20 years, he could have visited any town in England and found a pint of beer at half the price being charged in another establishment down the road. But, he concedes, there is a difference. In the old days, the cheap pint would have been in the working men's club or Conservative Association, both of which would have had charitable or non-profit-making status. Now it is in a rival pub. Some reasons for this are technical. Since the government acted in 1989 to loosen the brewing tie, more pubs are free rather than tied houses, and are thus in a stronger position to negotiate terms with the brewer. Also, as another brewing chief remarks, in the old days promotional discounts and 'happy hours' were an invitation to the manager to fiddle the books. Now the brewery can use electronic point-of-sale equipment to keep an eye on him. There is a more fundamental reason. As Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief executive, argues, the consumer climate of the 1990s is one in which people are proud to seek out lower prices. The pubs which offer pints of beer at 85p may sell only a tiny proportion of their beer at that price: but it is a powerful means of getting people through the door. A striking instance of this is the small London-based pub group, J D Wetherspoon. Its pubs currently promise a pint of Guinness or Courage Director's bitter cheaper than the take-home equivalent from Tesco or Sainsbury. This ought to be commercial suicide; but since Wetherspoon was floated on the stock market 18 months ago, its share price has more than doubled, far outstripping the big brewers, or Tesco and Sainsbury for that matter. Given the earlier argument about pubs being the root of high beer prices, this might seem paradoxical. There are two explanations. First, the decline in beer consumption has left the brewers with manufacturing overcapacity, so that they are eager to cut their own throats for extra volume. Second, most of the brewing industry still operates a type of vertical integration which in most other industries would seem quaint. Manufacturers of bread, soap or cigarettes would no longer contemplate owning the shops which sell their products. The fact that UK brewers still do owes much to the historic and ossifying effect of the brewing tie. In turn, much of the instability now afflicting the industry results from the process of sorting out who shall brew the beer and who shall own the pubs. In the meantime, the reaction of consumers to the high costs of the integrated system means that the number of pubs is likely to keep on shrinking - the industry says by a further 10,000 in the next few years from a total of about 60,000. Those will mostly be the small, uneconomic pubs which rely wholly on tied business from the brewery, or old-style boozers selling little other than drink to a male clientele. To justify the capital tied up in the remainder, the brewers will have to work their assets harder. Increasingly, the new-style pubs will base much of their business on offering an afternoon cup of tea, a playroom for the kids and better food than the local restaurant. Some of them may cease to be recognisable as pubs in the process. In the end, that may be the only way the brewers can justify their prices.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> STUDY DISPUTES RAILROAD SAFETY FIGURES  </P> <P> A study of five major companies suggests some of the nation's railroads are  under-reporting accidents and injuries and failing to keep proper records on  such incidents, the General Accounting Office said. The study concluded that  the shortcomings were because of inadequate internal railroad procedures, some  of which have since been corrected. The GAO, the congressional investigative  agency, did not accuse any of the railroads of purposely withholding  information from the Federal Railroad Administration. Nonetheless, the  investigators said the problem "raises questions about the overall  effectiveness of FRA's safety program." Dan Lang, a spokesman for the Assn. of  American Railroads, said "there could be room for disagreement" over whether  particular accidents satisfied the thresholds for injury and damage above which  federal regulations require a report to the FRA.  </P></p>

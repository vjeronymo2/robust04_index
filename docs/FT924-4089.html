			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Hopes for EC breakthrough: UK plan to end Danish Maastricht block - Summit prospects improve PROSPECTS for a break in the deadlock over the European Community's future brightened last night following a UK initiative to resolve Danish objections to the Maastricht treaty and a Franco-German agreement on EC enlargement. The moves, which boosted hopes for a successful EC summit in Edinburgh next week, could clear the way for the 12 to overcome other hurdles such as the financing of the Community. Britain's proposals, allowing Denmark to remain outside key areas of the treaty such as monetary union and defence, were given a cautious welcome by other EC members. The plan, submitted by Mr John Major to the UK's partners after a tour of EC capitals, does not tamper with the treaty's text, on the insistence of all 12 member states. The treaty can only come into force if ratified by the 12. At a bilateral summit in Bonn, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, and President Francois Mitterrand of France, agreed that negotiations on the EC's enlargement should start at the beginning of next year and be concluded by the end of 1993. That has always been a top priority of the British and German governments. Until yesterday, however, the French had been indicating they would not agree to an opening of membership negotiations with new candidates until the treaty was ratified by all existing members. However, a senior French official warned that the negotiations could still be held up by a failure to reach a compromise on the EC's future budget, including an increase in so-called 'cohesion' funds for the poorer southern member states. France's reaction to the British plan for Denmark was also cautiously positive. Mr Jean Musitelli, President Mitterrand's spokesman, said in Bonn: 'We consider that there is a possibility of satisfying the demands presented by the Danish government to its 11 partners by adopting adequate declarations.' Until now, France has been suspicious that a Danish compromise could water down the treaty. Mr Poul Schlueter, the Danish prime minister, said the British blueprint was 'an excellent starting point for arriving at a satisfactory solution'. But the opposition Social Democrats, Denmark's largest party, were less enthusiastic. 'We consider the British proposals as a constructive draft only,' Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the party's leader said, after a meeting of the three main opposition parties. The British plan provides for three separate 'clarifying' declarations which would allow Denmark to submit the treaty to a second referendum next year, probably in May or June. A first statement would underline the EC's commitment to 'subsidiarity' and greater openness in decision-making. A second declaration would be made by the Danish government on its interpretation of special areas of concern in the treaty. In effect, Denmark would be permitted to establish its own legal criteria for the extension of EC competence to areas such as citizenship and justice. A third declaration, by all 12 states, would be designed to interpret the treaty's provisions on defence, monetary union, citizenship and interior and justice matters in a way which would reassure the Danish electorate.

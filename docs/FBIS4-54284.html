			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshiaki Ito] </F>   [Text] Geneva, 19 May -- During a working group session of  the Geneva disarmament conference on 19 May, under which  negotiations on concluding a treaty on comprehensive test ban  are in progress, the Japanese Government presented a proposal  that will be the basis for the draft accord. The proposal  incorporates a nuclear inspection system consisting of the three  on-site inspection methods -- seismological inspection method, a  method to inspect radioactive fallout, and an international  inspection method -- as means to inspect nuclear tests conducted  secretly.    At the working session, Yoshitomo Tanaka, ambassador  accredited to the Geneva disarmament conference, announced for  the first time that a comprehensive inspection system should be  established after coordinating and incorporating each nation's  own inspection methods into Japan-proposed system. He then  asked the member nations to conclude negotiations by the time  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is extended next April.</p>

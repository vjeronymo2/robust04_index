			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / N Korea 'poses threat to region' Japan's Defence Agency yesterday warned that North Korea's weapons programme was 'a serious destabilising factor' in east Asian security. North Korea's suspected plans for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons posed an increasingly grave threat to Japan and the region, warned the agency, Japan's equivalent of a defence ministry, in its annual white paper. This normally routine exercise in informing the public of the current state of defence policy has extra significance this year as the Japanese government is putting the finishing touches to a long-term overhaul of defence policy, due next month, in which reductions in grounds troops are envisaged. Understandably, the agency wishes to head off any drastic decrease in its strength. 'Defence strength is not something that can be arranged overnight,' the white paper said. The study was prepared before the death of President Kim Il-sung, the former North Korean leader. Mr Hirotsu Ota, a Defence Agency adviser, said there were no contingency plans in the event of an attack by North Korea, but that measures would be considered if Pyongyang went ahead with its missile plans. North Korea would soon complete its Rodong-1 missile, whose range of 1,000km put most of Japan within reach, the paper said. Even longer range missiles were on the way, it warned. Despite the end of the cold war the agency expressed caution about the 240,000 Russian troops stationed in the far east. Their future was uncertain, linked to 'political and economic instability in Russia'. The agency said Japanese forces were capable of defending Japan against a small attack and holding off a large assault until the deployment of US forces, under the US-Japan security treaty.</p>

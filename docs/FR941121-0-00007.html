			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters requested a clarification as to whether the ``dividend declaration date'' was the date of the actual board meeting on which a credit union's board of directors declares the dividend, or the actual effective date of the dividend declaration. The importance of the dividend declaration date is to give members and potential members an idea of the timing of the last paid, declared dividend. The NCUA Board never intended for the dividend declaration date to be determined by use of a technical, complex formula. In order to reflect the intent of the use of dividend declaration date, the Board has provided several examples of the types of statements indicating time periods that would comply with the definition. The commenter also requested a clarification on whether ``prospective rates'' must be properly declared by a credit union's board of directors. Because the declaration of a prospective rate is tantamount to the declaration of an actual rate on an account (since only under rare circumstances would the board not adopt or ratify a prospective rate), the declaration of a prospective rate should be approached by a credit union's board of directors with the same responsibility as a formal declaration of an actual dividend rate. Further discussion of the dividend rate setting process is contained in comments 2(i)&hyph;2 and 3 and an example of a resolution to declare prospective dividend rates is provided in comment 2(i)&hyph;4(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (m) Extraordinary Dividends <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A national trade association commenter, as well as a few other commenters, suggested that this comment be expanded to discuss whether loan interest is considered an extraordinary dividend (no, as arises from the loan relationship and not the share account relationship, FCUs must follow 12 CFR 701.24 in order to make a refund of interest on a loan); the relationship of extraordinary dividends to the APYE (none, extraordinary dividends are excluded from the definition of ``dividends'' and ``interest,'' and therefore do not enter into the APYE calculation); and the proper methods for calculating extraordinary dividends (by any means determined by the board of directors of the credit union). These changes have been incorporated into comment 2(m)&hyph;1. After study, staff advised the Board that extraordinary dividends are often paid on bases not related to the amount of dividends in the account, such as evenly dividing the amount to be distributed by the number of members, or through a formula tied to the number of credit union loan and share account products used by the member. Since extraordinary dividends are not a component of the dividend rate, annual percentage yield, or annual percentage yield earned, and are a unique practice of credit unions, the Board has determined that any procedure devised by a board of directors may be used to figure extraordinary dividends. Of course, it is acceptable if a board were to use either the daily balance method or average daily balance method to compute extraordinary dividends, even though those methods are not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twelve commenters, including a national trade association, requested that credit unions be allowed to use the more common term ``bonus dividends'' to describe ``extraordinary dividends.'' Originally, the NCUA Board has declined to use the term ``bonus dividends'' for fears that members would confuse it with ``bonuses,'' as defined by part 707. Final Rule, 58 FR 50394 at 50402 (September 27, 1993). However, after further reflection, given members' familiarity with the distinctions between the two terms, and the long-standing credit union tradition of calling such irregular dividends ``bonus dividends,'' the Board has revised its position. NCUA has no objection to the use of the term ``bonus dividends'' as a synonym for ``extraordinary dividends,'' as has revised comment 2(m)&hyph;2 accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (q) Member <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

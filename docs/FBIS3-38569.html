			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Formigoni, Italian Popular Party </F> regional coordinator for Lombardy, by Daria Gorodisky; place and  date not given: "Formigoni: Berlusconi Must Not Let Himself Be  Trampled by Those Wanting To Become the Italian Social Movement  of the Year 2000" -- first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA  introduction]    [Text] Milan -- Top-secret meetings, discussions, clashes.  Time is pressing, the hunt for alliances is gaining pace, and  there are increasingly frenetic hypotheses and rumors about  agreements among the forces in the arena. If it is impossible  to unite, then at least an attempt can be made to divide rival  troops. One of the many rumors current in Milan yesterday was  of an imminent meeting between Roberto Formigoni -- who has  been ratified by the PPI [Italian Popular Party] Lombard  assembly as its regional coordinator -- and [Forza Italia leader  Silvio] Berlusconi. Furthermore, it was rumored that the reason  for the meeting was the difficulty of conducting a dialogue  between Berlusconi and the League. The gist of the message is  supposedly a request something like this: Silvio, forget about  the Lombards, and come with us.    [Gorodisky] Mr. Formigoni, is the PPI leaving the door open  to Forza Italia's leader?    [Formigoni] I see no open doors. I see only that Berlusconi  has decided to trample [League Secretary] Bossi. And frankly I  am surprised. I also regret it -- a friend who has leapt into  the lion's mouth.    [Gorodisky] Are you close friends?    [Formigoni] No. We are bound by ties of esteem and the  affection that all Milan supporters have for the soccer club's  chairman.    [Gorodisky] Meanwhile Milan's chairman has come to an  understanding with the Democratic Christians, Costa's Center  Union, and the new Federation of Reformist and Libertarian  Socialists -- Del Turco's grouping.    [Formigoni] That seems to me to be an agreement with  individuals, not with movements.    [Gorodisky] Be that as it may, Berlusconi is no longer on  his  own....    [Formigoni] What does that have to do with anything? We are  a party; we are in earnest. In Lombardy we command 20 percent  of the votes: Not many people can say as much. We reach  agreements on the basis of political arguments, not with  individuals. Politics is consensus. This is not a good  situation, admittedly. But we have already contributed some  good building bricks to our new edifice -- Segni's Pact, some of  the Socialists, half of the PRI [Italian Republican Party], half  of the Liberals....    [Gorodisky] What do you think of Forza Italia's election  campaign?    [Formigoni] I think it is sad. And it is on television....  I watch television as little as possible.    [Gorodisky] Are you thinking of standing as a candidate?    [Formigoni] That will be decided by the grassroots. I  declare my willingness to stand.    [Gorodisky] An agreement between Berlusconi and the League  seems to face many obstacles. Might you reconsider conducting a  dialogue with Bossi?    [Formigoni] Never. The League has opted to become the MSI  [Italian Social Movement] of the year 2000. We tried, then  Bossi decided to espouse the most extreme wing of the movement,  and broke away from us. There is not the faintest glimmer of  hope left. Of course, it is a different matter with regard to  the League's voters. We know that they are starting to  appreciate the center that is renewing itself, our proposals.    [Gorodisky] The implication seems to be that if Berlusconi  were to change a little....    [Formigoni] Look, all I know is that he was determined to  make the center, the liberal democrats, compact, but that after  two days, there he is, relegated to the right corner. I am just  watching him.</p>

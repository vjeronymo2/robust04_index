			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zagreb, April 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb troops  besieging Gorazde took control of a hill directly above the  Moslem-held town Sunday and were shooting into its centre, UN  officials said as thousands of refugees fled before the Serb  advance.    Serb forces gained the strategic hill on the right bank of  the river Drina which runs through the beseiged enclave, UN High  Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Peter Kessler announced just  after 4:00 pm (1400 GMT).    Some 15,000 refugees were fleeing the Moslem east of Gorazde  in panic and the area, including the hospital, could be "under  threat very quickly," UNHCR spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said in  Belgrade.    "The whole eastern part of the town has taken flight (...)  towards the west of the town," she said.    People working for the UNHCR in the town "can see the  fighting easily from their office, with bullets flying in their  direction," she added. [passage omitted]</p>

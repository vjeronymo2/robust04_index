(Bollmann) filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reporting requirements in which the firm sought relief from filing Form EIA&hyph;782B, entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering the request, the DOE found that Bollmann was not adversely affected by the reporting burden in a way that is significantly different from the burden borne by similar reporting firms. Therefore, it could not be granted relief from filing. Accordingly, exception relief was denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Van Dyke Gas Co., 02/03/94; LEE&hyph;0058 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Van Dyke Gas Company (Van Dyke) filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reporting requirements in which the firm sought relief from filing Form EIA&hyph;782B, entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' The DOE determined that Van Dyke did not meet the standards for exception relief because it was not experiencing a serious hardship or gross inequity as a result of the reporting requirements. Accordingly, exception relief was denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Walker Sims Oil Co., Inc., 02/03/94; LEE&hyph;0057 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Walker Sims Oil Co., Inc.

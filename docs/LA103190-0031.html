			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS / VERMONT BATTLE;  </P> <P> SOCIALIST COULD WREST SEAT IN HOUSE FROM REPUBLICAN;  </P> <P> 'THE LENIN OF LAKE CHAMPLAIN' ADVOCATES A THIRD PARTY.  </P> <P> Vermont, once known for its rock-ribbed Republicanism, sent Mr. Smith to  Washington two years ago -- but may replace him with a socialist.  </P> <P> Newspaper polls in the Green Mountain State show a dead heat between Peter  Smith, 45, a moderate Republican with a strong record on the environment and  education, and Bernard Sanders, 49, an independent-socialist and the former  mayor of Burlington, for the state's only seat in the U.S. House.  </P> <P> Dolores Sandoval, a professor at the University of Vermont, is the Democratic  nominee, but she has been shunned by outgoing Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, Sen.  Patrick J. Leahy and other leaders of her party after calling for legalization  of drugs and the complete pullout of U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Smith's difficulties were underlined last week when he broke with President  Bush and said he supported higher taxes on the wealthy -- as he introduced Bush  at a campaign rally for Smith.  </P> <P> The surprising dissent was in part a reflection of the populist appeal of  Sanders, who, if elected, would become the only independent in Congress. Even  before Smith's public break with Bush, Sanders was reason enough for the race  to attract national and even international attention. The Economist ran the tag  line, "The Lenin of Lake Champlain," under Sanders' picture, but the candidate  himself insists that he is much more a "Swedish-style democratic socialist."  </P> <P> He advocates a third party, saying voters are fed up with Republicans and  Democrats.  </P> <P> "Most of them are bought and sold by large multinational corporations, and most  of them do not have the courage to fight for the rights of ordinary people,"  Sanders said at a recent campaign gathering. "We need in this country a  political revolution."  </P> <P> Smith has hewed to a fairly independent line himself, co-sponsoring the Civil  Rights Act of 1990, voting against the Stealth bomber and the MX missile and  shepherding child care legislation. But he stood with the President on the  ill-fated bipartisan deficit reduction package, a vote Sanders uses as a foil  for his message that "the party is over," that the rich have gotten richer and  the poor poorer.  </P> <P> Smith defends his vote as courageous, the first step in solving an economic  crisis that could lead "to recession or the 'd' word, depression." Smith later  supported an income tax rate of 33% on those who make more than $125,000, which  put him at odds with Bush, who favored a lower rate.  </P> <P> Sanders, by contrast, advocated a 50% cut in the defense budget, with the money  being used to free the education system from its property tax foundation, to  create a national health care plan like that of Canada and to clean up the  environment.  </P> <P> Residents of Burlington, where Sanders was mayor for 18 years until he stepped  down last year, recognize those stands as vintage Bernie. There, the  Brooklyn-accented Sanders led a progressive group tagged as Sanderistas for  their leftish bent.  </P> <P> Each time he ran for reelection, his margin increased. Admittedly,  40,000-population Burlington is well insulated from the problems of big U.S.  cities such as Boston, which is four highway hours to the south. But U.S. News  &amp; World Report named him one of the best mayors in the country in 1987;  and, in 1988, Burlington shared top honors in the U.S. Conference of Mayors'  "most livable" cities awards.  </P> <P> His proudest achievement as mayor, Sanders said, was nearly doubling voter  participation.  </P> <P> "People say the American people are apathetic," said Sanders, who has lost all  his previous bids for statewide office. "I don't believe that. I think the  American people are disgusted, they are in despair, they're angry and they  don't know what to do . . . ."  </P> <P> "They say he's going to be an outsider," said Michael Beh, a building  contractor who is co-chairman of Sanders' Windsor County campaign. "So what? I  want him to raise hell."  </P></p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Unit trust industry set to demand single pricing: Threat of international competition prompts proposal The unit trust industry is set to call for radical change to the way unit trusts are priced in order to meet the threat of increasing international competition. In spite of record Pounds 9.1bn unit trust sales last year, the industry believes the existing 'dual pricing' system, under which investors buy units at an 'offer' price and sell at a lower 'bid' price, is a barrier to its performance, especially outside the UK. It hopes that 'single pricing' will make unit trusts easier for UK investors to understand and more accessible to customers in US and European markets. A draft paper from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds calls on the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, to introduce rules for the single pricing of trusts on the basis of a 'mid-price' valuation. Demand for change has intensified following the Treasury's announcement late last year that single pricing would be used for the open-ended investment company (OEIC), a form of pooled investment which will be introduced into the UK, perhaps as early as next year. The OEIC is already common in other European countries and in North America. Many believe it could be very damaging for the unit trust industry if this single-priced investment product became available while trusts continued to use the dual pricing system. The AUTIF paper has yet to be finalised. However, it is the result of extensive consultation among association members, who make up about 90 per cent of fund managers, and is unlikely to change substantively. Standard Life, which makes up most of the other 10 per cent, agrees with the call for single pricing. The paper comes in response to the SIB's consultation document in October last year on ways of deregulating the Pounds 84bn unit trust industry. The SIB said that given the lack of consensus in the industry at the time it would not impose single-pricing. The AUTIF response seeks to take account of concern that the move to a single pricing system could lead to extra costs being borne by the fund itself and prove unfair to those who continue to hold units. Under the existing system, the difference between the bid and offer prices reflects the fund's charges and costs. With single pricing there is a risk of 'diluting' the fund because, by using a mid-price, the whole cost of a particular transaction would not be met by each buyer or seller but would fall partly on the fund itself. The association suggests that fund managers who want to reduce dilution should be allowed to make separate payments into the fund, perhaps from their own charges or from an entry or exit charge. Any such charge would have to be disclosed in advance to the potential investor.</p>

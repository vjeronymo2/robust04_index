			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Lessons in Conciliation -- "The struggle for hegemony in  KwaZulu/Natal has been transferred largely from the killing  fields to the political areas, leading mericifully, to a marked  reduction in the death toll," notes an editorial in Johannesburg  THE STAR in English on 6 May on page 10. The winner in  ZwaZulu/Natal should "take a cue" from Hernus Kriel, likely to  become premier in the Western Cape, and his ANC rival Allan  Boesak, who have been holding "cordial discussions" on filling  executive posts. ANC premier-designate in the Northern Transvaal  Ramathlodi also talks about including members of the Freedom  Front in his executive. "The rivals for the premiership in  KwaZulu/Natal, Frank Mdalalose of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] and Jacob Zuma of the ANC, are fortunately, men who know  that politics is the art of compromise."  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   Judge and Be Judged -- An editorial in the Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English on 6 to 12 May on page 16  evaluates what happened to the elections, concluding that "an  incompetent IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] bungled the  administration of the election wholly and completely -- it  couldn't get ballots to the voters, its security systems were  inadequate, its counting plans non-existent. This opened the way  to fraud on a massive scale -- but so hopeless was the IEC  organization that it has been unable to pinpoint the fraud." "By  last weekend Judge Kriegler has to admit that he had to throw  aside the rules, the safeguards and what few systems he had in  place just to get some sort of result. By Wednesday afternoon he  had to acknowledge that counting accuracy and care had given way  to horse-trading among the parties. He has ceased to be a judje,  ruling on accuracy and validity of the result, but a mediator,  desperately negotiating a result that all parties would accept."  This is not only the "fault" of Judge Kriegler, there is  "evidence" of "a Department of Home Affairs `third force' in IEC  structures." But in the "most tense and sensitive area of all,  KwaZulu/Natal, the result will be tainted." In an election meant  to give the people of KwaZulu/Natal a choice, "IEC bungling has  prevented that and threatens to prolong instability in the  region"  <H8>  NEW NATION </H8>   Security Forces -- On the day of Nelson Mandela's  inauguration he will "acquire the instruments of power, which  have for more than three centuries been deployed to surpress the  aspirations of the African majority," notes an editorial in the  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 6 May on page 16. "The  government will be confronted with its most formidable challenge  -- namely securing the loyality of theese forces." "Theres are  disturbing signals within the ANC, which suggest that the  responsibility of building popular organizations in civil  society will be relegated to a secondary function after  parliamentary responsibilities. If allowed to go unchallenged,  all gains made so far will come under threat." And it is also  "important" that "those who have relished in the abundance of  wealth that this country had to offer, to come to grips with the  priorities of reconstruction and development," "with the reality  that there will be less for them from now on." If "defensive  actions" of "affluent constituencies" are "left unchallenged"  the ANC "will be in no posaition to ask the poor and working  constituency to moderate their aspirations."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Task of Inclusivity Not Yet Completed -- "One of the most  heart-breaking stories of the week was about Dr. Ferdi  Hartzenberg and 50 of his supporters who gathered at Lichtenburg  for a symboli protest against the new South Africa," writes  columnist Willie Kuhn in his "Politial BEELD" column on page 12  of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 29 April. "Dr.  Hartzenberg declared that they had become a rejected people."  "Rejected? No one has rejected the Afrikaner collectively. No  one has robbed them of their freedom. All that happened is that  those people over whom the Afrikaner for so long ruled  unilaterally have, with the Afrikaner, become co- rulers of  South Africa." "There are too few people who realize that the  Afrikaner's freedom depends on the degree to which other peoples  in the country have also been liberated." "Dr. Hartzenberg and  his followers view their flag-raising ceremony as the first step  on the road to Afrikaner freedom. Many Afrikaners, in fact the  majority, view the election as the first step on the road to  freedom. In this way they have become part of the just  dispensation in which one people and group become equals with  other peoples and groups. Most Afrikaners and whites do not  wish to become terrorists and boycotters. They want to be  useful citizens of a new dispensation. They wish to show by  example that cooperation in South Africa can succeed." Kuhn  concludes: "Let us then reach out to those who form the  shrinking part of an old order. Their fears have not yet been  assuaged, and it must be the task of others to help them to  believe that they are not a rejected tribe. They are our  language and cultural partners. When the lost sons and  daughters feel themselves free to return, there must be  happiness. The task of inclusivity has not ended with the  election."    Western Cape a Challenge -- The Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 3 May says in a page-8 editorial: "The National  Party's victory in the Western Cape is one of the highlights of  the election. It is the only one of the nine provinces where  the NP beat the ANC -- thanks to strong support among the  colored community. The NP therefore has a particular  responsibility in that region to prove, by means of effective  management and a policy of reconcilation for the whole country,  that its policy can and will be practically implemented. In  short, the NP can make the Western Cape a showcase for its  policy. If ever the party had an opportunity to apply  affirmative action in human relations and all that it entails,  it is in the Western Cape. It is a chance it must grab."    Avoid Irresponsible Affirmative Action -- A second editorial  on page 8 of BEELD says: "One has sympathy for the unenviable  and almost impossible task the Independent Electoral Commision  had in arranging the election in such a short time," and "one  hopes that those who serve in the government of national unity  as well as members of the new state administration have learned  a few lessons from the election. The election serves as an  example of how a country should not be run. If South Africa  wants to become a success, weak administration, even  mal-administration, poor training, strikes, waste and  indiscriminate affirmative action will have to be avoided. The  new government will have to ensure that people are properly  trained for their task; that indiscriminate affirmative action  for political gain is avoided; that people work for their money;  and that unnecessary strikes which cost the country millions are  stopped. South Africans voted for a new beginning -- they  deserve better."</p>

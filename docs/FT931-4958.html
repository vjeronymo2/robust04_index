			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Position on EC seats still unclear THE GOVERNMENT last night declined to clear up confusion over how the six new British seats to the European parliament are to be allocated, saying only that it expected to come to a view 'at a very early date,' David Owen writes. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister, acknowledged the matter was 'extremely urgent' but said the government was still considering how best to proceed. Mr George Robertson, shadow foreign office minister, said such an answer was not good enough with the next European elections only 56 weeks away. The response was another example of the 'dazed confusion' the government was in over Europe, he added. It was decided at last year's European summit in Edinburgh to give Britain six more MEPs, bringing the total to 87. In December prime minister John Major indicated Britain would retain the 'first past the post system' for the 1994 European elections.</p>

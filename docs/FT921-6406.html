			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries soar on demand for five-year note auction AFTER a quiet morning, US Treasury prices soared yesterday afternoon in the wake of exceptionally strong retail demand for the five-year note auction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 1/4 at 101 13/16 , yielding 7.835 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100, yielding 5.359 per cent. In the morning, the news that durable goods orders rose 1.5 per cent last month - a bigger rise than expected - was brushed aside amid speculation the Fed would cut interest rates again soon. Prices did not take off until after it became clear there was big demand from retail investors at the five-year auction. In a most unusual conclusion, the auction was completed with no 'tail', or no difference between the average yield and the highest yield accepted, which were both 6.75 per cent. Sentiment was given an additional boost by reports that Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told a Congressional hearing the Fed was considering purchases of more long-term Treasury bonds as a means of bringing down stubbornly high long-term interest rates. EUROPEAN government bond markets continued to advance almost in unison yesterday as investors digested Tuesday's news from the US of weak consumer confidence. In the German market, bund futures broke through the 88.00 ceiling against which they had pushed without success the day before, triggering a round of technical buying. There were also reports of buying from domestic retail investors, continuing a trend of position-building which has been notable for much of the past fortnight. The continued buying was notable in medium-term maturities, where much of the recent interest has been. The result, in a busy day on the futures markets, was a move out of the recent trading range, with the Liffe contract trading up at around 88.29 at the close. UK government bonds also rose on the general swell of positive sentiment, though the market continued to look in vain for any hints of an early cut in interest rates. The March gilt futures contract advanced close to a level at which it could have triggered a release of the Bank of England's tap stock. However, it later fell slightly to around 98.06. The tap level has not been touched for two weeks, and with an estimated Pounds 500m still on the Bank's books, the stock is still seen as placing a ceiling on the upward movement of the market. The benchmark gilt maturing 2003/07 closed at around 116 3/4 , for a yield of 9.27 per cent, while the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed up  3/16 of a point to 99 13/32 , a yield of 9.06 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the scale of business subject to such actions in order that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about through group action of essentially small entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued under the Act are based on those established under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal marketing orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are 5 handlers of olives regulated under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order, and approximately 1,350 producers in the regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. In addition, there are approximately 25 importers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> olives subject to the requirements of the olive import  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small agricultural service firms, which include olive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handlers and importers, are defined as those whose annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> olive producers and importers may be classified as small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities. None of the olive handlers may be so classified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final rule was issued on July 21, 1994, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 38104, July 27,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994], with an effective date of July 27, 1994. That rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended &sect;&sect;932.152, and 932.401 of regulations in effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which ended August 26, 1994. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Olive Committee (committee), the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for local administration of the order, met on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outgoing inspection procedures to permit handlers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a QAP in lieu of maintaining continuous in-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outgoing inspection of processed olives. Outgoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection is the assignment of a final grade to the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after processing is completed, according to the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Standards) [7 CFR 52.3751 to 52.3764]. The committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recommended that handlers be allowed to size whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pitted olives by diameter after pitting, as an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the requirement that such olives be sized by weight prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to pitting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the interim final rule, &sect;932.52 of the order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and &sect;932.152 of the regulations required handlers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain continuous in-line outgoing inspection for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling of processed olives. Also, pursuant to &sect;932.53,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such outgoing inspection is performed by the Processed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products Branch (PPB) of the Department. Continuous in-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outgoing inspection consists of inspection and grading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services in an approved plant whereby one or more PPB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspector(s) are present at all times the plant is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation to make in-process checks on the preparation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing, packing, and warehousing of all products and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assure compliance with sanitary requirements. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs for continuous in-line outgoing inspection have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased in recent years. Thus, the PPB is prepared to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop QAP inspection procedures which will provide quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance certification for California olive handlers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby reducing handlers' inspection costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, most handlers employ their own quality-control personnel. The PPB is prepared to establish QAPs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with individual handlers as provided in the ``Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Vegetables and Related Products'' [7 CFR Part 52.2]. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established, handlers will be permitted to use a QAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection procedure rather than continuous in-line outgoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection. Under a QAP, the PPB provides training for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handler's quality-control personnel. The handler's quality-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control personnel will be trained in the same procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently used by the PPB inspectors. Once the handler's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality-control personnel are trained to properly perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same duties and responsibilities as a PPB inspector, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of evaluation of the reliability of the handler's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality control responsibilities begins. This is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliability evaluation period. At such time as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handler's quality-control personnel successfully complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reliability evaluation period, a QAP will begin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation with oversight provided by the PPB. The PPB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspectors will continue to issue certificates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection. Certificates of inspection will be based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outgoing inspection records maintained by the handler's QAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel. These will be verified through spot-checks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample regrading by PPB inspectors. A QAP will continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assure safe, wholesome, and uniformly high-quality processed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

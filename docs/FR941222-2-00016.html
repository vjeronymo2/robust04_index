Permit 747 allows FWS to take threatened Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oncorhynchus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> tshawytscha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217&hyph;22).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FWS requested an expansion of their research sampling area to include the lower reaches of the creeks and tributaries of the Sacramento River in Butte, Glenn, and Tehama Counties in CA. The expanded sampling will occur in the tributaries within 5 miles of their confluence with the mainstem Sacramento River. In addition, FWS requested authorization to allow Dr. Paul E. Maslin, Department of Biological Sciences, California State University at Chico and his graduate students to carry out this expanded sampling and to participate in the part of the research involving the annual collection and sacrifice of up to 450 adipose fin-clipped and coded-wire tagged juvenile, listed, Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon released from the FWS's Coleman National Fish Hatchery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice is hereby given that on December 6, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification 4 to Permit 747 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. This modification will be in effect for the duration of the permit, which expires on December 31, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issuance of this permit, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is subject to parts 217&hyph;222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice is hereby given that the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has applied in due form to take listed species as authorized by the ESA and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DWR (P578) requests authorization to take juvenile and adult, threatened, Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oncorhynchus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> tshawytscha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) for scientific research purposes while conducting an acoustic barrier applied research project at the confluence of Georgiana Slough with the Sacramento River. The purpose of the proposed project is to determine the effectiveness of an underwater acoustic barrier in diverting migrating juvenile chinook salmon away from Georgiana Slough under various hydraulic and hydrologic conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated substantially higher mortality rates for downstream migrating juvenile chinook salmon which pass from the Sacramento River into Georgiana Slough when compared with salmon which continue their migration downstream within the Sacramento River channel. The proposed study involves Kodiak trawling within the Sacramento River and Georgiana Slough between February and June 1995 to determine the guidance efficiency of the barrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on this application should be submitted to the Chief, Endangered Species Division, Office of Protected Resources, F/PR8, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226, within 30 days of the publication of this notice.

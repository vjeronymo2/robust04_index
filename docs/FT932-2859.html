			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Inkatha may be bypassed in S African talks MR Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday warned that talks on a new South African constitution would go ahead with or without the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, his main black rival. The future of the talks will be decided today when delegates from Inkatha and other conservative groups return to the negotiating table to report on whether they intend permanently to withdraw from the talks. Six conservative parties, known as the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag), provoked a crisis on Tuesday when they staged a walkout. Mr Mandela took a tough line against the dissenters yesterday when he told a crowd in Soweto: 'We want to warn them that no party will be able to hold the multi-party negotiations to ransom.' He was speaking at a rally to mark the annual 'Soweto day' unofficial holiday, observed by blacks to commemorate anti-apartheid riots in 1976, the spark which led to eventual uprisings in the 1980s which helped prompt political reform. Yesterday Chief Buthelezi defended his delegation's decision to lead the walkout, accusing the government and ANC of arrogance and saying his group had drawn a line against 'those who have been attempting to manipulate the process of the constitutional development of our country while disregarding the real aspirations of the majority of South Africans'. The dispute centres on whether Inkatha and its allies, which include the white right-wing Conservative party, will be allowed to exercise real power within the negotiations, or simply be called on to rubber-stamp a constitution which has already been agreed in outline between the ANC and the government. In their haste to implement their draft constitution, calling for a five-year multi-racial government of national unity, the government and ANC have tended to ignore concerns of regionally-based parties such as Inkatha for maximum devolution of power. On Tuesday the ANC and government bloc threw out a resolution from Inkatha's sister delegation, the KwaZulu 'homeland' government, calling for debate on a federal constitution. In a crucial test of the 'sufficient consensus' rule by which decisions in the 26-party forum are taken, the talks chairman declared the resolution did not have sufficient consensus. In effect, this means the assent of Inkatha and its allies is not necessary for sufficient consensus - and that the forum can overrule Inkatha in all matters. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Turkey's EC courtship lowers the trade barriers - The most radical reforms since the early '80s IF TRADE officials in Brussels still have doubts about Turkey's commitment to open its markets, they might consider the case of Philip Morris, the US cigarette manufacturer. Having invested nearly Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m) on a plant near Izmir  - its largest single investment outside the US - the company now says it would have been cheaper to import its product from a European subsidiary. Philip Morris's predicament is a measure of the impact of the sweeping tariff cuts, introduced in January, that put Turkey back on track for a customs union with the European Community by 1996. Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro brand, is something of a special case, investing in one of the most regulated industrial sectors in Turkey. But as the deadline approaches, Turkish trade officials expect a tug-of-war between government and industry across a whole range of sectors. In March a joint EC-Turkish steering committee was established, with the government and particularly the foreign ministry enthusiastically extolling the merits of a customs union. In Ankara recently, Turkish business leaders from industries most vulnerable to import competition met to develop a strategy. With a customs union, the business environment will be turned on its head. Foreign investors can no longer base their calculations simply on the attractions of Turkey's large protected home market. Issues of cost structure and export competitiveness have to be considered. Moreover, for foreign multinationals already in the country, the tariff changes will force a complete rethink of sourcing policies, with a clear incentive to source imported raw materials and process inputs to the EC. The trade picture has changed, too. Trading companies from Japan complain their Turkish buyers are turning to EC suppliers and in some instances even cancelling existing contracts. For Turkish groups, the reforms will accelerate the trend to foreign collaboration. Many local companies, from consumer durable manufacturers to vehicle makers, are seeking foreign partners in an attempt to upgrade technologies and boost exports - ultimately the only defence against increased import competition. Mr Hayrettin Yildirim, head of investment at the Treasury, says Turkish groups will have to integrate with foreign multinationals if they want to compete. He believes the days of family-owned holdings are numbered. According to EC calculations, the cuts in import duties reduce effective rates of protection for the Community's industrial goods by an average 6.4 per cent. For the first time, EC goods and those from countries of the European Free Trade Association are provided with a clear trade preference over third countries, estimated at around 4 per cent - the crux of Philip Morris's complaint. The reforms provide greater transparency and scrap a number of non-tariff barriers such as stamp duty and a range of special levies. The moves represent the most radical trade reform since the late President Turgut Ozal embarked on Turkey's market-oriented policies in the early 1980s. The legislation, passed by parliament last summer, has taken two years to prepare and covers some 18,000 individual import items. However, for industrial goods, effective protection rates remain around 15 per cent while for farm products, which are currently excluded from the negotiations, they are as high as 62 per cent. Nonetheless, by 1996 rates are scheduled to be reduced to zero and Ankara will adopt the Community's common external tariff (CET) for goods from third countries. The EC lifted import restrictions on Turkish goods in 1973, although textiles are covered separately by a quota arrangement and there are various seasonal restrictions on certain food products. But Turkey's task is not simply to satisfy the EC timetable agreed under its 1964 Association Agreement. It has to show that the arrangement is not in breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The new regime also has to maintain sufficient tax revenues at a time of budget constraints. Ankara points out it will be the only country to enter a customs union without gaining EC membership and is seeking EC funds to compensate for an implied revenue loss of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) a year. The adjustment for investors, both foreign and domestic, has been considerable. With inflation around 60 per cent and the lira having suffered a real depreciation, investors already complain their capital is being eroded. As trade barriers come down, the traditional attractions of investing in Turkey change. Indeed, officials concede there may be a significant drop in foreign capital inflows. Dr Ali Tigrel, former head of the state planning organisation, warns that Turkey 'cannot go into customs union with closed eyes', an increasingly common refrain in Turkish boardrooms. In 1992, Turkey approved Dollars 1.8bn worth of foreign investment permits (though considerably less is realised). Moreover, most - the Istanbul based Capital Co-ordination Board estimates as much as 80 per cent - is targeted at domestic sales in protected sectors such as cement, cars and tobacco. In the long run the exercise will force through new efficiencies and concentrate resources in the areas where Turkey has real competitive advantage. Mr Yavuz Canevi, a former head of the central bank and now chairman of the Foreign Capital Co-ordination Board, says: 'I don't think Turkey should be seen any longer as a haven for protected industries.'</p>

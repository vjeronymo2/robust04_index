			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Independent republics in disarray over armed forces THE FUTURE of the Common-wealth of Independent States was thrown into doubt yesterday when three former Soviet republics said they would immediately create their own armed forces. The declarations by Moldova, Azerbaijan and Ukraine at the CIS summit meeting in Minsk constituted a sharp rebuff to Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who has sought to maintain a unified military command. The question remains open on when the other republics, especially Russia, will form their own military forces. However, the remaining eight republics agreed to retain a form of unified command for two years. Belorussia and Uzbekistan agreed to the transitional period, but with reservations. Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, chairman of the Belorussian parliament, said its constitution did not allow it to be a member of a military pact, but it would stay within the commonwealth structure for the time being. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov was confirmed as head of the united strategic and conventional forces - but decisions on the chief of the general staff and the commanders of the strategic and conventional forces were delayed. The presidents agreed to meet again in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev on March 20. All 11 members have agreed there should be one unified command over the strategic nuclear forces, under the control of the presidents of the four states with nuclear weapons - Belorussia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine. The agreement on control of the nuclear forces is, according to Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, a statement only of general principles - 'and so we could sign it.' He made clear that Ukraine intended to destroy its nuclear warheads by 1994  -at the end of the two-year transitional period. The urgent military issue which has divided Russia and Ukraine, control of the Black Sea fleet, also appears to have been put off until the March meeting in Kiev. Mr Kravchuk said after the 11-hour meeting last night that he had not discussed military questions with Mr Yeltsin. Russia, meanwhile, is likely to face calls from its parliament and some of its senior military advisers for the immediate creation of a Russian army - especially as it is now clear Ukraine will take no further part in the commonwealth forces. However, Mr Yeltsin was reported to have said that 'Russia does not intend to create its own armed forces'. The vexed question of the division of property of the former Soviet Union has also been left to the meeting on March 20. Mr Kravchuk said that the meeting passed in an 'atmosphere of goodwill', although officials attending the meeting said tempers flared between him and Mr Yeltsin. Some 20 documents were signed by the presidents, including an economic agreement which, according to Mr Kravchuk, devolves responsibility for concluding trade contracts from the state level to the level of enterprises and local organisations. The United Nations announced yesterday that the General Assembly would meet on February 28 to admit eight former Soviet republics to the UN, Reuter reports.</p>

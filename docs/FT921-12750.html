			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Michelin man finds recession food tasty HOTELS and restaurants in the UK have responded to the recession by raising standards while maintaining or even cutting prices, according to the editor of the 1992 Michelin guide, which was published yesterday. Mr Derek Brown said that the guide, in spite of the recession, had added nine restaurants to its list of Michelin-starred establishments. The new additions, all of which received one star, include Tatsuso, a Japanese restaurant in the City of London, Lettonie of Bristol and 21 Queen Street in Newcastle upon Tyne. Le Gavroche in Mayfair and the Waterside Inn in Bray, Berkshire, kept their three-star ranking. La Tante Claire in Chelsea; Harvey's in Wands-worth, south London; Chez Nico in Westminster; Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons near Oxford; and L'Ortolan, near Reading kept their two stars. There were 36 one-star establishments. Mr Brown said more restaurants had introduced fixed-price menus, many offering a wider choice than previously.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 16 (XINHUA) -- It is only logical  and legitimate for the Chinese side to reorganize the three-tier  councils in Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law and  decisions of China's top legislative organ after 1997.    This was stated by Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the  Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, at a seminar on  Tuesday [15 March], which was attended by advisors on local  district affairs.    Owing to sabotage of the British side, it is impossible to  implement the so-called "through train" arrangements, which  allows legislators elected in 1995 to remain in office after  July 1, 1997, when China resumes the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong, Zheng said.    As part of the framework with which Britain ruled Hong Kong,  the last district boards, the two municipal councils and the  Legislative Council under the British administration will surely  terminate along with the colonialist reign, he stressed.    As the transfer of power is approaching, Zheng said, "we  must  rely on Hong Kong compatriots, including Hong Kong advisors, to  make good preparations for works in all fields during the  transitional period and make every possible effort to keep Hong  Kong stable and prosperous."    During the seminar, many Hong Kong district affairs advisors  threw their support to a motion, proposed by Cheng Yiu-tong, a  Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), and  agreed by other 30-odd delegates, on the reorganization of the  three-tier councils.    District affairs advisor Fok Ting-hung deems it necessary  for  the NPC, which serves as the highest organ of the state power in  China, to approve the motion.</p>

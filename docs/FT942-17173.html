			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais in alliance move Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, hopes to expand its insurance interests by forging a strategic alliance with Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance group, according to Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's chairman. Mr Peyrelevade, who last autumn was brought into Credit Lyonnais by the government to rescue the ailing bank, said he had discussed the possibility of an alliance with Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, AGF chairman. 'It's obvious to me that we need a long-term partner in insurance,' he said. 'The question is whether AGF wants to be that partner. I've had a very friendly conversation with Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani who asked me, perfectly reasonably, for time to think it over.' AGF yesterday confirmed that Mr Jeancourt-Galignani was considering the feasibility of an alliance with Credit Lyonnais. However, it stressed this was only one of a number of strategic options under consideration. Societe Generale, another leading French bank, has indicated interest in forging closer links with AGF. The overtures from Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, both of which have small cross-shareholdings in AGF, form part of the trend for France's big banks to reduce their reliance on the intensely competitive banking market by diversifying into related fields, notably insurance. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), another big bank, used its recent privatisation as an opportunity to clarify its strategic links and cross-shareholding with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's largest insurer which is due to be privatised this spring. Mr Peyrelevade, who recently sold Credit Lyonnais's 30 per cent holding in the Union des Assureurs Federales insurance group as part of his FFr35bn (Dollars 5.9bn) asset sale programme, said he did not envisage an eventual partnership between Credit Lyonnais and AGF adopting the same structure as that of BNP and UAP. However he said it would be 'in the same spirit'.</p>

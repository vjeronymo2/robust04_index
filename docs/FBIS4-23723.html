			<p>BFN     [Text] Alfredo del Rio, representative of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], says over 1 million  Mozambicans have already returned home in the repatriation  program. Del Rio was speaking to Radio Mozambique about the  integrated plan to assist returnees that is being implemented by  the UNHCR and the Mozambican Refugee Assistance Unit. He added  that now the repatriation of refugees is likely to gain momentum  since it is the dry season. The repatriation of refugees will  continue until the end of October.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;S News up 10% to Pounds 3.8m Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers, the publishing, printing and retailing group, increased pre-tax profits by 10 per cent from Pounds 3.39m to Pounds 3.75m in the half year to September 25, on turnover 5 per cent higher at Pounds 54.9m, against Pounds 52.3m. All group companies improved profits, apart from Portsmouth Publishing &amp; Printing which suffered a further decline in its market place. In response to these poor conditions, PP&amp;P closed a free newspaper, Streetlife, and also continued to reduce manpower elsewhere. These actions resulted in rationalisation costs of Pounds 639,000 (Pounds 290,000). Excluding these costs, underlying profits before tax increased by 19 per cent. Earnings per share slipped to 20.2p (20.6p). In line with the board's intention of paying an interim of about one third of the previous year's total, the interim is 3.12p (2.84p).</p>

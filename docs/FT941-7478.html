			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Munich Re to raise DM700m Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, is raising DM700m (Dollars 397.7m) through a deeply discounted one-for-eight rights issue. The group said funds from the issue would bolster its financial position. While announcing the issue, Munich Re predicted losses from mainstream reinsurance business - before investment income - in the financial year to June would be reduced. Although there had been abundant natural disasters in 1993, the knock-on effect on the reinsurance industry had been less severe than in previous years, the group explained. Growth in premium income during the financial year to June 1994 would be in the region of 10 per cent, the same as in the past two years. It said it was too early to judge the precise level of overall profitability for the group but was confident that investment income would again compensate for underwriting losses. This would enable last year's dividend of DM11 per share to be matched, Munich Re said. Last year underwriting losses rose to DM1.27bn from DM1.12bn but after investment income, net earnings climbed to DM287m from DM278m. Premium income rose to DM25.56bn from DM23bn. The new shares are priced at DM800, a discount of about 75 per cent. The shares closed down DM20 at DM3,020 yesterday. Each new share comes with a warrant attached and four of these will allow the shareholder to subscribe for one further Munich Re share at an exercise price of DM2,650. The warrants may be exercised between July 4 this year and March 13 1998.</p>

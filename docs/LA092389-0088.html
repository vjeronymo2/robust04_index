			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Checchi Gets Report on Northwest: Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner  told Alfred A. Checchi, the new owner of Northwest Airlines, the result of an  investigation into the airline's financial health. The results will not be made  public until next week. Joined by Australian brewer Elders IXL and KLM Royal  Dutch Airlines, Checchi bought Northwest three months ago for $4.05 billion,  including $3.1 billion in debt. Skinner is concerned about foreign ownership  and the safety of airlines involved in debt-financed takeovers.  </P></p>

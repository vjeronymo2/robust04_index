			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bulletin No. 3 issued by the Electoral Tribunal, TE, at the </F> Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City; read by TE Press  Secretary Doris Chong Guardia -- live]    [Text] The voting process in Bocas del Toro Province has  ended, and everything is in order. As the voting process ended  in Los Santos Province, we learned that the elections were held  amid a peaceful atmosphere; however, minor incidents occurred  and were quickly resolved. Several political party  representatives, who arrived at the voting centers to cast their  votes as they were closing, complained in Chitre, Ocu, and  Parita Districts. They began complaining when voting table  authorities enforced the guidelines for such cases. Due to  technical problems at the relay station and despite great  efforts made to reestablish communication lines with the San  Blas Indian Reservation, we were unable to obtain details about  the final phase of the voting process in this Indian region.    Meanwhile, in Darien Province, along the Colombian border,  it  was reported that the end of the voting process went smoothly,  despite a six-hour delay at two voting tables in Rio Iglesias.  This problem was solved, and lost time was recovered. In  Cocle, it was reported that the voting process went as planned,  but a couple of vote-buying incidents took place in Cabuya  hamlet. The Anton municipal attorney is handling the  investigations. There was a shortage of 20 presidential ballots  at a voting table in Salineta de Nata, but Electoral Tribunal  [TE] officials immediately supplied them.    Meanwhile, the Electoral District Vote-Counting Boards were  set up at 1400 in Chiriqui Province, and the wait for the end of  the elections began. Now that voters have finished voting,  these electoral organizations have started performing their  duties.    Most international observers invited by the TE came back  from  their tours of the many electoral posts in the countryside and  concluded their observations in the metropolitan area, where  they witnessed the end of the electoral process at several  voting tables.    As we conclude this third bulletin, we inform the media that  from now on the flow of information is in the hands of the TE  information system, as announced by the honorable TE  magistrates. Thank you.</p>

This issue has  been entrusted to the politburo. However the FLN has been  reaffirming that it will not participate in approving a meeting  that excludes any effective political force. The resolution  endorsed by the FLN central committee called on the politburo  which it authorized to take the initiatives it deems necessary  for the national dialogue and to avoid solutions that do not  lead to national unanimity.    [Begin FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri recording] The  central committee, out of its desire to avoid useless solutions,  asks the politburo not to endorse any authority, and not to  employ the credit of the party in providing imaginary legitimacy  to such an authority, but it remains prepared to cooperate with  any authority which genuinely desires to take the country out of  the crisis and restore it to legitimacy and its natural  situation. The central committee, out of its concern for the  position of the National People's Army and its desire to  preserve its position on account of it being a constitutional  establishment, expects from it in these serious circumstances to  support any orientation for a comprehensive dialogue which  responds to the people's expectation to take the country out of  the crisis and restore it to a natural situation. The central  committee is of the opinion that the proposed national  conference is not the only formula for making the national  dialogue successful. It reaffirms once again the FLN's  attachment to the serious comprehensive and far-reaching  dialogue to take the country out of the crisis. [end recording]    Immediately following the end of the session Mr. Abdelhamid  Mehri met with the national and foreign press and answered some  of the questions relating to issues of national dialogue. The  participation in the national conference remains linked to the  extent of the development of the stances of the sides involved  in the national dialogue.    For its part, the Rally for Culture and Democracy [RCD] held  a session of its national council to study the general situation  in the country and its attitude toward the dialogue and the  participation in the national conference. At the beginning of  the session and following a comprehensive analysis of the  situation in Algeria at the political, economic, and security  levels, RCD leader Said Saadi dealt with the issue of the  dialogue. Will the RCD participate in the national conference  or not? To answer this question, Said Saadi said that it was  inevitable that several points should be discussed, and in the  light of this the executive council of the party will decide  whether to participate in the dialogue.

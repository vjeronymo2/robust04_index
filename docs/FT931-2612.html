			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: LVMH's sharp setback blamed on Guinness LVMH, the French luxury goods group, yesterday confirmed that it suffered a sharp fall in net profits from FFr3.7bn in 1991 to FFr3.0bn (Dollars 530m) last year, mainly because of the problems of Guinness, the UK drinks group in which it owns a 24 per cent stake. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, was cautiously optimistic about the 1993 outlook for LVMH, which owns a string of prestigious brand names including Louis Vuitton luggage and Hennessy cognac. 'Even without an improvement in the economic environment LVMH should hold up well,' he said. 'If the environment improves we should benefit'. This time last year analysts were forecasting a sharp increase in 1992 net profits for LVMH to FFr4.4bn. The global luxury goods market has since been badly affected by the economic slowdown, particularly in Japan. The group has also been hit by the franc's strength following the September currency crisis. The news earlier this year of Guinness' restructuring plans prompted LVMH to issue a warning that last year's profits would fall to FFr3bn due to the reduced income from Guinness. It affirmed yesterday that the contribution from the UK drinks group fell from FFr1.1bn in 1991 to FFr681m in 1992. LVMH also saw sales fall from FFr22.04bn in 1991 to FFr21.66bn in 1992, due to economic difficulties and adverse currency changes. LVMH said that, on stable exchange rates, its sales would have risen by 1.2 per cent, slightly below the French inflation rate. Operating profits fell from FFr6.4bn to FFr5.5bn over the same period. The only division to show growth was perfumes and cosmetics, where operating profits rose from FFr636m to FFr809m mainly due to the impact of recent fragrance launches - Dune by Christian Dior and Givenchy's Amarige. The worst affected division was champagne and wines, which saw operating profits fall from FFr1.3bn to FFr780m. Mr Arnault said the outlook for the group's European markets was still uncertain, although there were signs of fledgling recovery in the UK. Lex, Page 16</p>

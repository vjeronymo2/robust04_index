			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Alarm Over Food-Staple Prices"] </F>   [Text] Believing that persistent price hikes for farm  produce will continue to hinder efforts to control inflation,  economists with the State Statistics Bureau are calling for  prompt official action to rein in the spiralling prices of  grain, edible oil and meat.    This continuous climb in prices jeopardizes the central  government's campaign to reduce inflation in the country's 35  major cities to 19 percent this coming December from 23.2  percent in April.    The government's hopes for cooling inflation were fanned by  a  recent survey by the bureau's urban statistics team which found  that prices were plummeting for machines, electronics and  household electrical appliances.    But the prices of grain, edible oil and meat are still  climbing. This poses a serious problem for the government, which  must improve its control over prices if it is to achieve its  economic target this year.    The survey found no signs that the upward trend in prices  will reverse itself in the months ahead.    According to the bureau, grain prices rose in April by 3.8  percent from March, and by 36.7 percent from April a year ago.    On free markets, a kilogram of rice now fetches between 1.70  yuan (20 U.S. cents) and 2.20 yuan (25 cents), up 4.4 percent  from the beginning of this year.    Prices are lower in State grain shops because of the  government's stern pricing guidelines that are intended to  stabilize the grain supply. But managers of these shops  complain of unprecedented losses.    Because of a severe shortage, the prices of edible oil  increased 55.8 percent in April from a year earlier.    Some local governments, worried that edible-oil prices may  run beyond what residents can afford, are subsidizing grain  shops and restricting consumer purchases by once again issuing  coupons.    The average price of oil made from soya bean, rape seed and  peanuts is now between 7 yuan (80 cents) and 9 yuan ($1) a  kilogram, 0.6 yuan (7 cents) higher than at the start of this  year.    The swelling costs of animal feed are also making various  meat products more expensive, the bureau said.    Meat prices have climbed an average 33.4 percent from last  year, the bureau said.    The setback in cotton production, meanwhile, is presenting a  tough challenge to the government's efforts to control cloth and  garment prices.    The bureau's figures show that prices for cotton cloth have  persistently increased this year. In April, the year-on-year  increase was 25.4 percent.    Analysts explain that side-effects of the pricing reform and  the rocketing cost of production materials have combined to form  the Achilles heel of the economy.    The government's lifting of price controls on grain and  other  consumer products last year created imponderable effects on the  economy that are now being felt. Analysts do not expect the  inflationary pressures to abate because of the persistent  adverse factors that took shape in 1993.</p>

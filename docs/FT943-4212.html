			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fair deal for Peruvian growers  -Deborah Hargreaves on Cafedirect's buying in the Chiclayo region Ms Luzmila Loayza visits 4,300 small coffee farmers in northern Peru several times a year - some of them she can reach only by donkey. As a coffee buyer for Cafedirect, the fair trade organisation, she is unlike many other agents who do not venture further than the coffee processing plant. 'At the moment some of these farmers are being offered fantastic prices by some coffee buyers who appear one day and disappear the next and don't return,' said Ms Loayza. She stresses the benefits of a stable marketing organisation such as Cafedirect which pays a 10 per cent premium over world prices in order to guarantee a fair return to growers. Since coffee prices have soared on the London and New York commodity exchanges this year, prices for the Peruvian farmers in the area around the town of Chiclayo have jumped from the equivalent of USDollars 110 per quintal last year (a bag containing 200lbs) to between Dollars 340 and Dollars 380. When coffee prices reached their low point in 1992, the farmers were receiving Dollars 10 a bag - not even enough to buy a bag of rice. Most of the Peruvian farmers are extremely small producers with only 3-4 hectares of land, producing 7-8 bags of coffee a year. They are organised into nine co-operatives to direct their products towards the export market. The Peruvian farmers are using windfall profits from recent price increases to buy land or cattle or invest in improvements to their production methods. But few are planting new coffee trees - they take at least three years to bear fruit and market conditions are too uncertain to risk the investment. The coffee farmers are also eager to diversify into other products for export to try to avoid the vagaries of the international coffee price. They are looking to produce honey, black-eye beans, lemon grass and even cocoa. The coffee price rise has meant farmers are more eager to stay on their farms rather than migrate to nearby coca fields where the drug is grown mainly for turning into cocaine. Cafedirect buys five per cent of the 200,000 bags of coffee produced by the farmers in the region around Chiclayo who are divided into nine co-operatives. For the past two years the company has been selling ground coffee as a 'fair trade' product and this week it launched a range of instant coffee. The company hopes to gain a one per cent market share of the Pounds 500m British instant coffee market and is using the Peruvian farmers in its advertisements. 'They're amazed at the promotional side of it,' said Mr Loayza. 'They can't understand why people in the west should be interested in hearing about their farms.'</p>

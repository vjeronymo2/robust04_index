			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (1): Action plan lifts Amsterdam's status - The centrepiece of the Dutch capital's programme of financial reforms is an overhaul of the stock exchange's trading system this month. Ronald van de Krol, author of this survey, discusses achievements Six years after the launch of a wide-ranging programme to boost Amsterdam's status as a financial centre, the Dutch capital has decided to wind up its campaign of reforms, initiatives and promotional activities. The move, far from signifying defeat, is clear confirmation that Amsterdam has achieved its aim of bolstering its standing in the face of concerted competition from larger international financial centres, particularly London. The campaign, which began as a joint initiative of prominent bankers in 1988, was not intended that Amsterdam should rival the stature of first-tier European centres such as London or Frankfurt. Instead, the goal was to confirm Amsterdam's place in the second tier and to prevent its slide into third-tier status. The centrepiece of the campaign - a radical overhaul of the trading system at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, with a separation of the wholesale and retail segments of the market - is due to take place on September 30. Earlier milestones in the campaign, which was formally ended in May, included the abolition of exchange duty, reforms of the government bond market, and the introduction of a fixed seven-day settlement system. Another successful element in the promotion of Amsterdam was persuading foreign banks, particularly in the Far East, to choose the Netherlands as a base for expanding into the European market place. There have also been disappointments along the way. Amsterdam's hopes of attracting a prestigious multilateral financial institution, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the nascent European Central Bank, were both dashed. Another of the campaign's original 23 aims - the development of Amsterdam as a centre for the trading of ECU-denominated financial instruments - also failed to materialise. Early on, it became clear that neither Dutch companies nor the Dutch state would be issuing enough ECU paper in the short term to create the right conditions for a flourishing market segment. 'A lot has happened here,' says Jan Steinhauser, a former deputy-director of the Dutch central bank who ran the 'Amsterdam Financial Centre' campaign. 'The action plan, with all its limitations, has achieved good things for the Dutch financial community. Without it, the situation would have been deplorable.' However, Mr Steinhauser and other members of the financial community are aware that the reforms and changes are not, in themselves, an iron-clad guarantee that Amsterdam will continue to compete effectively. To achieve that, the big institutions in Amsterdam - essentially the large Dutch banks - must seize the new freedom for equity market-making and make it happen. Prices must be extremely competitive, and market liquidity must be more than ample, if buyers and sellers of Dutch shares and bonds are to be persuaded to do their business in Amsterdam rather than London. Almost exactly a year ago, ABN Amro, the Netherlands's largest bank and biggest single participant on domestic capital markets, caused a brief flutter of anxiety when it announced plans to move the co-ordination of world-wide equity sales, trading and research to London. Louis de Bievre, member of the management board and head of investment banking and global clients, said the bank had since managed to allay fears that it was withdrawing support from the Amsterdam market. 'It is not at all our intention to close down in the Netherlands and to operate solely from London. We are a Dutch bank, and we will do our best to keep the Amsterdam bourse strong for the shares that are traded here and to keep the market competitive.' Like other Dutch banks gearing up for the September 30 reforms, ABN Amro believes the changes can help win back part of the equity business that now takes place in London, mirroring Amsterdam's earlier success in recapturing the initiative in government bond trading. 'I think that you will see the same effect (in shares as in bonds),' Mr de Bievre said. However, there are obvious limits to Amsterdam's ambitions. It may be able to ward off London's encroachments, but it cannot supplant the UK capital's role as the place where international financial flows come together in Europe. For ABN Amro and other European banks, but perhaps for other Dutch financial institutions in future, London is an obvious place from which to co-ordinate a worldwide equity business. 'If we want to compete with our peer group, we, too, must be in London,' he said. Although the reforms that are about to take place at the stock exchange are impressive enough, they are at least several years overdue. In fact, it had been obvious since the 1980s that the bourse, which claims to be the world's oldest with a history stretching back to the 17th century, was being hamstrung by the limited resources of its stock jobbers, or 'hoekmen'. Though required by bourse rules to be involved in virtually every transaction that took place between two parties, the hoekmen were simply too poorly-capitalised and too small to act as middle men in the sale and purchase of shares and bonds. The result was excessive costs and dwindling liquidity, two factors that helped drive trading in Dutch bonds and shares to London. Significantly, alarm bells began to ring in Amsterdam only after an 'outsider", the McKinsey consultancy firm, prepared a report showing the extent to which trading had seeped across the English Channel. This, in turn, helped concentrate the minds of all participants in Amsterdam, leading to the painful but necessary decision to sacrifice a large number of the traditional 'hoekman' and to convert the remaining firms into 'market specialists'. Change is always difficult in a 'co-operative' of member firms such as the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. With stock brokers, banks and old-styled jobbers possessing equal power within the stock exchange, it is not surprising, perhaps, that consensus on the need to change was so long in coming. To remain well-prepared for the future, the bourse and its members will also need to apply their minds to building new kinds of businesses to generate income for the financial community as a whole. They will also need to find new investors, especially among the Dutch public, who so far have not been big buyers of shares. Finally, Amsterdam still needs to increase the number of listed companies from the varied ranks of the Nether-lands's family-owned or privately-held corporations. The June flotation of Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch telecommunications and postal company, was the largest initial public offering in the history of the Amsterdam bourse. The government's first tranche raised nearly Fl 6.9bn (Dollars 3.9bn) and attracted the attention of 188,500 private investors. Nevertheless, the flow of new companies to the bourse has slowed to a trickle in recent years, and so far the KPN flotation has not produced the hoped-for bandwagon effect. Indeed, the recent flotation of Ballast Nedam, the Dutch construction group previously owned by British Aerospace, simply marked the return of a company that had once had a listing. New blood is essential to Amsterdam. It will be getting an injection of sorts in January when foreign banks and brokers, mainly of Anglo-Saxon origin, begin to trade remotely on Amsterdam's new system from their offices on the other side of the Channel. But if it is to lead rather than follow, Amsterdam will have to rely in the end on home-grown energy and talent.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Tirana verdict today Relations between Greece and Albania will be tested today when a court in Tirana passes sentence on five Albanian ethnic Greeks who are accused of spying for Athens. The trial threatens to trigger a crisis between the two countries. Athens accuses the authorities in Tirana of fabricating the charges in order to intimidate Albania's Greek minority. Since the trial began on August 15, the Greek government has deported some 40,000 illegal Albanian immigrants and blocked European Union financial aid to Albania. Greece has warned that further measures will be taken if the men are found guilty. All five defendants are members of the Omonia political movement which campaigns for Greek minority rights in Albania. Diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between the two countries appear to have failed. A US envoy, Mr Richard Shifter, was sent to Tirana and Athens by President Bill Clinton over the weekend to urge conciliation and encourage the Albanian authorities to drop the case.</p>

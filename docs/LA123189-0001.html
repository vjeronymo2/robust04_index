			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A KAFKA FOR SOUTH AFRICA;  </P> <P> ADVANCE, RETREAT BY RICHARD RIVE (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $16.96; 131 PP.)  </P> <P> In the fictional world of Richard Rive, a black South African writer, the  social evil of apartheid appears in the guise of a banality so extreme it can  be expressed only in the form of darkly comic, Kafkaesque parables. For  example, in his story "The Man From the Board," a teacher named Isaac Jacobs is  called upon by "a dumpy little man wearing a khaki safari suit." This droll  creature, Mr. Johannes Bredenkamp, arrives to inform Jacobs that since his  racial classification is "colored," he must leave the white area where he is  living.  </P> <P> Yet Bredenkamp bears no whiff of hostility toward Jacobs. A petty bureaucrat  with "brilliantined hair," he is recognizable in any country and at any time as  a funny little government functionary far more interested in Jacob's choice in  television sets ("Stick to a Sony. The colour is OK"), and his philosophy of  life than in racism; and he lavishly compliments the teacher on his life style:  "Lucky you, being a bachelor and spending most of your time just lecturing and  reading."  </P> <P> Grotesques like Bredenkamp fill the 12 stories collected in "Advance, Retreat,"  their presence reminding us, as in the fiction of Flannery O'Conner, that evil  leads inevitably to social monstrosities, to a madness we have come to accept  as the status quo. We laugh nervously, as Rive wishes, at a society so  blatantly premised on racial prejudice, but the humor holds within itself the  horror of our own absurdity.  </P> <P> A case in point is "Drive-In," which illustrates how the stupidity of  segregation turns even South African liberals into insensitive louts. Here,  Rive's narrator and nameless protagonist, a black writer, is trying to escape  from a boring "informal get-together, a social occasion of would-be writers and  weekend poets." Before he can flee, a white teacher named Jenny, who is  "ostentatiously progressive and liberal," insists on giving him a ride.  "Everything about you people fascinates me," she says.  </P> <P> Although the narrator does everything he can to shock her into seeing her own  bigotry, she is unflappable and spirits him off to a segregated drive-in where  she insists they be served. The manager, "a huge Greek who for the first time  in his life realized that he was a white man when he emigrated to South  Africa," rings for the police. Jenny digs in, oblivious to the gnawing panic of  her black passenger, insisting, "If you have no guts, I'm prepared to call his  bluff." Finally, the narrator convinces her to leave, but not before undergoing  the humiliation of confessing to a woman blinded by her own zeal and  indifference to his situation, "Yes, I have no guts."  </P> <P> The courage required to oppose apartheid is lost on the Jennys of South Africa,  according to Rive, but not to Karlie, a simple black man who discovers the real  meaning of resistance in "The Bench," easily the most memorable tale in this  volume and one that takes us behind the newspaper headlines into the heart of  civil disobedience. Karlie would be the last man to think of rebellion.  However, one day he hears a speaker proclaim, "It is up to every one of us to  challenge the right of any law which willfully condemns any person to an  inferior status." To Karlie, "the man on the platform seemed to be rolling out  a new religion, which said that he, Karlie, had certain rights, and his  children would have certain rights. What sort of rights? Like a white man for  instance?"  </P> <P> Although frightened by the thought that he "was as good as any other man,"  Karlie moves almost hypnotically to a train station where "There seemed a  cocoon around each person. Each has his own world. Each moving in a narrow  pattern of his own manufacture." He locates a bench with the legend WHITES ONLY  and sits; he waits for the arrival of a policeman, who strikes him down, then  handcuffs him. The scene, we know, has been played countless times, and one  might think Karlie's victory is Pyrrhic -- all the white observers see is  another black arrested -- but Karlie has achieved "if not a victory over them,  then one over himself," over his fear and the propaganda of inferiority.  </P> <P> Critics may accuse Rive of writing not stories but sketches where his meaning  is thinly veiled. This is true of "No Room at Solitaire," a Christmas story set  in a South African inn where a black Joseph and pregnant Mary are turned away  by the owner, who realizes his error too late.  </P> <P> But even with its flaws, "Advance, Retreat" is a collection to be highly  recommended to anyone who wishes to experience the texture and feel of black  South African lives before they are rendered in the language of politics.  </P> <P> And it must be read for another reason: Rive's talent is clearly world-class.  These stories have appeared in more than 12 languages and in more than 22  countries, but "Advance, Retreat" is the last we shall see of this wizardry.  Richard Rive, after a writing career of 30 years, was murdered in his home near  Cape Town on June 6 of this year.  </P></p>

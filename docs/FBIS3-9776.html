			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariyana Barutchieva: "The Currency Market Today"] </F>   [Text] Sofia, March 29 (BTA) -- Today the Interbank  Currency Market was blocked by the high exchange rate of the  U.S. dollar against the lev. While in the morning the dollar  was sold between 56 and 58 leva, in the afternoon it reached  78-79 leva.    Most of the larger commercial banks withdrew from the  Interbank Market today and sold foreign exchange mainly to their  regular clients for 58-59 leva/$1. "Panic reigns, the market is  paralyzed," said a dealer from one of the large banks who  preferred not to be named. It is absurd to predict to what  heights the dollar and the other key currencies might rise, he  said. In his opinion, the rate of the depreciation of the leva  is not so alarming if compared to the rate of inflation. The  "panic" was created by the skyrocketing prices of the foreign  currencies which he described as "unprecedented".    Tension mounts with the saltatory rise of the hard  currencies  against the lev and people rush headlong to turn their deposits  into foreign exchange. "They are ready to buy any currency, no  matter what the price is," this reporter learned in an exchange  office. Demand is high, the inadequate supply raises tension  additionally, dealers said. The interest rates on 6-month  deposits no longer attract the population.    Some experts believe that the uncontrolled rise of the  foreign exchange against the lev can be stopped by fixing the  exchange rate of the key currencies against the lev or even by  suspension of the currency market. That would set a precedent  for an economy which claims to be market-oriented, say  transactors in the Interbank Market.    In the exchange offices the dollar's price rose to 80-85  leva. The German mark also reached unprecedented prices ranging  between 39 and 45 leva. Many of the exchange offices used the  cross rate to calculate the rate of the Deutsche Mark on the  basis of a rate of 67 leva/$1. The British pound was sold  between 100 and 120 leva. Most of the exchange offices were  selling actively in order to close their long positions.    A dealer from a large state-owned bank who asked not to be  named said that later in the afternoon transactions were made at  about 65 leva/$1. All transactors in the Interbank Market are  expecting drastic measures from the central bank. The national  radio quoted the central bank's Governor Prof. Todor Vulchev, as  saying: "We know what we have to do in the next few days to  reassure people and to reverse the process of depreciation of  the lev."    From March 1 to March 30 the central exchange rate of the  U.S. dollar rose by 23.083 leva, and so did the German mark and  the British pound, respectively by 14.342 leva and 34.869 leva.  According to the national bank, some $6,354,937.33 were bought  and $5,178,413.98 were sold in the Interbank Market today. The  central exchange rate of the dollar for tomorrow is set at  60.609 leva, i.e. nearly 6 leva higher than today's central  exchange rate.</p>

From 16 to 24 December, Comrade Hu Jintao, accompanied by Pu  Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee, and  provincial governor He Zhiqiang, inspected enterprises in  Dehong, Yuxi, and Kunming; visited the development zones and  open ports in Ruili and Wanding; and called on farm households,  veteran party members and cadres in ethnic minority villages and  urban neighborhoods as well as ethnic minority teachers in Luxi.  While in Kunming, he listened to briefings by leaders of the  provincial party committee and provincial government, and spoke  at a meeting with members of the first study class on Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, which was  attended by leading cadres at and above the county level in  Yunnan.    Hu Jintao said that from what he had seen and heard over the  previous few days, he was impressed with Yunnan's great change  and rapid progress over the past 15 years. He said: The  province is full of vitality, and enjoys high economic growth,  social and political stability, greater unity of nationalities,  and an improved livelihood for its people. All of these prove  the correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the party's  basic line, principles, and policies which have been formulated  under the guidance of this theory. They also testify that the  Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government  have proceeded from the actual condition in the province in  resolutely and earnestly implementing a series of policy  decisions and plans adopted by the party Central Committee, and  that party organizations in Yunnan are full of fighting spirit.  He exhorted party organizations at all levels and cadres and  people at large, to be guided by the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, comprehensively  implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session, to seize the opportunity, deepen  reform, and accelerate development, thereby pushing Yunnan's  work in all fields to new heights.    During his tour of Yunnan, Hu Jintao studied and  familiarized  himself, in particular, with the issue of further strengthening  and improving party construction in the process of expediting  the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. In  this connection, he attended and spoke at a discussion in  Kunming with directors of the organization departments of the  provincial party committee and party committees of some  autonomous prefectures and cities directly under the provincial  government.    He said: The organizational line must be dictated by, and  must serve the political line. In conducting work related to  party building, it is necessary to bear in mind the overall  situation of socialist modernization and carry out work in close  conjunction of the party's central task. The correct  orientation and guiding ideology for party building should be to  constantly strengthen and improve party construction while  implementing the party's basic line and carrying out the party's  basic task. In conducting work related to party building, we  should continue to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line as our guide. According to the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and the requirements set by Comrade Jiang  Zemin in his recent speeches, we should focus our attention on  the central task of economic construction, and work hard to  adapt ourselves to the new situation of deepening reform and  expediting development -- especially the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure -- by further emancipating  our minds, persisting in seeking truth from facts, and actively  studying new circumstances and exploring new ways to solve new  problems. We should conscientiously uphold the party's  character as the vanguard of the working class and the  fundamental goal of serving the people wholeheartedly by  comprehensively improving the party ideologically,  organizationally, and in its style of work; and by further  strengthening the rallying power, appeal, and fighting spirit of  all party organizations to promote reform, development and  stability, thereby bringing into better play the party's role as  the core of leadership.    Discussing the main tasks of party building, Hu Jintao  said: We should organize party cadres and members to study  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and  further arm the entire party membership with the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should  continue to pay keen attention to improving the competence of  leading bodies at all levels; make determined efforts to  strengthen grass-roots party organizations; and carry out the  anti-corruption drive in a thoroughgoing and sustained manner.    He emphasized: Diligently studying and mastering the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to enhance  the entire party membership's theoretical understanding of  Marxism is the ideological guarantee for accomplishing the  party's great historic mission in the new era, as well as the  most important task in party building. So far, a good beginning  has been made in studying the theory of socialism with Chinese  characteristics by all party members. We should continue to pay  keen attention to the study by leading cadres, and should urge  them to increase their awareness in study and to further  integrate theory with practice. The pressing task at the moment  is, by combining the study of Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping with the party Central Committee's  decision on establishing a socialist market economy, to further  encourage emancipation of the mind by cadres, and increase their  understanding of the pertinence and urgency in initiating a  brand new economic structure in China, thereby firing their  enthusiasm for reform and building up their confidence in  improving work in all fields.    Urging all party committees to constantly strengthen their  leadership over party building, Hu Jintao said: The key to  accomplishing the various difficult tasks in the nineties and  advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics lies in an effective party leadership. To  further improve the party, it is of crucial importance that all  party committees conduct work in an earnest and responsible  manner. The principle that "the party administers party  affairs" must be implemented through, first and foremost, the  handling of party affairs by all party committees and their top  leaders.</p>

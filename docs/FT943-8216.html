			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: New chief moves to take Andrews Sykes private Mr Jacques Murray, who completed his boardroom takeover at Andrews Sykes by succeeding Mr David Hubbard as chairman last month, has launched a bid to take the specialist industrial group private. European Fire Protection Holding, a private Netherlands-based company owned by Mr Murray, yesterday lifted its stake from 29.67 per cent to 37.87 per cent by acquiring a further 1.17m ordinary shares at 50p apiece. European Fire also acquired 760,000 convertible preference shares, representing 8.26 per cent of the issued convertible preference share capital. The acquisition of the additional ordinary shares triggered the takeover bid under the City Code. Under the terms of the bid, disclosed after the market closed, European Fire is offering 50p a share cash for the outstanding ordinary shares, unchanged at 47p yesterday, and 12p a share for the preference shares, which also closed at 47p. The bid values Andrews Sykes at about Pounds 8.2m. Earlier this year Mr Murray took Nu-Swift private in a similar buy-out bid.</p>

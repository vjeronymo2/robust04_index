			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Investors set aside concerns - New York After last week's record-breaking gains, US share prices are likely to rise further this week as stock market investors continue to set aside concerns about high equity valuations and rising interest rates and concentrate on the promising economic and earnings outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now well past 3,800, in spite of warnings from some analysts that there would be a lot of profit-taking when the average hit that record mark. That there was not much profit-taking - just a 20-point sell-off mid-week, which was quickly offset by a strong Friday rally - was primarily due to the consistently positive economic news that has been released recently. That data has included a big rise in industrial output, sharply higher retail sales, and low consumer and producer price inflation. Investors have responded to the figures by investing in a range of stocks, but most notably in companies whose earnings are closely tied to the economic cycle. This explains why the Dow has outperformed other indices lately. Investors, however, have also been looking forward to some more solid improvements in corporate profitability. They should get what they want this week, when the fourth quarter reporting season begins in earnest. Tomorrow will be the big day for the banking sector - a veritable 'Super Tuesday' of quarterly reporting. Citicorp, which last week issued a preliminary forecast of its October-to-December earnings that delighted investors, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Banking, and NationsBank are among the big banks unveiling their figures. In the wake of Citicorp's upbeat prediction, and the recent strong numbers from J. P. Morgan, analysts are expecting a healthy round of results. Given that the sector has already rallied in anticipation of this, however, banks' earnings announcements might not prompt that much movement in sector share prices. Also reporting on Tuesday will be Chrysler, and here too analysts are looking forward to some positive data. Yet, as with the banks, investors have already discounted a good fourth quarter, so there may not be much of a reaction from Chrysler's stock. At times like these, companies can only disappoint the market, barring an extraordinary and unforeseen leap in profits. The big oil companies will also begin reporting earnings this week, starting with Mobil and Texaco. Although oil prices have been falling steadily for months, Wall Street is looking for some solid profits growth due in particular to buoyant earnings from companies' international 'downstream', or refining and distribution, operations. There is not much in the way of economic data due out this week, although Wednesday's trade figures should say something about how US exports have been affected by the recent appreciation in the dollar. The only other statistics of note will be December housing starts, which are due to be released on Thursday.</p>

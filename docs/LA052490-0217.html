			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREE TAPED BOOKS OFFERED AT LIBRARIES  </P> <P> It was interesting to read Dennis McLellan's article on the Rental Book Tape  business (May 12).  </P> <P> But I was saddened to note the omissions of coverage of free taped books in  public libraries throughout the country serving hundreds of thousands of  readers.  </P> <P> Also, how about the Library of Congress program for free taped books and  periodicals, free play machines, and free postage both ways for a million  housebound readers?  </P> <P> Why not construct an article reviving up free readership and some counteraction  to imbibing superficial TV time-wasting?  </P> <P> L.A.

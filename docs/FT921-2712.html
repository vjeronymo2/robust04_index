			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC likely to roll over farm prices MR RAY MacSharry, the European Community's agricultural commissioner, is today expected to announce a simple roll-over of existing farm prices for 1992-93. The only proposed cuts likely to emerge from today's commission meeting on the price-fixing are those resulting automatically from the stabiliser system agreed in 1988. Last year's harvest totalled 169m tonnes (180m, if eastern Germany is counted), well in excess of the set threshold of 160m, and will therefore trigger a 3 per cent price cut, plus an extra 3 per cent on top of the existing 5 per cent co-responsibiity levy. Officials say cereal stocks are up from 10m tonnes last year to 18m tonnes and could reach 30m by 1993. There are also more than 500,000 tonnes each of beef and dairy produce in EC storage. With such surpluses, Mr McSharry thinks he would be justified in seeking cuts in guaranteed farm prices. But he would prefer to concentrate attention on farm policy reform, made urgent by the Gatt negotiations. Meanwhile, a Gatt panel this week issued a preliminary ruling on the US complaint about EC support for soyabeans. The EC has already changed its soya support system once, in 1989 following a Gatt decision on a similar US complaint. Gatt is keeping its latest decision confidential, allowing both parties time to respond.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Yeltsin decree on company debt President Boris Yeltsin has signed a decree to force Russian enterprises to settle debts incurred between themselves, it was announced yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow. The decree provides for the issue of promissory notes which would enable creditors to sell enterprises' debts to other companies if they remained unpaid. The holders of such debts could then try to recover them by starting bankruptcy proceedings against the indebted enterprise. With inflation very high and enterprises prepared to deliver goods to each other without payment, many have found it not only more profitable, but possible, to drag out payment indefinitely.</p>

Guide for Seeking Legal Advice and Representation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before Office of Special Counsel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Guide for Seeking Legal Advice and Representation Before Office of Special Counsel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a. DA employees or military members asked to provide information (testimonial or documentary) to OSC may obtain legal advice through the Labor Counselor from DA attorneys concerning their rights and obligations. This includes assistance at any interviews with OSC investigators. However, an attorney-client relationship will not be established unless the employee or military member_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is suspected or accused by the OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Has been assigned counsel by the DA General Counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Any military member or employee who reasonably believes that he or she is suspected or has been accused by OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act may obtain legal representation from DA. The counsel assigned will be from another DOD component whenever a DA attorney is likely to face a conflict between the attorney's ethical obligation to the client and DA, or when the suspected or accused individual has requested representation from another DOD component. Outside legal counsel may be retained by DA on behalf of the member or employee under unusual circumstances and only with the personal approval of the DOD General Counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The DA General Counsel will determine whether a conflict is likely to occur if a DA attorney is assigned to represent a military member or civilian. If the DA General Counsel determines a conflict may occur, or if the suspected or accused employee has requested representation from another DOD component, the DA General Counsel will seek the assistance of another General Counsel in obtaining representation outside DA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Requests for Representation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. To obtain legal representation, military members or civilian employees must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Submit a written request for legal representation through the Labor and Employment Law Office, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Department of the Army, to DA General Counsel, explaining the circumstances that justify legal representation. Copies of all process and pleadings served should accompany the request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Indicate whether private counsel, at personal expense, has been retained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Obtain written certification from their supervisor that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) They were acting within the scope of official duties; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) DA has not initiated any adverse or disciplinary action against them for the conduct being investigated by the OSC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Requests for DA legal representation must be approved by the DA General Counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The conditions of legal representation must be explained and accepted in writing by the member or employee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Limitations on Representation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a. DA will not provide legal representation with respect to a DA initiated disciplinary action against a civilian employee for committing or participating in a prohibited personnel practice or for engaging in illegal or improper conduct. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the participation or conduct is also the basis for the disciplinary action proposed by the OSC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. In certain situations, counsel provided by DA may be limited to representing the individual only with respect to some of the pending matters, if other specific matters of concern to the OSC or MSPB do not satisfy the requirements contained in this regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Attorney-Client Relationship <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a. An attorney-client relationship will be established and continued between the suspected or accused individual and assigned DA counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. In representing a DA employee or military member, the DA attorney designated as counsel will act as a vigorous advocate of the individual's legal interests before the OSC or MSPB. The attorney's professional responsibility to DA will be satisfied by fulfilling this responsibility to the employee or military member. Legal representation may be terminated only with the approval of the DA General Counsel and normally only on the basis of information not available at the time the attorney was assigned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The attorney-client relationship may be terminated if the assigned DA counsel determines, with the approval of the DA General Counsel, that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The military member or civilian employee was acting outside the scope of his or her official duties when engaging in the conduct that is the basis for the OSC investigation or charge; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Termination is not in violation of the rules of professional conduct applicable to the assigned counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. The DA attorney designated as counsel may request relief from the duties of representation or counseling without being required to furnish explanatory information that might compromise confidential communications between the client and the attorney.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation authorizes cognizant DA officials to approve requests from military members or civilian employees for travel, per diem, witness appearances, or other departmental support necessary to ensure effective legal representation by the designated counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A military member's or civilian employee's participation in OSC investigations, MSPB hearings, and other related proceedings will be considered official departmental business for time and attendance requirements and similar purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Advice to Witnesses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following advice to military members and civilian employees questioned during the course of an OSC investigation may be appropriate in response to these frequent inquiries: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. A witness may decline to provide a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer in favor of a more qualified answer when this is necessary to ensure accuracy in responding to an OSC interviewer's question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Requests for clarification of both questions and answers are appropriate to avoid misinterpretation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Means to ensure verifications of an interview by OSC investigators are appropriate, whether or not the military member or civilian employee is accompanied by counsel. Tape recorders may only be used for this purpose when_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recorder is used in full view. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All attendees are informed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The OSC investigator agrees to record the proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Any errors that appear in a written summary of an interview prepared by the investigator should be corrected before the member or employee signs the statement. The military member or civilian employee is not required to sign any written summary that is not completely accurate. A military member or civilian employee may receive a copy of the summary as a condition of signing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17726 Filed 7&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3710&hyph;08&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is continuing to consider the petition as part of this rulemaking and seeks further comment on abolishing the GELAC. The Commission is also seeking evidence either supporting or refuting the petitioner's claim that the privately-funded GELAC undermines the public financing of general election campaigns by allowing the actuality and the appearance of improper influence in Presidential elections. Absent evidence supporting the petitioner's claim, the Commission would be reluctant to completely eliminate the GELAC because Presidential campaigns would need to devote some of their public funds for compliance expenses, instead of using public moneys for campaign expenses. The result could be significant difficulty in complying with the public financing statutes and the FECA. The GELAC is also used to make repayments, which would need to be funded from other sources. Moreover, the elimination of monetary contributions of $1000 or less for compliance purposes could force some committees to turn to much larger in-kind donation of legal and accounting services to ensure that their compliance obligations are satisfied. See 2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(ix) and (9)(B)(vii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, comments are requested on several alternative revisions to the GELAC. For example, should the amount raised and spent for compliance costs be limited to a fixed percentage of the general election spending limit? If so, what amount or percentage would be sufficient to ensure that adequate amounts are available for meeting compliance obligations? Please note that this approach is not included in the proposed rules which Follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners and one commenter also challenge the appropriateness of allowing fundraising costs for the GELAC to be paid for by the GELAC on the ground these expenses are campaign expenses that should be subject to the spending limits. The current rules permit fundraising costs to be paid by the GELAC because it would not be appropriate to sue public funds to solicit private contributions that are used solely for legal and accounting compliance purposes. However, the Commission is concerned that fundraising activities for the GELAC could be used to generate electoral support for the candidate's campaign, and if so, should be treated as qualified campaign expenses. Accordingly, comments are sought on whether to continue to permit the GELAC to pay the entire amount of these costs, or whether a fixed percentage of GELAC fundraising costs should be paid by the general election campaign committee. Splitting the costs would recognize that solicitations and other activities conducted to raised GELAC funds have a campaign-related component. Comments are sought as to the appropriate percentage that should be paid from general election funds. Please note that this approach is not included in the proposed rules which follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is also considering modifying section 9003.3(a)(1)(i)(A), which currently requires solicitations to clearly state that the contributions are solicited for the GELAC. A new sentence would also require solicitations to state that contributions to the GELAC may not be used for campaign purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note that the provisions regarding predesignations and transfer of primary funds to the GELAC in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii)&hyph;(iv) would be reorganized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (H) of section 9003.3 set forth the permissible sues of GELAC funds. The Petition for Rulemaking urged the Commission to delete current paragraph (H) allowing GELAC funds to be used to pay unreimbursed costs of providing transportation for the Secret Service and national security staff. Although this provisions is included in the attached proposed rules, the Commission seeks further comment on whether it is appropriate to use GELAC funds for this purpose. Please note that GELAC funds may not be used to pay transition costs ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cf. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  AO 1980&hyph;97); legal defense fund expenses ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cf. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  AO 1979&hyph;37); legal expenses not related to ensuring compliance, such as contract litigation or electoral college expenses; and winding down expenses that are not for legal and accounting compliance purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Commission proposes reducing from 70% to 50% the standard amount that the GELAC may pay for computer-related costs, and the corresponding exclusion from the spending limits. See 11 CFR 9003.3 (a)(2)(ii)(A), (b)(6) and (c)(6). The GELAC is relatively small in comparison to the publicly funded general election account. Much of the computer costs are for basic accounting purposes, which the campaign committee would need to perform regardless of the need to comply with the campaign financing laws. Please note, however, that committees would still be able to deduct a higher amount if they can show that their computer-related compliance costs are higher. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9003.3(a)(2)(iv) would be modified slightly to clarify that funds remaining in the GELAC may only be used to pay debts remaining from the primary or for other lawful purposes if all GELAC expenses have been paid. Finally the Commission is proposing to revise two citations contained in 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(2)(iii). The first sentence of this paragraph currently refers to paragraphs 9003.3(a)(2)(i) (A) through (E). This would be updated to read, ``11 CFR 9003.3(a)(2)(i) (A) through (F) and (H).'' Also, the citation to paragraph 9003.3(a)(2)(i)(F) in the second sentence should instead refer paragraph 9003.3(a)(2)(i)(G). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Gains on the Use of Public Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9004.5 of the Commission's regulations allows a committee to invest public funds or use them in other ways to generate income, provided that an amount equal to the net income derived from those investments, minus any taxes paid, is repaid to the Treasury. Section 9007.2(b)(4) also lists the receipt of any income as a result of investment or other use of payments from the fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.5 as one of the basis for requiring repayment. These provisions seek to ensure that any income received through these use of public funds benefits the public financing system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rules would indicate that section 9004.5 applies to any use of public funds that results in come to the committee, regardless of whether the committee engaged in that use with the intention of generating income. The proposed rules also contain a conforming amendment to section 9007.2(b)(4), which would indicate that income on investment or other use of payments from the Fund must be repaid to the Treasury. The Comission notes that if a committee loses an item that is insured, and the insurance proceeds exceeds the cost of replacing the item, such excess would be considered income for the purposes of proposed sections 9004.5 and 9007.2(b)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

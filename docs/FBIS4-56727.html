			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino by Jenia </F> Nenzen at the Telemetro Television studios in Panama City --  live]    [Text] [Nenzen] Thousands of international observers from  all over the world have arrived in our country to closely follow  this historic electoral process. Foreign Minister Jose Raul  Mulino is here to talk a bit about this. We welcome him to our  studios on 50th Street.    [Mulino] Thank you.    [Nenzen] Mr. Foreign Minister, you have had very close  contacts with the international observers who arrived in our  country. What were their expectations of this electoral process  before arriving in Panama?    [Mulino] Yes, Jenia. I have talked with many international  observers from different groups and with different levels of  importance in recent days. When they came to Panama they  thought they would find things that are quite different from  what they actually found. They thought they would find a  difficult electoral process with some degree of violence; and  they had doubts about how things would go; but many of them were  able to witness how the different candidates ended their  campaigns. Likewise, they have talked with many Panamanians  from different political groups; and all of them, without  exception, coincide on various issues.    First of all, there has been a very high voter turnout. This  was something we were able to confirm today at the different  polling places. Second, the honesty with which this process has  been carried out and the way the elections have ended today  without any doubts. People have participated; they have voted;  no one was afraid of being insulted or having their vote  ridiculed. Moreover, the confidence that the different  political groups have given the Electoral Tribunal has been  reasserted by all the candidates and all the political parties.  I believe that, as Panamanians, we should feel quite satisfied.  We should feel quite pleased with the high degree of maturity  we have demonstrated up to this point in an electoral campaign  that everyone foresaw as being much more difficult than it has  been.    Furthermore, it is important to emphasize, and I am pleased  about this as foreign minister of the Republic, that our country  behaved marvelously in the eyes of the world, meaning as a  country that has matured; a country in which citizens have  civically exercised their rights; and, above all, a country that  has decided -- because the polling places have already closed --  to elect its leaders with freedom, without fear. This is quite  different from what we experienced in 1989.    In addition, I think it is important to emphasize and  acknowledge the role of those who deserve it. First of all, the  three Electoral Tribunal magistrates and the organization they  have led. I think the country can sleep peacefully tonight  after its hard work. Second, the pledge acquired and fulfilled  until now and, I am sure, until the end of the process, by the  president of the Republic. I think his figure and name will go  down in history as the president who respected the people's  will; and as the president of the Republic who, after many  decades, lead an electoral process without flaws, without  doubts. I am sure he will turn over power on 1 September, as he  has said on many occasions, to whoever the Panamanian people  elect today.    [Nenzen] Does this mean you believe the honesty of this  electoral process will help counter the international criticism  of our country? Do you think this criticism will be eclipsed by  the honesty of this electoral process, which has been truly  historic? Is this what the international observers will report  to their respective countries?    [Mulino] That is right. In fact, I have asked them to do so,  not only in my role as foreign minister but also as a  Panamanian. The main results of their work should be that  tomorrow they tell the world, without beating around the bush  and with realism, what they have seen and what they have  observed in these elections. I believe this will tremendously  help to favorably and positively depict Panama at the world  level. Obviously, as we conclude our term, we also see with  great pleasure how we leave Panama -- once more in harmony with  other free nations; without diplomatic or political problems  with any country in the world; and, above all, respected,  because we have consistently stated and implemented the  democratic principles of liberty and respect for human rights  that we have professed in our various efforts throughout the  world.    [Nenzen] To conclude, Mr. Foreign Minister, what message do  you send the community in general? There are observers in  Panama; the eyes of the world are on our country. What should  the people's behavior be when the winner is announced?    [Mulino] I think that is the culmination of this entire  process. When the Electoral Tribunal announces who has won the  elections, the six losers must immediately go and congratulate  -- without problems -- the candidate who won. I believe this  will confirm Panamanian democracy and, evidently, when the new  president of the Republic is sworn in for the next five-year  constitutional term on 1 September, he is duty bound to lead the  country democratically. I think this is what the Panamanians,  regardless of the electoral preference they exercised today,  will demand from the next president. He must lead the country  with the same degree of liberty and the same sense of democracy  that President Guillermo Endara has done in this harsh, complex,  and many times misunderstood political transition.    [Nenzen] Yes. The next president of the Republic, the 53d  president, must maintain and improve our country's international  image, aside from meeting most of our people's needs.    [Mulino] That is correct.</p>

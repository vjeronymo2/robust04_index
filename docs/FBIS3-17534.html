"It was a very interesting and intensive discussion. It  focused mostly on our bilateral relations, but also relations  within the Commonwealth of Independent States," Shumeyko said.    "It is time to raise the question of closer integration  within the CIS, perhaps, even the establishment of some  supra-national bodies which could transform the Commonwealth  into something like a union. Not the kind of union we had  before, but a commonwealth preserving the sovereignty and  freedom of all member states," Shumeyko said.    The two leaders also discussed problems of citizenship, non-  payment crisis and other issues. "Our points of view on  bilateral relations coincided almost 100 per cent," Shumeyko  concluded.</p>

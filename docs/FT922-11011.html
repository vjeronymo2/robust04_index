			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / BAe wins Pounds 40m orderfor Rapier BRITISH AEROSPACE has won an order worth more than Pounds 40m to upgrade Rapier surface-to-air missile units which it supplied to Oman 15 years ago, David White writes. The order is a further boost to BAe's guided weapons division after it won a UK Ministry of Defence contract to supply a new air-to-air missile. It involves bringing Oman's two Rapier squadrons up to current RAF standards, including new computer systems, and marks the company's first success in exporting the upgrade package for the low-level air-defence missiles. Oman is one of about a dozen countries fielding Rapier fire units. Other clients in the region are the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.</p>

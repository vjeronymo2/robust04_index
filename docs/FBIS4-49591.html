			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- A publicity drive in  China's economically advanced province of Jiangsu has helped  enhance local people's sense of protecting patent rights.    An official of the provincial patent administration said the  number of people who applied for patent rights has increased at  an average of 20 percent a year over the past decade.    To ensure the healthy development of patent application and  protection, Jiangsu has worked out more than 20 local  regulations and rules on patent rights.    In addition, it has carried out patent implementation in 793  enterprises on a trial basis and set up a specialized research  institute.    The official noted that the administration had received  21,918 patent applications by the end of last year, and approved  11,456.</p>

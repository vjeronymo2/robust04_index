			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Bonds: UK decision excites foreign interest THE UK Treasury's decision to borrow Ecu10bn in foreign currencies, announced last week, represents an unusually bold step to support a currency by tapping the international capital markets. While other countries have indirectly supported their domestic currencies by borrowing abroad, rarely has that intention been so directly expressed. Further, the move runs counter to the current trend among most of the world's leading economic powers. Most G10 countries have reduced their dependency on foreign currency borrowings in recent years. On the other hand, smaller sovereign borrowers, such as Belgium and Finland, and emerging economies like Mexico, have tended to be more active in foreign bond markets, often because their domestic markets are still too small or too restricted to meet their financing needs. However, in the wake of the UK Treasury move last Thursday, investment bankers called a number of sovereign borrowers in an attempt to whip up interest in similar projects. Top of the list of potential copy-cat borrowers is Italy, which had to lift interest rates again on Friday. The Italians have been active borrowers in the international capital markets but have never raised D-Marks. Even though they have been keen to tap the D-Mark sector for some time, the Italian treasury would only issue under Italian law. Until August, Bundesbank rules required all borrowers to issue D-Marks under German law, effectively barring the Italians from the market. The scrapping of that requirement on August 1, as part of a series of rule changes by the Bundesbank, effectively opens the way for the Italians to borrow in D-Marks. Bankers said that some Scandinavian countries might also consider borrowing in D-Marks to support their currencies. However, for Sweden, this would mean a reversal of a decision to avoid foreign bond markets, as part of its debt reduction programme. Finland, which devalued the markka earlier this year, expects to raise half its planned Dollars 12bn funding programme this year in foreign currencies. Finland launched a DM2bn bond issue earlier this year, though not with the explicit aim of bolstering its currency. But, with the exception of Italy (which had gross debt of Dollars 1,167bn at the end of 1991, more than 100 per cent of its GDP), most G7 countries are expected to stay away from foreign bond markets. Countries like Germany, Japan, and the US, with large internationally-traded government bond markets, have little incentive to change this policy. Apart from its politically-motivated Ecu bond programme, France has also stuck to its domestic currency. Canada last tapped the Eurobond market in 1986, leaving room for its provinces to raise funds overseas to meet their own heavy financing needs. The UK Treasury is also unusual in choosing to borrow directly from banks, by arranging a syndicated facility. 'Most sovereign borrowers now only use banks for short-term funding, although there are plenty of private bilateral agreements,' one banker said. Syndicated loans have in recent years proved substantially more expensive for sovereign borrowers than the bond markets. For the Treasury, however, a syndicated facility, through which the UK is raising DM10bn this month, was needed to provide flexibility and speed of execution, as well as to accommodate the size of the transaction. The D-Mark financing underlines the government's commitment to underpinning the pound and the sale of the D-Mark proceeds for sterling will provide tangible support in the foreign exchange market. A bond offering would have had a fixed maturity date, and foreign exchange dealers would have known when the Bank of England needed to buy D-Marks to repay the debt. Borrowings under the three-year facility can be rolled-over and refinanced at various stages throughout the three-year life of the facility.</p>

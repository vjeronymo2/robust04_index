			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arpi Totoyan: "Armenian Army Has Food, Uniforms </F> and Authority"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] It is obvious by now that  [former minister of defense] Vazgen Manukian played an important  role in finally converting the various Armenian armed units into  a regular army during the 9 to 10 months (October 1992 through  July 1993) he was in office. That interval also coincides with a  period of relative peace on Armenia's borders, the recapture of  Maghavuz and Martakert in Artsakh and the success in Kelbajar.  Evidently the work that [Manukian] started has continued in the  same direction: As encouraging news reported by the NOYAN TAPAN  news agency on 17 December suggests, problems associated with  antagonisms that could be caused by the formation of the  Armenian army have been set aside.    A meeting was held at the conclusion of the fall  conscription  campaign to tally up its results. Vazgen Sargsian, a former  minister of defense and currently the minister of state  responsible for defense affairs, says that the conscription has  concluded successfully everywhere except in the two large cities  of the earthquake zone, Gumri [formerly Leninakan] and Vanadzor  [formerly Kirovakan]. So far 511 conscripts are missing in Gumri  and 244 in Vanadzor. The deadline for reporting to duty has been  extended by 7 to 10 days in those cities.    Problems associated with conscription were one of the  principal reasons delaying the formation of the army for a long  time. A not so insignificant proportion of the youth in cities  tried every means to dodge the draft. Their parents also did  everything necessary to make their children's task easier. Both  the youth and their parents had forgotten the conditions of  serving in distant locations in the Soviet Army in the past.  That led to demonstrations and hunger strikes on Yerevan's  squares, with the demand that Armenian soldiers serve their  terms in Armenia. Ironically, when those seemingly unrealizable  dreams came true so suddenly, those subject to the draft sought  ways of dodging it rather than rejoicing. The report cited above  does not offer details of the methods employed in the gratifying  correction of this problem, but the important point is that a  shameful and extremely dangerous situation has ended. That is  affirmed most strongly by the following statement: "Incidents of  administrative action to ensure the normal progress of the  conscription campaign are becoming steadily rarer."    Of course, all this does not mean that the process of  building the army no longer faces any difficulties or that there  are no deficiencies to correct. For example, sometimes it is  difficult to determine the permanent residences of young men who  have migrated from Azerbaijan. It is also said that barracks  buildings are insufficient. V. Sargsyan says that a new census  must be taken in Armenia. The last one, taken in January 1989,  immediately after the [December 1988] earthquake, cannot be  considered reliable because it could not provide a true picture  of the population. The most gratifying element of the said  report is that the meeting underscored the following despite the  complex problems facing the country: "The army is fully stocked  with food and uniforms."    The NOYAN TAPAN report provides other details also.  Armenia's  military academy will begin operating next year and will train  officers. At present Armenian officers are trained in Russia.  Some of the current conscripts serve in the ranks of Russian  border forces on Armenia's borders with Turkey and Iran, as well  as the Russian 127th division, which is based near Gumri.    Despite the many positive signs, V. Sargsian is far from  being fully satisfied. He says: "Although many observers  consider the Armenian Army the most combat-ready in the region,  the Armenian leadership itself is viewing the national army  critically, finding that much more must be done to consolidate  the army's combat readiness and that the weakness of the armed  forces of Azerbaijan and Georgia are temporary."    It can be gathered from the report that there is something  more than the statement that "the army is fully stocked with  food and uniforms." The reality of a successful conscription is  proof that the problem of authority has been resolved. Those two  points are sufficient to confirm that the army of independent  Armenia has successfully overcome the basic hurdles of the  initial period.</p>

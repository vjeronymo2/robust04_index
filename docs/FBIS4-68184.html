[passage omitted]    Shortly after, an unidentified man telephoned ELEVTHEROTIPIA  and said the "Anti-Fascist Action" [Andifasistiki Dhrasi]  organization was claiming responsibility for the arson and  added: "The cinema has become an asylum for the `Golden Dawn'  [Khrisi Avyi] fascists." [passage omitted]    [A related item from Paris AFP in English at 1230 GMT on 13  May adds: "A previously unknown movement calling itself  Anti-Fascist Action said it had set fire to a central Athens  cinema overnight in protest at neo-Nazis, Greek police reported  here on Friday."    "The 100 or so people in the cinema escaped unhurt."    "A phonecaller to a radio station claimed the attack as a  protest against the cinema owner who hired it out several months  ago to the Greek neo-Nazi movement Khrisi Avyi for a meeting."]</p>

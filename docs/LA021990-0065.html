			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LENDL JUST TOO FAST, TOO GOOD FOR MAYOTTE ONCE MORE, 6-3, 6-0  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl was in a hurry and Tim Mayotte couldn't slow him down.  </P> <P> Lendl had a plane to catch so he took only 1 hour 4 minutes to register a 6-3,  6-0 victory over Mayotte Sunday in the final of the SkyDome World tournament at  Toronto.  </P> <P> When it was over, Lendl, who is on the Hartford Whalers' board of directors,  headed for the airport to catch a flight to Buffalo, where the Whalers played  the Sabres in an NHL game Sunday night.  </P> <P> "The match was shorter than I wanted," said Mayotte, who also lost to Lendl  last week in the final of a tournament at Milan, Italy.  </P> <P> The $167,500 winner's share, from the $1.2-million purse, lifted Lendl's career  earnings above $16 million. Mayotte earned $88,000.  </P> <P> Lendl broke Mayotte in the seventh game of the first set and ended the set with  another service break. The top player in the world powered through the second  set with ease.  </P> <P> Martina Navratilova used her intimidating serve and precise shots to overpower  Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-3, 6-2, in 54 minutes and win her 10th Virginia  Slims of Chicago title.  </P> <P> Navratilova, top-seeded and ranked No. 2 in the world behind injured Steffi  Graf, took the $100,000 first prize to boost her leading career winnings to  $15,434,813. Maleeva made $45,000.  </P> <P> It was the 147th career tournament victory for Navratilova, second only to  Chris Evert.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Boris Becker swept past Carl-Uwe Steeb, 7-5, 6-2, 6-2, to win the  Belgian Indoor Championship at Brussels.  </P> <P> Steeb upset Becker last month in Australia.  </P> <P> In the first all-West German final in a major tournament since 1973, Becker won  $77,500, while Steeb earned $43,000.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SOCCER TEAM PRIMED FOR TWO MEETINGS  </P> <P> Still reeling from the last World Cup, the U.S. soccer team will take a small  and somewhat uncertain step toward the next one with games tonight and Sunday  in the Marlboro Cup of New York.  </P> <P> U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said Thursday he is concerned that his players are more  focused on their meeting Sunday with Los Angeles attorney Alan Rothenberg,  elected last weekend as president of the U.S. Soccer Federation.  </P> <P> Gansler has been besieged by questions about Rothenberg's potential impact on  the national team program from his players, many of whom are under contract  through next year at the federation's option.  </P> <P> Gansler, who has coached the team for 20 months, also faces an uncertain  future. He said this summer that he has a commitment to coach the team through  the 1994 World Cup from former USSF president Werner Fricker.  </P> <P> But Rothenberg, after outpolling Fricker in last Sunday's election, said he  will review all USSF personnel, including Gansler.  </P> <P> Chuck Cale, who assisted in Rothenberg's campaign, said the new president has  an open mind. "He's not going back there with any pink slips," Cale said.  </P> <P> In the tournament at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the U.S. will  play Flamengo of Brazil tonight.  </P> <P> All starters from the United States' 0-3 World Cup effort are available except  midfielder Tab Ramos and forward Peter Vermes, who will play for teams in  Europe.  </P> <P> Players from seven World Cup teams, including forward Roger Milla of Cameroon  and goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea of Argentina, will lead a team of World  All-Stars against the Mexican All-Stars Tuesday at 8 p.m. at the Coliseum.  According to organizers, proceeds will benefit the World Children's Transplant  Fund.  </P></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Colorvision declines to Pounds 203,000 Shares in Colorvision fell 7p to 31p yesterday, as the Liverpool-based television and video retailer reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.78m to Pounds 203,000 for the year to end-March. The downturn, which was foreshadowed in April's trading statement, was struck on turnover marginally up from Pounds 66.8m to Pounds 67.1m - of which Pounds 951,000 was contributed by discontinued operations. The directors said that, in line with current retailing practice, the reported turnover figure now contained commissions received, and interest-free credit subsidies were included within the cost of sales. Action had been taken to improve the profitability of the group, the directors added, and nine outlets had been earmarked for closure, of which six had been closed prior to the period end. Staffing levels had been reviewed and appropriate cuts had been made, the costs of which had been provided for in the results. Earnings per share were 0.2p (5.6p) and, as previously stated, the board is not recommending a dividend.</p>

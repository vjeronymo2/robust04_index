			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vision of gas liberalisation Sir, In the current debate ahout the liberalisation of the gas market in the UK, we feel that more heat than light has been generated. This has obscured the vision of the most likely outcome of the whole exercise: lower prices for all gas consumers. Opponents of the government's plans to open up the domestic market have argued that this process will create a 'winners and losers' scenario. Such arguments simply do not stand up to proper examination. For example, we believe that any small regional price variations for domestic customers will be more than out-weighed by the overall reductions that independent suppliers will be able to offer. British Gas currently dominates the market with a share of more than 80 per cent, and will still control the entire transportation system when the market is fully open. To ensure self-sustaining competition, some simple steps need to be taken. First is the relatively straightforward legislation planned by the government. Second is continued downward pressure on the charges levied for use of the national gas grid to reflect the real cost of operating the system efficiently. The liberalisation of the industrial and commercial market has already generated savings of up to 20 per cent. The introduction of competition in the domestic market should, similarly, deliver significant reductions in prices for householders. It will also underpin competition in all sectors of the market and provide the certainty to encourage companies such as ours to continue making the necessary investment in the gas business.

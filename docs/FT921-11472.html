			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei overcomes weak start as futures jump THE NIKKEI average overcame a weak opening on arbitrage-related buying as well as small-lot buying by foreigners and individuals, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed 195.41 ahead at 21,557.67 after a day's low of 21,334.30 and high of 21,779.14. It lost ground at the start because of the overnight fall on Wall Street and lower bond prices, but strength in the futures market prompted arbitrage-related index buying. Volume expanded to 250m shares from 180m, rising above 200m for the first time in five trading days. Traders attributed 50m of this to block cross-trading. Advances led declines by 704 to 266, with 151 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 13.62 to 1,598.35, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.96 to 1,229.97. Traders said the premium over the cash market created by the jump in futures prices had activated arbitrage buying. 'The wider spread between the futures and cash markets is a bullish sign,' said a futures trader at County NatWest. Interest among individual investors was noted. News that more than 100 people had turned up for a stock investment seminar at a branch of a leading Japanese brokerage house encouraged other investors. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'Some individuals are attracted to the current low prices.' Individual investors chose earnings situations. Video game makers gained on projections of increased profits for the current year to March. Sega Enterprises moved ahead Y400 to Y13,300, and Nintendo Y700 to Y11,300 in Osaka. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ended Y3,000 up at Y683,000 on bargain hunting after briefly sinking to an all-time low of Y678,000. Electrical engineering companies firmed on reports that electric power companies plan to expand capital spending next fiscal year. Yondenko added Y20 at Y1,290 and Chudenko Y150 at Y4,500. Reports of rising orders for prefabricated apartments lifted housing issues. Taisei Prefab Construction climbed Y60 to Y2,310 and Daiwa House Industry Y30 to Y1,900. Showa Highpolymer advanced by its daily limit of Y104 to Y1,100. The issue regained popularity as an environmental play, thanks to its biodegradable plastics. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 292.51 to 23,082.21 in volume of 157.6m shares, the highest turnover for this year. Traders said the turnover reflected active cross-trading ahead of the March book closing in banking issues. The Bank of Tokyo, the most active issue of the day, declined Y30 to Y1,360. Roundup THE STEEP fall on Wall Street sent markets in the Pacific Rim region generally lower. HONG KONG took comfort from stronger than expected Bank of East Asia results  -30 per cent profits growth to HKDollars 504m from HKDollars 387m previously - which pushed the stock up 20 cents to HKDollars 25.20. The news helped to reduce early losses and the Hang Seng index ended just 0.34 off at 4,571.47. Utility and property shares were the major movers: New World declined 30 cents to HKDollars 13.10, but HK Telecom rose 10 cents to HKDollars 7.85. Hongkong Land lost 10 cents to HKDollars 10.10. SEOUL rallied after two days of decline in active trading. The composite index gained 4.85 to 664.13 in turnover of Won328bn (Won363bn). KUALA LUMPUR motor issues were hit by a rise in tax on four-wheel drive vehicles: UMV fell 36 cents to MDollars 4.02 and Angkasa 30 cents to MDollars 4.00. The composite index slipped 4.53 to 568.75. SINGAPORE was quiet and the Straits Times Industrial index receded 6.79 to 1,526.04. BANGKOK finished mixed, with heavy trading in property and finance stocks. The SET index shed 3.87 to 764.70. Siam Cement, the second-largest quoted company, eased Bt4 to Bt628. There was news that Thai International Airways may be listed in April. JAKARTA was active with the Jardine Fleming index rising 1.33 to 60.78. The banks sector remained strong. TAIWAN gained slightly before closing for the Chinese new year. The weighted index firmed 1.58 to 5,391.63. The market reopens on February 7. MANILA's composite index weakened 11.01 to 1,231.03, with the downward trend expected to last. AUSTRALIA showed some recovery after a weak opening, the All Ordinaries index ending 9.6 down at 1,612.5, picking up from a 15-point fall. Volume came to 129.5m shares. ANZ, which announced a one-for-five rights issue on Wednesday, fell 8 cents to ADollars 4.20. Westpac was off 8 cents at ADollars 4.02 on a downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. NEW ZEALAND fell for the third consecutive day, the NZSE-40 losing 12.16 to 1,456.39.

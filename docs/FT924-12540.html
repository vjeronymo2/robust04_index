			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Separatists gain heart in row over Canadian reforms GROWING prospects that Canadian voters will reject a package of constitutional reforms in next Monday's national referendum have ignited confidence among Quebec separatists hoping for an eventual breakaway by the province. The separatists have taken courage from opinion polls showing a widening margin of voters throughout the country opposed to the package, known as the Charlottetown agreement. Opposition is especially strong in Quebec and British Columbia. Although the results of the referendum will not be binding, the deal in practice requires the approval of Quebec and at least a clear majority of the nine English-speaking provinces to be implemented. While Quebec nationalists insisted in the early stages of the campaign that a No vote would simply be a rejection of the terms of the Charlottetown deal, they have more recently linked a No vote to support for greater autonomy for the province. Mr Lucien Bouchard, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, said at the weekend that a No victory would mark the end of attempts at national reconciliation and usher in a new era in Canadian politics. Opposition to the agreement has grown in spite of overwhelming backing among the country's political leaders, organised business and trade unions. Supporters still insist they can make up lost ground in the final week of the campaign. But most observers now think the odds favour a No victory in at least Quebec and British Columbia. Critics have found it easy to zero in on the defects of what is a delicate compromise between various regions and population groups. The recession and the widespread unpopularity of Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister, have given the opponents extra ammunition. The reforms, aimed at keeping Quebec within the federal fold, envisage greater autonomy for all the provinces in areas such as immigration and education. They also aim to transform the Senate from an appointed to an elected body, with equal representation for all the provinces. But western provinces have baulked at the enshrinement of Quebec's status as a 'distinct society' within the constitution. According to an opinion poll published yesterday, a clear majority of Canadians want Mr Mulroney to call an election or resign if the Charlottetown deal is rejected. Mr Matthew Barrett, chairman of the Bank of Montreal, said yesterday the most unsettling implication of a No victory was the boost it would give to separatist forces in Quebec. 'At a minimum, a No vote is a vote for constitutional gridlock,' Mr Barrett said. 'A new deal, let alone a better deal, will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 23 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher informed his counterparts of South  Korea, Japan and Russia the response by the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) last night on his way home from  Brussels, the State Department said here today.    The U.S. Administration received formal confirmation from  the  DPRK yesterday that it will freeze the major elements of its  nuclear program while a new round of talks between the U.S. and  the DPRK proceeds.    Christopher had discussions on the new situation in the DPRK  with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa, department spokesman Mike McCurry said at a news  briefing.    They used that discussions to "really begin to build a  framework of consultations for the upcoming third round of  talks," McCurry said.    The spokesman explained that in every step along the way in  dealing with this crisis the United States had used "very  careful and precise diplomacy" to first build international  support for sanction efforts at the United Nations.    "We will use exactly that some type of approach now in  building a common understanding and foundation for the type of  dialogue that we now seek to have with the DPRK," he said.    In answering a question, McCurry said the response from the  DPRK "specifically addressed the types of concerns that we  raised."    "We are quite satisfied that the response was detailed  enough," he added.    McCurry said U.S. Administration officials have had a good  exchange with DPRK officials on dates of a new round of talks  between the two countries. But he refused to disclose them.    President Bill Clinton said yesterday the United States was  ready to hold the third round of talks with the DPRK in Geneva  early next month.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> POROUS PALOS VERDES LOSES TO ALEMANY, 11-7  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Coach Gil Eberhardt had a succinct description for Saturday's 11-7  loss to Alemany in the Palos Verdes-Redondo Tournament at Redondo Union High  School.  </P> <P> "Just a poor outing," he said with a laugh after the Sea Kings (8-5) committed  eight errors and left 12 runners on base. The errors led to four unearned runs.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes starter Jason Goldberg, coming off a complete-game win in his last  outing, was given a 2-0 first-inning lead. But he couldn't make it out of the  second, walking five of the 10 batters he faced in the game.  </P> <P> Jud Sanford relieved Goldberg with two outs and the bases loaded in the second.  Left-fielder Kirk Fellows greeted him with a two-run double. An error let in  two more runs, giving the Indians (7-7) a 4-2 lead.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings tied the game at 4-4 on Goldberg's third-inning double.  </P> <P> Despite getting two walks and three stolen bases, Palos Verdes failed to score  in the fourth inning as Alemany reliever Greg Thompson, who started the game at  shortstop, pitched out of the jam. Thompson, who picked up his first win, went  four innings, giving up six hits and three runs.  </P> <P> After the Indians scored twice in their half of the fifth to take the lead for  good, the Sea Kings loaded the bases with one out in the the bottom half. But  left-fielder Tom Hein grounded into a double play.  </P> <P> "We've been hitting well all year," said Eberhardt, whose team had nine hits.  "We didn't take advantage of our chances today."  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes attack was led by Goldberg (two hits, three RBIs),  center-fielder Doug Kay (two hits, three runs) and first baseman Pat O'Hara  (two hits, two RBIs).  </P> <P> Miraleste 7, West Torrance 0 -- Pitchers Chris Hubbard and Jason Mavar combined  on a three-hitter, and Mike Ryan and Greg Keese each hit two-run homers to lead  the Marauders in the consolation quarterfinals of the Palos Verdes/Redondo  Tournament at Miraleste.  </P> <P> Hubbard, a left-hander, had not allowed a hit when he was pulled after the  second inning because he had reached the 10-inning pitching limit for the week.  Mavar, a right-hander, gave up three hits and struck out 11 in the last five  innings to improve to 5-1.  </P> <P> Miraleste (10-2) was ahead 3-0 when it scored four runs in the fifth on home  runs by Ryan and Keese. Ryan also doubled in the game. Mavar was two for four  with an RBI. The Marauders resume play Monday with a non-league game at South  Torrance.  </P> <P> West fell to 5-7.  </P></p>

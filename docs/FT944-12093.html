			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Judge tells jury to clear manager A manager of a City investment company who was accused of making multiple share applications was cleared yesterday on the orders of a judge. Mr Stuart Fisher allegedly promised 'beer and curry' to colleagues so he could use their names to cash in illegally on the privatisation of the power industry in 1991. But the case was thrown out of Southwark Crown Court after Mr Ken McDonald, acting for the defence, told Judge Eugene Cotran that the Crown had failed to make its case. He said there was no evidence to back prosecution allegations that Mr Fisher, a contracts manager for Gartmore Investment Management, had illegally pocketed profits from the flotations of the generating companies. During legal argument at the close of the prosecution case, Mr McDonald said all those whom Mr Fisher had assisted to make share applications had said they had received all the money due to them. The judge directed the jury to return not guilty verdicts on each of the four counts of obtaining property by deception and three of attempting to obtain property by deception which Mr Fisher had denied.</p>

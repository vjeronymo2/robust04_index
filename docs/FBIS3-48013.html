Mr Uthai earlier met Malaysia's International Trade and  Industry Minister, Dato' Seri Rafidah Aziz.    He said Dato' Rafidah wanted him to make clear the Thai  Government's view on the EAEC. He told her he supported the  move because it was a good concept. However, it was merely an  initiative with no action taken yet.    At the weekend, officials who asked not to be identified  said  that Thailand was still not enthusiastic about the EAEC.    Mr Uthai said he stressed with Dato' Rafidah that the most  important aspect was to strengthen the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) to increase the group's bargaining power  in international forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) group.    Under current understandings, the EAEC would comprise East  Asian members of APEC and not the United States, Canada, Mexico  or Chile. In November, senior ASEAN secretariat officials said  their initial exploratory talks with potential members received  a warm response.    Mr Uthai said Dato' Rafidah asked him whether Thailand would  participate in the first meeting of APEC in Hawaii on March 18  and 19 because she believed the United States would force  smaller countries to open up their financial markets further.    Mr Uthai said he told Dato' Rafidah that he could not speak  on behalf of the Thai finance minister but he thought that  Thailand would have a clearer position after Tharin Nimmanhemin  met the US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.    Dato' Rafidah said the ASEAN secretary-general had visited  countries which would be founders of the EAEC, such as Japan,  South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Results would soon be  reported to ASEAN economic ministers.    She said the private sector would benefit from the loose  consultative forum.    The arrangement would benefit the private sector in finance,  industry and even by linking the stock markets.    Dato' Rafidah said the private sector should realise the  marketing possibilities as the EAEC would include Japan, South  Korea, Taiwan, China, Indochina and all of ASEAN.</p>

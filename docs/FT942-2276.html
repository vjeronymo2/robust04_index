			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Zurich - Other Markets Hints of imminent transformation at Elektrowatt and Motor-Columbus, Switzerland's two big quoted electric power generators, have been building in recent months, and more may emerge tomorrow when Elektrowatt reports its interim results, writes Ian Rodger. The big questions are whether the two will merge and, if so, who will take over whom. Oddly, both are controlled by one of Switzerland's big banks, Elektrowatt by CS Holding, Motor by Union Bank of Switzerland, so Zurich gnomic pride could play a big role. UBS has made clear that it does not regard its Motor holding as strategic, and Motor's chief executive Ernst Thomke publicly nudged the bank two weeks ago to put an end to the uncertainty. In March, Oskar Ronner, the new Elektrowatt chief executive, said the group's main future growth would come from its industrial division. As for the likely trend of the interim results to March 30, the electricity division probably enjoyed buoyant export sales, thanks to unusually heavy precipitation in Switzerland last winter. The market will be awaiting publication this week of consumer price indices for Basle and Geneva.</p>

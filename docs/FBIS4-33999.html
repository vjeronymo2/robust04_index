			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at the opening </F> ceremony of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartegena de  Indias -- live]    [Text] Ibero-American chiefs of state and heads of  governments, foreign relations ministers, representatives of  international organizations, delegation members, authorities,  and ladies and gentlemen: I want to open this speech by thanking  so many friendly nations for the solidarity demonstrated in  light of the painful moments we Colombians are experiencing as a  result of last week's natural disaster that adversely affected  thousands of my compatriots -- the Paez Indians in the Cauca and  Huila departments. In memory of those who perished, I ask you  for one minute of silence. [minute of silence observed]    Cartagena de Indias awoke today in a festive mood. There is  excitement in the Bay of Souls [bahia de las animas] and rumors  of fandango in Chambacu. The word is being spread from balcony  to balcony.    The local residents, as is true of all Colombians, are happy  to have you here, chiefs of state and heads of governments. We  hope that your stay among us is pleasant, advantageous, and that  the protection of our Lady of the Candelaria of Popa will  descend warmly on all of you. Lets us attempt to hear the  faithful, who under the mudejar [multicolored decorations of  Islamic influence] of San Toribio Church, mouth their prayers  with a faint Andalusian accent, while outside the first notes of  a ballenato [Colombian folk music] drowned the cry of a black  female street vendor. These are the sounds of this marvelous  cultural unity that is manifested in a new voice -- that of  Ibero-America.    Cartagena de Indias, the same as Guadalajara, Madrid, or  Salvador de Bahia, reflects the rich blend of cultures and races  that today brings us together for the fourth time. Here we must  stop, look at where we came from, and see where we are headed,  and we must share our experiences to continue constructing a  better future for our people.    We are living in times of change. The mere disappearance of  global bipolarism has not given us the feeling that peace,  progress, and justice is nearer or is now more feasible. With  the conclusion of the confrontation between the two blocs that  antagonized one another for so long, we unfortunately are  witnesses to old and unfriendly nationalisms. These are  fanaticisms that threaten peace and stability as much as the  presence of extreme poverty and social injustice in many nations  of the world. While we are assembled here, thousands of human  beings continue dying, victims of racism, xenophobia, fraticidal  wars, resentments shaped over the centuries, territorial  disputes, or the simple and terrorizing incapacity of mankind to  offer what is promised to all -- namely, liberty, justice, and  equality.    Nevertheless, I also believe we are living in times in which  there is a place for the [word indistinct] hope. In recent  years, we have initiated the making of a new world order, marked  by signs of interdependence. In recent years, my dear friends,  we have been able to make possible the hope of replacing a phase  marked by domination [word indistinct] by cooperation.    I dream about the Americas being integrated from North to  South, a place where a free trade zone from Alaska to Patagonia  will be more than a great expression. Likewise, I dream about  the Americas, as Europe, being united not only economically, but  also scientifically, technologically, and political, and  enjoying a rich and diverse culture. I also dream about the  Asia-Pacific region being consolidated and expanding. I dream  about a Middle East that is conscious of the need for peaceful  coexistence and conscious of the benefits of converting to a  common market. And, of course, I dream about Africa remarking  its boundaries, overcoming old disputes among brothers, and  progressing with the solidarity cooperation of the international  community.    We are gathered here today to create this future dream much  closer to all of us so that to travel through Ibero-America no  other document is needed than the language we inherited from our  parents, Spanish and Portuguese. We need to make it possible  for anyone to work in a profession or a trade in any part of  Ibero-America; it would suffice to show a diploma issued in any  one of our nations; to encourage investments to flow from one  side of the Atlantic to the other... [Gaviria clears his throat]  excuse me, from one side of the Atlantic to the other, taking  advantage of the open markets and distributing the benefits that  emerge from the innovation of technological development and  strategic alliances; to make Ibero-America an economic and  cultural bloc open to the rest of the world; to have  Ibero-America interact and enrich its relations with other  communities; and, in order to lead, to assume the challenges and  take advantage of the opportunities that the third millennium  offers.    Let no prejudice or obstacle hinder our authentic  brotherhood.    This dream may have many interpretations, but it is  essentially one dream -- an Ibero-America that does not need  bridges across borders, because there are no borders in the  souls and the minds of the people.    We are here because there is a vision we can dream about  here  today, in Cartagena de Indias, the site where another dream took  root 500 years ago -- the meeting of cultures. If we look  beyond the abyss of time and peer into the future, all of this  appears as something that is finally possible. It depends on us  to turn a horizon full of options into a future of wellbeing for  our people.    Dear friends: During the days that have preceded this  summit, I have been constantly asked about its importance. I  have given a simple answer: I believe that in any relationship  there is nothing like a handshake and a frank dialogue.    Three Ibero-American summits have taken place. Much progress  has been made in reaching political agreements, and many useful  exchanges of experience have taken place. The ambitious index  of the Ibero-American summits now includes science and  technology, education and training, sustainable development,  human rights, support for the Indian population, social  policies, and, on this occasion, economic matters such as  investment, development, commerce, integration, and the  consolidation of reforms that many of our countries have  promoted in recent years.    Regarding issues that form part of this meeting's agenda, it  is necessary to acknowledge that the economic situation of the  majority of the Ibero-American countries during the past 10  years has not been free of trauma. The debt crisis, with all of  its repercussions, made evident the vulnerability of our  economies and the worn-out condition of the economic development  system then in vogue.    We believed that by substituting imports we would strengthen  our autonomy, but we crashed against insufficient domestic  markets and found an omnipresent state, lack of competition, and  excessive protectionism.    This is why in many of our countries we had to make, in  varying degrees, significant structural changes to our economies.    Increased fiscal discipline; inflation controls; free  markets; the rationalization of the state's size; the creation  of opportunities in the private sector; the adoption of  competitive frameworks for attracting new foreign investments;  the introduction of labor, currency exchange, financial, and tax  reforms; and other things have encouraged trends toward  renovation.    I think we have seen a profound change of attitude that  allows us to increasingly incorporate ourselves with the rest of  the world and at the same time leave behind the miserableness  whose only promise was the perpetuation of our backwardness.    At the same time, we are practicing commercial policies that  now are no longer designed to separate us, as they were before,  but are designed to unite us.    For many of us, free trade and integration, of course, are  probably the best antidote against the poverty that still exists  in our nations.    How are we going to consolidate the reforms through which  many of our countries overcame the lost decade? What should  accompany the economic adjustments and the opportunities that  free trade and integration open in order to secure the social  benefits that we are searching for and that our people have  wanted for so long? What can we do to make the reforms last  and, especially, generate egalitarianism?    We must acknowledge the fact that adjustment policies alone  have not produced growth in all countries and that these  adjustment policies have not guaranteed a better distribution of  income. Economic reforms could in some cases have weakened the  state, and in some countries, it is an obsolete solution for  today's problems.    Finally, everyday it becomes more evident that the  commercial  liberalization effort we have made must aim at harmonizing the  agreements that have been reached.    These are some of the challenges we have ahead of us. This  is why this fourth summit's agenda responds to the urgent need  for jointly exchanging opinions on how to face these challenges.  Fortunately, the current international framework is more  suitable for meeting these challenges.    Never before in the history of mankind have so many human  beings enjoyed democracy and liberty. Never before has there  been such an ambitious multilateral trade system as that which  emerged a few weeks ago following the culmination of the GATT  Uruguay Round. The principal economies of the industrialized  world are gradually recovering. There is a growing wave and a  massive awakening of consciences in the quest for sustainable  development. We have based our hopes on our own economic  performance during the next few years. Here I refer not only to  the fact that our countries will be perceived as attractive new  markets but to the structural conditions of many of our  economies, which have transformed us, without considering what  Spain and Portugal would add, into what will be the region with  the most dynamic growth in the coming years, second only to the  Asian Pacific region.    Messrs. chiefs of state and government; following those  statements, perhaps I should very briefly mention something that  is an internal part of each country and which I truly believe  will be a vital topic on the Ibero-American summit agenda in the  next couple of years. I speak of the strengthening of  democracy. Without flexible instruments for popular  participation in principal group decisionmaking, without strong  judicial organizations approved by the citizens, without  security for citizens and their properties, without efficient  mechanisms to promote and protect human rights, without pure  electoral systems, without both governors and governed being  held responsible for their actions and omissions, without  efficient public organizations, and, above all, without an exact  redefinition of the roles of the public and private sector in  search of public equality, without all this, there cannot be  true democracies among us.    Last, what brings us together here is the necessity to  consolidate economic reforms in such a way that they will  guarantee a better distribution of income, stimulate savings,  and increase investment, thus spurring economic growth. What  has brought us this far is our desire to make inroads into  political reforms that will strengthen the state, enable greater  democratic participation, and defend human rights. What has  brought us here is an imperative need to make trade serve as a  bridge for the welfare of our peoples. Of course we hope that  free trade and expanded markets will also benefit the smaller  countries.    Your Majesties, Esteemed Presidents, Messrs. Chiefs of  Government, friends, everyone; we are Ibero-American. We  represent the voice of Ibero-America and here we are. It is my  heartfelt wish that the tradition initiated in Mexico and  enriched in Spain and Brazil will continue during these two  days, providing us a new opportunity to dream as a group.  Within these streets of Cartagena, a place where everything is  possible, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, our Nobel prize winner,  always says, in these walls which served one day to defend the  city from pirates and corsairs, within the castle walls, where  the dreams of our forefathers came true, we have the opportunity  today to again take up the reins of our countries' destinies, to  forge a more dignified, prosperous, and peaceful life for our  peoples. I declare this Ibero-American summit of chiefs of  states and governments inaugurated. Thank you. [applause]</p>

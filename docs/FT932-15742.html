			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: Pension obligations of contractors after privatisation Sir, David Goodhart ('Pensions blow to government contracting out plans,' April 5) is right to stress the significance of the obligation on contractors to offer comparable pensions when staff are transferred from the public to the private sector. The impact on contractors' costs are obvious. A few years ago a Treasury document, Using Private Enterprise in Government, admitted: 'Most of the savings from contracting out arise because contractors offer poorer conditions of employment. . . The difference in total labour cost may typically be of the order of 25 per cent. Pensions are the main element in it.' Two recent industrial tribunals signalled a change in the legal interpretation of Transfer of Undertakings (Tupe) regulations in relation to pensions. Even in May 1992 the Treasury warned departments that, regardless of Tupe: 'Under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, the terms and conditions of employment under the new employer must be broadly comparable to those in the old. . .  This means that the pension scheme must offer broadly comparable payments.' However, the real lesson to be drawn is that ministers have allowed ideology, not the law, to frame the approach taken with departments and contractors, despite having had adequate legal advice from government lawyers. I hope the pathetic saga of ministers attempting to reinterpret the law in relation to contracting-out will now end.

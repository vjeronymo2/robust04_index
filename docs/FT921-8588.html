			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Redland offer timetable extended The Takeover Panel has further extended the timetable regarding Redland's offer for the ordinary and preference share capitals of Steetley. With no news forthcoming from the secretary for trade and industry as to whether the bid would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the Panel's view was that the timetable should be further extended. It will review the matter of the timetable again if there is no announcement by the trade and industry secretary by March 12.</p>

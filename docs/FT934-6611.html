			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Management: Clipped wings of ambition - The demise of the Alcazar airline deal provides a cautionary tale for those following the cross-border merger trail Alcazar, the cynics always said, was far too ambitious to succeed. On Sunday the cynics were proved right. After a year of painstaking negotiations, entailing costs in management time and lawyers' fees which can only be guessed at, the attempt by four European airlines to forge what would have been the continent's most ambitious cross-border enterprise collapsed when they failed to agree on which US carrier should become Alcazar's American partner. With hindsight, it is easy to judge that the idea of melding Austrian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish and Swiss interests into one unified airline was as hopeless as the name given to the project was grandiose. After all, Alcazar, a four-towered Moorish fortress built to keep predators at bay, had no obvious association with the cultures of the protagonists. But even if the final breakdown was not a great surprise, the four airlines did come tantalisingly close to pulling off a deal, establishing along the way a fund of knowledge and experience that could well be useful to others who follow the cross-border merger trail. Perhaps the most striking feature of the Alcazar project was the constant acknowledgement by the four airlines - Austrian Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Swissair - that what they were attempting was, indeed, extremely complicated. The four proclaimed their vision of an alliance strong enough to compete with British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France, the three European giants. But from the moment the negotiations, begun in the autumn of 1992, were made public this February, they tempered their ambitions with sober warnings of the hurdles to be overcome. These ranged from the intangible issue of how to marry four corporate cultures, through the associated problem of how to square the need for a single multinational management structure and flight network with the rigidly bilateral nature of airline route agreements. The airlines also feared that opponents, both inside and outside their ranks, could appeal effectively to the strong emotional attachment people in every country feel towards their national airline. When the four chief executives launched informal talks in late 1992, the initial objective was not just to set down what the advantages of an alliance would be, but also to identify the areas that could be 'deal breakers'. It was immediately clear, for example, that logic dictated there should be one headquarters, located in one of the six home countries. Could the five that 'lost' the HQ be reconciled to the decision? Other thorny questions were the relative stakes of the companies in Alcazar and the question of the US partner. By January, the chief executives had reached a sufficient 'level of comfort' to feel that they could proceed with more detailed negotiations. It was informally agreed, for example, that the three big airlines would have equal 30 per cent shares in the new group, regardless of significant differences in their actual asset values. They felt this was the only way to avoid constant niggling over the share-out of management posts. According to Swissair, it was also understood that Delta Air Lines would be the US partner. At the time, Northwest, KLM's partner, looked to be at death's door. No less than 17 committees, or work teams, were then set up with representatives of each airline meeting once a week, usually at weekends. Each airline had its own steering committee to co-ordinate internally their conduct of the talks. The work teams also reported to an Alcazar steering committee which in turn reported to the chief executives. The work was done in English. Most of the 17 work teams were concerned with technical airline matters  - passenger systems, cargo systems, fleet maintenance and the like. But three key committees thrashed out corporate structure, 'air political' issues and balancing the value of the participants' shares in Alcazar. The results of these studies were extremely encouraging. The route networks fit together well, the marketing philosophies were similar and the prospects for cost savings were impressive. Sufficient progress was made so that in April the managements of the four airlines went to their shareholders for approval to proceed to signing a loose Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which would be followed by a formal negotiation of a final Alcazar deal. All but the three core committees and a work team on communications were disbanded. But now the problems everyone had been so careful to warn of began to arise in earnest. Opponents of the deal, sensing that it was nearing the decision point, suddenly emerged, rousing public anxiety and forcing governments in Switzerland and Austria in particular to demand reviews. This meant the signing of the MOU had to be postponed until after the summer holidays. In the meantime, however, the lawyers kept working. Initially, the intention was that the MOU would be fairly vague, merely binding the partners to the Alcazar path. It would not necessarily resolve all the 'deal breaker' issues. However, by September, when the companies finally had their shareholder approvals, the lawyers presented them with a very detailed MOU. The chief executives then realised that they now had to move more quickly to resolve the deal breakers. For one thing, it had become clear that the original intention to form a joint management company under which the four airlines preserved their separate corporate and tax structures, at least in the early years, was no longer adequate. While this step-by-step plan would have diffused domestic objections to the project and avoided problems with national and international transport laws governing landing rights and other airline issues, it would have run foul of the European Union and US anti-cartel regulations. Alcazar had to show it was to be a genuine integration of the four airlines. Moreover, by early September, it was clear that Northwest Airlines was recovering smartly from the edge of bankruptcy in June and KLM's attitude to the US partner issue had changed. By late October, the four had overcome most of the toughest questions. Austrian, SAS and Swissair had accepted that the headquarters would be in Amsterdam and they had agreed a complex formula to compensate Swissair in recognition of its net asset value being greater than its 30 per cent share in Alcazar. But they could still not resolve the US partner issue. If, indeed, that was the sole issue that broke the Alcazar project, there is a certain irony in it, because it is not an issue arising from the cross-border complexity of the undertaking, rather one of basic competitive strategy. However, even if this issue had been resolved, it is a fair bet that the project would have hit other tough stumbling blocks. It will never be known, for example, if governments and other shareholders might have baulked at the last minute. The spectacle of the shareholder revolt against Volvo's proposed merger with France's state-owned Renault provided a tempting model for the six groups of shareholders of the Alcazar companies. There were also signs of substantial lingering disagreement over the scale and speed of rationalisation, issues that would have been very difficult for a fledgling management group to resolve peacefully.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Drink: Is it schnapps or vodka? - Giles MacDonogh enjoys an unusual pick-me-up WEDHOLMS FISK in Stockholm is one of only eight Michelin- starred restaurants in Sweden. We were served a plate of Swedish hors d'oeuvres rather in the manner of Russian zakuski. There was very lightly smoked salmon and delicately marinated gravlax, which came with a rather sweet, mustard sauce. Matjes and Bismarck herrings, salmon and bleak roe came from fish caught above the Arctic Circle. To drink with this we received a glass of Pripps lager and a tot of lemon-flavoured brannvin or schnapps. I call it schnapps but the makers, the Swedish government monopoly Vin &amp; Sprit, would rather it were called vodka. It is more a question of marketing than semantics. Schnapps distilling is a Baltic tradition: the Swedish word brannvin like the Dutch brandewijn means burnt wine; where the Russian word vodka with its watery connotations is closer to the Swedish word for spiced schnapps aquavit. Aquavit just means eau de vie or if you prefer, whisky. I suspect that the Swedes feel that we might have trouble pronouncing brannvin and perhaps they are right to call it vodka. Certainly the tradition of making a highly rectified vodka in Sweden goes back for more than 100 years. In 1879 LO Smith (he had assumed the name of his guardian, who may or may not have been of British origin) began distilling an absolut renadt brannvin (absolutely pure schnapps) at Reimersholm near Stockholm. The spirit was distilled ten times until all impurities (and presumably all flavour) had been removed. The Stockholmers loved the new drink, and when the city fathers tried to prevent it being sold they took to their boats, filling up their containers at Smith's Island distillery until the authorities were forced to concede defeat. When in 1979 the Swedish monopoly decided to launch a quality spirit on the export markets, they remembered LO Smith and his 'Absolut' and Absolut Vodka was born. Absolut is a highly rectified spirit, but not, I hasten to add, quite so drastically cleaned up as Smith's original brew; rather more of the grain flavour survives than in other commercial vodkas, but far less, say, than you would find in a north German Kornschnaps. Absolut now comes in three forms: straight vodka, 'citron' and pepper. The flavouring of schnapps is another tradition which extends throughout northern Europe and the Baltic, and in spite of the fact that quality grain spirit is now distilled in only one place in the whole of Sweden, this flavoured schnapps or aquavit continues to be produced. Sweden's principal licit distillery is in Ahus in the south of the country. It was there that I tried a range of these drinks: Herrgards a licorice-tasting spirit aged in sherry casks; OP Anderson, a Swedish kummel; Hallands Flader flavoured with elderflowers; porsbrannvin flavoured with bog-myrtle, which gives it a suitably earthy, indeed swampy taste; Ostgota Sades Brannvin which is essentially a Swedish grain whisky; Arsta, a Stockholm speciality flavoured with bitter oranges; and Ahus Bitters which tastes like the entire contents of the spice box macerated in alcohol. In the 19th century there were as many as 200,000 distilleries in Sweden making brannvin. Consumption was massive and drunkenness became such a problem that a referendum was taken on whether to ban alcohol sales altogether. The drinkers narrowly won the day, but the result of the poll was the creation of the Swedish monopoly in 1917. In the intervening 75 years the number of distilleries has been-whittled down to just Ahus, a situation which no one feels will change once Sweden joins the EC and the monopoly is finally wound up. Brannvin schnapps or vodka (whatever you want to call it) goes very well with basic Swedish food: the circles of crisp bread which were formerly hung up to dry before the long winter; smoked, pickled, salted, cured or marinated foods; oily herrings eels and salmon; roes of every description, including the abominably salty turbot roe we ate in an otherwise fine restaurant in the south of the country. Vodka is said to protect you from tainted foods: hence the Russian habit of drinking it with what was often putrid caviar. Finally, brannvin was the traditional compliment to the smorgasbord. The word means 'buttered bread' such as the German Butterbrot. In the last century the smorgasbord was a male preserve; set out on a side table for the men to eat while the ladies removed their travelling clothes prior to dinner. In the centre of the table an enormous canteen was filled with brannvin and two or three different sorts of aquavit arranged in separate compartments; another section was filled with ice. Presumably it worked wonders after an icy sleigh ride.</p>

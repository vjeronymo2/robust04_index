This conclusion was drawn by the participants of the  parliamentary hearings on the Partnership for Peace program held  in the State Duma on Wednesday, Chairman of the Defense  Committee of the parliament's lower chamber Sergey Yushenkov  (Russia's Choice bloc) reported in his interview with Interfax.    In his words, at the hearings it was recommended to join the  program and to consider NATO's program "as the beginning of the  path towards the creation of a common security system." The  State Duma was recommended to hear information by Russian  Foreign Minister's spokesmen, Defense Minister, and secretary of  the Russian Federation Security Council at one of the nearest  "governmental hours."    During the discussions in the State Duma on Thursday, Major  General Pavel Zolotaryov, representative of the Russian Defense  Ministry, expressed his support to the idea to join NATO's  Partnership for Peace program.    Zolotaryov underlined that the Defense Ministry understands  that this program "is one of the concrete trends in NATO's  strategy" aimed at detention by means of cooperation rather than  using deterrents.    According to his estimate, if Russia refuses to join this  program it will occupy "a self-isolating position of an alien  supervisor over processes going on in Europe" and it "will be  less listened to."    Zolotaryov pointed out that Russia should demonstrate its  political will and resoluteness to actively participate in the  new system of collective security and creation of an efficient  military mechanism to deter wars and conflicts. It is also  necessary to push for the development of common approaches by  Russia and NATO to the problems of military security and  strategic stability; and for the recognition by NATO of Russia's  special role in supporting stability on the CIS territory.</p>

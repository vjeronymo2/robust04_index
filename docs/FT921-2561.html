			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Pledge on anti-pollution laws MR Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, yesterday promised the Commission would consult industry and consumers on its anti-pollution plans at an earlier stage. Presenting the EC's fifth environmental programme, setting general policy goals up to the year 2000, Mr Ripa di Meana conceded the Commission had been criticised in the past for 'handing down bans from on high'. He proposed a 'general consultative forum' in which the Commission would systematically seek the views of all interest groups before finalising its proposals. The commissioner said he detected signs of a 'more responsible' attitude by industry to the environment. He contrasted the 'long rearguard action' that EC car makers fought a few years ago against tougher emission controls with the 'very encouraging' willingness by EC industrial producers and users of CFCs to phase these substances out, largely on a voluntary basis. In the new consultative forum, industry 'will have to speak out clearly' on its environmental views, Mr Ripa di Meana said. More open consultation 'will avoid the half-confidentiality on which so many misunderstandings have been based in the past', he added.</p>

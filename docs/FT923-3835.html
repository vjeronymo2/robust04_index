			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / People: More non-execs Martin Corke and Bernard Tickner have retired from GREENE KING. ***** David Atterton, former chairman of Foseco, and John Parker, chairman of Harland and Wolff, at BRITISH COAL CORPORATION. ***** Graham Webster at BETT BROTHERS. ***** Chris Oberst, president of the International Meat Secretariat, at WESTLAKE SHEFFIELD. ***** George Hardie, joint group md of Johnson Firth Brown, and Roger Kingdon, a director of Teeside Urban Developments, at The HOPKINSONS GROUP. ***** Susan Ellen (below), md of BUPA Health Services, at Asda. ***** Stephen Robinson, a management accountant who has spent the past 13 years with the Burton Group, is moving to Edinburgh to take charge of the retail division of John Menzies with effect from the beginning of next year. 'This is a career move,' says Robinson of his departure from the UK's second largest clothing retailer that has been beset by management changes and eroding profit margins. Ranald Noel-Paton, John Menzies' group managing director, says that Robinson 'seemed to us to have the strengths, in depth, in the areas necessary for the retailer of the 1990s. The complexities of the market mean you have to be very numerate these days. He is also a tremendous team leader.' Robinson, 45, will replace Bob Black, who has been managing director of John Menzies Retail since 1983. In that time Black has refocused the chain from a preponderance of corner stores to concentrate on high street outlets; he has presided over the acquisition of a chain of stores from the Martin Retail Group; and recently set in train an important systems overhaul. Black, who is taking early retirement at the age of 58, was appointed to the main board in 1984. His successor, however, does not immediately join the board. Joining Burton in 1979 as finance director of the retail division, Robinson became a director of Debenhams before moving on to Principles for Men, then Top Shop and Top Man, in both cases as managing director. He had taken up the same position at Champion Sport just last December. Meanwhile, moving north of the border should be easy enough for Leeds-born Robinson, who is married to a Scot and worked for Vickers in Edinburgh, where both his children were born, before he transferred to Burton.</p>

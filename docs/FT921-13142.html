			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Stuck at the airport again THE TENS of thousands of airline passengers who will this summer spend hours munching peanuts on aircraft stranded on the tarmac should reflect upon what their disrupted journeys reveal about the state of European political and economic integration. In all likelihood their delays will be caused by the woeful deficiencies of Europe's patchwork air traffic control system. For years, politicians ignored warnings that a crisis was developing. Now it has arrived. Mr Giovanni Bisignani, managing director of Alitalia and chairman of the Association of European Airlines, says that as air traffic picks up from the downturn induced by the Gulf war, the system may well buckle. Demand for air transport in Europe could easily double by the end of the decade. Without significant improvements to European air traffic control systems, this growth will be funnelled into an extremely tight bottleneck. Flight delays have increased by 50 per cent in the past four years, so that at peak periods a quarter of flights are delayed by at least 20 minutes. The costs of these delays could amount to almost Dollars 10bn a year, according to a study which SRI, the Californian consultancy did in 1990 for the International Air Transport Association. The direct costs to airlines of having expensive capital lying idle are eventually passed onto passengers in higher fares. System's shortcomings Behind these failures stand western Europe's 51 air traffic control centres, with their 31 different operating systems, running 22 types of software on computer hardware made by 18 different manufacturers. The European route structure, which is cut across by military demands for airspace, was drawn up 30 years ago, based on national boundaries which are becoming obsolete. Crossing Europe using these traditional routes is like travelling across London or Paris using only backstreets. European air transport ministers have begun to tackle the system's shortcomings. From next year a body called Eurocontrol, operating from Brussels, will co-ordinate all civil air travel across Europe, to ease the flow of traffic and increase utilisation of the existing system. It aims to harmonise and integrate the computer systems used by national authorities by 1995, as well as overseeing investments in additional capacity in southern Europe, which becomes heavily congested in the summer. Drastic reduction The question is whether this combination of a federal co-ordinating body, with national authorities, will provide the integrated system which post Maastricht Europe needs. Eurocontrol has no power over national public procurement practices, which are a root cause of system incompatibility. Nor is it clear that Eurocontrol can achieve the necessary drastic reduction in the number of control centres. Most significantly, summer congestion will only be reduced if tourists from the rich northern states help to pay, through taxes, for the poorer southern states to buy better radar systems. Flights leave northern airports at a rate which southern airports cannot handle. The most sophisticated radar systems in Europe can handle aircraft travelling just three miles apart. But in the worst areas of the Mediterranean the gap has to be more than 30 miles. Europe is operating at just half the capacity of the most heavily used north eastern corridor in the US. American superiority is partly due to better technology, partly to the simplicity of a unified system run by the Federal Aviation Authority. When a plane wants to fly from New York to Los Angeles, it can proceed once its flight plan is cleared. That is what should happen in Europe. Instead just getting from London to Milan is like flying through an electronic maze. Europe needs a unified system, building up from a core based upon the northern bloc, where operating systems are most compatible. That means politicians will have to discard procurement nationalism and airspace sovereignty in favour of the unified system European consumers deserve.</p>

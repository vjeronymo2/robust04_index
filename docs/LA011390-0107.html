			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELLS FARGO DECIDES TO CLOSE FOR KING HOLIDAY  </P> <P> After numerous calls from customers, Wells Fargo Bank reversed itself Friday  and decided to keep its 462 branch offices closed for Martin Luther King Day on  Monday.  </P> <P> Lisa Hoogerwerf, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said the bank's public relations  office received about 30 calls from customers Friday morning about its plan to  be open for business for the first time on the slain civil rights leader's  birthday, a national holiday.  </P> <P> She said there were additional calls to branch offices and customer service.  </P> <P> "That's (the number of calls) a lot to us," Hoogerwerf said. Callers "were  concerned that we weren't observing Martin Luther King Day, and we know that  for every person that calls there are probably some more out there who feel the  same."  </P> <P> Wells Fargo, like rival Security Pacific National Bank, had originally planned  to be open Monday, citing the need to be more like a retailer, providing longer  hours for customers. Security Pacific's plans were unclear Friday night as  spokespeople could not be contacted.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo still plans to be open on Presidents Day, Columbus Day and Veterans  Day, but spokeswoman Kim Kellogg said the bank will review decisions on those  holidays "on a case-by-case basis."  </P> <P> Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Los Angeles Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, called the two banks' decisions to remain open a type of  "retrenchment".  </P> <P> And Patrick Patterson, Western regional council for the NAACP Legal Defense and  Educational Fund, said it is important for businesses to observe King's  birthday. "In this climate that we have today, where there is a resurgence of  racial violence, bombings and murder that appears to be linked to racism, it  becomes more important for people to recognize this holiday," Patterson said.  </P></p>

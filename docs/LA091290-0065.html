			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR VOWS TO VETO ILLINOIS CITY'S TUITION-TAX PLAN  </P> <P> Efforts to impose a first-in-the-nation tuition tax on college students  appeared doubtful Tuesday after Mayor Joan Barr vowed to veto a modest but  symbolically significant levy approved by the City Council.  </P> <P> Brushing aside complaints that such a tax would punish students who are poor  and would probably be struck down by the courts anyway, the council voted 10 to  8 late Monday to enact the approximately $15-a-quarter fee.  </P> <P> It would have applied to several thousand students who attend prestigious  Northwestern University as well as three smaller colleges in this well-heeled  suburb of 73,000 residents just north of Chicago.  </P> <P> Critics, including many educators, feared that approval of a tuition tax in  Evanston might open the floodgates to a wave of copycat taxes in cash-strapped  college towns across the country. Northwestern had threatened to sue to block  the tax if it were approved.  </P> <P> Backers of the Evanston tax said they lacked the votes in the council to  override Barr's veto, but they vowed to organize a petition drive to put a  referendum on the tax question on the ballot during municipal elections next  April.  </P></p>

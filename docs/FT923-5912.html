			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Latin American link-up - Leslie Crawford on plans for cross-border listings The stock exchanges of Santiago and Buenos Aires are planning to introduce cross-border listings following a wave of Chilean investment in Argentina. Both exchanges believe the time is ripe for closer integration. Chilean speculators have pumped more than Dollars 200m into the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange - Latin America's top performer last year. Nearly all of this has gone through unofficial channels to avoid the dreaded tax man. In addition, many Chilean corporations are becoming household names across the border. Chile's cash-rich utilities have acquired several Argentine power companies that were privatised this year. Mr Pablo Yrrarazaval, chairman of the Santiago Stock Exchange, or Bolsa, believes it makes sense to allow Chile's budding multinationals to be quoted in Buenos Aires. Attracting Argentine companies to Santiago would also give the Bolsa more depth. Only 50 Chilean companies are actively traded on Chile's Bolsa, and the daily turnover rarely exceeds Dollars 14m. The average daily trading volume is six times higher in Buenos Aires. As a first step, the two exchanges have signed an agreement to exchange information on the rules for listing and trading in both centres. Chile currently demands stricter rules on the disclosure of financial information of its publicly quoted companies. The Securities and Exchange Commissions of both countries are working to standardise auditing and accounting practices. Mr Yrrarazaval is particularly worried about the different tax and foreign investment regimes that operate in both countries. 'Argentina has the clear advantage: there are no capital gains tax or restrictions on capital repatriation,' he explained. In Chile, foreign investors must wait between one and five years to repatriate capital and pay capital gains tax at a rate of 35 per cent. Only one Chilean company is presently quoted on a foreign stock exchange. Compania de Telefonos de Chile (CTC), the telecommunications group controlled by Telefonica of Spain, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1990, where most of its shares are now traded. Demand on Wall Street and at home has more than trebled the price of CTC shares over two years. Mr Yrrarazaval is pressing the finance ministry to abolish Chile's capital gains tax. He argues that Chile needs a stock market that can compete on an equal footing with other financial centres. The response so far has been negative. Mr Hugo Lavados, who heads the Chilean SEC, says: 'We will not change Chile's tax regime just to enhance stock market competition.' He supports the idea of cross-border listings, and believes the markets will set their own price levels to reflect the different tax burdens. Another project in progress aims to link the smaller electronic exchanges of Latin America and Spain. The screen-based securities exchanges were set up in the late 1980s as rivals to the established stock exchanges in the region. They have grown rapidly. Santiago's electronic exchange now handles between a quarter and a third of all equity transactions. Montevideo's electronic bourse has linked up with Barcelona to trade in Spanish treasury bills. They are working to standardise information, and the long-term goal is to have interactive trading between the bourses of Mexico, Sao Paulo, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Caracas, Lima, Madrid, Barcelona and Bilbao.</p>

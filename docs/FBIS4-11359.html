			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel  Salaverria said future president Armando Calderon Sol, the  winner of the 25 April elections, will comply fully with  commitments that remain pending from the peace agreements. The  peace agreements, signed two years ago, put an end to the bloody  civil war in this Central American nation. In an interview with  the media, Salaverria noted that no one can ignore an  international agreement involving the international community,  represented by the United Nations, because to lie to or ignore  the United Nations is a very serious offense. Salaverria added  that Calderon Sol has already committed himself to fully comply  with any issues pending from the peace agreements signed with  the guerrillas.    After declaring himself the winner of the elections on  Sunday  night, Calderon indicated that his first mission will be to  consolidate peace, and in doing so, he will begin a dialogue  with the opposition represented by the former guerrilla movement  Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, among other political  forces.    Calderon Sol also announced that he will travel to New York  in May, when he will meet with UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali to discuss the peace process and convey his  intention of fulfilling the commitments of the peace agreements.</p>

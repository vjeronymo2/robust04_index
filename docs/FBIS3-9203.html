			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Full text" of "address to the Bulgarian Socialists," </F> adopted at a plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party held in  Sofia on 13 March]    [Text] The ideological debate within the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] that has been going on for the last four  years has entered a decisive stage. The discussion of the  prepared drafts of the program document is an important moment  in the life of the party, and it must demonstrate the  irreversibility of the processes of renewal within the BSP.    The debate in the runup to the congress is meant to confirm  the ideological orientation mapped out by the "Manifesto on  Democratic Socialism" and the "Platform for Further Renewal of  the BSP" and to substantiate, supplement, and intensify the main  characteristics of this orientation -- that of a party of  democratic socialism, forming part of the Bulgarian and world  Left that is undergoing renewal.    The active and intense debate on the submitted draft  programs  should provide the answer to some of the key questions in the  ideological evolution of the BSP, such as:    -- the nature of the contemporary world and Bulgarian  society, the changes that are ensuing in them, and their  prospects as we approach the 21st century;    -- the left alternative as a path for rescuing the country  from the socioeconomic crisis in the course of the transition to  a democratic, social state based on the rule of law;    -- the BSP's ideological, social, and political identity;    -- the changes needed in the BSP's organization and  statutes;  and    -- the integration of the Bulgarian Socialists in the  European and world Left.    The intensive, in-depth ideological debate will contribute  to  understanding and assimilating the new views contained in the  various program documents and help to bring them to the notice  of every Socialist and BSP sympathizer.    The municipal BSP councils should create the necessary  conditions for ensuring that the forthcoming discussion is  methodical and well organized, that the views expressed are  summarized and disseminated in popular form, and that these  views are presented in a timely fashion to the BSP Supreme  Council. What is needed is not that each BSP organization  should pass a formal vote of approval, but that each  organization and every Socialist should give their own  standpoints on the main issues of the ideological debate and the  ways they are treated in the individual draft program documents.  Such a standpoint can only be formed by a discussion in depth  that involves all the party organs, the main and municipal party  organizations, and every Socialist.    The discussion should be an active and critical one, while  observing the democratic principles established over the past  four years. The BSP Supreme Council is sure that the discussion  of the program will proceed in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance  and forbearance, which will help to develop and enhance internal  party relations. The discussion and adoption of a new socialist  program should create conditions for rallying the party and  strengthening its organizational and political unity.    In the course of the discussion new ideas should be  generated  to enhance a future BSP program document. We call upon all the  teams of authors to present their own draft documents before the  accountability-election campaign enters its final phase, that  is, before the municipal organizations hold their conferences.  As the campaign proceeds, their participation through the  submission of their drafts will enhance the debate and improve  the resolutions of the meetings and conferences, promote a  meaningful elucidation of the problems prior to the 41st  congress, and considerably facilitate the work of the congress  itself.    We hope that we will succeed in mobilizing the BSP's  political and scientific potential in the time remaining before  the upcoming congress. The discussion of the program document  is a good occasion to motivate the organizations, stimulate the  ideological trends, and encourage the clubs of socialist  intellectuals to involve themselves in a public dialogue  encompassing the entire spectrum of left-wing intellectual  thinking.    The success of the debate on the program is unthinkable  unless a permanent and authoritative speaker's platform is made  available. It is essential to ensure greater commitment of the  party publications to this goal, especially DUMA and NOVO VREME,  so that they reflect in suitable form the views, remarks, and  proposals of the participants in the debate.    We should not limit the debate to the party organizations.  The discussion of the ideological problems are a good  opportunity to open up the Bulgarian Socialists to Bulgarian  society, the European Left, and the world at large. We should  seek a broad public debate on the way out of the crisis and the  problems of the transition to a democratic, social state based  on the rule of law, a debate that will establish the image of  the BSP as a fundamental constructive factor in Bulgaria's  political life.    Such a debate will enable the 41st BSP Congress to make a  comprehensive, in-depth assessment of the results of the  ideological discussion within the BSP and to impart a new  impetus to the party's efforts to confirm its program, the  result of which is of immense importance not only for the  Socialists themselves, but also for the Bulgarian Left and the  whole of Bulgarian society.</p>

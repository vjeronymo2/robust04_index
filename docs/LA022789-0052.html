			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLIGHT CANCELED AFTER CARGO DOOR PROBLEM  </P> <P> A cargo door problem on a United Airlines jet forced cancellation of a flight  to Hong Kong on Sunday, the day the airline said it ordered inspections of the  doors because of Friday's deadly in-flight accident near Hawaii.  </P> <P> A United spokesman said, however, that the incident at Seattle-Tacoma  International Airport was not related to the special inspections.  </P> <P> In the Seattle case, an electric motor that closes a latch on the cargo-hold  door was found to be faulty, said Russell Mack, a United spokesman in Chicago.  </P> <P> He said the motor was repaired in one to two hours, but by then crew scheduling  problems forced the flight to be delayed until this morning.  </P></p>

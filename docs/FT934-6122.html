			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Exporters resent calls to pass on devaluation: Eddie George and Kenneth Clarke think margins in manufacturing are too high. But, as some industrialists find their remarks a bad joke In the past month, first Mr Eddie George and then Mr Kenneth Clarke have voiced concerns that British industry may be boosting prices and profit margins instead of sales volumes and employment. Mr George, governor of the Bank of England, was alarmed that more than half of recent increases in manufacturers' output prices in the UK came from higher margins while Mr Clarke, the chancellor, focused more on the sharp rise in export prices following last year's devaluation of sterling. However, for some of Britain's more beleaguered manufacturers, the patriotic exhortations of the chancellor and the governor to cut prices and increase exports are simply irritating. The governor's remarks, says Mr Robert Napier, chief executive of the building materials group Redland, were 'extremely unsympathetic to the plight of the construction industry'. In some sectors the pleas of the chancellor and governor must seem like a bad joke. Pilkington, one of Europe's biggest glass manufacturers, took a decision at the time of devaluation last September to hold its European prices in local currency terms. But, says Pilkington's finance director Mr Andrew Robb, the combination of European recession and ferocious competition means that prices in those markets have kept on falling. As a result, he says, 'the sterling price we're getting now is lower than we got before devaluation'. For building materials companies such as Redland, the irritation is doubly justified. In the late 1980s government ministers exhorted the sector to invest in new capacity, since the building boom was sucking in imports of bricks and other materials. And indeed, the industry invested - by one estimate - some Pounds 200m from 1985. The ensuing decline in the building industry guaranteed that the money was largely wasted. Even for companies willing in principle to cut their export prices, there may be practical difficulties. An extreme case is Rover, which was working hard on building up its European exports long before devaluation. Nevertheless, according to Mr Graham Morris, managing director of Rover Europe, the price of standard Rover models in continental Europe has stayed broadly unchanged in spite of devaluation. First, Mr Morris said, Rover had taken out long-range foreign exchange contracts to hedge it against currency turbulence. 'We have significant foreign exchange cover in most markets to the end of 1994, and in some cases into 1995. Thereafter, we have a significant opportunity for higher profits or market share, but not until then.' Second, he pointed out, the EU was imposing a system of price harmonisation for cars across the community. 'This means we are under increasing pressure to defy the laws of supply and demand and keep prices across Europe within a 12 per cent band,' he said. Third, Rover was a small niche player in European markets, and had positioned itself as an up-market and relatively expensive brand. 'We cannot rush for volume on the back of short-term price cuts,' Mr Morris said. 'Apart from anything else, that would harm existing Rover owners through a fall in residual values.' Nevertheless, he said, devaluation had offered some opportunities. In one or two areas, such as down-market diesel models of existing lines, there had not been a market in Europe. But devaluation meant Rover could enter the market on a cut-price basis for the first time. Since this was new business, not previously budgeted for, it was not covered by foreign exchange contracts. In other markets, too, Rover has been less hesitant. In February of this year it launched a marketing campaign in Japan, based on the slogan of 'fair play'. This explained to Japanese consumers that, because Britain had devalued, it was in a position to pass part of the benefits on to its customers. 'This will help our volumes and help you,' the advertisements said. On average, the price of Rover cars in Japan was cut by 13 per cent. As a result unit sales - admittedly from a low base - are up 24 per cent in the year to date compared with a total rise for imported cars of just 8 per cent. The chancellor and governor can take further comfort from one of Britain's best-known companies, Imperial Chemical Industries. According to Mr Alan Spall, ICI's general manager for finance, ICI took a decision at the time of devaluation to split the benefits between higher margins and higher exports 'Following devaluation, we did a significant amount of work on how to increase our market share. The decision we arrived at was that we should use the benefits of devaluation to minimise the free fall in volume that was going on in the European market.' Mr Spall declined to specify just how much of the gains of devaluation were handed out in this way. But the amount, he said, was 'significant'. As a result, he said, ICI's volume sales of bulk chemicals into continental Europe in the first nine months of the year were up while the market as a whole was substantially down. On the whole, though, companies such as ICI seem to be in a minority. Mr Richard Kersley, strategy analyst at the London brokers BZW, has calculated that export prices for British manufacturers were up 10 per cent in this year's third quarter compared to the year before. Of that, he reckoned, 8.8 percentage points could be attributed to higher margins. Mr Kersley added: 'Taken all round, UK companies have protected their profitability far more successfully in this recession than they managed to in the last.' Appeals to patriotism, it seems, are falling on deaf ears.</p>

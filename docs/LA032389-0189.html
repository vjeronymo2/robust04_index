			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DISTRICT: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> TOUR BUS SCHEDULE OKD  </P> <P> Tour bus operators and city officials have reached an informal agreement as  part of a plan to eliminate traffic congestion from buses and passengers  crowding city streets.  </P> <P> City officials met with the half-dozen major tour bus companies that operate  vacation tours originating in Monterey Park and traveling throughout the  Southwest and California.  </P> <P> The bus companies agreed to load and unload on off-street locations and to  separate these spots as much as possible. The operators also agreed to have  buses depart before 8:30 a.m. and to return to Monterey Park on staggered  schedules.  </P> <P> "The problem was that 10 to 12 buses would be in one place, loading up on a  Saturday morning, blocking visibility and with pedestrians running all over the  street to get to a bus," said Assistant City Manager Stan Soo-Hoo.  </P> <P> "The idea was to address the problem and not overreact in a police kind of  way." Bus operators last year complained that city officials had arbitrarily  issued citations to buses that had allegedly committed zoning violations by  improper parking on city streets.  </P></p>

All the commenters opposed the proposal to add the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service to the Procurement List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current contractor indicated that its contract for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service represented a sizeable part of its sales for the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarter, and noted that not being allowed to perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining option year of its contract could affect its survival.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The contractor cited its quality performance on the contract, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidenced by an award it had received. The legal defense fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seconded the contractor's comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The four other Utah disadvantaged businesses noted that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service had long been in the Federal disadvantaged business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8(a)) program. Its removal from the program, along with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closures of two other military bases in Utah, would, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimed, eliminate about a fifth of the 8(a) contracting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business in Utah, requiring disadvantaged businesses to go  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside of the State to do Federal work in the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, they indicated that addition of this contract to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Procurement List would negatively impact them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SBA district office also indicated that this service has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been in the 8(a) program for many years. The office indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the service is a substantial part of the program in Utah,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representing at least ten percent of program dollars and nearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fifty percent of program dollars in janitorial services. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> office also seconded the current contractor's comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning its option and its performance on the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additions to the Procurement List do not affect contracts in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being before the effective date of the addition, or options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercised under those contracts. The decision to exercise an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option is solely at the discretion of the Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracting activity. Consequently, if an option is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercised, any resulting impact on a contractor is because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contracting activity's decision and not the Committee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action in adding an item to the Procurement List. In this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular case, the option in question has already been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercised, so the contractor will retain the work for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coming year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comparison of the comments by the SBA district office and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four Utah businesses with information available from Hill Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Force Base contracting staff indicates that the commenters have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exaggerated the impact on the 8(a) program of adding this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service to the Procurement List. Based on FY 1994 data, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract represents only six percent of all 8(a) contracts at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hill Air Force Base. Since there are other 8(a) contracts in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah, such as a General Services Administration contract for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> janitorial services at the Federal building in Salt Lake City,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this contract clearly represents an extremely small percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all the 8(a) contracts in Utah.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to 8(a) janitorial contracts in Utah, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee recognizes that there are a limited number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities to clean Federal facilities. However, it also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knows that many 8(a) janitorial contracts are competed among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8(a) contractors on a regional or national basis. Consequently, the Federal business opportunities for 8(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> janitorial firms in Utah are not limited to contracts for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities within Utah. Moreover, adding this service to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procurement List is not taking business away from the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractor or the other 8(a) contractors which commented, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only removing the opportunity for 8(a) firms other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current contractor to obtain the work in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taking into account all these factors, the Committee does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that addition of this service to the Procurement List  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will have a severe impact on the 8(a) program and its Utah  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors. The Committee's action will also create a very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large number of jobs for people with severe disabilities, well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the average for a Procurement List addition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of the material presented to it concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the service,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I certify that the following action will not have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors considered for this certification were:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than the small organizations that will furnish the service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current contractors for the service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the service to the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 46 - 48c) in connection with the service proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the Procurement List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procurement List: Janitorial/Custodial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Remaining buildings not on Procurement List)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hill Air Force Base, Utah.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of this addition or options exercised under those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Beverly L.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] MORE than one million people in Thailand are  now believed to be HIV positive, according to Public Health  Ministry statistics released yesterday.    Interior Ministry spokesman, Chiyakon Sesawet, said there  are  as many as 1.3 million HIV infected people according to the  Public Health Ministry's statistics for February.    He described the figures as "very alarming." [passage  omitted]    Chiyakon believed that the number of HIV cases is rising  because 75 per cent of Thai men sleep regularly with prostitutes.    In addition, 44 per cent of teenage boys have their first  sexual experience with prostitutes.    Chiyakon said that the Interior Ministry has set up four  committees in response to a request from the National Aids  Committee for a coordinated campaign to try to redress the  alarming spread of the deadly disease.    The committees will take responsibility in planning,  budgeting, public relations and analysis to ensure that the  campaign is effective.    Chiyakon said the Interior Ministry has also approved a plan  to set up Aids- free clubs in some government and state  enterprise agencies nationwide.    "If the clubs prove successful in the fight against Aids,  the  ministry will expand the idea to cover all government and state  agencies" he said.    Chiyakon said the statistics released yesterday show that  there are 5,215 Aids patients in Thailand, 85.3 per cent of them  men and 12.7 per cent women.</p>

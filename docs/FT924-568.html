			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: Resignation clears way for Astra takeover Mr SUMITRO Djojohadi-kusumo resigned yesterday as chairman of Astra International, Indonesia's dominant automotive company. The move clears the way for a consortium led by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a timber tycoon, to buy 44.5 per cent of Astra from the Soeryadjaya family, who currently hold a majority stake. Last week, Mr Djojohadikusumo vetoed the proposed sale of 108m shares for Rp1,080bn (Dollars 518m) to the consortium, describing it as against the interests of Astra and the nation. Toyota, the company's main joint-venture partner, and at least one Japanese bank with exposure to Astra, had opposed the deal, he added. Toyota said yesterday: 'In spite of the chairman's resignation, we would like to do business with Astra group in the same friendly relations as before.' Toyota remains undecided about whether to purchase 20m shares offered by the Soeryadjayas last month. Mr Djojohadikusumo was appointed chairman in September to replace Mr William Soeryadjaya, who wanted to concentrate on rescuing Bank Summa, owned by his family. Last week, Bank Summa was ordered into liquidation, owing Rp1,600bn, and Mr Soeryadjaya has been trying to raise finance to repay depositors. Mr Djojohadikusumo resigned under pressure from Mr Soeryadjaya, brokers say. Astra's shares rallied Rp250 yesterday to Rp8,750, but brokers expressed disappointment at the resignation. 'He (Mr Djojohadikusumo) was brought in to protect the company's minority shareholders and insulate Astra from Bank Summa. He failed, because he was put in an intolerable position by the Soeryadjayas,' said a foreign broker. Brokers stress details of the expected sale of Astra shares are unclear, including the identity of many members of Mr Pangestu's consortium and how the deal would be financed.</p>

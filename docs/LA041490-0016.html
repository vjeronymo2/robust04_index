			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT IS THIS GUY, SOME KIND OF JOKER?  </P> <P> Could you tell me why Jack Nicholson needs binoculars at Laker games.  </P> <P> He sits in the front row, next to the opposing team's coach. Half the time he  has a better seat than Magic. Hey, Jack, I love you. I root for you every time  I see "The Shining," but could you please pass those suckers up to the top,  where someone with bad eyes can see the game?  </P> <P> GARY FENTON, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

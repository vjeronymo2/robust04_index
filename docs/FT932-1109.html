			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / US and Britain rap Nigeria's knuckles GEN Ibraham Babangida, Nigeria's military leader, is due today to break his silence, in a national broadcast in which he is expected to outline a new political programme following the annulment of presidential elections earlier this month. Britain and the US yesterday imposed minimal military sanctions against Nigeria. The UK Foreign Office in London said Britain would discuss appropriate action with Washington and the European Community and did not rule out further sanctions. The Foreign Office called on the Nigerian government to reverse Wednesday's decision to cancel the June 12 poll: 'Nigeria deserves better than a further period of unstable and undemocratic military rule.' British measures include the withdrawal of military advisers from Nigeria, a bar on new military training courses and the suspension of visas for military personnel from that country. At least four of Nigeria's military leaders have been trained by the British army. Gen Yukubu Gowon, who took power in a coup in 1966 and was head of state until 1975, trained at Sandhurst, while Gen Olusegun Obasanjo and Gen Muhammadu Buhari, who took power in 1976 and 1984, were at Aldershot. President Babangida trained with the Royal Armoured Corps. In Washington the Clinton administration said it was suspending Dollars 450,000 (Pounds 300,000) in annual aid set aside for training Nigerian military personnel, and ordered Nigeria's military attache to leave. The State Department is to issue a travel advisory discouraging US citizens from going to Nigeria. A spokesman for the Social Democratic party of Mr Moshood Abiola, who was widely believed to have won the election, said of the president's planned broadcast: 'What will the government say now that the people will believe? They have brought on a crisis of confidence.' The Nigerian government claimed last night it had unearthed a US and British anti-Nigerian plot and pledged 'necessary action' against any country or interest group that sought to interfere in its internal affairs. 'The federal government is aware of the enemy that gave rise to the chaos in Somalia, Sudan, Yugoslavia and so on and wishes to reassure Nigerians that it will not allow foreign interference to exacerbate the present crisis.'</p>

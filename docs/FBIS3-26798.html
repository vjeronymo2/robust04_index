Macao Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira presided  over a ceremony marking the opening of the bridge.    The governor first expressed his congratulations on the  completion of the new bridge, saying he was convinced that the  bridge would bring great benefits to local people.    The new bridge is expected to ease the tense traffic in  Macao, the governor said.    He added that the opening of the bridge is a recognition of  the great efforts that technicians and builders have made to  finish the project.    It is learned that starting from today, all heavy-duty  trucks  will not be allowed to use the old Macao-Taipa bridge, finished  in 1974.    The four-lane new bridge is 4,414 meters long and 19.3  meters  wide, with a total 1108.86-meter bridge approach at the two ends.    Construction of the bridge, started in 1990, costed more  than  600 million Macao patacas (about 77 million U.S. dollars).</p>

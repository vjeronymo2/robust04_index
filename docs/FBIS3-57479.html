			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "In Japan It Is No Longer </F> Considered Necessary To Assist Russia"]    [Text] Tokyo -- Citing confidential Foreign Ministry  sources, the capital's TOKYO SHIMBUN reports that the Japanese  Government has decided to make adjustments in its approach to  Russia.    In view of Moscow's clear conservative turn in recent weeks,  the departure from the cabinet of key figures committed to  reforms, and Viktor Chernomyrdin's statements leaving no doubt  of his intention to halt the country's movement toward a market  economy, Tokyo intends as a matter of the greatest urgency to  adjust its policy of providing economic assistance for the  Russian reforms. From a formal viewpoint the economic package  of $1.82 billion in credits for Russia and insurance for trade  operations with Russia which Japan had promised remains on the  agenda, but in actual fact even this lifeline is being put on  ice, so the same source points out, because the change in the  political situation in Moscow and the Chernomyrdin government's  sharp turn to the right require a commensurate response.    According to the major Japanese newspapers the recent  changes  in Moscow have unambiguously shifted the Japanese perception of  Russia in a negative direction. Fears that the agreements  reached during Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October can now be  confidently written off are becoming firm convictions.  Bilateral relations themselves are being plunged into a new  period of uncertainty, the length of which cannot be estimated.    Japanese analysts are more and more frequently comparing  Yeltsin's Russia with Hindenburg's Germany, and are rebuking the  president for appeasement and other sins. But perhaps the most  notable feature is that hints are emerging, tentative as yet,  about the need to review Russia's relations with the G-7, the  Paris Club, and other common Western structures. So, for  example, Japanese Foreign Ministry sources are now actively  arguing that it is logical to help the reformers, to meet them  halfway on the question of deferring payments on Russian  liabilities, and to seek other forms of collaboration. But the  logic clearly collapses if Moscow intends changing course and  putting the brakes on reforms. Moreover, according to TOKYO  SHIMBUN, Japan is inclined to put on the agenda of the  forthcoming G-7 meeting in Naples the question of reviewing the  whole package of Western economic aid for Russia to take account  of the changes in Moscow's political reference points.    You do not have to be a great prophet to divine that there  will be a further sharpening of tone if Chernomyrdin really does  resort to reintroducing the antimarket model.</p>

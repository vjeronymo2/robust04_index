			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China has dismissed diplomatic concerns that it  might plant spies and informers in foreign consulates in Hong  Kong after 1997.    Diplomatic missions in the territory fear a Foreign  Ministry-run government agency might centralise their supply of  local staff when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.    Under the Basic Law, the Central People's Government will be  responsible for foreign affairs in the Special Administrative  Region (SAR).    But China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The HONGKONG  STANDARD it had no intention of changing current consulate  practices which allow foreign diplomatic missions in the  territory absolute freedom to recruit their own staff.    In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said all  consulate-related matters would be further examined, but that  basically China was unwilling to change the territory's usual  practices.    "After China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty  over  Hong Kong, the present system will basically remain unchanged,"  the Foreign Ministry said.    Staff such as office clerks, interpreters, drivers or  domestic helpers at diplomats' residences are usually recruited  through public advertisements in local newspapers.    Sources argued the practice of planting bugs and spies in  foreign diplomatic missions was not only used by communist  countries but also by many Western nations.    "Under the present staff recruitment rules, spies and  informers can still mingle in foreign consulates in Hong Kong,"  a source said.    The question of whether new recruitment rules will be  introduced for the territory's foreign consulates is a very  "minor issue to China.    "A principle has been stipulated under the Basic Law on the  questions concerning the establishment of foreign consulates in  Hong Kong," the Foreign Ministry statement said.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofeng explained that  foreign affairs issues in Hong Kong would be handled by China  under the Basic Law provisions which referred to major  diplomatic policy.    "The Foreign Ministry will not take care of those small  concrete things," Mr Shen said, referring to staff recruitment  for foreign diplomatic missions in Hong Kong.    "The local staff recruitment rules for consulates are among  considerable number of matter that have not yet been fully  studied by the Foreign Ministry."</p>

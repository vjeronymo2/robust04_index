			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Allies' shaky footing: Croats and Bosnian Moslems make uneasy partners Is it war or peace? Peace, but not the kiss of peace. A patched up affair, if you ask my opinion. And if you ask me, I think that this peace Is nothing like an end, nor like a beginning. TS Eliot - Murder in the Cathedral Such is most people's instinctive reaction to last week's US-brokered agreement be-tween Croats and 'Bosniacs' (Bosnian Moslems). It came so suddenly, after nearly a year of savage fighting, in which both sides emulated the methods used earlier by the Serbs to 'cleanse' the territory they held of other ethnic groups. Publicity about the Croat-Moslem war has focused on the plight of the Moslems in and around Mostar, and on the intervention by the Croatian regular army. This partly obscured the fact that in central Bosnia the Moslems have been winning the war and the Croat inhabitants have fled from a string of towns: Travnik, Bugojno, Fojnica, Konjic, Kakanj and others. That explains the US-brokered agreement. The policy pursued by President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, which was to support a separate Croat state of 'Herceg-Bosna' as the prelude to an eventual partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina between Croatia and Serbia, has proved a disaster for the Croats. The Croatian army had not succeeded in retrieving this disaster, but its attempt to do so had brought down the west's wrath on Croatia's head. In Croatia itself, the increasingly visible alliance with Serbia was unpopular. All over Croatia there are refugees from the areas, amounting to roughly one-third of the republic's territory, which were conquered by Serb forces in 1991. These refugees, and many of their fellow-citizens, were outraged at the sight of their own government conniving with the Serbs in the carve-up of Bosnia. So Mr Tudjman was glad enough to use US pressure and mediation as cover for his admission of defeat - just as President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, and the Serb leaders in Bosnia, seized on Russian intervention to cover their retreat when faced with a serious threat of Nato air strikes. The Nato action may also have helped to swing Mr Tudjman round. Croatia, whose whole raison d'etre as an independent state derives from its self-image as part of the west (in contrast to the 'Byzantine' Serbs), could not possibly take the Serb side once a serious confrontation developed between Serbia and the west. If the west is now at last getting tough with the Serbs, Croatia is bound to put itself on the western side, in the hope of regaining control of its lost territory. That indeed is the explanation of his volte-face that Mr Tudjman gave to the Croats. For him the agreement is not really about Bosnia at all. A deal with the Bosnian Moslems is simply the price the US requires Croatia to pay for help in recovering Krajina. It seems there is some truth in this presentation of the matter, since US spokesmen have started saying that sanctions on Serbia will not be lifted until the Krajina issue is resolved. Meanwhile, it is not entirely clear how the Bosnian government interprets the Washington agreement. Most international reaction has taken it as a step towards a 'two-republic solution' in Bosnia, based on the acceptance that the Serbs of Bosnia will have a separate state of their own, linked to Serbia, and that therefore it makes sense for the Moslems and Croats to pool their resources and develop links with Croatia. This interpretation seemed to be confirmed by the Bosnian prime minister, Haris Silajdzic, when he said in Washington last week that Russian pressure is needed to get the Serbs to agree to a negotiated solution. But another interpretation is doing the rounds in the small pro-Bosnian lobby in London. According to this view, the new Croat-Moslem alliance is a step towards the defeat of Serbia. The Bosnian army has proved itself in battle against the Croats, but also against the Serbs, for instance near Banja Luka where small groups of Bosnian partisans have held far more heavily armed Serb forces at bay. Now, with or without a formal lifting of the arms embargo, the Bosnian army will be strengthened by the Croats' change of sides and the opening of supply routes from the coast. Such hopes are mirrored by Serb fears, as reported in an AP despatch from Banja Luka at the weekend. The author, Julijana Mojsilovic, reports Serb fighters as dreading a Moslem spring offensive. Superior Moslem numbers and morale are beginning to tell in thickly-wooded terrain where heavy artillery is of little use. It is tempting to believe that the hold of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Serb leader in Bosnia, and his thugs could be broken by a short, sharp spring offensive with western support. It is tempting to believe that the Serbs would then agree to peace on similar terms to the Croats, joining the new federal republic, while Serbia itself could join the proposed confederation with Bosnia and Croatia - thereby recreating a loose, confederal Yugoslavia such as the Croats and Slovenes were demanding before the war broke out. Tempting, but dangerous. It is good that the Serbs should fear a spring offensive, since without that fear they are unlikely to make the territorial concessions which are essential for a two-republic solution to work. But the Bosnian government would be taking a risk with the lives of its own citizens if it spurned such a solution and staked everything on a continuation of the war. And those in the west who support the Bosnian cause would take a great moral risk if they encouraged the government to adopt that course.</p>

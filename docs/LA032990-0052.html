			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FAIR'S EX-MANAGER FACES REDUCED CHARGE  </P> <P> The former manager of the Antelope Valley Fair in Lancaster entered a plea of  no contest Wednesday to a misdemeanor grand theft charge as part of a plea  bargain with prosecutors to drop felony embezzlement charges.  </P> <P> C.W. Adams, 48, had been charged with embezzling public funds in the purchase  of materials to build a $700 fence around his house in 1986 and to buy $500  worth of tires for two private vehicles in 1988. Adams, who retired as fair  manager last April after budget irregularities surfaced, allegedly used fair  funds in both instances.  </P> <P> Adams was also charged with altering fair records on the eve of an audit by  state officials -- the fair is under the auspices of the state -- to conceal  unpaid utility debts of more than $50,000, according to the Los Angeles County  district attorney's office.  </P> <P> That charge was dropped in a hearing on Monday before Lancaster Municipal Court  Judge Frank Jackson in exchange for Adams' no contest plea to a single count of  misdemeanor grand theft. Attorneys told the judge that Adams has agreed to pay  back the embezzled $1,200 plus a fine of $1,000.  </P> <P> Because of Adams' lack of prior offenses and the relatively small amount  embezzled, prosecutors said they have also agreed to ask for no jail time when  Adams appears for sentencing May 11. He could be sentenced to up to 60 days in  jail.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley said a key factor in the reduction of  charges was that in the most serious offense, the alteration of public records,  Adams appeared to have been trying to make the fair's finances look better,  rather than to conceal a crime.  </P> <P> "It does not appear to have been done for fraudulent purposes for self-gain,"  Cooley said. "But for the fact that we did file the one charge of falsification  of an account of public monies, the case would probably not have been pursued  as a felony, given the amounts taken."  </P> <P> Adams declined to comment.  </P></p>

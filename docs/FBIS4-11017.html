			<p>BFN     [Text] Daniel Ortega, FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front] secretary general, last night said the ESAF [Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility] poses a "very serious threat to  Nicaragua." He believes the economic measures agreed upon with  international financial organizations "will not achieve their  intended goals."    "The government proposal is wrong," Ortega insisted during a  debate televised by Canal Cuatro.    Hours earlier, during a news conference, Presidency Minister  Antonio Lacayo said the ESAF is not a new "harsh experience" for  the country but, instead, an opportunity to pay on a lower debt  to the Paris Club, grant more financing to agricultural  production, and have more schools and health centers.    While issuing a warning about possible social unrest in the  country, the Sandinist leader described the government as "blind  or ill-intentioned" for imposing its policy at all costs as part  of "a position that has become reckless."    Ortega added, "We would be the first to support the measures  if we were certain that production and employment would rise  after a certain period of time."    He questioned the decisionmaking process that led to these  economic decisions, and he noted, "the government is responsible  for taking into account the various social, economic, and  political segments of the population before making a decision on  such an important issue. The government failed to do this and  has been applying these measures since May 1993."    "These measures were decided [comprometidas] and issued from  above, and this undermines government trust and credibility.  They pointed a pistol at those sectors consulted," he said.    The FSLN secretary general said some viable alternatives to  ESAF include making more flexible the granting of loans,  adjusting bank interest rates, avoiding attacks on properties  through debts with the financial system [as published],  protecting national production, and seeking a renegotiation of  our foreign debt.    The feasibility of these measures proposed by the FSLN could  be accepted by international financial organizations if the  government had "the political resolve to confront the  international financial organizations," Ortega said.    He added, "If the government had the support of political  and  economic forces, it would be in a favorable position to reach  agreements of this sort."    Ortega replied to charges leveled hours earlier by Minister  Lacayo on the foreign debt acquired by Nicaragua during his  tenure.    The former president said one must understand the reason  behind that debt, and he added that the financing terms were  favorable to the country.    Ortega pointed out that a good part of that financing served  to supply Nicaraguan producers with inexpensive raw materials,  spare parts, and machinery.  <H5>  Popular Support </H5>   Throughout his presentation, Ortega stressed that his party  is only warning about the consequences of ESAF.    "The FSLN is not seeking support for its positions. It is  issuing a warning about the risk of these economic policies.  When a conservative segment, such as the producers, takes to  the streets to protest, it is because we have a profound  crisis," Ortega added. When asked about a possible wave of  popular protests or violence because of these economic  decisions, Ortega said: "Only a rectification on the part of the  government will prevent riots and protests such as those that  occurred in the past. Neither the FSLN nor I will provoke the  riots; the government's policies will."    The Sandinist leader said his party must support the demands  of segments of the population who are hurt by the ESAF.    As for limits to the popular protests, Ortega said, "This is  a very complex situation, and the FSLN cannot produce some sort  of catechism." [sentence as published]  <H5>  Defending Constitutional Order </H5>   "We are defending constitutional order. Should the  government break that order, there are 39 Sandinist deputies and  other deputies from other forces in the National Assembly who  would certainly join to defend constitutional order," Ortega  pointed out.    He commented, however, on violent acts such as the burning  of  journalist Pablo Emilio Barreto's house and the murder of 219  Sandinists in Jinotega Department, saying that such explosive  incidents could result from self-defense groups.    In face of this, "we must wonder whether the organization of  citizens in self-defense brigades would be tolerated, whether  state authorities are limited in their ability to guarantee  public safety," Ortega added.    The FSLN secretary general said he was not advocating the  establishment of self-defense groups, but he pointed out that  situations like this "leave no other option other than the  creation of self-defense organizations."    Ortega said the FSLN would not be at the helm of any  possible  social unrest. "We must take into account that social upheavals  are not planned. We are issuing a warning about a situation  that could be beyond our control," he added.</p>

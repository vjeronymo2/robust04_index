			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat survival more likely THE survival of Greycoat, the property company struggling to fend off receivership, was more likely last night as the UK value fund appeared on the verge of a rescue refinancing. Lawyers and advisers for the fund, which is advised by corporate financiers Mr Julian Trager and Mr Bryan Myerson, who advise the UK Active Value Fund, were concluding details of a complex package that will have to reconcile the conflicting interests of two sets of bond holders, preference and ordinary share holders. Last month a similar deal proposed by Postel, the UK's largest pension fund and recommended by Greycoat's management, foundered when preference shareholders and holders of zero coupon bonds rejected the offer on the grounds that it undervalued the company's property assets. The deal emerging last night appeared likely to raise more money through a rights issue and to improve terms for bond holders while ordinary shareholders would do slightly worse.</p>

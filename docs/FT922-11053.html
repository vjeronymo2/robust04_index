			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (11): A man of diverse parts - Profile of Maciej Skarbonkiewicz Of Bydgoscz - Anthony Robinson criss-crosses small-town Poland and finds the spirit of enterprise still very much alive and well THE president of the Plexis precision engineering company in Bydgoszcz, Maciej Skarbonkiewicz, runs his diversified enterprise from an elegant panelled office attached to his precision plastic extrusion die factory. He started building his company in the early 1980s after studying English in England for two years. In 10 years he has built the company up to a Dollars 4m a year turnover, adapting quickly to changed circumstances. Latterly, he has built an atelier to produce high-quality, women's fashion clothing in the attic of the die factory and branched out into importing liqueurs, and consumer electronics. He has also entered a joint venture with OKT of Germany, renting the storage hall of a nearby state-owned bakery to produce a wide variety of plastic household products. The imported German machines, easily serviceable by the skilled engineers from the Plexis factory, run 24 hours a day producing the kind of bright, cheap kitchen utensils simply unobtainable in Polish and eastern European shops a few years ago. This summer he will start producing high quality plastic garden furniture under an agreement with Flair Plaisir of Holland. 'We have developed many legs, to help us keep afloat in fast changing times. But the most difficult thing is to build up capital when interest rates are so high and government policies keep changing all the time.' He worries that few in government have any idea of the real needs of businessmen. He plans to enter parliament with the Liberal Congress Party, whose leader Jan Krzyzstof Bielecki found himself up against a rubber wall when he tried to close loss-making state enterprises.</p>

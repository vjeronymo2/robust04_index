[Correspondent Pagiela] The Wanda textile plant in  Sosnowiec, the mining electronic equipment plant in Tychy, and  the Fablok locomotive factory in Chrzanow are among the  enterprises on strike. We have been told that the OPZZ  [All-Polish Trade Union Agreement] unions have joined the  strike. Despite earlier announcements, muncipal transport is  not on strike in Silesia. Marek Kepski, chairman of the  Solidarity Silesia-Dabrowa region, said that a strike of public  transport would inconvenience the public, and Solidarity wants  to avoid this. The decision as to whether a public transport  strike should take place in Silesia will probably be made on 15  March.    [Announcer] Piotr Pagiela was speaking from Katowice.    Public transport in Koszalin was not working between 0400  and  0700 hours because the work force of the MZK [Municipal  Transport Enterprise] joined the Solidarity strike. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each fuel tank must be supported so that tank loads are not concentrated on unsupported tank surfaces. In addition_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) There must be pads, if necessary, to prevent chafing between each tank and its supports; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The padding must be nonabsorbent or treated to prevent the absorption of fuel; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If flexible tank liners are used, they must be supported so that it is not necessary for them to withstand fluid loads; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Each interior surface of tank compartments must be smooth and free of projections that could cause wear of the liner unless_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) There are means for protection of the liner at those points; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The construction of the liner itself provides such protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Any spaces adjacent to tank surfaces must be adequately ventilated to avoid accumulation of fuel or fumes in those spaces due to minor leakage. If the tank is in a sealed compartment, ventilation may be limited to drain holes that prevent clogging and excessive pressure resulting from altitude changes. If flexible tank liners are installed, the venting arrangement for the spaces between the liner and its container must maintain the proper relationship to tank vent pressures for any expected flight condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The location of each tank must meet the requirements of &sect;27.1185 (a) and (c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) No rotorcraft skin immediately adjacent to a major air outlet from the engine compartment may act as the wall of the integral tank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Section 27.973 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;27.973 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fuel tank filler connection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each fuel tank filler connection must prevent the entrance of fuel into any part of the rotorcraft other than the tank itself during normal operations and must be crash resistant during a survivable impact in accordance with &sect;27.952(c). In addition_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Each filler must be marked as prescribed in &sect;27.1557(c)(1); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each recessed filler connection that can retain any appreciable quantity of fuel must have a drain that discharges clear of the entire rotorcraft; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Each filler cap must provide a fuel-tight seal under the fluid pressure expected in normal operation and in a survivable impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each filler cap or filler cap cover must warn when the cap is not fully locked or seated on the filler connection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Section 27.975 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;27.975 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fuel tank vents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) The venting system must be designed to minimize spillage of fuel through the vents to an ignition source in the event of a rollover during landing, ground operation, or a survivable impact, unless a rollover is shown to be extremely remote. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 29_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: TRANSPORT CATEGORY ROTORCRAFT <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. The authority citation for part 29 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 1344, 1354(a), 1355, 1421, 1423, 1424, 1425, 1428, 1429, 1430; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. A new &sect;29.952 is added to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;29.952 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fuel system crash resistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unless other means acceptable to the Administrator are employed to minimize the hazard of fuel fires to occupants following an otherwise survivable impact (crash landing), the fuel systems must incorporate the design features of this section. These systems must be shown to be capable of sustaining the static and dynamic deceleration loads of this section, considered as ultimate loads acting alone, measured at the system component's center of gravity without structural damage to the system components, fuel tanks, or their attachments that would leak fuel to an ignition source. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Drop test requirements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Each tank, or the most critical tank, must be drop-tested as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The drop height must be at least 50 feet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The drop impact surface must be nondeforming. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The tanks must be filled with water to 80 percent of the normal, full capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The tank must be enclosed in a surrounding structure representative of the installation unless it can be established that the surrounding structure is free of projections or other design features likely to contribute to rupture of the tank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The tank must drop freely and impact in a horizontal position  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) After the drop test, there must be no leakage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fuel tank load factors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Except for fuel tanks located so that tank rupture with fuel release to either significant ignition sources, such as engines, heaters, and auxiliary power units, or occupants is extremely remote, each fuel tank must be designed and installed to retain its contents under the following ultimate inertial load factors, acting alone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For fuel tanks in the cabin: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Upward_4g. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Forward_16g. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Sideward_8g. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Downward_20g. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For fuel tanks located above or behind the crew or passenger compartment that, if loosened, could injure an occupant in an emergency landing: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Upward_1.5g. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (5): Private sector set to benefit from legacy of development - The TDC is being wound up. Stewart Dalby analyses its record NEW TOWN corporations are wound up, or 'realised', when the secretary of state for the environment feels that the town has reached critical mass; that is, enough infrastructure has been built and sufficient housing, factories, offices and leisure facilities constructed for the town to be self-sustaining. In theory, there should be no need for vast sums of new public money to be spent. What will have been achieved when Telford Development Corporation is wound up in September? Roads, utilities and major public services will all be in place. There is a wide range of leisure facilities, including an ice rink, indoor tennis centre, three purpose-built sports centres, three swimming pools, four golf courses within a three mile (5km) radius and a multi-screen cinema. The town is connected to the main link rail link to London's King's Cross. It adjacent to the M54 motorway and there are anumber of good hotels. More than 1.4m sq m of factory floorspace had been constructed by last year and more than 142,182 sq m of office accommodation put up. In addition, there is 187,924 sq m of retail floorspace. Around 45,053 houses will have been built during the lifetime of the corporation, some 14,668 of them by the public sector. For all intents and purposes this means the development corporation. Since 1968, the development corporation reckons it has built 11,700 houses. During the lifetime of the corporation, the population has grown from 74,000 to 120,000 and, on the basis of what has been built, Telford seems a well-rounded town where people can live, work, play and shop. Where does it go from here, in terms of the availability and cost of shops, offices, houses and land? Telford's new town corporation has divested itself of most of its assets before realisation. A recent example is the sale of the entire town centre shopping complex, an area of 750,000 sq ft, to Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), for Pounds 100m. Many of the houses that the development corporation built for rent have been sold off to tenants under the government's right-to-buy scheme. Indeed, the development corporation reckons it has been more successful than any public body under the right-to-buy scheme. Of the 11,700 houses built for rent, only 4,000 remain in tenants' hands. The local Wrekin District Council would like to take them over because of the rents. But the decision is up to the tenants themselves, who will be balloted on whether they want to be taken over by the council or local housing associations or whether they want to buy. Almost all of the factories built by the corporation or constructed on its land have been sold. Mr Chris MacKrell, the current commercial director at the TDC who will become executive officer for the Commission for New Towns in September, estimates that at wind-up, the TDC will have between 500,000 sq ft and 750,000 sq ft of built factory space to dispose of, along with some 2,000 acres of land, most of it serviced. The exact amount of factory space is not known because the corporation is negotiating with the local council over the transfer of community related assets. These include, for example, some 1,000 acres of parkland. The corporation cannot simply transfer those assets without the means to maintain them. This usually involves setting up endowments. The endowments, in turn, are usually funded by income from other corporation assets such as factories and offices. The most likely outcome is that the amount of industrial space the corporation will have to dispose of will be at the bottom end of its estimates, that is around 500,000 sq ft. Considering that more than 15m sq ft of factory space was built on corporation-owned land, this is not a great deal left to sell off. The recession has hit Telford like many other places. But Mr MacKrell is sanguine that the outstanding industrial properties will move once the climate improves. He also believes there will be demand for the land. It is reasonably priced. At something like Pounds 140,000 an acre before the recession, it was very competitive with land in the West Midlands. The population of Telford is predicted to rise to 128,000 by 1995. Interest from overseas companies continues to be strong (there are more than 115 in Telford). Factory space is predicted to rise from the current 1.4m sq m to 1.8m sq mby 1995. The corporation does not have any commercial property availability of privately developed commercial premises - particularly B1 properties in Telford, both in the enterprise zone and elsewhere. Moreover, although the market is sluggish, developments are going ahead. The Thoroughbred Property group is offering its flagship Pegasus Court development, which is 73,000 sq ft in its first phase. This is a mixed development of commercial, light industrial and warehousing in the enterprise zone. Most of the 270 acres of the enterprise zone have now been developed, although there is a little land left. The advantage of the EZ is that no rates are payable until 1994. The Thoroughbred group is also developing Landau Court, on the edge of Wellington town centre. Mountleigh Northern Developments, in association with the Brighouse Group, is proceeding with an office development on the Stafford Court Business Park, a 73,000 sq ft scheme with the 36,000 sq ft headquarters building, Hollinswood House, as its centrepiece. Rents in Telford range from Pounds 8.50 to Pounds 15 per sq ft. An average is Pounds 11.50 per sq ft, even in the enterprise zone. In all, it is thought that some 250,000 sq ft of office accommodation, both in and out of the enterprise zone, either is or will be available. The recession has had its effects on retail property. But when a property became available in the town centre complex recently it went for Pounds 110 per sq ft for zone A, which suggests prices are holding up. This shopping centre is now almost fully let, with retailers such as Marks and Spencers, Debenhams, C&amp;A and Boots. House building has slowed down in the past year, although it has been predicted that Telford will need a further 5,000 homes by 1995. The local district council estimates that there will be a need for more rented accommodation. Prices are notional at the moment, but for a new town, Telford has a surprisingly wide range of houses on offer. They start at Pounds 40,000 for a two bedroom semi-detached house, rising to Pounds 170,000 for an 'executive-style' home.</p>

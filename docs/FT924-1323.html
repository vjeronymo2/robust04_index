			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: First Technology rises sharply to Pounds 807,000 FIRST TECHNOLOGY, the car safety business which makes crash test dummies, continued to lift profits after the reorganisation of its balance sheet earlier this year. Mr Fred Westlake, chairman, said the group hoped to return to the dividend list with a final payment for the current year. For the six months to end-October pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 83,000 to Pounds 807,000 on sales down 29 per cent at Pounds 11.4m The interest charge dropped from Pounds 425,000 to Pounds 181,000 as gearing fell from 150 per cent to about 100 per cent. The group expects this to fall to 85 per cent by the year-end, depending on the exchange rate of the dollar. Mr Westlake said there were signs that the fall in car sales in Europe had flattened out while in the US, the big three car makers were reporting a return of sales growth. 'Future trading prospects are bright and the improvement in profitability should continue,' he said. In both the sensors and dummies businesses, the group was winning new business from existing customers, Mr Westlake said. First Technology has recently won orders to supply to General Motors a new accelerometer, a device that will help Cadillac's suspension system create a smoother ride. Fiat also said recently it would fit First Technology's fuel cut-off switches to its new model, code-named the Tipo B, and Honda would be fitting the device to the new Accord at its Swindon plant. Earnings per share were 4.2p (0.3p losses). COMMENT Chastened after its unsuccessful trip down acquisition lane, First Technology appears to be back on track in a much slimmed-down version. The four-fold increase in the share price since the company nearly collapsed might suggest the recovery story is over. But First Technology's particular niche in sensors appears to be growing with big orders coming through from Fiat, General Motors and Honda. And with more focused marketing, the dummies business, which has been held back by recession, should make a greater contribution. Shareholders have had a rough ride since the shares hit 500p in 1990 and may yet have to participate in a strengthening of the balance sheet. But they should now be sanguine that future growth will be sought from new customers and new products rather than from acquisitions. Pre-tax profits are likely to be Pounds 1.7m this year, giving 8.4p of earnings, and a prospective multiple of 12 that is still undemanding.</p>

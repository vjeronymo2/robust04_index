			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AETNA ENDS POLICIES IN 2 STATES  </P> <P> Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. is dropping personal auto and homeowners'  insurance in New Mexico and Idaho, saying the business is unprofitable with  little hope for much improvement.  </P> <P> Aetna stopped selling new auto and homeowners' policies in New Mexico and Idaho  Nov. 2. Starting in February, the company will not renew policies in New  Mexico; in March it will not renew them in Idaho.  </P> <P> The decision is the latest move by Aetna to improve dreary financial results in  personal insurance lines nationwide.  </P> <P> Aetna has also stopped writing new personal auto policies in Rhode Island, and  is challenging laws in Massachusetts that make it very expensive for the  company to withdraw from auto insurance there.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN WOMEN SWIMMERS PRIMED FOR TITLE DEFENSE  </P> <P> Pete Accardy gambles on stocks and race horses. But when it comes to his job,  the Cal State Northridge swim coach covers his bets as often as possible.  </P> <P> That is especially true when the stakes are as high as they are at the NCAA  Division II swimming and diving national championships, which begin today and  run through Saturday at State University of New York at Buffalo.  </P> <P> The 13-member Northridge women's team is bidding for its third consecutive  title and Accardy would appear to be playing with a stacked deck.  </P> <P> "We have somebody we feel can make the finals in every race," Accardy said.  "They're all swimming as well as ever."  </P> <P> But Northridge will be hard-pressed to match its dominating performance of a  year ago when it outscored second-place Tampa, 441-285, to win its third  national championship since 1982.  </P> <P> "People have been saying that this is the best women's team ever assembled,"  Accardy said after last year's meet. "I'd have to agree with them."  </P> <P> However, that distinction may be passed to this year's squad.  </P> <P> Last season's team broke six NCAA records and 15 school standards; those totals  could be approached again. And of the six CSUN swimmers who set records in last  year's meet, backstroke specialist Chris Breedy is the only one not competing  here this week.  </P> <P> Tina Schnare, a senior in the breaststroke, has a perfect record at national  meets. Schnare has won titles in both the 100- and 200-yard events each of the  past three years. Accardy is predicting that she will conclude her Northridge  career the way she started it -- by breaking Division II records in both  events.  </P> <P> "She has trained harder than she has since her freshman year," Accardy said of  Schnare. "She's primed."  </P> <P> Along with Schnare, other Northridge swimmers expected to challenge for titles  are Toady Kimble and Jude Kylander (freestyle sprints), Carol Eisele and Lisa  Dial (medley), Jeanna Giessinger (middle-distance freestyle) and Michele Sulak  (freestyle and butterfly).  </P> <P> The Northridge men's team has set a less optimistic goal for the week. The  Matadors, who won nine national championships from 1975-85, will try to avoid  dropping out of the top 10 for the first time in Accardy's 19 seasons as coach.  </P> <P> Cal State Bakersfield is expected to win its fourth consecutive men's team  championship. The CSUN men had visions of a national championship of their own  until nine team members were declared academically ineligible at midseason.  </P> <P> Among Northridge's six qualifiers is Ted Hollahan, defending champion and  Division II record-holder in the 100- and 200-yard freestyles.  </P> <P> CSUN's Rick Giambastini, a transfer from University of the Pacific, is among  the favorites in the 200-yard butterfly.  </P></p>

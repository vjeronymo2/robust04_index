			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HULK STEPS INTO RING IN 'HOLDS'  </P> <P> Pro wrestling phenomenon Hulk Hogan is the main attraction of the garish,  sub-"Rocky" action-satire, "No Holds Barred" (citywide), and he has a peculiar  Jekyll-Hyde persona during the movie. Outside the ring, he's quiet, gentlemanly  and deferential. While wrestling, his face becomes distorted and maniacal: eyes  bulging, neck muscles taut, mouth stretched into a silent but leonine scream.  </P> <P> It's the beast unleashed, the hulk unbuckled. The movie itself is about the war  of nerves between a gentle but heroic wrestler and a raving madman who runs a  national TV network. And, if you've labored under the delusion all these years  that there was something phony about TV wrestling, "No Holds Barred" will set  you straight. In the film's world, every ludicrous chokehold, every laughable  belly-flop, every preposterous rope-slam is totally legitimate.  </P> <P> Instead, it's TV that's phony. Here, it's run by greedy, dangerous lunatics and  sniveling toadies who, in the pursuit of higher ratings, will stop at nothing:  including prostitution, murder or screaming and hollering until their faces  turn blue.  </P> <P> Hogan plays Rip, good-natured wrestling superstar and benign blond behemoth;  the movie's ingenuity has not extended to finding him a last name (Rip Rogan?  Rip Roxoff?). Kurt Fuller plays his demented nemesis: the unspeakable network  executive Tom Brell.  </P> <P> Brell first tries to woo soft-spoken Rip to his lineup with the gentle approach  (for him): waving money in his face, shoving and pummeling him. When these  restrained tactics fail, Brell turns to kidnaping, extortion, assault and  attempted murder. He enlists the services of a homicidal maniac named Zeus  (Tiny Lister) who challenges the champ to a match with no rules. Zeus also  beats Rip's brother to a bloody pulp. (Lest critics accuse the movie of veiled  racism -- Zeus is black -- other blacks are always included, hiding behind Rip  or cheering him on at fights, whenever Zeus appears.)  </P> <P> Obviously Brell is not rational. There must be easier ways to win good ratings  than this. But Rip and his friends are irrational too; they never call the  police to complain that a maniac is threatening them and committing violent  crimes. Instead, Rip fights it out as he always has: alone, indomitable, in the  ring, mano-a-mano. Will he win? Will he smash, bash and thrash the obstreperous  Zeus? Will he rescue the lissome Samantha (Joan Severance)? Will his little  brother walk again? Will the vile Brell get his comeuppance? Will the sun rise  tomorrow?  </P> <P> "No Holds Barred" gets no points for originality. It's written with the  subtlety of a body-slam and directed with the finesse of a hammerlock. But the  movie never takes itself seriously and director Tom Wright (TV's "Beauty and  the Beast") has fun with the wrestling montages. Hogan himself has an appealing  screen presence -- like a gallant teddy bear who goes berserk every 10 minutes  or so. Kurt Fuller, last seen gibbering insanely in "Miracle Mile," comes up  with the kind of congenitally sneering, wild-man bully who might have harassed  Abbott and Costello.  </P> <P> And if you still think TV wrestling is mostly phony, consider this: "No Holds  Barred" was produced by Shane Productions, which is, according to the press  book, run by the "executive brain trust" behind the World Wrestling Foundation  of which Hulk Hogan is currently world champion. What group would know better  whether pro wrestling is just a big show?  </P> <P> 'NO HOLDS BARRED'  </P> <P> A New Line Cinema presentation of a Shane Productions production. Producer  Michael Rachmil. Director Thomas J. Wright. Script Dennis Hackin. Music Jim  Johnston. Editor Tom Pryor. Production design James Shanahan. Associate  producer Michael McDonnell. With Hulk Hogan, Kurt Fuller, Joan Severance, Tiny  Lister.  </P> <P> Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.  </P> <P> MPAA rating: PG-13 (parents are strongly cautioned; some material may be  inappropriate for children under 13).  </P></p>

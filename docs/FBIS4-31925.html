			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jolanta Adamiec: "A Difficult Wooing: The </F> Cooperation Between Poland and the European Union"]    [Text]  <H8>  Foundations of Cooperation </H8>   Since 1 November 1993, a new and extremely important entity,  the European Union, has appeared on the European scene. This  does not mean, however, that it is an entirely unknown organism.  On the contrary, as a fruit of the continuing development and  evolution of the European Community, it had long been expected,  not just by its member countries but also by all partners. As  such, it also is taking over all of the obligations of its  predecessor, including those concerning our country.    Poland is linked as an associate member to the EC by the  European Treaty, which was signed on 16 December 1991. An  agreement of this kind must be ratified by the parliaments of  all of the member countries of the EC, the European Parliament,  and the parliament of the concerned country. Poland ratified  that agreement as early as in June 1992, but its ratification by  the other countries took much longer. In effect, the agreement  as a whole became effective as late as on 1 February 1994.  However, its commercial part [the so-called Interim Trade  Agreement] had already taken effect on 1 March 1992, and that  made it possible to implement concessions [by the EC],  presupposing the establishment, within 10 years, of a zone of  free trade in manufactured goods.    The turning point in the relations between Poland and the EC  occurred in 1988 upon the signing of the so-called Joint  EEC-CEMA Declaration, which afforded the possibility of  negotiating and concluding specific bilateral agreements between  the Community and discrete countries of Central-East Europe.    In practice, since 1973, when the EEC adopted the principles  of a joint trade policy, that possibility had not yet existed;  all economic agreements had to be negotiated with the Community  as a whole rather than with its individual member countries, but  the CEMA countries refused to acknowledge the supranational  powers of the EEC on this issue and, pointing to the imbalance  between the negotiating parties, demanded bilateral agreements.  At the same time, direct negotiations between the EEC and CEMA  were impossible because the statute of CEMA did not authorize it  to act on behalf of its member countries.    Owing to the East-West detente, one of whose fruits was the  signing of the aforementioned "Joint Declaration," that impasse  could be broken, and, on 19 September 1989, Poland signed its  first major agreement with the EC concerning trade and economic  cooperation and, soon afterward, the association agreement  ["European Treaty"] as well. The latter confers on  Polish-Community relations a totally new quality, such that,  within a short period of time, the status of our country changed  from that of the virtual absence of agreements to one that is  much more favorable than that of many other EC partners. It also  is a vital factor in the whole of the changes taking place in  our country; it stabilizes the direction and course of our  economic reforms by placing them in the context of the entire  West European system.    The range of the issues covered by the European Treaty  extends from political dialogue (Articles 2-5) through trade  (Articles 7-36), migration of labor (Articles 37-43),  establishment of companies (Articles 44-54), exchange of  services (Articles 55-57), movement of capital (Articles 59-70),  competition (Articles 63-67), to coordination of legal systems  (Articles 68-70) and economic (Articles 71-94), cultural  (Article 95), and financial (Articles 96-101) cooperation.  Although the very fact of the signing of such a far-reaching  treaty is advantageous to Poland, not all of the barriers to  mutual relations could be overcome. Most of these barriers  pertain to trade relations, and they can by now be more  concretely identified after the nearly two-year-long  implementation of the Interim Trade Treaty. As for the other  barriers contained in the remaining parts of the European  Treaty, these concern chiefly migration of labor and financial  assistance.    Regarding migration of labor, it was merely settled that  Polish citizens who are legally employed on EEC territory will  be treated like the citizens of the host country. Unfortunately,  it was not possible to incorporate provisions legalizing the  employment of other categories of Polish citizens residing in  the member countries of the Community and sanctioning an  additional quota for Polish employees. Yet, precisely such  provisions would be most advantageous to the Polish side, given  the current rising unemployment and the attendant social  tensions. Another disputed issue was the financial protocol.  Unlike in the case of association agreements with Greece and  Turkey, in Poland's case, the agreement merely refers to the  statutory provisions of PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for  Poland and Hungary] and the European Investment Bank [EIB]. But  the EIB offers loans solely on market terms rather than  financial assistance in the close meaning of the term, while  PHARE is intended to provide consulting and technical rather  than financial assistance.    All of this reflects conflicting signals from the member  countries of the Community. Their verbal support for the reforms  in Poland and other countries of Central-East Europe is very  strong, but, when it comes to particular decisions entailing  specific expenses to their own economies, their attitude becomes  quite detached. What is more, as the EU matures, the rise of new  barriers relating to a common foreign policy, security policy,  and trade policy is conceivable. These barriers may prove to be  particularly detrimental to our aspirations for membership in  the EU.  <H8>  The Interim Trade Agreement </H8>   The Interim Trade Agreement--that is, the trade part of the  Association Treaty--introduces two basic distinctions. First, it  treats differently manufactured goods and farm commodities, and,  second, it introduces differing timetables for the abolition of  [trade] barriers by Poland and by the Community. The former  distinction was dictated by the specific conditions of the  commodity market of the EC, while the latter, termed "the  asymmetry principle," means that the EC began to abolish import  barriers earlier and more rapidly than did the Polish side, this  being intended to give us time to adapt ourselves to the  conditions of trade on the international market.    As regards manufactured goods, the EC abolished the duties  on  50 percent of our exports on the effective date of the  agreement. The pace of the reduction of duties on other goods  varies for discrete groups of merchandise, as specified in  detail in the Appendixes to the Treaty, which classify specific  articles according to Integrated Nomenclature (NC). As regards  farm products, total liberalization of trade is generally not  envisaged; all merchandise was divided into six groups, each  with a different timetable for the reduction of duties and  countervailing fees as well as for increases in the fee-exempt  quotas. In every case, however, a major limitation is the  so-called protective clauses, which provide for restrictions in  the event of, among other things, dumping, problems with balance  of payments, abuse of monopoly practices, or broad fluctuations  on the markets for particular products (farm, textile, steel).    Viewed in a broader context, it turns out that the  concessions granted by the Community are rather limited. Here at  least three factors should be taken into consideration:    --Share in aggregate exports: The longest-lasting and most  restricted timetable of liberalization was adopted for goods in  which Poland at present relatively excels (so-called sensitive  goods) and whose free market access would yield maximum  advantages; these goods account for nearly 23 percent of Polish  exports to the EC, or, if allowance is made for textiles and  steel, about 44 percent.    --Existing level of protection: The attendant extended  process of abolition of barriers applies chiefly to the goods  for which the extent of protection was the highest in the past  as well. This means that trade liberalization applies primarily  to the domains in which anyhow in the past, too, market access  had been relatively easy.    --Possibilities for production: The industries manufacturing  so-called sensitive goods, which are most affected by the  recession, have both the largest inventories and the highest  spare productive capacity, and they are capable of rapidly  responding to increased export possibilities.    Thus, in practice, in the sectors in which the extent of  protection is the highest and the possibilities for higher  output and profitable exports are the greatest, the EC is  eliminating its barriers most slowly. This also applies to trade  in farm commodities, for which the treaty generally does not  envisage the establishment of a free-trade zone and which not  only account for 20 percent of Poland's aggregate exports to the  Community but also concern goods whose production cost is  relatively low and that are, comparatively speaking, quite  profitable.    A disturbing element is the increasingly frequent problems  raised by the utilization of protective clauses by individual  member countries of the Community attempting to protect  themselves against higher imports from Poland. This concerns, in  particular, the subsectors currently experiencing major  structural problems, such as the steel industry and farming.  Most often, Polish exporters are being accused of dumping, the  more so considering that, often in this country, the domestic  prices of some or other products are not treated as real market  prices. Our farm exports are being restricted under various  pretexts.    It appears, however, that the Commission of the Communities  is aware of the rising protectionism and, in practice, low  extent of the concessions granted in the association agreement.  The Copenhagen Summit (21-22 June 1993) became yet another  attempt to meet the expectations of the Central-East European  countries. Five of the decisions adopted at that summit are  especially noteworthy, as viewed from our standpoint:    --[Full] membership of the associated countries in the EC  was  defined as a common objective of both sides.    --A fuller incorporation of the associated countries in the  institutional structures of the EC was envisaged.    --The liberalization of imports by the EC will be  accelerated.    --Part of PHARE funds will be allocated for direct  infrastructural investments.    --The possibility of including the associated countries in  some Community programs will be afforded.    This appears to be laying a solid foundation for the growth  of further cooperation; however, the reality may prove different  from the Copenhagen declarations. The broadening of economic  ties is being impeded by the deep crisis in the world economy.  Unexpected problems may also arise owing to the transformations  occurring within the EU itself.[.sup]1[/]  <H8>  Effects of Changes in the Foreign Policy of the EU </H8>   Poland's attempts to establish closer cooperation with (up  to  and including [full] membership in) the EU coincide with the  marked advancement of the integration of West Europe (within the  framework of the Union and between the Union and the EFTA  [European Free Trade Association]). This markedly complicates  achieving our goal because we have to adapt ourselves to an  organism that is not only incomparably more highly developed but  also rapidly evolving. The related nascent problems may be  exemplified by two aspects of the Union's growth: a common  foreign and security policy and a common trade policy.  <H5>  Common Foreign and Security Policy </H5>   Attempts to coordinate foreign policy have been under way  since the EEC was first established. The Maastricht Treaty has  brought considerable order into it, even if it also, as a result  of far-reaching compromises, is couched in rather vague language  open to diverse interpretations. Two major provisions of that  treaty allow for the possibility of adopting decisions by a  qualified majority of votes (Article J.3) and open the road for  a common defense policy (Article J.4). Currently, the West  European Union is charged with the responsibility for  coordinating the defense system, though upon making allowances  for the NATO obligations of certain of the Union's member  countries.    To Central-East Europe, a more integrated Community with a  common policy on a broader range of political and economic  issues means primarily an organism that is more closed to third  countries. A common foreign and security policy engenders two  principal groups of barriers:    --Fear of domination by the larger and more highly developed  countries of the Community; after 40 years of domination by  Moscow, the countries of Central-East Europe are particularly  sensitive about pursuing an independent foreign policy of their  own.    --Lack of experience, and especially of discipline, in  cooperating with other countries and coordinating foreign and  security policy. As exemplified by the member countries of the  EC themselves, even after 20 years of attempts to attain this  kind of cooperation, that is no easy matter.    Neither Poland nor the other postsocialist countries can  cope  with these barriers. This process also requires involvement by  the EC and a gradual preparation of eventual candidates for  inclusion in all aspects of a common policy. A common foreign  and security policy may prove a particularly valuable domain for  gaining experience because here the form and scope and  cooperation are defined only on the basis of a consensus of all  of the member countries.  <H5>  Foreign Economic Policy </H5>   A point of departure for a common policy on foreign economic  relations is the Treaty of Rome, which mentions, among the  principal instruments of the EC, a common system of external  tariffs and a common trade policy (Article 3). Along with the  Uniform European Act, the EC extended coordination to other  domains of economic cooperation. The Maastricht Treaty thus  introduced no radical changes in this respect, merely confirming  (Article 3) that the EC's activities include, among other  things, a common trade policy and an internal market  characterized by a free flow of goods, people, services, and  capital.    The provisions of the Uniform Act, while pertaining  exclusively to internal liberalization and formally not  referring to foreign relations, are not irrelevant to the EC's  partners. At least three aspects of the EC's new policy will be  directly related to these provisions:    --Allocation of EC quotas: To be sure, the EC does not  intend  to extend national quotas to the entire territory of the  Community; rather, it intends to eliminate these quotas by using  various forms of compensation during the transition period.  Nevertheless, this may initially result in tighter protectionism:    --Protective measures: Previously employed individually by  the various countries pursuant to Article 115 of the Treaty of  Rome, upon merely notifying the Commission; under the Maastricht  Treaty, they will now be subject to total control by the  Commission and contingent on its prior approval.    --Trade in goods not included in the rules of the Common  Market: Under Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, defense goods  were excluded from free trade, and a detailed list of such  merchandise was agreed upon in 1950 and, in connection with the  creation of the Common Market, has to be not only updated but  also downsized.    Unlike in the case of the EC's common foreign and security  policy, any changes in its common economic policy will affect  Poland's situation both when that country joins the Community  and when it remains outside it. Of a certainty, the possibility  of inclusion in an area covered by a common protection system is  more favorable to producers, but, on the other hand, the  discrepancies in the economic systems and development levels of  the EC and Poland are so marked that opening the domestic market  to competition may cause unimaginable damage to the enterprises  that still operate according to the principles of a planned  economy. The aforementioned extension of national quotas to the  entire area of the EC and the restrictions on the employment of  protective measures require a long preparatory period even in  the case of the weaker members of the Community. Major problems  may also arise in connection with such issues as:    --The requirements posed by the standards and technical  norms  of the EC.    --The still predominant share of the state-owned sector in  manufacturing [in Poland].    --Adaptations of the financial and tax system.    --Liberalization of the service sector.    These are only representative and most important groups of  problems, but even they alone demonstrate the magnitude of the  technological, organizational, and--most important--financial  efforts that will have to be undertaken in the event that any of  the countries of Central-East Europe join the EU.  <H8>  Prospects and Challenges </H8>   As can be seen, cooperation with the EU is not problem-free.  What is more, as this cooperation grows, not only the problems  but also its cost will increase. But this does not mean that  Poland should abandon the ambition of becoming an associate and  later full member of the Union because then the cost to this  country would be still higher. But everything should be done in  order to completely exploit the opportunities and possibilities  being afforded by the new situation in Europe, and also to get  prepared, through the joint effort of both sides, for eventual  problems and to try and reduce them to a minimum    In the case of the member countries of the Communities, this  requires chiefly overcoming the stereotyped idea of a conflict  between "broadening" (accepting new members) and "deepening" (  developing new domains and forms of mutual cooperation).  According to this stereotype, any tightening of ties between the  Union and the Central-East European countries can be considered  only after the process of building the Union is completed. Yet,  opposing these two concepts in itself already is fallacious  because they are not mutually exclusive and, even more, they  cannot run their course independently of one another. Any change  in EC policies, if it is to be lasting, should by now make  allowance for the needs and possibilities of potential new  members. This is particularly essential in the case of the  countries of the former Soviet bloc, which in every respect  remain separated from the EC by an abyss they cannot bridge on  their own.    Besides, paying attention to Central-East Europe does not  mean halting the development of the Communities. On the  contrary, any attempt to "put on hold" the lagging part of the  European Continent would be harmful to both sides. Thus, the  "deepening" of the EC could be enriched by taking a number of  specific measures enabling the countries of Central-East Europe  to smoothly join that process and, by the same token,  stabilizing and accelerating the reforms in these countries  themselves. Such measures may consist in, e.g.:    --Speeding up the implementation of the provisions of  association agreements (and, in particular, in this connection,  accelerating the liberalization of access of East European goods  to the EC market.    --Affording to the countries of Central-East Europe the  possibility of participating, at least in the capacity of  observers, in the shaping of Community regulations (so-called  acquis communautaire).    --Including associated members of the EC completely in the  domains of common policies, where this does not threaten the  unity of the Communities (e.g., environmental protection,  research programs, regional policy).    --Developing a concept of "gradual membership" that would  enable the Central-East European countries to be gradually  included in the formulation of common policies and, insofar as  possible, to participate in their implementation.    There is no precedent for any of these concepts in the  foreign relations of the EC so far, but the complexity of the  situation and the overall process of restructuring the shape of  the Communities require a new approach to the process of  European integration as a whole.    Much more difficult (and definitely more important) is  another aspect of this whole process--namely, the proper  formulation and consistent implementation of a Polish strategy  of development because, regardless of how good the conditions  afforded us by the EU may be, it will be up to us to utilize  them properly. This requires, above all, strategic thinking in  global terms and, thereupon, the adaptation thereto of our  current foreign and domestic policies.    Specific measures should be primarily taken to exploit the  opportunities already afforded by the Interim Trade Agreement  and especially by the three-year period of one-sided  liberalization of trade specified in that agreement. In this  case, the paramount requirement is an economic policy  stimulating improvements in the efficiency of our domestic  industry and a proexport orientation of production. A survey  conducted by E. Kawecka-Wyrzykowska indicates that, to 90  percent of the Polish enterprises that export their products  and/or deal in exports, the principal barriers are of a domestic  nature (debt, instability of tariff and tax regulations,  excessively high cost of investment, etc.).[.sup]2[/]    In addition to a rational program encompassing the whole of  domestic economic policy, a specific plan dealing directly with  the implementation of the treaty and regulating our current  contacts is also needed. The principal measures should include:    --Determining which institution is to be responsible for an  efficient flow of information among interested organizations;  this concerns information on the extent of the utilization of  the export quotas assigned to us, on the possibilities for the  legal protection of the domestic market and Polish producers  against excessive competition from the Communities, and on the  process of adaptation of the Polish legal system and the  prospects for scientific and cultural exchange.    --Efficient monitoring of the consequences of the treaty,  serving to formulate proper arguments and coordinate contacts  with the Communities. These contacts do not have to be top-level  alone because possibilities for tightening or renegotiating  certain provisions are also afforded to the Association Council  established under the agreement, and, similarly, the Joint  Commission of the Polish parliament and the European Parliament  can also act on its own initiative.    --Dissemination of the basic legal acts and documents  crucial  to cooperation with the EU at various levels, and popularization  of knowledge about the Union among the public.    But the coordination of all measures remains the fundamental  prerequisite. This means, on the one hand, coordination of the  process of adapting our economy, legal system, social policy,  etc. to the requirements posed by the European Treaty and, on  the other, coordination of the measures taken to restructure the  economy as a whole, in both its relations with the economies of  other countries and in purely domestic terms.

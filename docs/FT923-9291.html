			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: New head named at Saab Automobile SAAB Automobile, the car company jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse as chief executive. He will take up his position on September 1 in succession to Mr David Herman, who became chief executive at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, last month after two-and-a-half years running Saab Automobile from its formation in January 1990. Mr Butler-Wheelhouse, 46, is a British citizen. He worked for Ford in South Africa from 1965 and became the company's sales and marketing director in 1982. Three years later he moved to GM South Africa as director of technical operations. He was appointed managing director of Delta in November 1987 after GM sold its shareholding in the company. Mr Butler-Wheelhouse will have the difficult task of leading Saab Automobile into viability. Under Mr Herman, a comprehensive rationalisation programme was carried out in the company which brought a sharp decrease in its financial losses to SKr293m (Dollars 54.4m) for the first quarter of the year. It also doubled productivity performance as well as bringing about a sales upturn in the all-important and difficult US car market.</p>

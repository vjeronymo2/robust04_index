			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Belarus sweeps in new broom The victory in Belarus's first presidential election of Mr Alexander Lukashenko, an anti-corruption campaigner, threatens to aggravate the republic's economic woes if the new president sticks to his promise of fighting both corruption and market economics. Official results published yesterday gave Mr Lukashenko 80 per cent of the vote in a run-off against Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the conservative prime minister who had tried every trick in the book - including populist economic handouts and unabashed exploitation of the state-controlled media - to secure his own election. But Mr Lukashenko, a poorly-educated former collective farm boss who more recently headed parliament's anti-corruption commission, owes his surprise victory to his well-delivered message of 'finding simple solutions to complicated problems'. Victory was delivered to him on a plate by popular weariness with old-style Soviet-era leaders who failed to conduct any coherent market reforms in three years of independence. The failure to reform an economy dominated by obsolete industry has meant Belarus has suffered from industrial collapse, hyperinflation, shortages in the shops, and widespread corruption as the state has sought to maintain an increasingly ineffective grip on the economy. Mr Lukashenko, 39, has promised to root out corruption by starting from the top. 'This will end the problem at the lower level because people take their cue from the top,' he has said. He has vowed to restore socialist-style controls over the economy and also frightened the country's fledgling private sector with his promise to confiscate 'ill-gotten gains'. The main plank of Mr Kebich's programme to save the economy from 'catastrophe' was his plan for a monetary union with Russia - in effect turning Belarus into a Russian province. In an attempt to boost Mr Kebich's election chances after his poor showing in the first round of voting, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, even travelled to Minsk to confirm Russia still endorsed the draft union he cooked up with Mr Kebich last winter. During the election campaign, Mr Lukashenko, an unknown quantity in Moscow endorsed only by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist, had also supported the proposed union with Russia. He even suggested that the alliance be extended to the political sphere. On Sunday, however, he issued mixed signals on his plans for relations with Russia. 'Let us stop playing up the Russian card,' he said. 'Russia has its own interests, Belarus has its own.' Mr Lukashenko's victory can only reinforce Moscow's growing doubts about the benefits of a union already criticised within Russia as economically unprofitable for it. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, took a non-committal line on the results of elections in both Belarus and Ukraine while acknowledging the problems which have dogged the proposed monetary union with Minsk.</p>

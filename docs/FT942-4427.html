			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities turn higher following production data - Market Report A welcome return of institutional buyers for UK equities yesterday broke the log jam of poor trading volume which had kept share prices subdued in the two preceding sessions. A vigorous response to a strong rise in industrial production in April raised hopes that share prices are poised to 'growth in the economy, in company profits and in dividends', to quote one leading market strategist. The revival of optimism was also buttressed by assurances from Mr John Major, the prime minister, that any control of dividends has been firmly ruled out, thus removing one of the stock market's most significant causes for concern. However, polling for the European parliamentary elections takes place in the UK today, bringing the likelihood of a drubbing for Britain's Conservative party. The FT-SE Index closed 33.4 higher at 3,038.2, having touched 3,043.2 earlier. The advance was underlined by a return, for most of the session, to premiums in the Footsie stock index futures which have been at a discount for several sessions. Strength in UK government bonds, in spite of the strong production data, encouraged equities. Confidence spread across the full range of the stock market, lifting the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 23.2 points to 3,600.8. The market opened lower and it seemed at first that the Footsie 3,000 mark was about to be tested again. The abrupt upswing, in both equities and bonds, came following the news that April industrial production had risen by 1.6 per cent, for an annualised gain of 5.6 per cent; the UK Treasury later added that manufacturing output for the three months to April stood at a three year high. Confidence was further encouraged by good trading statements from among others, Meyer International and Northern Foods. The market made steady progress, showing a gain of 38.4 at its mid-session peak. Seaq volume was very thin in the first hour but gathered pace significantly during the session. The final volume total of 591.7m shares showed a gain of 10 per cent over the figure for the previous day. Traders were confident that the value of retail business, which will be disclosed today, will show improvement from the still dismal Pounds 936m recorded on Tuesday. 'A very positive day for equities,' commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, 'with clear signs that the market will now be driven by earnings and dividend growth.' At Kleinwort Benson Securities, Mr Edmond Warner said that Mr Major's assurance on dividend policy was 'very important. Probably worth 75 to 100 points on the Footsie'. Mr Major's comments were regarded as a significant committal to the City of London and to the financial markets. Criticism of dividend-paying policies at British companies has been a restraining factor on the stock market over the past month. Background factors across Europe were also favourable to equities. The modest reduction in money market repo rates in Germany was no surprise, but favourable comments from both French and German central bankers also helped sentiment. A slight softening in the US dollar at the close chastened London. The FT-SE Actuaries Committee yesterday announced that GKN will join the list of FT-SE 100 Index components with effect from June 20, replacing Tarmac.</p>

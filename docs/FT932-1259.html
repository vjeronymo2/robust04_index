			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sale proceeds behind surge to Pounds 289m at Charter Cons CHARTER Consolidated, which yesterday announced plans to buy out Minorco's 36 per cent stake in the industrial group, also reported an 11 per cent increase in annual operating profits from its existing businesses to Pounds 31.3m. Under FRS 3, pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 85.5m to Pounds 289.2m in the year to March 31, although they were distorted by the Pounds 218m profit on the sale of Johnson Matthey. Charter said: 'This improvement was creditable in a very difficult year when many of our competitors struggled to stand still.' The rail track equipment division increased its operating profits from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.5m on sales which expanded from Pounds 94.4m to Pounds 116.1m. The strongest performance came from the British fastenings business, which increased exports by 26 per cent. The group said the rail grinding and track maintenance market was recovering gradually as the US emerged from recession, but it had been a difficult year for the track maintenance division. Operating profits from building products and services rose from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 11.9m on sales which increased from Pounds 202.8m to Pounds 245.2m. Cape increased its overseas sales from 39 to 44 per cent, which helped compensate for the effects of recession in the UK. In mining equipment, operating profits increased from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 3.8m on sales up from Pounds 110.4m to Pounds 118m. In spite of difficult markets, Anderson had successfully developed its repair and rebuild capacity and had won a further two-year contract from British Coal, putting it in a stronger position to cope with its smaller domestic market for original equipment. National Mine Service's profits were flat despite a 28 per cent increase in turnover, as recession in the US cut the demand for coal. Operating profits from quarrying and mining were flat at Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 3m) in spite of an increase in sales from Pounds 54.9m to Pounds 58.4m. Underlying earnings per share, stripping out the impact of FRS 3, were flat at 42.5p. A final dividend of 15p gives a total for the year of 22p (21.5p).</p>

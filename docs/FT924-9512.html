			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Arts: Horror and farce in 'The Changeling' Thomas Middleton (1580-1627), official chronologer of the City of London, was the Hogarth of his time, mixing satire, tragedy and realism. The Changeling (1622) was one of six plays he wrote with the William Rowley (b. 1585). The Royal Shakespeare Company gave a traditional rendering of this muscle-bound play: predictable, careful and unmoving. This is a tragedy of irresponsible immaturity caught in its own consequences. The action, set in Alicante, feeds on excess. The heroine, Joanna, has an unwanted fiance and strong desires for another man, Alsemero; she enlists her ugly servant, De Flores, to murder the affianced, but at the price, she later discovers, of becoming the murderer's mistress. More deceit and murder follow, and De Flores takes Joanna's life before taking his own. A distant subplot, set in an asylum, echoes the main action. Within this bleak prospect, The Changeling offers scenes which can be played comically, and Michael Attenborough's thorough production balances the horror with the farce. On her wedding night, Joanna discovers in Alsemero's trunk a litmus test for virginity; she takes it in private, fails, tries it on her virginal maid, and learns to replicate the effects of a positive result. This scene is caught in a tightening net of deceit, the more disturbing because inapposite. The production's chief resources are Cheryl Campbell as the perjured, fickle Joanna, and Malcolm Storry as the opportune and ill-favoured De Flores. Together they register both the power of lust and the ease of deceit. Their central scene follows his murder of her fiance; as he explains what he has done, she begins to realise the extent of her involvement. While they barter money, lust and power, both emerge as changelings, capable of expediency and dispatch. The third changeling is a lover, Antonio (played with panache by David Westhead) from the subplot. He disguises himself as a fool in order to court the asylum-keeper's wife: 'I bring nought but love and his soft wounding shafts to strike you with.' The bedlam scenes are well policed by Geoffrey Freshwater and Paul Webster. Attenborough keeps the action moving, but finds neither character nor scene as a centre to the play, no quiet level where the imperatives of excess, appetite and deceit can bargain freely. This is partly Middleton's style, which offers no moral centre; but a clearer disposition of the characters on stage would sharpen the action to counteract Middleton's mixture of tedious discourse and sudden reality. The open set, period costumes and creative lighting have yet to cohere properly. But The Changeling remains a powerful play, probing the possibilities of personal change and the limits of reasonable deceit. It charts ordinary vices. Joanna's husband asks if she is honest: 'That's a broad question, my lord.' The Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon (0789 295623) until January 30</p>

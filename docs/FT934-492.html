			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Murdoch buys into Indian TV Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star Television has acquired a 49.9 per cent stake in Asia Today, the Bombay-based company which broadcasts Zee TV, a Hindi-language entertainment channel. The acquisition means two of Star's six television channels will be broadcast in a regional Asian language. It demonstrates the strategy of Mr Murdoch's News Corp, which owns 64 per cent of Star, to widen its choice for Asian viewers. Zee TV will continue to be operated by its current management team in Bombay, which generates all programming and advertising sales, and will maintain its 10-year output agreement with Zee Telefilms, a public company listed on the Bombay stock exchange. The purchase will boost Star's share of prime-time viewing in Indian cable homes to more than 50 per cent. Zee TV, transmitted by satellite, is seen in more than 7m homes, or 25 per cent of Indian households with television sets. The Hindi entertainment and current affairs programme channel has enjoyed growth of 400 per cent since its launch in October 1992. It also has viewers in the Gulf countries and in Pakistan. Zee TV plans to increase its hours of transmission gradually from 87 a week to a 24-hour schedule. 'The backing of News Corp will mean better and better programming,' said Mr Ashok Kurien, director of Zee.</p>

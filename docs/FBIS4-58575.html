			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with George Habash, secretary general </F> of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, by  correspondent Muhammad Bishkar "soon after the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli accord"; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Habash] It [the Palestinian-Israeli accord] fully  undermines the sacrifices and struggle of the Palestinian people  over more than 25 years. It undermines the right of the  Palestinian people to self-determination and the resolutions of  the national councils, even the UN resolutions that we do not  believe achieve all the Palestinian people's demands. This  accord has also given up on these resolutions.    Needless to say, the economic accord recently signed in  Paris  which places not only Palestine, but also the entire Arab region  and the Middle East [sentence incomplete as heard] and opens the  door to the Arab and Middle East region. This issue also  concerns you, I mean Iran. Why? Because this accord opens the  door to the entire Middle Eastern region.</p>

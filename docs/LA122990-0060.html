			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS HONOR TEACHER WITH ALMOST A CENTURY OF MEMORIES;  </P> <P> REUNION: MARY VAN DAM, 99, TAUGHT IN POWAY OVER A FIVE-DECADE SPAN AND AUTHORED  A BOOK, WHICH IS THE STORY OF HER LIFE AND POWAY'S HISTORY.  </P> <P> Arie DeJong arrived in Poway -- and in Mrs. van Dam's fourth- fifth-  sixth-grade classroom -- in 1949, speaking not one word of English.  </P> <P> For Mary van Dam, it was a challenge. She spoke no Dutch, and her husband spoke  only a few words of it. There were only about 400 or so inhabitants in the  Poway hills and valleys back then, and not one of them was "foreign" until  DeJong, his parents and his nine brothers and sisters arrived from Holland.  </P> <P> "People looked at us like we came from the moon," DeJong recalled recently.  "But not Mrs. van Dam.  </P> <P> "She took me and tutored me, after school and during class. All the time,"  DeJong said. "Pretty soon I was speaking pretty good English."  </P> <P> "Mrs. van Dam was a very good teacher," said DeJong, who now heads a family  that owns the Hollandia Dairy in San Marcos. "She changed my life."  </P> <P> His schoolboy crush has lasted more than 40 years.  </P> <P> In a recent interview, Mary van Dam shrugged off the memories of those 1940s  language lessons. They were just a few days in her 99 years of living.  </P> <P> "I've had a very commonplace life," she said. "There is nothing much to tell."  </P> <P> But Gordon Stuart, who wrote the preface to Mary van Dam's book -- "As I  Remember Poway" -- in 1983, thought differently. He wrote:  </P> <P> "As a rule, the people who make history do not write about it, and the people  who write about it do not make history. Mary is one of those rare individuals  who has done both!"  </P> <P> She wrote about her life in the early days of Poway and about the people that  she had known while growing up and going to school there. And she wrote about  the children she had taught in Poway's first elementary school and about her  friends and neighbors. She wrote about her life and those around her, and she  produced the first and only history of the place she holds in her heart.  </P> <P> Today, Mary van Dam's mind is clear as a bell as she sits in her tiny room in  an Escondido retirement home, autographing copies of the second printing of the  book, which is the story of her life as well as the history of Poway. It takes  only a little nudge to set it ringing with nearly a century of memories.  </P> <P> Mary Frank and her sister, Elsie, started their schooling in the one-room  Bernardo School (near what is now Lake Poway) late in the 19th Century, and  walked the 3 or 4 miles to class in all but the worst of weather.  </P> <P> "There were all grades from first to eighth, and the school day was from 9 a.m.  to 4 p.m.," she wrote in her autobiographical history book. "When I fell asleep  at my desk in the afternoon (I wasn't 6 years old yet), Miss Clay (the teacher)  would cover me with the apron she wore in the classroom."  </P> <P> In later grades, she recalled, she went to the larger (but still one-room)  Poway school across from where the old Community Church stands today.  </P> <P> "Inside there were rows of desks, graduated in size from front to back and  fastened to the floor. Some of them were double desks for the younger  children," she wrote. "There was a slightly raised platform in front with a  teacher's desk and also a pump organ. There were three tall windows on either  side of the room with blackboards in between.  </P> <P> "Also there was a blackboard on the wall in front and wall maps which could be  pulled down out of their cases; these were mounted above the blackboards. A  stand for the large dictionary and a school clock on the wall completed the  furnishings. A bucket of water and a long-handled dipper stood on a bench at  the rear of the room."  </P> <P> With her crystal-clear descriptions, Van Dam re-created those early Poway days,  describing how, when the school well went dry, the upper-grade boys earned 25  cents a barrel hauling water from a nearby farm and how, at her eighth-grade  graduation ceremonies, "we drove to the exercises in a two seated spring wagon  and we were late."  </P> <P> She was to have read the welcoming address and recalled her embarrassment at  having missed her cue because of the family's late arrival, and finally giving  her welcoming address midway through the ceremonies.  </P> <P> "Of course there was applause, but how embarrassed I was at being late. Things  might have been even worse though, for we found out later that a spot had been  burned in my ruffled graduation dress, evidently caused by a spark from my  father's pipe, which he smoked on our drive to the program."  </P> <P> After two years at San Diego State Normal School (now San Diego State  University), she received her teaching certificate "which was issued by the  County Board of Education at a cost of 2 dollars," and began teaching in 1912  in a one-room school near Del Mar where "enrollment was minimal and attendance  was irregular" before returning to her beloved Poway, where she taught at the  Merton School for three years, living at the family ranch and saving her money  to buy a Model T Ford.  </P> <P> That Ford took Mary Frank to Imperial County in 1916 to teach for $90 a month  and to meet her husband-to-be, Ed van Dam. But, after her marriage and a few  years of attempting farming in the arid valley, the Van Dams returned to Poway  to stay and raise their two sons.  </P> <P> Not until World War II, when the war industry lured most of the younger folk to  high-paying San Diego jobs and her own two sons were grown and away at school,  did Mary van Dam return to teaching.  </P> <P> "It was 1943, and the school board had advertised for a teacher and had  received not one application. So they came to me," she said. "I told them that  I wouldn't do it if I had to go back to school and renew my teaching  certificate. So they took me just as I was."  </P> <P> For 11 years until her retirement, Mary van Dam taught the middle grades at  Pomerado School, molding a new generation of Poway youngsters with the same  teachings that she had been taught a half century before.  </P> <P> She often started the school day with a prayer, which was legal at the time,  and usually read to her classes from the classics after lunch. But, most of the  time she spent on the basics, "reading, writing and arithmetic. The Three R's  are as important today as they were in my day," she said.  </P> <P> "I guess I am old-fashioned, but in my mind I can't go along with some of the  modern innovations. Now they teach the children to use computers, beginning  down in the primary grades. I think it's more important to teach them to read  first, save the other things for later. But then, as I say, I guess that I am  old-fashioned."  </P> <P> Those teaching years "were happy years. In fact, I could live my life over  again and be perfectly happy," she said, tears filling her eyes.  </P> <P> "I wish now that I had gone back into the classroom once in a while, since I  retired. Just to keep up, you know, not be so old-fashioned," she said.  </P> <P> Instead, she took up tutoring, prompted by worried parents whose son or  daughter was having trouble keeping up with classmates.  </P> <P> "I did quite a bit of that. I would tutor any child who would pay attention and  who wanted to learn," she explained. "I didn't do it for the money. I did it  for the children."  </P> <P> But, after her husband died in 1975, "and I found myself with too much time on  my hands," Van Dam turned from teacher to historian and wrote her book about  the valley that she loved. She described the dairy farms and the sights and  smells of the old country store. She told about courting in the horse-and-buggy  days. She described the terror of a runaway team of horses and the fear of a  smallpox epidemic. She painted graphic pictures of Poway of yesteryear with the  same meticulous concentration on detail that she stressed in her classroom.  </P> <P> The Poway Historical Society published Mary van Dam's history of the town in  1983 and, now in its second printing, it still sells well.  </P> <P> "It is the newcomers to town who are buying it. They all want to know what it  was like around here in the old days," she said of the book's continuing  popularity. "Poway is so different now. It's a city, and I can hardly find my  way around."  </P> <P> Until April, Mary van Dam lived alone in her Poway home until a small  "incident," a minor stroke, convinced her that her sons were right and she  should move into a place where she could take life a little easier. It was then  that her former pupils remembered her and decided to honor the teacher that had  set them properly on the road to adulthood more than 40 years before.  </P> <P> Arie DeJong, that Dutch boy whom she had taught to speak English so many years  ago, was the organizer, and the students of Mrs. van Dam's fourth- fifth-  sixth-grade classes at Pomerado School returned to Poway in September to give  her a 99th birthday party to remember.  </P> <P> "We were going to wait and do it on her 100th birthday, but then we thought,  'Why wait?' and we can do it again next year, too," DeJong said.  </P> <P> Most remarkable about the event to Mary van Dam was that a boy remembered her,  his grade school teacher, after all these years.  </P> <P> "I might have expected it from one of the girls, but, my goodness, it's quite  unusual for boys to remember," she said.  </P> <P> About 50 to 60 former students and current friends came to celebrate her  birthday with a church choir serenade, a party and presents, and finally a  barbecue.  </P> <P> "It was just grand to see them all again," she said. "It was just wonderful.  I've had a rich life, a teaching career, marriage, children and now  grandchildren and great-grandchildren."  </P> <P> Perhaps, she thinks, she'll write another book. There's half a century of her  life and Poway's still to be told. Her hand is still firm and steady, and,  "although I've never learned typewriting," she could still pen a few chapters  by hand as she did with her first story. Besides, she has a little time on her  hands before her 100th birthday party.  </P></p>

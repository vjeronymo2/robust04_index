			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Happier times for Peru's 'big gringo octopus' - Things are looking up at the country's foreign-owned mining giant AN AIR of cautious celebration pervades the Lima headquarters of Southern Peru Copper Corporation, the country's principal foreign investor and producer of two-thirds of all Peru's copper. Not only was last year's production of blister from its Ilo smelter a record, but a long-standing dispute with the government has amicably ended - and SPCC is about to embark on a Dollars 300m investment programme. 'We've now got our plate full with five new projects,' says Mr Charles Preble, the corporation's president, who has spent 26 years of his life with the company he jokingly calls 'the big gringo octopus'. Eight engineering companies are currently bidding for construction of two new electro-winning plants - the combined price tag is about USDollars 100m. The new plant at Cuajone, a copper porphyry deposit 650 miles south of Lima, which treats some 20m tonnes of ore annually, will come on stream in March next year. Nearby Toquepala's larger electro-winning project will take twice as long. Combined output from the two new plants will be close to 40,000 tonnes a year of cathode copper, increasing Peru's total production by about 9 per cent. Southern Peru, with annual sales around Dollars 650m, has made a 'firm commitment to the Peruvian government' to plough a further Dollars 100m into plant and equipment renewal over the next five years - well above average annual investment. The other projects, together making up the third Dollars 100m tranche, are broadly environmental: a small sewage treatment plant for the Ilo camp, a tailings disposal facility and a partial capture acid plant for the Ilo smelter, a continuing thorn in the flesh both for the corporation and for local inhabitants and farmers who regularly claim substantial compensation for damage to health and crops from smelter 'fall-out' gases. The problem with producing 155,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid annually at Ilo is that Peru's market is already saturated. Acid capture plants at the state-owned Cajamarquilla and Centromin refineries can produce 225,000 tonnes a year. They operate at about 72 per cent capacity and still sell only 80 per cent of output. 'This is a loss project all the way,' says Mr Preble, although he hopes to use some in Southern Peru's own projects, capture part of the local market and maybe sell abroad too. Despite the corporation's 35 long years of survival in what has been one of the most difficult countries for foreign investors, banks abroad are showing only 'guarded interest' in coming up with the Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m of outside financing required for the handful of projects. 'Conditions for investment have certainly improved,' says Mr Preble, 'but our impression is that banks won't move fast to finance new projects until the Paris Club and Peru's commercial debt is fully worked out.' Among the avalanche of recent liberalising legislation, Mr Preble particularly applauds freeing of remittances. Now that companies operating in Peru can hold bank accounts anywhere it the world, remitting profits is as simple as writing a cheque. 'And the Central Bank is no longer a player in the inflow and outflow of capital, as it is, for example, in Chile - that's enormously helpful.' Southern Peru needed a boost. Last year had started tough with the company posting a first quarter loss of Dollars 39m, mainly resulting from exceptionally high petroleum costs (the corporation requires substantial quantities of 'Residual 6' to generate electricity to operate the Cuajone and Toquepala mines), an emergency 10 per cent government levy on exports and labour costs that increased far faster than the dollar exchange rate. Most of that loss was recovered in the second half through strict austerity measures, permission for direct import of cheaper petroleum and personnel reductions where feasible. By year's end, the corporation's payroll had dropped by several hundred to 5,550 - and there have been no strikes for 18 months. 'We're still asking the accounts department daily whether we actually ended 1991 in profit,' says Mr Preble. Different accounting systems mean that US head office (SPCC is a branch) calculates around break-even, while 'according to the Peruvians we made money'. The 1.79m short tons (2,000 lb) of copper concentrates processed at Ilo last year - which included some purchased from state-owned mines Tintaya and Cerro Verde - produced a record 300,117 short tons of blister, 99.2 per cent pure. Two-thirds of this goes to state-owned Mineroperu's refinery also at Ilo to be made into 99.98 per cent pure copper cathodes. The rest is exported as blister, mainly for electrical use in Europe and the Far East. Southern Peru says it has no plans yet awhile to acquire and develop the large but low-grade Quellaveco copper deposit which lies between Cuajone and Toquepala. The corporation's two mines have proven reserves lasting well into the first decade of the 21st century, and the huge open pits, already more than 1,750 feet deep, may reveal more riches yet.</p>

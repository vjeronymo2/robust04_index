			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Gould refuses to concede fight for Labour leadership MR Bryan Gould, a candidate for the leadership and deputy leadership of the Labour party, insisted yesterday that he would not concede the contest to take over from Mr Neil Kinnock, even though he admitted that there was a danger of 'falling between two stools' in running for both posts. In a press conference to launch 'An Agenda for Change', as part of his rolling manifesto, Mr Gould criticised as 'somewhat undemocratic' claims from Mr John Smith's camp suggesting that the leadership contest was already over. Mr Smith's standing among the constituency parties was, he said, 'a matter of conjecture'. He warned that it was 'slightly disturbing' for Mr Robin Cook, Mr Smith's campaign manager, to claim that Mr Smith already had majority support in the contest when voting will not take place until mid July. Mr Gould said that the contest for the deputy leadership was more difficult to read than that for the top job. However, the perception seemed to be that Mrs Margaret Beckett was losing ground among Labour MPs and constituency parties, and might finish in third place. He was confident that he would win in a final ballot against Mrs Beckett or Mr John Prescott. Acknowledging that some people would not wish to vote for him for both posts, Mr Gould urged those who wanted him to be leader to carry that view through to the deputy leadership election as well. 'The real question is: do they want me in a leadership team?' he said yesterday. The paper launched by Mr Gould yesterday raised questions about the future of the party and what issues it should address. It warned that Labour was suffering from 'an identity crisis'. He pressed more strongly than before the need to move to a tax-benefit system as a way both of keeping the universality of benefits without extending means-testing or devoting too much to those who did not need it.</p>

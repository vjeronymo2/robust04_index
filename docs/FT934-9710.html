			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Union binds EC in all but name IT'S official. The Council of Ministers of the European Community (EC) reconstituted itself yesterday as the Council of the European Union (EU). But the 12 foreign ministers who took the decision each had two hats - EC and EU - and not all of them were wearing the same one at the moment they appeared to have made up their minds. Confusion about what the EC should call itself after the entry into force this month of the treaty on European Union signed at Maastricht in February 1992 will continue a good while yet, sowed in almost equal amounts by Euro-federalists (EU) and sticklers for national prerogatives who prefer loose, inter-governmental co-operation (EC - or less). Yesterday the 12 foreign ministers agreed that the Council of Ministers  - which decides EC policy, usually on the basis of proposals from the European Commission - should henceforth be a Union body. The Commission of the European Communities - the quasi-executive of the EC - will henceforth be known as the European Commission, quite helpfully really because that was what everybody knew it as anyway. The Council will become Union-ist, 'notably,' the decision said, 'within the framework of titles V and VI of the TUE' - to use the French acronym for the Treaty of European Union (which give or take an accent, is rather like the French word for 'dead'). Titles five and six of Maastricht cover the common foreign and security policy, and co-operation on justice and home affairs, both areas for inter-governmental co-operation outside the normal framework of Community business, to keep them safe from Brussels intrusion. The problem is that both kinds of business are conducted by the same people, at the same time, sitting around the same table, and invariably with the Commission present; hence the need to bring at least two hats, and the fastidiousness among some about the dress code. Thus the UK, which prides itself on the succintness of its insertions into EC/EU policy, yesterday more than doubled the verbosity of the 'Union decision'. It said: 'This change does not in any way alter the current legal position that the European Union does not enjoy any international legal personality. Nor does it affect the designation of the Parties to any international instrument having legal effects, which will be a matter to be decided case by case.' In the UK case, part of the objection to 'Union' has to do with the cost of changing everything from the headed notepaper to the brass plaques for its EC/EU delegations, one British official intimated. Few other delegations in Brussels seem in a desperate hurry to make the change either. The current Belgian presidency of the Union/Community is a clear exception. Even invitations to the summit last week - held before the entry into force of Maastricht - convened member states to a Council of the European Union. At the same meeting of foreign ministers in the Union-ist capital, devoted yesterday principally to the Uruguay Round trade negotiations, Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's chief trade negotiator, decided to fudge the theological question of the moment. 'I think I will just dispense with all (Euro) titles and give my name, hoping that people remember who I am.'</p>

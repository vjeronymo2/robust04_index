			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Portillo stresses fight against 'pernicious' inflation Mr Michael Portillo yesterday underlined the government's commitment to low inflation, arguing that stable prices helped mobilise investment and preserve the welfare state. The employment secretary said in a speech to the Conservative Political Centre group that maintaining low inflation assisted the government to mobilise private capital for infrastructure investment. He said that with high and unpredictable rates of inflation in much of the period since the second world war the provision of infrastructure had become a state monopoly. Low inflation was also essential to the government's aim of a 'modern and affordable welfare state'. Only with low inflation would people be encouraged to provide for their own retirement. In times of high inflation 'inevitably people look to the state to do more and provide larger pensions to compensate for the decline in value of their own schemes and their savings', he said. Although Mr Portillo's speech was low key compared with some of his other interventions at this year's conference, it nonetheless marked out his claim  -as a former Treasury minister - to have a say in determining government economic policy. Mr Portillo said inflation affected the government's management of the nation's finances. He noted that in the last Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, raised taxes by far less than the amount by which he reduced borrowing because low inflation enabled the government to keep a tight grip on its spending. Mr Portillo predicted that in future 'balanced budgets will be the order of the day, just as they were for governments in the 19th century'. Inflation, Mr Portillo said, was 'a pernicious form of hidden tax' that 'amounts to dishonest government'. Inflation in Britain had exerted a bad effect on industrial relations, savings, investment, resource allocation and on management. It had reduced efficiency and productivity and thus held back the growth of living standards. Expectations of inflation were the 'ugly sister' of inflation. In anticipation of inflation businesses pushed prices higher. Capital was diverted away from investment in productive projects into less risky assets such as gilt-edged stock. As a legacy of high inflation investors continued to demand high nominal returns even when inflation was low. Mr Portillo said the economies that Britain sought to emulate - notably Japan and Germany - did not tolerate inflation. He recalled that during the past 20 years there had been only two years when UK inflation was lower than Germany's. These were 1992 and 1993. 'We are determined this will not be a brief flash in the pan,' he said. The permanent defeat of inflation was 'at the top' of the government's political agenda.</p>

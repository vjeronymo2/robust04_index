			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b-(5). Periodically reviewing recombinant DNA research conducted at the institution to ensure compliance with the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b-(6). Adopting emergency plans covering accidental spills and personnel contamination resulting from recombinant DNA research.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Laboratory Safety Monograph describes basic elements for developing specific procedures dealing with major spills of potentially hazardous materials in the laboratory, including information and references about decontamination and emergency plans. The NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are available to provide consultation and direct assistance, if necessary, as posted in the Laboratory Safety Monograph. The institution shall cooperate with the state and local public health departments by reporting any significant research-related illness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or accident that may be hazardous to the public health.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b-(7). Reporting any significant problems with or violations of the NIH Guidelines and any significant research-related accidents or illnesses to the appropriate institutional official and NIH/ORDA within 30 days, unless the Institutional Biosafety Committee determines that a report has already been filed by the Principal Investigator. Reports to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b-(8). The Institutional Biosafety Committee may not authorize initiation of experiments which are not explicitly covered by the NIH Guidelines until NIH (with the advice of the RAC when required) establishes the containment requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b-(9). Performing such other functions as may be delegated to the Institutional Biosafety Committee under Section IV-B&hyph;2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV-B&hyph;3.

The institution shall appoint a Biological Safety Officer if it engages in large scale research or production activities involving viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;3-b. The institution shall appoint a Biological Safety Officer if it engages in recombinant DNA research at BL3 or BL4. The Biological Safety Officer shall be a member of the Institutional Biosafety Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;3-c. The Biological Safety Officer's duties include, but are not be limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;3-c-(1). Periodic inspections to ensure that laboratory standards are rigorously followed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;3-c-(2). Reporting to the Institutional Biosafety Committee and the institution any significant problems, violations of the NIH Guidelines, and any significant research-related accidents or illnesses of which the Biological Safety Officer becomes aware unless the Biological Safety Officer determines that a report has already been filed by the Principal Investigator;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;3-c-(3). Developing emergency plans for handling accidental spills and personnel contamination and investigating laboratory accidents involving recombinant DNA research;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;3-c-(4).

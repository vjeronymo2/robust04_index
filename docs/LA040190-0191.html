			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PENNSYLVANIA;  </P> <P> FUEL SLICK FLOATS IN ALLEGHENY RIVER  </P> <P> An 8-mile-long fuel slick caused by a landslide floated south down the  Allegheny River, threatening drinking water for tens of thousands.  </P> <P> Fumes from the spill forced the evacuation of 100 people. The Coast Guard used  booms to try to contain the spill. A 10-inch pipeline was cracked by the  landslide about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh near Freeport, Pa. About 75,000  gallons of "transmix" -- a combination of diesel fuel, gasoline and oil -- ran  into Knapp Run Creek and then into the river. Thousands of residents north of  Pittsburgh were told to conserve water because intake valves had been shut to  protect water supplies.  </P></p>

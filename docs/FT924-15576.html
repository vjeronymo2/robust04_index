			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Bachelor's complaint I AM a lifelong bachelor, aged 53, who has been working for the same American multinational company since 1964. On joining the company, I had to join the contributory pension scheme, which is contracted-out of Serps. It is a final salary scheme, and contributions are based solely on present salary. But I am concerned that the scheme discriminates against single employees in two ways: first, they do not have the right to (or need) a widow's pension; second, in calculating retiring pensionable pay on which benefits are based, the married basic state retirement pension is subtracted from pensionable earnings. This means, effectively, that the benefits per Pounds of contributions are worth less for single than for married employees. Is this kind of discrimination legal? If not, how should I go about seeking redress? I intend retiring in 4/5 years from now. We do not accept your contention that your pension scheme 'discriminates' against single people. The notion that any benefit provided by an employer for one employee which cannot be (or is not) provided for another somehow 'discriminates' is totally wrong-headed. Many schemes provide orphans' benefits and no one refers to them as 'discriminating' against employees without children. The objective of an employer with a good final paid pension plan is usually to ensure a guaranteed level of income replacement for employees who retire after reasonable periods of service, and also for spouses and other dependents. Marriage patterns are unpredictable. Many employees who have remained single throughout their careers have married only a few months before retirement, enabling this late marriage partner to qualify for the same post-retirement spouse's pension entitlement as if the employee had been married throughout his service. The employer might well fund his pension scheme on the assumption that virtually all employees will marry or have a dependant who will qualify for the equivalent of a spouse's pension. Furthermore, an increasing number of schemes now provide surviving spouse's pensions for post-retirement marriages. This pattern of pension provision has been, and is, treated normally as equitable. Arguments such as those which you advance about discrimination against bachelors tend to be treated as on a par with claims by bachelors and childless couples that they should pay lower taxes because they have no children to use the state education system. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Clinton leads from the front ANY GOVERNMENT may be more, or less, than the sum of its parts. But, more than most, the one that will be taking over in Washington on January 20 looks as if it will be especially dependent on the man who heads it, President-elect Bill Clinton. Notwithstanding an unseemly pre-Christmas rush of appointments, and the lack still of a White House staff, his team is an intriguing amalgam. It is made up of old hands and new, Washington veterans and novices, technocrats and thinkers. As promised, it contains more women and members of minority groups than any before it. It lacks a Republican, which Mr Clinton once said was possible, and its composition pretty much reflects the contemporary US Democratic party, with the conspicuous exception that the old bulwark, organised labour, is not directly represented. Foreign policy has been principally vested in the experienced hands of Mr Warren Christopher, as secretary of state, and Mr Anthony Lake, as national security adviser in the White House. Neither are turf conscious or power hungry and their relationship should be harmonious, as was the case in the Bush administration, but not in those of presidents Carter and Nixon. Negotiating skills The standard criticisms of Mr Christopher, though less of Mr Lake, is that he is not a conceptualist in the Kissinger mould and is too addicted to conventional diplomacy. Yet much the same was said of three of the more successful recent secretaries of state, Cyrus Vance, George Shultz and James Baker. The Cold War may have passed into history, but this, if anything, has increased the role of the US as the remaining superpower. If President-elect Clinton is willing to project American power on a wide variety of fronts, Mr Christopher's negotiating skills will be needed and tested. Intellectually, the security affairs combination of Mr Les Aspin at the defence department and Mr James Woolsey at the CIA looks formidable. Mr Aspin may be precisely the sort of man to direct the US military through a period of transition under which it must get by on less without sacrificing its capabilities and its technological advantages. He may be more interventionist than both Mr Christopher and his risk-averse service chiefs, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Wheeler-dealer The installation of Mr Leon Panetta and Dr Alice Rivlin to run the budget office may turn out to be the most significant of the economics appointments. Both are practically-minded deficit reduction hawks capable of keeping Mr Clinton's similar inclinations on track. Mr Lloyd Bentsen at the Treasury is a consummate wheeler-dealer without pronounced ideology who will need to exercise considerable authority if the much-maligned gridlock in Washington is to be broken. International economic policies may remain obscure for some time. Mr Bentsen's experience in this domain is limited and his positions on trade sometimes ambivalent. Mr Mickey Kantor, the new trade representative, was chosen for his political skills, not his expertise. Given the fierce rivalry for this position among trade ideologues and the considerable success in the job during the 1970s of another non-expert, Robert Strauss, it is not surprising that the president-elect preferred a neutral choice. Mr Clinton is also promising to change some of the ways in which government works. His new economic security council in the White House, under Mr Robert Rubin, is designed to give a voice at the policy table to some hitherto under-represented departments. Both Mr Robert Reich as secretary of labour and Mr Bruce Babbitt at Interior are men with a lot of ideas, on industrial retraining and the environment respectively, which at least deserve a full hearing. But in all this Mr Clinton's role is central. In picking a team better known for the diversity of its views than for any ideological coherence, he has set himself up, quite deliberately, as the active arbiter of the policies of his administration. His talent and appetite for the task should not be underestimated but nor should the immensity of the challenges he has taken on.</p>

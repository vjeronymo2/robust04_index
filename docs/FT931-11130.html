			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Electricity prices likely to fall HOPES that electricity prices may fall from April were increased yesterday when National Grid said the amount it charges for using the electricity transmission system would be pegged, Michael Smith writes. Although changes to the pricing structure mean grid charges to some consumers will rise, the company said users will on average pay no more. National Grid agreed to keep price rises to 3 percentage points below inflation after Mr Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, called for lower charges. The company said yesterday it had set charges for connection to and use of the grid at levels aimed at recovering about Pounds 12m less for 1993-94 than the maximum allowed under the price control.</p>

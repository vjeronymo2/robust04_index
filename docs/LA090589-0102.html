			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON COLLEGE FAVORED THIS YEAR;  </P> <P> RECORD-SETTING TAILBACK JEFF ANDREWS RETURNS FOR HORNETS  </P> <P> Fullerton College publicists like to say the Hornets "came out of nowhere" to  win the Mission Conference football title last season.  </P> <P> While some may contend last season's success was no surprise, any similar  accomplishment this season will surprise no one.  </P> <P> Fullerton is picked first in the conference poll, second in the state poll  behind Bakersfield and third in USA Today's national poll behind Bakersfield  and Northeast Oklahoma A&amp;M.  </P> <P> One of the main reasons for the high regard is Coach Hal Sherbeck and his  staff.  </P> <P> Sherbeck enters his 29th season as the winningest community college coach in  the nation. His career record is 220-61-8, and his Fullerton teams have also  won 16 conference championships.  </P> <P> Fullerton went 10-0 in the regular season and 9-0 in the Mission Conference,  regarded by many coaches as the toughest in the state. The Hornets lost the  national championship last December when Bakersfield scored a touchdown in the  final minute to win, 30-24, in the Potato Bowl.  </P> <P> This season's lofty expectations might seem a little out of line for a team  that has only six starters -- four on offense -- returning. But Sherbeck's  teams always seem to find ways to win and this season's edition has a big asset  in tailback Jeff Andrews.  </P> <P> Andrews was a redshirt in 1987, when Andrew Greer set the Fullerton  single-season rushing record with 1,119 yards. Andrews took the field last  season and shattered the record with ease, gaining 1,520 yards.  </P> <P> "I've worked hard with him all summer to make him a pretty good running back,"  Sherbeck said, joking. "We're happy to have him back. He makes you a pretty  good coach."  </P> <P> Andrews, from Diamond Bar High School, tied Ray Pallares with a team-high nine  touchdowns last season.  </P> <P> Starter Nick-John Haiduc and reserve Mike Thomas return at wide receiver.  Haiduc had 30 catches for 487 yards and three touchdowns, and Thomas had 13  catches for 227 yards and four touchdowns last season.  </P> <P> Sophomore David Chisum, an all-county player from Sunny Hills High, will get  the first shot at quarterback. Chisum completed three of eight passes for 21  yards last season at Fullerton, but Sherbeck sees qualities in him that are  encouraging.  </P> <P> "He doesn't look like a true passer," Sherbeck said. "But the thing I like  about him is that he's very intelligent, a very strong competitor. He just  makes things happen."  </P> <P> Two starting guards, Joe Hayes and Matt Nicolo also return.  </P> <P> Defensively, linebackers Mahe Liavaa and Keoni Manliguis return to give  Fullerton a powerful force against the run.  </P> <P> "These are two of the finest players you will find at linebacker in community  college football," Sherbeck said.  </P> <P> Kevin Capps and Dante Venturelli, who played but didn't start last season,  return at the defensive end position.  </P> <P> The secondary, always a Fullerton strong point under coach Al Feola, has four  sophomores back, including safety Orlando Robbins. Robbins had a team-high six  interceptions.  </P> <P> The one defensive question for Fullerton is the line, which was depleted by  graduation. Fullerton has six players ready, including sophomores Mitch Mier  and Ken Bell, but Sherbeck says they all lack "important game experience."  </P> <P> Wednesday: Golden West  </P></p>

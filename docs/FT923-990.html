			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Ford factories face deep cuts FORD announced yesterday that a total of 1,487 hourly paid jobs are to be cut throughout its UK plants. Car assembly plants at Dagenham, Essex, and Halewood, Merseyside, will be hit hardest by the cuts, but the workforces will also be reduced at engine plants at Dagenham, east London, and Bridgend in south Wales. The workforce at the Dagenham car plant, which produces the Fiesta small car, will be reduced by about 650, while 700 jobs will be cut at Halewood, which builds Escort and Orion small family cars. A further 90 jobs will be cut at the Dagenham engine plant and 47 at Bridgend. It is understood that Ford's salaried-staff unions were being told last night of a further cut of about 60 salaried jobs to be implemented by the end of the year. The new round of redundancies is in addition to the reduction of 2,100 jobs announced by Ford of Britain in February. Of this earlier redundancy package about 827 jobs remain to be shed before the end of the year. In parallel with the job reductions Ford is cutting its daily car output by 200 at Dagenham - from 1,200 at present - and by 250 at Halewood from about 1,100. These cuts are in addition to the short-time working announced earlier this week, which means the plants will effectively work a three-day week throughout October. Compulsory redundancies appear inevitable at Ford for the first time, although the company offered an alternative tough package to the trade unions including a six-month delay in pay increases to make the redundancies voluntary.

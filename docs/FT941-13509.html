			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Italian hotel chain to write down capital Ciga, Italy's luxury hotel chain, said yesterday it planned to write down its ordinary capital, from L150.79bn to L57.26bn (Dollars 33.76m), bringing the value of each ordinary share to about L379, AP-DJ reports from Milan. Subsequently, shareholders will be issued 30 new ordinary shares for every 79 ordinary shares held, with the aim of bringing the nominal value of each share back to L1,000. Ciga said its directors would propose the measures to shareholders at meetings scheduled for February. Host Marriott of the US, and the UK hotel group Forte are both negotiating to acquire a controlling stake in Ciga. Once the ordinary capital write-down and share issue have taken place, Ciga said it would have total shareholder capital of L91.72bn, equivalent to its net worth on December 30, 1993. Although specifics of a capital increase had not yet been decided, the directors had agreed that a plan to restructure the group could go forward with a capital increase of approximately L1,100bn. On Friday it was revealed that Marriott had raised some Dollars 315m in a share placing and an asset sale, supporting any bid it might make for the debt-ridden company.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucia Domville] </F>   [Text] The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial  Development (Secofi) has not decided how it will resolve tariff  inconsistencies affecting nearly 20 production networks as a  result of the tariff reduction program negotiated under NAFTA.    Representatives of the private sector have asked the Foreign  Trade Commission (Cocex) to apply Rule 8 of Chapter 98 of the  General Importation Tax Tariff (TIGI), which creates entire  tariff brackets which eliminate tariff irregularities  [desfasamientos arancelarios] on similar products.    According to foreign trade experts, mainly small- and  medium-sized businessmen -- specifically those who did not see  tariffs reduced to zero on products they import within the  framework of NAFTA -- have filed complaints with the authorities.    Up until mid-February, at least 20 cases of tax  irregularities had been filed with Cocex, which comprises  officials from Secofi, the Finance Secretariat, and the Bank of  Mexico.    Among those products facing open-market competition while  encountering disadvantages in the cost of their component  imports are: Padlocks, tools, movable iron pipes, agriculture  transport or milk storage tanks, fish meal, sausages,  refrigerators, leather belts, and others.    For example, in the NAFTA tariff brackets for machinery and  equipment, the reduction rates rates are greater than those for  similar products under the TIGI, which is used by third-party  countries.    The inconsistencies for the aforementioned products  translate  into a tariff reduction rate that is slower than the one for  imports from which these final products are made. Therefore,  the raw materials for iron products face a 10-percent tariff,  while the final product -- say, a padlock -- has been exempted  from tariffs altogether since the day the trade agreement went  into effect.    According to sources, some of the cases that have been  brought before Cocex are not always similar to the  above-mentioned cases -- those involving compact disk or bag  manufacturers, for example -- because these industries never  participated in the negotiations.    Meanwhile, some small- and medium-sized businessmen charge  their interests were not defended by the Coordinator for Foreign  Trade Business Organizations (COECE) and were sacrificed to  obtain concessions in favor of large Mexican businessmen.    To correct the situation, Cocex has suggested that Rule 8 of  Chapter 98 of the TIGI be applied, eliminating all tariffs at  the same time for each and every component of a production  network.    Rule 8 is not a new option, because it has been discussed at  the legislature for more than 10 years. Nevertheless, in  general, no new brackets have been added using Rule 8 over the  past five years.    Sources said Secofi officials have refused to resort to this  provision, because it would only represent temporary solutions  for some products. It is not a matter of creating a new tariff  bracket under Chapter 98.    The bottom line is this: The cards have already been dealt,  and NAFTA legislation prohibits "recanting" negotiated  concessions; only negotiations to further reduce tariffs for  products under the terms of Article 302.2 are expected to be  held.    The seriousness of this situation, according to warnings  from  foreign trade experts, is that, if the final product pays less  taxes that its component parts, there will be trade imbalances  that favor imported goods. Additionally, they noted that if  this matter is not settled promptly -- already, more than 30  days have passed since the notification -- domestic producers of  goods facing competitive disadvantages with regard to foreign  goods will tend to disappear or become product marketers.  Foreign trade experts warn that the effects of this must not be  underestimated, especially in advance of new tariff negotiations  with the United States and Canada.</p>

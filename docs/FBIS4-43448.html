			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that a  picture has begun taking shape as to what the next steps by the  United Nations on the Cyprus issue should be. In a statement  after his meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali this  evening, Mr. Mikhailidhis added that the picture will be  formulated as soon as Gustave Feissels' report on his latest  meeting with Rauf Denktas arrives at the UN Headquarters. Asked  to comment on reports that Denktas has accepted the  confidence-building measures, the foreign minister said that the  important thing is what Gustave Feissel will say to the  secretary general and not what Denktas says. He added: The UN  Secretariat is ready, as soon as it receives the Feissel report,  to finalize the plan of action and suggestions with which it  will apply to the Security Council.    The foreign minister further noted that he has the  impression  that the suggestions he made to the secretary general will be  jointly assessed in formulating the positions of the UN  Secretariat.    A press spokesman for the UN secretary general said that at  the meeting they discussed all the aspects of the secretary  general's good offices mission including the confidence-building  measures and other questions of substance. The spokesman said  that the United Nations continues to feel that the set of  measures proposed is balanced with advantages for both sides.  He was not in a position to comment on the latest Denktas  statement and made it clear that he is waiting for Feissel's  report.    In an interview with Voice of America, the foreign minister  described the results of his contacts in Washington and New York  as very satisfactory. He added: The suggestions by the Cypriot  side for getting out of the current situation concern the need  for a new approach to the Cyprus issue for the Security  Council's involvement which would mean upgrading the dialogue  and strengthening the whole effort as well as creating a new  agenda. The foreign minister concluded: The Cypriot side's  suggestions were listened to with care and interest and will be  evaluated properly.</p>

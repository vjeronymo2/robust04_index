			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SHOTGUN INJURES BOY; OWNER HELD  </P> <P> The manager of a Canoga Park apartment building was in jail this morning after  he accidentally fired a sawed-off shotgun and the pellets struck an 11-year-old  boy, causing minor injuries, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Kevin Kellogg, 24, was arrested on suspicion of possessing an illegal firearm,  a felony, and was being held at the West Valley Division jail in lieu of $5,000  bail, police said.  </P> <P> The boy was taken to UCLA Medical Center in Westwood shortly after the  shooting, which occurred at 8:30 p.m. Thursday. He was in satisfactory  condition after being treated for minor pellet wounds to the left side of his  body, Lt. George Rock said. The victim's name was not released by police.  </P> <P> Police said Kellogg was carrying the gun while "patrolling" in a courtyard area  of the complex in the 21600 block of Saticoy Street. "He somehow slipped and  fell, and it went off," Rock said.  </P> <P> Police said the pellets apparently ricocheted off the pavement before hitting  the boy. It was unclear how far away the victim was when he was struck. The  incident is still under investigation.  </P> <P> Kellogg will not be charged with injuring the boy because investigators said  they believe the shooting was accidental. But altering a shotgun by shortening  its barrel makes the weapon illegal, Rock said.  </P> <P> Kellogg's reasons for patrolling the complex were unknown. "That location  doesn't seem to be a terribly bad area," Rock said.  </P></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / People: Harrods' new bank manager The smart London district of Knightsbridge acquired a new bank manager yesterday. He is John Simmonds, who has just become director and general manager of Harrods Bank Ltd, which is situated in - but not controlled by - the famous store. Simmonds, 58, took early retirement from Lloyds Bank when it was going through a restructuring exercise in 1992. Since then he has been acting as a consultant for small businesses and others, including Lloyds, and has just been approached by Harrods. Having been an area director with Lloyds, he is looking forward to running all aspects of Harrods Bank - which has assets of almost Pounds 25m. With just 3,500 customers, Simmonds sees his first task as establishing a relationship with the existing clients. Beyond that, he believes that there is a role for the bank in offering a personal service to young professionals who are not yet the high net worth individuals courted throughout the financial services sector. 'We don't want to be all things to all men,' Simmonds says, 'but one of the first priorities is to look at those who are one or two rungs up the ladder and believe they merit a more personal service than they are getting from the main clearing banks.'</p>

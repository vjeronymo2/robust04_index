"We are ready to cooperate with the United States on several  problems but we will not accept any issue becoming a  precondition for the normalisation of diplomatic relations," a  foreign ministry spokesman said.    Christopher said Saturday in Hawaii before heading off for  an  Asia-Pacific tour that Vietnam needed to make progress in its  human rights record, settle claims by US businesses and resolve  questions on US service personnel missing since the conflict in  Indochina.    "There are a great many things they would have to do before  normal relations can be established," Christopher said.    US and Vietnamese met in New York last week to discuss human  rights in an atmosphere described by Hanoi as "constructive,"  although no other details merged from the meeting.    Vietnam has said it welcomes dialogue on the issue but will  not countenance "interference in its internal affairs."    A recent State Department report on Vietnam's human rights  record welcomed changes to the constitution that enshrine  certain legal rights, but accused Hanoi of detaining dissidents  who peacefully expressed political views. The secretary of  state praised Hanoi for its help in the search for the 1,647 US  personnel still listed as missing in action in Vietnam, which  has diminished as a obstacle to ties due to increased  cooperation from authorities here.    Officials from both sides also said they had made "some  progress" in talks in Hanoi last week on opening liaison offices  and settling claims on more than 500 million dollars in assets  seized by both sides in 1975 after the Vietnam War.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BANKS ACT 7TH DAY TO DAMPEN DOLLAR  </P> <P> European central banks intervened against the dollar today for the seventh  consecutive trading day, trimming its value by less than half a pfennig and  half a yen.  </P> <P> The morning bout of intervention by seven central banks served as a powerful  reminder that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations want to see the  dollar lower still. Last week's barrage of concerted dollar sales sliced around  4% off the currency's value.  </P> <P> The Bank of Japan had intervened earlier today during Asian trading hours. The  European intervention was joined by the central banks of West Germany, Britain,  France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain and Belgium.  </P> <P> About half an hour after the intervention started, the dollar was trading  around 1.8775 West German marks and 140.50 Japanese yen. It had opened in  London at 1.8817 marks and 140.80 yen.  </P></p>

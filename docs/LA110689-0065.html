			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BENTLEY'S 68 LEADS WAY AS PROS WIN HINE CUP  </P> <P> Scott Bentley, a pro at the Singing Hills Country Club, had played in the past  two Century Club Matches, in which San Diego County's top amateur golfers meet  its top professionals.  </P> <P> Both times, Bentley had been on the losing end. The amateurs, in fact, were on  a little bit of a roll. Entering this year's competition for the Hine Cup, they  led the series, 9-8, and had won three of the past four.  </P> <P> "I wanted to win bad this year," Bentley said. "We really needed to win."  </P> <P> It didn't look to good for the pros when the amateurs led, 25 1/2-19 1/2, after  the first round Saturday. But the pros rallied strongly and outscored the  amateurs, 50-24, in the match-play Nassau format Sunday to win the Hine Cup, 85  1/2-49 1/2, at the Carlton Oaks Country Club.  </P> <P> Both teams had their chances on a newly revamped course. Carlton Oaks reopened  Oct. 1 after 11 months of construction, and the new Dye Design course is  quickly establishing itself as one of the most difficult in the county.  </P> <P> That was evident Sunday as only three of the 20 amateurs and professionals were  able to shoot better than a 78. Eight golfers shot 80 or above.  </P> <P> The course has not received its rating since being revamped, but several of the  pros thought it could be in the 75-76 range.  </P> <P> Jerry Michals of San Luis Rey Downs led the amateurs with a one-over-par 73,  but Bentley had the day's best round, shooting a four-under 68 with six birdies  and two bogeys. Chris Starkjohann of Pala Mesa Resort added a three-under 69  for the pros.  </P> <P> If anyone was going to be successful on the course, it figured to be Bentley,  who is having his finest year as a pro.  </P> <P> He won the Southern California Championships in July at Huntington Beach and  subsequently received exemptions for the Shearson Lehman Hutton San Diego Open,  the Los Angeles Open and the Bob Hope Desert Classic.  </P> <P> "It's been my best year," said Bentley, 31. "I guess I'm maturing, getting a  little smarter."  </P> <P> Bentley played at Monte Vista and Valhalla high schools and another year at  Grossmont Community College. He then played for three years at San Diego State,  from 1979-81. Bentley said his best finish at SDSU was third place in the Aztec  Invitational his senior year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  envoy, has expressed his feeling that there will be consequences  from the failure of the talks on the confidence-building  measures and added that nobody can predict what these  consequences will be.    Before leaving Cyprus this morning, Mr. Clark told CyBC  [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] that in the end all the  Cypriot people will pay the price for the failure of the talks.  He noted that Rauf Denktas was very hasty in stating that the  process had collapsed, and added that Denktas has ulterior  motives for what he does and says. Mr. Clark added: I cannot  say anything else except that Denktas intentionally and hastily  said our efforts had collapsed. Mr. Clark said the United  Nations must decide to continue its mission and to study  seriously the suggestions he will submit later.    Mr. Clark also noted that there has not been enough good  faith or political will to solve the problems. When asked what  should be done to create such a will, he said that in addition  to the two leaders in Cyprus there are other voices which should  probably be encouraged to take a bigger part in the  consultations.</p>

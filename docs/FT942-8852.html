			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (3): Education and research bring in the foreign investor - Industrial location Take a drive around Toulouse and the importance of foreign investment to the local economy quickly becomes apparent. From Siemens of Germany to Sony of Japan and Motorola of the US, many of the world's largest business groups have their names on manufacturing or research centres in the city and its environs. It is a similar story in the region as a whole. A total of 284 foreign companies, in manufacturing and services, have invested in the Midi-Pyrenees  -from agricultural groups in the Haute Garonne department to automobile components in Aveyron. Foreign companies now account for almost 30 per cent of the region's industrial investment and about 24 per cent of its industrial workforce. Such a substantial presence is explained by several factors. In Toulouse particularly, much of the attraction lies in the strong education and research base which is available to industry. Ms Florence de Villoutreys, director of human resources at Storagetek, the most recent foreign investor in Toulouse, says that it took just six weeks to find the six engineers needed for the data storage group's initial product line. According to Ms de Villoutreys, the US group decided on Toulouse as an investment location after a three-year study of 27 sites in nine countries. In addition to the skilled workforce in Toulouse, she says the links with research institutes were an important factor in the final decision. In March, the company signed contracts with two engineering and science institutes to work on their robot and data reading systems. Similar arguments are expressed at Motorola, the first foreign electronics group to make a significant investment in the region. 'We have always had a close relationship with the research centres here,' says Mr Robert Aschieri, chairman of Motorola France, citing as an example the development of high efficiency switching systems for electric lights. Motorola has expanded steadily in Toulouse since its first factory was built in 1967. It has added higher value added semiconductors to its product range from the site and is now planning to build a pure research laboratory for advanced chip technologies. The scale of foreign investment which has flowed into the area since Motorola put down its roots is partly the result of a 'coat-tails' effect. 'It was encouraging for us that Motorola was here,' says Ms de Villoutreys of Storagetek. She adds that many of the company's customers, including Aerospatiale and Meteo France, the meteorological agency, are located in the city. The rise in foreign investment also reflects an aggressive search by local authorities. The search has been strengthened since 1988 when Mr Dominique Baudis, the mayor, established Metropolitan Toulouse, an agency charged with promoting investment in the city and its environs. The organisation has joined forces with BRIA, the regional development body, with which it co-operates to secure foreign investment throughout the Midi-Pyrenees. Foreign companies are offered a number of sites in the region, says Mr Jean Barcellini, head of Metropolitan Toulouse. 'Some may be attracted to Toulouse because of its strength in R&amp;D, but others may have reasons, such as costs, to be in the countryside or near one of the other towns.' For instance, Storagetek was shown sites in Albi and Montauban before deciding on the regional capital. Mr Barcellini says his organisation has helped draw about 20 companies to the area since 1988. He is currently involved in advanced negotiations with nine potential investors, five from the electronics sector, and two each from the aerospace and medical fields. The challenge, he admits, has become tougher. Increased competition from other regions in France and from abroad has coincided with the impact of recession to reduce the potential candidates and increase the number and quality of offers they receive. 'Yes, it is harder, so we have to concentrate on our strengths,' says Mr Barcellini. For Toulouse this means an emphasis on the operating environment, rather than on financial incentives which can be offered to prospective investors. 'In the region we can offer financial support, but in Toulouse this is relatively limited,' says Mr Barcellini. 'Our advantage is the infrastructure we possess, in terms of communication and in terms of science and research.' Such factors should continue to work to the benefit of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees. The trend of foreign investment is shifting away from low-cost labour sites towards what Mr Barcellini describes as 'low brain cost delocalisation'. France's second largest university town, and one of its principal centres of high-tech research, should therefore retain a sharp edge in the competition for foreign capital.</p>

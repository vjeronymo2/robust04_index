			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Magnum goes ahead 48% to MDollars 310m MAGNUM Corp, the Malaysian gaming and investment holding company, has announced pre-tax profits of MDollars 310.2m (USDollars 117m) for the year to December 31 1992. This represents an increase of 48 per cent on 1991 taxable profits of MDollars 209.2m. Turnover reached MDollars 1.55bn, up 28 per cent on the 1991 figure. Magnum said the improved performance was partly due to better management controls, plus a significant increase in the sales of its lottery tickets in Malaysia. Magnum is one of a number of Malaysian companies chasing what are believed to be highly-lucrative gaming projects in China. Late last year, the com-pany announced that the Chinese authorities had approved 'in principle' its application to run a lottery in Guang-dong province, in southern China.</p>

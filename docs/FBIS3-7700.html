Regarding short-term economic forecasts, views were divided  among the executives, with 50 of them saying they feel the  economy is either "recovering gradually," "firming down," or  "close to hitting the bottom," and the other 50 saying they feel  the economy "remains at the bottom." However, while the  previous survey (conducted in November 1993) showed that  one-third of the executives felt the economy was "worsening,"  this time there were none.    As to when the economy would move toward recovery, 56  executives said they feel this will happen between October to  December this year, indicating they hold high hopes the economy  would begin recovering by the end of the year.    Increased consumer spending and housing investments were  cited as major reasons the executives feel the slumping economy  is bottoming out. On the other hand, the yen's further  appreciation against other currencies and more layoffs were  concerns cited by many executives. Notable was the fact that  the number of executives who stressed "political instability" as  a source of concern jumped from five in the previous survey to  33 in the latest survey. Since economic prospects still remain  uncertain, most executives said they feel the government should  take further action, recommending that income tax cuts be  continued after fiscal year 1994 and further deregulation be  promoted.    ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted its survey from 14 to 25 March by  holding personal interviews with top executives, as a rule.    Regarding the current state of the economy, two of the  executives said the economy is "beginning to expand."  Thirty-one said it is "firming down," while 17 said it is  "close to hitting the bottom." In the previous survey, none said  the economy was "firming down" or "close to hitting the bottom."    If we look at the manufacturing industry and the services  sector separately, the results of the survey show that 19  executives from the services sector said they feel the economy  is "firming down." In contrast, 30 executives from the  manufacturing industry said they feel the economy "remains at  the bottom." These results were in line with the fact that many  executives from the services sector cited increased consumer  spending as a positive economic factor, while many from the  manufacturing industry cited little growth in investment in  plant and equipment as a negative factor. It can thus be said  that the manufacturing industry, which by itself has experienced  the effects of diminished investment in plant and equipment, has  given a less-than-optimistic view about current economic  conditions.    In the previous survey, predictions as to when the economy  would start recovering were evenly divided among those  executives who predicted recovery between July and September  1994, those between October and December 1994, and those who  predicted recovery after 1995. This time, however, 56 of the  executives predicted economic recovery between October and  December this year. There were 27 executives who predicted the  economy would not recover until next year, but they were mostly  from retail merchandising, transportation, steel, and chemical  firms.    Executives predicted real economic growth would remain low  for fiscal year 1994. Fifty-seven of them said the economy will  grow in real terms by 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent, and 24 said it  will grow by less than 0.5 percent, while none predicted growth  over 2 percent. This indicates there is a wide gap between the  executives' predictions and the government's prediction of 2.4  percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP).    Regarding areas where they want the government to step up  its  efforts, the executives said they hope for continued income and  residence tax cuts and increased spending on public works  projects. Notable, however, were some executives saying that  "effects of increased spending on public works projects, which  has been the mainstay of the government's traditional  pump-priming measures, have become diluted."    Asked about steps government should now take, 82 of the  executives said they want tax cuts to be continued in fiscal  year 1995. Forty-eight of them cited "vigorous promotion of  deregulation," indicating they hold high expectations for  renewed vitality in the private sector through the  implementation of structural economic reforms.</p>

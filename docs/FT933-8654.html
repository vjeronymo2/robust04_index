			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Peerage goes to former Sogat chief Brenda Dean THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced the creation of eight 'working' peers to strengthen the three main parties in the House of Lords. The most prominent are Ms Brenda Dean, who was the first woman to lead a big trade union, and Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National and a former European commissioner. Working peers are created by the Queen on the recommendation of party leaders, usually during the summer parliamentary recess. They are expected to play a full part in the chamber's main role of reviewing legislation. The list of four Conservatives, three Labour and one Liberal Democrat is significantly smaller than last year's crop of 21, prompting Labour complaints that its party's numbers are not being fully replenished. Nine Labour peers have died since last summer including Lord Underhill, a former general secretary of the party. The latest list is more balanced than last year's, which added 13 Conservative peers compared with six Labour, one Liberal Democrat and one independent. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has restricted himself to four Conservative nominations, confirming the government's overall satisfaction with the performance of its Lords team. The four, all experienced politicians, are: Sir Paul Dean, a former deputy speaker of the Commons; Mrs Doreen Miller, chairman of the Conservative party's Greater London organisation; Mr Robert Dixon Smith, a former chairman of the Association of County Councils; and Sir Christopher, a former chairman of the European Commission and also once a Financial Times leader writer. Ms Dean, who was successively general secretary of the print union Sogat and deputy leader of its successor, the GPMU print union, is expected to play a prominent part in Labour's smaller Lords team. She was already being talked of yesterday as a potential member of the front bench, along with Mr Simon Haskel, the second Labour nomination. Mr Haskel, chairman of Perrotts, a Leeds-based packing and textile company, is an adviser on industrial policy who was in the Downing Street policy unit which advised Lord Callaghan when he was prime minister in the 1970s. He said that he intended to delegate most of his management responsibilities to colleagues in order to work 'virtually full-time' in the Lords. The third Labour peer is Ms Joyce Gould, a former director of the party's national organisation. The Liberal Democrat peer will be Mr Anthony Lester, a founder member of the Social Democratic party and a leading constitutional lawyer.</p>

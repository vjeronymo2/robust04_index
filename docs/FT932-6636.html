			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BP agrees division sale to managers for Pounds 250m BRITISH PETROLEUM agreed yesterday to sell its consumer products division to a management buy-out for Pounds 250m. Sir Allen Sheppard will become non-executive chairman of the new company with Mr Michael Handley, previously divisional managing director of RHM, to become managing director. The consumer products division is a leading supplier of household detergents, cleaners and personal care products to supermarkets. It comprises Robert McBride in the UK, Yplon in Belgium and Solaro in Italy with a workforce of 4,000 and a turnover last year of Pounds 350m. Financial backing for the buy-out was put together by Legal and General, the insurance company, which is understood to have beaten several other management groups in the bidding process. The consumer products division is the second of BP Nutrition's businesses to be sold since the sector was put up for sale about a year ago. Consumer Foods was sold to Sara Lee, the US group, last December. Purina, animal foods in the US and other animal feeds businesses in Europe are still for sale. The consumer products business is understood to have enjoyed solid profits in the past couple of years although BP will not disclose figures.</p>

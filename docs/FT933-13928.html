			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Barbour Index dips to Pounds 3.42m BARBOUR INDEX reported lower profits of Pounds 3.42m pre-tax for the 12 months to end-April as the specialist information services company increased development expenditure to combat continuing recession in the construction industry. The profits decline, from Pounds 3.7m last time, came on turnover of Pounds 12m (Pounds 11.9m). Mr Jack Dunn, chief executive, said that new sales of microfile services to architects and planners were very low, reflecting falling architectural commissions and new housing starts, but that renewal rates were similar to 1992. However, services to civil, structural and service engineers performed better. The expanding health and safety microfiles showed substantial growth, Mr Dunn said, with renewal rates again over 90 per cent. The operation accounts for 27 per cent of group revenue, up from 12 per cent five years ago. He warned, however, that moves to accelerate a new generation of services 'may result in our reported profits remaining relatively static over the next couple of years'. Nevertheless, the balance sheet remains strong with cash of Pounds 5.51m (Pounds 5m) and no borrowings. To maintain a 'progressive' dividend policy, the final is raised to 5.45p bringing the total to 8p (7.25p), payable from earnings of 13.8p (14.8p).</p>

[passage omitted] The first point on the agenda of  the Council of Ministers was a briefing on the state of security  in the country. It was introduced by the minister of state  charged with interior and public security and expanded by the  minister of national defense. The briefing noted that security  was slowly returning to normal inside the country, while in  Bujumbura, especially in Kamenge, this morning the situation  worsened. It should be noted that arms are being kept almost  everywhere in the country, particularly in the capital. The  council therefore recommends an in-depth study of ways to  install appropriate mechanisms to disarm the public. Members of  the government also deeply deplored the balkanization trends  currently affecting Bujumbura.    In the face of the generalized insecurity in Burundi, the  Council of Ministers found it necessary to put in place  operational structures charged with following up and solving on  a daily basis questions related to security. The people will be  regularly informed about the steps taken to that effect. The  council recommended the strengthening of the National Security  Council. The media were called upon to support the government's  action towards restoring security, especially in the mayorship.  The members of the government believe that the solution to the  crisis will necessarily pass through a judicial process devoid  of complacency and with the cooperation of the various bodies of  the police and the people.    Last, in order to emphasize its determination to bring about  a rapid return to security and peace in the country, the council  decided that until further notice it would meet at least once a  week to study the security problem as a priority.

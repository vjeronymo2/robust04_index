			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Better off at Barclays Leaping out of knickers and into bank manager's trousers in one fluent movement is a difficult and potentially hazardous stunt. So if Mr Martin Taylor can manage it on his way from Courtaulds Textiles to Barclays, his track record will seem all the more impressive. Certainly, Barclays' new chief executive faces a formidable challenge. His most immediate concern must be that the pair of trousers he is heading for appear to be occupied already. It is commonly assumed that Mr Andrew Buxton's executive role will steadily wither, transforming him into a more conventional non-executive chairman. Mr Buxton, however, may have other ideas. To the extent that the two men strike up a harmonious working relationship, that may not matter too much. In truth, few chairman in such large companies act in a purely non-executive capacity. Yet the test of such relationships and structures comes when they are put under strain. Mr Buxton will have to show uncommon flexibility of mind when Mr Taylor wants to sacrifice some of the sacred cows which the chairman has lived with for decades, especially as the process will not start until next year, by which time earnings will have improved further, the rights-issues-to-dividend-cut fiasco will be a fading memory and complacency will be creeping back. The position of other board members will then be crucial, and some of them have recently shown disturbing signs of pursuing their own agendas. Perhaps the most difficult challenge facing Mr Taylor is transforming the culture of Barclays' retail branch network at a time when banks have broken their implicit lifetime employment pact with employees, and, judging by Barclays' margins, customers are being soaked for past management mistakes. If he can crack that issue Mr Taylor really will deserve his phenomenal reputation.</p>

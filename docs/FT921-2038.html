			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Appeal Court frees Cyprus bank's assets: Overturning of Mareva injunction likely to be welcomed by bankers A COURT ORDER freezing a bank's assets should be made only in unusual circumstances, Sir John Donaldson, Master of the Rolls - the senior judge of the Court of Appeal - said yesterday in a ruling likely to be welcomed by bankers. The so-called Mareva injunctions, named after the first case in which one was imposed, have been widely used in recent years to avoid dissipation of assets pending a final ruling in a court action. They are frequently imposed on banks holding defendants' assets. Banking business, Sir John said, was fundamentally dependent on the maintenance of customer confidence that a bank could and would meet its obligations. Any order that could cause a 'run on the bank' would be inimical to the purposes for which the jurisdiction to grant asset freezing orders existed. Sir John made his comments when the Appeal Court lifted a Mareva injunction freezing Pounds 38.9m of the worldwide assets of the Central Bank of Northern Cyprus. Such injunctions were granted in November to the administrators of Polly Peck International, who are trying to recover about Pounds 1bn of the failed international trading company's assets that they believe have been misapplied by Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman, and others. The court was told that the administrators' current estimate was that there would be a Pounds 190m surplus in Polly Peck after the costs of the administration had been deducted. In their pending action, the administrators claim from the Central Bank Pounds 44.9m transferred to it by Industrial Bank of Kibris, a Northern Cyprus bank controlled by Mr Nadir. They assert that the Central Bank knew, or should have suspected, that the funds were being improperly diverted away from Polly Peck. Allowing an appeal by the Central Bank, Lord Justice Scott said the Mareva injunction had already seriously interfered with its normal business and, if maintained, would be likely to cause it irreparable harm. Polly Peck's claim against the bank was 'no more than speculative', the judge said, and it was not only wrong in principle, but positively unfair, to impose an asset-freezing order interfering with a defendant's normal course of business before any liability had been established. The judge said the Mareva injunction was merely intended to prevent a defendant defeating a plaintiff's chances of recovery by dissipating or secreting away assets. That principle made it very difficult to grant a Mareva against a bank, which had to repay depositors in accordance with the terms on which deposits were held. The Central Bank's only customers were the authorised banks of Northern Cyprus, which were required to keep 20 per cent of their foreign currency holdings in the Central Bank to ensure their foreign currency liquidity. There was evidence that the Central Bank's foreign currency liquidity had been very seriously affected by the freezing order, Lord Justice Scott said. Sir John Donaldson, who observed that it was the first case in which a Mareva order had been sought against a bank as a defendant, said a central or reserve bank could not continue to fulfil its proper functions under local law if subject to an injunction on the way it transacted its business. The appeal judges ordered that the Pounds 10.7m balance of the Pounds 44.9m still held by the central bank in Midland Bank in London should be earmarked in a separate account and not used other than in the normal course of business, unless there were no other funds available in England. The central bank must also inform Polly Peck's solicitors of any proposed use of the Pounds 10.7m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Calgene's initial submission requesting an advisory opinion regarding whether the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene may be used in the production of genetically engineered tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape plants included an environmental assessment (EA). The agency received comments on this EA. As noted earlier, the request for advisory opinion was later converted to a food additive petition at Calgene's request at which time Calgene submitted an updated EA. At the time the notice of filing was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , FDA announced that the petitioner's EA was being made available to the public at the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and expressly solicited comments on the EA. No additional comments were received in response to this request for comments. The comments received on the original EA are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment asserted that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene could spread from tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape plants to other crops and related weeds by pollen flow when the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene-containing crops are grown near nontransgenic crops, and in locations where the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -gene containing crops have wild relatives. The comment noted that transfer of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene would create a problem if it were to make wild and weedy relatives more difficult to control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment also criticized the Calgene submission for not addressing whether it is ``wise to contribute foreign genes to the gene pools of wild plants even where the plants do not become weeds or manifest other obviously harmful traits'' and stated that Calgene's submission ``too easily dismissed the problem of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcrossing from the engineered oilseed rape.'' The comment noted that oilseed rape has wild and weedy relatives with which it can breed, and that ``it is not sufficient to rely on traditional commercial control practices to control gene flow,'' but that the rate of gene flow must be experimentally determined and then ``controlled by procedures that are demonstrated, not assumed, to work.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has considered the potential for adverse environmental effects from the commercial use of cotton, tomato, and oilseed rape plants modified to contain the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene. The agency notes that it is possible for cotton and tomato plants to transfer the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene to neighboring plants of the same species via cross-pollination, although commercially grown cotton and tomatoes are primarily self-pollinating. Oilseed rape plants are also capable of pollinating sexually compatible wild relatives, although not all crosses with wild relatives prove fertile. Importantly, however, introduction of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene will not confer a competitive advantage upon a plant receiving it. That is, the gene will not enhance the plant's capacity to compete with other plants for available resources. In particular, there will be no selective pressure on plants containing the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene because kanamycin will not be present in the environment in sufficient concentrations to create such pressure. First, there are no specific therapeutic uses of kanamycin that would result in its widespread application to agricultural crops. Also, kanamycin does not accumulate in the environment from production by soil microbes or by land application of animal wastes (Ref. 36). Accordingly, FDA has concluded that transfer of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene to other crops or related weeds will have no significant adverse environmental effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the comment about outcrossing from engineered oilseed rape, the comment provided no information to show that the transfer of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene to wild or weedy relatives of oilseed rape will be any more frequent or have any greater significance than the transfer of other genes from cultivated oilseed rape. FDA is aware of no human health or environmental concern associated with such transfer. Therefore, the agency does not agree that the cultivation of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -containing oilseed rape should be subject to control practices any different from those used traditionally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action, including those described in the comments discussed in this document. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

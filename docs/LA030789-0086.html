			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The shuttle Discovery's launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, now  planned for Saturday, could be delayed up to two days because of a faulty  electrical component that must be replaced, officials said. The problem  involves a "master events controller," or MEC, that failed a routine test  Sunday night. The component is one of two such devices that control when the  shuttle's boosters and external tank separate during launch.  </P></p>

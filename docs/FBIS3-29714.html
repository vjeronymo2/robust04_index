			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In response to a KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY  reporter's question concerning the recent final decision by us  and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on the scope  of inspections for ensuring the continuity of safeguards, today  a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman gave the following answer:    An agreement was reached on the scope of the inspections for  ensuring the continuity of safeguards at the negotiations held  between us and the IAEA held in Vienna, Austria, on 15 February.    The inspections on which an agreement was reached at this  time are not regular and irregular inspections [chonggimit  pichonggi sachal] under the safeguards accord, but inspections  corresponding to our special status since we had temporarily  suspended the effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. And, their basic mission is to ensure  the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the nuclear  materials have not been used for other purposes since the  previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of the  agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is to  ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the  nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since  the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of  the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is  to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the  nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since  the previous inspections.

This also complies with the spirit of  the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is  to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the  nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since  the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of  the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York last  29 December.    At the contact, the DPRK and the United States agreed that,  as imminent measures to resolve the nuclear issue in a package  deal, we would accept inspections necessary to ensure the  continuity of safeguards and affirmatively examine working-level  contact for the exchange of special envoys if the South Korean  side so proposes, that the United States would declare the  discontinuation of the Team Spirit joint military exercise for  1994, and that the DPRK and the United States would jointly  announce the date of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    What had been stressed, in particular, in the agreement was  that the inspections we would receive from the IAEA must be  thoroughly [choltu cholmi] restricted to [kukhan] inspections  for ensuring the continuity of safeguards. However, no  agreement had been reached on the scope of the inspections  because the IAEA Secretariat, completely ignoring the DPRK-U.S.  agreement, had pressured us to receive complete [wanjonhan]  regular and irregular inspections and because the United States,  in a breach of faith [sinuirul choborigo], had unjustly defended  the agency's Secretariat.    This had made us no longer entertain expectations from the  DPRK- U.S. talks and express our official position that we had  no alternative than to make a necessary choice. Then, the  United States and the IAEA withdrew [cholhoe] their previous  request for regular and irregular inspections on their own and  stated that they would conduct inspections solely for ensuring  the continuity of safeguards, and, as a result, the final  decision on the scope of inspection could be made this time.    We welcome the fact that the United States and the IAEA  Secretariat assumed an attitude conforming to the resolution of  the issue and consented to the final decision on the scope of  inspections for ensuring the continuity of safeguards.    What remains at present is to see what attitude the United  States will assume on the practical stage of implementing the  agreement between us and the agency.    When agreements on future simultaneous actions are reached,  as promised between the DPRK and the United States, a phase will  be opened for the IAEA's early inspections to guarantee the  continuity of safeguards and for the holding of the third round  of DPRK-U.S. talks to achieve a package solution to the nuclear  problem.    At a time when the world is welcoming the recent agreement,  only the U.S. rightist conservative forces and the Japanese and  South Korean authorities are loudly saying that regular and  irregular inspections must completely be conducted because the  inspection scope agreed upon between the IAEA and us is not  enough to verify the transparency of our nuclear activities  [haek hwaltong], and are openly insisting on conducting even  special inspections. This is no ordinary matter. They are  insisting this not because they are unaware of the reality of  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. This is regarded as  nothing but a deliberate scheme [uidojogin chakkan] to prevent  the resolution of the nuclear issue and to drive the situation  to an extreme.    As the special inspection issue is one of the primary  reasons  for the announcement of our withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, the continuous insistence on the  special inspection is the same as an act aimed at pushing us  completely out of the treaty.    The matter of regular and irregular inspections is an issue  to be discussed within the scope of the method for a package  solution to the nuclear problem when the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks are held, and it cannot be solved by loudly  talking about it at present.    The United States must prevent the positive [kungjongjok]  development of the situation from reversing itself by fulfilling  its responsibilities and duties at this decisive moment  [kyolchongjogin taemoge waso], which has come after a lot of  trouble, and should contribute to the ultimate solution to the  nuclear problem.    If the United States puts the brakes on the resolution of  the  nuclear issue again by setting unjustifiable conditions for  agreeing on the simultaneous actions or sticking to applying  pressure, the agreements reached between the IAEA and us cannot  be implemented, nor another opportunity like the current one  will come again.    We have invariably taken an independent policy [chaju  chongchaek], and we all together will cope with any situation.  We will continue to carefully watch the development of the  situation.</p>

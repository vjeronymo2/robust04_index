			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Costain's US coal arm pleads guilty THE US coal mining arm of Costain, the UK construction group, yesterday pleaded guilty to 29 charges involving safety violations at its William station mine in west Kentucky where 10 people were killed in an explosion in 1989. An indictment against the company was announced by the US Grand Jury which has been investigating the explosion and which is highly critical of the mine's management before and after the tragedy. Costain said that it had decided to plead guilty on 29 counts, and would not contest three other charges, rather than face protracted court proceedings which 'would prolong the pain for all, especially the families of those miners whose lives were lost'. Costain is being fined Dollars 3.75m (Pounds 2.64m). The company also faces claims for damages from the families of the dead miners. Settlements in two cases have already been agreed by the company's insurers. Mr Tom Parker, chairman of Costain's US coal mining division, said: 'We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred. Although the exact cause and reasons for the explosion remain unresolved, we believe it is best at this point to settle the matter for our employees, the miners' families and the company.' The explosion occurred in September 1989, just two months after Costain acquired a 100 per cent stake in Pyro coal company which had previously operated the mine jointly with the British group. Costain says that since the explosion it has reorganised the mines safety procedures including hiring extra safety officers and increasing training for miners. The British group now operates 16 underground and open-cast coal mines in five US states producing 17.5m tonnes of coal a year. US coal operations in 1991 are thought to have generated about Pounds 5m operating profits out of total operating profits of Pounds 27.4m. The Grand Jury findings have been published shortly before a court in St Louis, Missouri, is due to announce its judgment in a separate legal action involving Costain and Peabody, the US coal mining arm of Hanson, the UK-based conglomerate. Peabody has asked the court for an injunction preventing the sale, for Dollars 245m, of Costain's Australian coal and property operations to Altus, part of the French Credit Lyonnais group. Peabody, which says it had previously agreed terms with Costain to buy the Australian coal business at a lower price, wants the sale to Altus disallowed.</p>

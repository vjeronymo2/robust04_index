			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Forte closes in on Ciga as competition falls off Forte's chances of acquiring the Italian-based Ciga luxury hotel chain rose last night when Host Marriott of the US withdrew its competing bid. Host Marriott said it had suspended negotiations to acquire Ciga because it had been given insufficient information to counter Forte's offer. ITT Sheraton, which had also expressed some interest in Ciga, said last night that it had not submitted a bid for the chain. Forte executives are expected to make a presentation today to Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank that has organised a restructuring of the highly indebted Ciga. Forte said last October that it had agreed to take over the management of Ciga, which has net debts of more than L1,000bn (Pounds 397m). Under the agreement Forte said it would pay Pounds 33m cash and insert some of its own luxury hotels with a value of about Pounds 125m into an Italian operating company, in which it would have a majority interest. Ciga's bank debt would be transferred into a separate property holding company in which the operating company would have a 15 per cent stake. The deal would give Forte access to a prestigious luxury hotel brand - something it sought in the 1980s with its bid for the Savoy group. The agreement to manage Ciga raised questions over whether Forte would need to continue its pursuit of Savoy. Ciga has 35 hotels in Italy, Austria, France, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain. Some of Ciga's creditor banks were unhappy with the Forte agreement, however, and criticised Mediobanca for not examining alternatives. Barclays of the UK was believed to have been one of the most vociferous critics of the agreement with Forte. Host Marriott emerged as the most credible rival to Forte last month when it said it was in discussions over the possible acquisition of Ciga. It said Marriott International, its sister company, could run some or all of the hotels. Although ITT Sheraton said a bid for Ciga was under 'preliminary review', Host Marriott's discussions with Ciga were seen as a more potent threat to Forte. Forte, which has been conducting its due diligence investigations of Ciga, argued that it had more experience of running luxury hotels than the other two groups.</p>

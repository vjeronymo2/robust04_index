			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Calls to liberalise industry BUSINESS leaders across Europe would welcome increased competition, especially in the telecommunications sector, but most believe they are unable to persuade their governments to accelerate liberalisation. This is the principal finding of a survey carried out by Harris Research on behalf of British Telecom of the UK which examined attitudes to liberalisation in eight continental European countries. The business leaders believe increased liberalisation of telecommunications would cut costs, increase efficiency and improve quality of service. Britain has the most competitive telecommunications market in Europe and BT has been pressing for a speeding up of the liberalisation process in other countries. Some 60 per cent of the senior business people consulted chose telecommunications as the industry they would like to see liberalised. The survey shows that almost three-quarters of large companies are prepared to consider changing their telecommunications suppliers and believe that doing so would not expose their businesses to unnecessary risk. The greatest resistance to change came from France and Sweden where only about one- fifth of business people showed a willingness to change supplier; 94 per cent of Italians, on the other hand, said they would be happy to go to an alternative supplier. However, companies were virtually unanimous in lacking confidence in their ability to influence their national governments to accelerate liberalisation.</p>

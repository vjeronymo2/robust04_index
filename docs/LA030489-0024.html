			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FRAZEE SEEKS TO AMEND FARM-WORKER BILL;  </P> <P> EMERGENCY FUNDS SOUGHT FOR MIGRANT HOUSING  </P> <P> A state senator who represents North County plans to amend a farm-worker  housing bill to include money for emergency shelter, a move that could  alleviate the sort of upheaval caused recently when an immigrant camp in  Carlsbad was uprooted.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad) will undertake the changes to establish a fund  to provide temporary housing to migrant field hands, according to Richard  Ledford, a legislative aide to the senator.  </P> <P> The idea for the emergency money surfaced during a meeting Friday of state and  local officials concerned with the migrant housing problem. Participants  suggested that steps be taken to provide the funds, which would be included in  a bill Frazee is sponsoring that calls for $500,000 in seed money to build  permanent farm-worker housing.  </P> <P> Canyon encampments across North County are under increasing fire from public  health officials and municipal authorities, who see the enclaves as health and  fire hazards.  </P> <P> The spotlight was trained recently on a camp in south Carlsbad known as Valle  Verde, which was razed a month ago. Many immigrants in the camp, which had  existed in relative peace for six years, moved to a canyon in Encinitas,  prompting protest from neighbors there.  </P> <P> Most of those migrants dispersed this week when the city announced plans to  raid the canyon and charge them with trespassing.  </P> <P> Even if the bill is approved by the Legislature, money for the emergency  housing would not be available until next year, Ledford said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, officials with the state Housing and Community Development  Department agreed at the meeting to begin working with a local nonprofit  agency, the North County Chaplaincy, to try to tap existing emergency funds to  provide trailers to house immigrants, Ledford said.  </P></p>

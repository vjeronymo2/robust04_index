			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev today warned that NATO air strikes  against Bosnian Serb positions could lead to an escalation of  the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina.    NATO aircraft have bombed Bosnian Serb positions near the  town of Gorazde twice in the past two days.    In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher today, Kozyrev said the world might be  dragged into the danger of exchange of strikes and he called for  maximum restraint.    He said the decision to launch air strikes was hasty and  "taken without due regard for consequences" and NATO had not  consulted the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.    Kozyrev, who is accompanying President Boris Yeltsin in  Madrid for a visit to Spain, said that the decision-makers  should be responsible for "all serious consequences of air  strikes."    In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow was  told that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had been  informed of the possibility of using aircraft before the air  strikes.    The statement said Russia also hoped to be informed of the  whole incident by U.N. leaders.    It called on the United States and other Western countries  not to wreck the U.N. decisions or connive at any side.    As a direct and active participant in the settlement of the  Bosnian crisis, Russia insisted on preventing an escalation of  the conflict in the region, the statement said.</p>

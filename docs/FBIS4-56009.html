			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovak National Party Standpoint: Threat of </F> Manipulation"]    [Text] The Slovak National Party leadership sharply  protests the planned amendment to the election law, which does  not provide for the delivery of the ballot papers directly to  voters' homes. The change to the election law, on the basis of  which every voter would receive the ballot papers only at the  polling station, would enable real manipulation of the elections  and could result in the distortion of election results. Besides,  the situation during the elections would be confusing because if  any citizen did not arrive at the polling station for one reason  or another, his ballot could be misused.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Ren Kan: "BOC Mulls Impact as </F> FECs Are Phased Out"]    [Text] A senior official from the Bank of China called  upon local branches to prepare for the unification of the  dual-track foreign exchange system and to "conscientiously"  carry out the withdrawal of foreign exchange certificates (FECs).    The bank will replenish its reserves of foreign currencies  to  cope with the possibility of rising demands for foreign  currencies in the future, said Wang Xuebing, the newly appointed  president of the bank which issues FECs.    The withdrawal of FECs from the economy is a task with wide-  ranging impact, Wang said on Wednesday.    The People's Bank of China has announced that the country  will no longer issue FECs. Existing FECs can be used  temporarily and will be gradually withdrawn by the banks.    The discontinuance of FECs was one of the measures China was  expected to launch next year to extend reform of the country's  foreign exchange control system.    Wang Qiren, the bank's chairman of the board, said the  central government has placed great expectations on the Bank of  China and expects the bank to aid the establishment of the new  exchange system in the socialist market economy.    The bank specializes in foreign exchange and foreign trade  business, and will continue to be a State-designated foreign  exchange bank under the new system.    The bank's president said all banks should treat foreign  exchange reform as a top priority next year.    "We should have a high sense of social responsibility to the  task," Wang said. "These duties must be performed well."    The bank's head office has established a special group to  strengthen the bank's work on the foreign exchange control  system.    Some of the bank's departments have also organized special  divisions to do preparatory work.    The president said the bank's head office will make efforts  to map out detailed management regulations and send them to  local branches in the near future.    To ensure the Bank of China's smooth operation under the new  system, its head office summoned local bank officials  responsible for accounting, settlement and foreign exchange  savings to Beijing for a two-day training course. The classes  began today.    These officials will immediately return to their branches to  teach local staffs.    In another development, it was announced the China Foreign  Exchange Trading Centre will open in Shanghai during the first  half of 1994.    It will be the largest and most advanced marketplace for  trading foreign currency in the country.    The outfitting of the foreign exchange trading centre is now  in full swing. The centre's computerized trading system will be  connected to six major cities throughout the country on January  1.    According to local banking sources, the government-sponsored  trading centre will mainly provide services to banks in the  trading and settlement of hard currencies.</p>

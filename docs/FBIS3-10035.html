Savall] </F>   [Text] Havana, 25 Feb (PL) -- Leaders of the American  Physicians Association (APHA) have endorsed the role of doctors  in alternative diplomacy against the U.S. blockade against Cuba.    Dr. Helen Rodriguez Trias, president of this association  founded 122 years ago, said the blockade enforced by U.S.  administrations since the beginning of the 1960's is a dirty and  inhumane practice. Rodriguez Trias led an APHA delegation that  attended a bilateral workshop on health exchanges with another  group of doctors and psychologists who came to Cuba at the  invitation of the Center of International Policy.    The meeting covered the subjects of public health in both  countries in terms of their current situations and outlook, the  consequences of the blockade on Cuban medical and sanitary  conditions, and the program to reform public health services  presented by President William Clinton.    After learning in detail the effects of the blockade on the  Cuban economy and its negative repercussions on the lives of the  people, particularly on the lives of children and the elderly,  the APHA delegation voiced a consensus in its determination to  increase the campaign against this measure.    Rodriguez, of Cuban origin, voiced her pleasure with this  visit to the island after so many years of absence. Rodriguez  said: It has been a moving experience, and foremost it has  reinforced my wishes to continue working to eliminate what the  U.S. authorities call an embargo against Cuba.    When mentioning that the rest of the delegation has the same  commitment, she added that APHA -- which she described as an  institution that has always maintained a progressive line in its  professional and social work -- will organize other contacts  with Cuban colleagues in the future.    Meanwhile, the participation of Wayne Smith and Cuban  Foreign  Ministry officials in the workshop gave a touch of alternative  diplomacy to the meeting. Smith was the chief of the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana during the Jimmy Carter  administration.    Dr. Abelardo Ramirez, Cuban vice minister of public health,  said we are mutually learning about the social problems of both  nations, particularly in the field of health. This field  represents a common ground among nations and a means for  personal and collective relations inasmuch as the wellbeing of  humanity favors the development of all people, he pointed out.    Ramirez feels that the presence of these delegations  constitutes a stimulus for the professionals and workers in  Cuban public health services who are determined to maintain the  achievements reached in medical assistance despite the difficult  times of the national economy. This is an example for other  sectors of U.S. society, he added, and on our part we are  committed to improve these meetings which could cover many more  topics.    To this effect, Smith said other visits by professionals to  Cuba will continue to be organized by the Center of  International Policy.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Cost probe on nursery teaching Mr John Major, the prime minister, has ordered an inquiry into the cost implications of introducing nursery provision for all children under the age of five. Mr Eric Forth, junior education minister, told the Commons last night that whether or not attendance should be mandatory or optional, and whether the teachers involved should be graduates were among issues being considered. He suggested that the cost of making the fullest possible provision would be in the region of Pounds 1bn a year.</p>

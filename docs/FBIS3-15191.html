The first batch of  missiles will be sent to Russia in the next few weeks, he told  reporters in Kiev.    Shmarov said that as soon as Russia gives the green light to  the delivery of nuclear fuel to Ukraine, "we will give the green  light to the transfer of nuclear warheads". He said there was  no signal from Russia yet.    The SEGODNYA newspaper referring to well-informed sources  reported on Wednesday that a trainload of Ukrainian nuclear  warheads was due to arrive at a closed town in the Urals on  March 2. It maintains that the first 60 nuclear warheads were  dismantled in the last days of February from the ICBM's deployed  by the 43rd missile army which is stationed in Ukraine.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: GM to sell European luxury car in US General Motors is planning to produce a luxury car in Europe for sale in North America under the Cadillac brand name. The project will mark the US carmaker's first substantial export of cars from Europe to North America since the early 1960s and will be the first European-produced GM car to be sold under a North American nameplate. The programme is expected to be approved in the next few months, with the car going into production in early 1996 in Germany at the Russelsheim plant of Opel, GM's main European subsidiary. The three-litre V6 engines for the car will be produced in the UK at Vauxhall's plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, while automatic transmissions will be made at GM's plant at Strasbourg. At the Detroit motor show yesterday, GM unveiled a prototype version of the car, the Cadillac LSE (Luxury Sedan Euro-style). It will allow the carmaker to compete for the first time with the Japanese luxury car brands Lexus and Infiniti, launched in the US at the end of the 1980s by Toyota and Nissan. The European-built Cadillac is being developed as a derivative of GM Europe's new top-of-the-range Opel/Vauxhall Omega executive car, to be launched in Europe soon. It is understood that GM is aiming to produce in Germany up to 40,000 units a year of the Cadillac. The product marks an important step in the globalisation of GM's vehicle development and engineering, which is seen as a way to cut costs and make better use of the company's worldwide resources. GM is also planning for the first time to export to Europe a version of its next generation US-produced MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) for sale under the Opel/Vauxhall badges, to compete with vehicles such as the Renault Espace. Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, yesterday said the programme for a European-produced Cadillac was 'one of the most significant intern-ational projects GM had under-taken'. The new car represented a cost-effective way to integrate the group's global resources 'with a fraction of the investment' that it would have taken under the more traditional approach of developing the car in North America. 'It makes little sense to build duplicate components or near-duplicate platforms (chassis) for different regional market segments, when one region can adapt or tailor what is being developed for another,' he said.</p>

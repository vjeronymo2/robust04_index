			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INSTRUCTING MIGRANTS  </P> <P> I live in an area of North County with a desperate problem with migrant  workers. I have a suggestion for the Rev. Rafael Martinez who is highly  respected for his work with the migrant workers.  </P> <P> As a liaison between the citizens of North County and the workers, he has the  power to create an atmosphere of harmony or animosity. He can explain to them  what is acceptable and lawful behavior in our country and what is not.  </P> <P> A case in point is the community where I live. It has been estimated that it  will cost us at least $6,000 a year to remove the litter and fecal matter left  by the migrant workers who have been camping less than 75 feet from our condos.  We are required by law to do so.  </P> <P> We are an elderly group of retired teachers, farmers, veterans, etc., of very  modest means. Our age and lack of physical agility precludes us from cleaning  it up ourselves, and the cost of hiring it done is prohibitive. We do not  expect the migrants to "disappear." We just feel that, along with the privilege  of living in this country, goes the responsibility of living by our laws.  </P> <P> BETTY ANDERSON  </P> <P> Encinitas  </P></p>

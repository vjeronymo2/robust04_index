			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Mandela eases himself into S Africa's media spotlight - Patti Waldmeir witnesses a profound shift in the balance of power AT times of great national crisis, South Africans are accustomed to seeing their leader address them on national television. But now, as the country faces perhaps its greatest political crisis to date, the face on prime time television screens is not Mr F W de Klerk, the president, but Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress. When Mr Chris Hani, the guerrilla leader, was assassinated, Mr Mandela broadcast a live address to appeal for calm. On the eve of last Wednesday's national day of mourning, Mr Mandela addressed the nation at 7pm, 8pm and 11pm. For his part, Mr de Klerk issued a statement from his seaside holiday home, via his press secretary resting at another holiday resort. There can be no clearer evidence of the profound shift which has occurred in the balance of power between white and black. The ruling National Party still insists that it will never 'hand over power' to blacks; but most of their supporters think they have already done so. Gone are the days when Mr P W Botha, the former president, would simply declare a nationwide state of emergency and detain 50,000 people to deal with a crisis. Mr de Klerk's language over the past few days has recalled the hardline rhetoric of the finger-wagging former President. But he cannot match him in action. The fact is that Mr de Klerk cannot rule South Africa without Mr Mandela's help. With his dark threats against 'radicals' (which he knows he cannot carry out without sparking civil war) and his frantic warnings of a descent into chaos, Mr de Klerk has cut a somewhat pathetic figure in recent days. He may be President, but Mr Mandela is South Africa's leader. This was never more apparent than when the ANC leader dominated TV screens on Tuesday evening (furious that his address had been cut in half for the 8pm newscast, he insisted on - and was granted - the right to broadcast again in full at 11pm). Speaking with all the dignity and gravitas of the tribal African chieftain which he is, Mr Mandela tried to use his eloquence and authority to heal the racial rift caused by the murder of one of black South Africa's greatest heroes. 'Tonight I am reaching out to every single South African, black and white, from the very depths of my being,' he said. He praised the white woman who had risked her life to identify Mr Hani's assassin and condemned those who would 'plunge our country into another Angola.' 'Now is the time for all South Africans to stand together against those who, from any quarter, wish to destroy what Chris Hani gave his life for - the freedom of all of us.' Mr de Klerk's statements, by contrast, have been clearly partisan in nature, aimed at his white constituents, who have been outraged and terrified by the violence which has followed the assassination. He has showed little understanding of the anger and loss felt by the black majority; his condolences lacked sincerity. Mr de Klerk was no doubt worried that too sympathetic a response would antagonise whites, who largely viewed Mr Hani as a communist demon. But for a man who portrays himself as the natural leader of a multi-racial South Africa, he has showed little ability to bridge the racial gulf. Mr Mandela's leadership abilities are also under severe strain. Dealing with large, young, militant crowds is not his forte. His style of public speaking is pedantic rather than charismatic. And he will have further enraged whites by allowing his more militant ANC colleagues to persuade him that the ANC should carry on mass protest actions for another six weeks. His task is difficult: he must be seen to respond to the anger of militant youths while keeping them under control. It will take a rare man to tread that tightrope for a further six weeks.</p>

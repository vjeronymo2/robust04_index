			<p>BFN     [Text] Before his talks with President Tudjman, Antonio  Martino met his Croatian counterpart Mate Granic and Cardinal  Franjo Kuharic. He gave a news conference this evening.  Tihomir Vinkovic reports:    [Vinkovic] The Italian foreign minister described his talks  with President Tudjman and Foreign Minister Granic as cordial  and useful.    [Begin Martino recording, in Italian with superimposed  Serbo-  Croartian translation] Both sides confirmed their willingness to  strengthen the already good relations, and to overcome current  difficulties. It is necessary to establish a joint commission  to resolve these issues.    Problems of reparations to the Italians who left Croatia  after World War II as well as the question of the Italian  minority have to be resolved through talks. Italy will -- by  resolving the current difficulties and reaching bilateral  agreements -- help the integration of Croatia and Slovenia into  the European Union economic system. [end recording]    [Vinkovic] He was optimistic regarding the resolution of the  issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The forthcoming  meeting in Naples of the G-7 and Russia is important in this  respect. Antonio Martino described the role of Russia in  resolving the problems in southeast Europe as constructive.</p>

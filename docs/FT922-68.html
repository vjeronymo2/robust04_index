			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Employers criticised over performance-related pay MANY EMPLOYERS fail to think through the introduction of performance-related pay in a coherent manner, according to a study published today by the Institute of Manpower Studies. The survey also finds little evidence to demonstrate a causal link between individual performance-releated pay and increases in productivity. Some schemes change employee attitudes, it says, 'but not always in the direction desired'. Performance-related pay has been one of the most significant changes in employers' approaches to pay and personnel in the last decade. It is estimated that about half of Britain's employers have performance-related pay for at least some white-collar and managerial employees. In the report, based in part on studies at 20 organisations, Mr Marc Thompson, an IMS research fellow, finds that many performance-related-pay (PRP) schemes tend to contradict a range of other policies in the organisation, or sit uncomfortably with them. He says: 'The perception of some personnel practitioners was that in order for PRP to be successful, however that may be defined, it probably had a better chance if it was part of a wider and more coherent strategy to raise employee performance.' The study finds that few employers build in a monitoring and evaluation process as part of the scheme's introduction. It also says few realise their schemes could potentially discriminate against women. Pay and Performance: The Employer Experience, IMS Report 218.

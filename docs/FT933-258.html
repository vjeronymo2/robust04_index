			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / New calling beckons for the mobile telephone NINE out of 10 Swedes will have a mobile phone by the end of the decade, by when the portable phone will be a mass consumer product across Europe, the head of Sweden's state mobile communications operator said yesterday. Mr Seth Myrby, chief executive of Telia Mobitel, an offshoot of Sweden's state telecommunications operator, said the next five years would see a 'mobile revolution' as the portable phone was transformed from yuppy accessory to household essential. Addressing the FT's world mobile communications conference in London, he said that almost nine in every 100 Swedes now had a mobile phone, one of the highest ratios in the world. In a pointed reference to the implications of rapid growth for the industry's high prices and margins, Mr Myrby noted that department stores and consumer electronics retailers would become the normal channel for selling mobile phones, 'and they are used to handling consumer goods with much lower margins than is the case with mobile phones today'. Mr John Defeo, chief executive of US West NewVector Group, the US operator, reinforced the message by pointing to the ready availability of high-frequency radio spectrum for operators to offer new mobile services. 'We are in a very different world (from the 1980s)', he said. 'There will be plenty of spectrum to go round. Value will be created through the development of new products and services.' He predicted that the emphasis for the consumer market would be on simple tariff packages.</p>

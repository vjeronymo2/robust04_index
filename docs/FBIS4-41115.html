			<p>BFN     [Text] As has already been reported, Belarusian Prime  Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich is on a short working visit to  Austria. The intention of the visit is to sign a document  securing a $100 million credit to our Republic from the Austrian  Government. Those credits will be used to purchase Russian oil  to meet Belarusian needs and fund its subsequent processing at  the Novopolotsk Oil Refinery. It is planned that a [word  indistinct] portion of the gasoline and other oil products will  be sold on European markets, which will provide hard currency to  repay the credit. Vyachaslaw Kebich held a prolonged meeting  with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky. Also discussed at the  negotiations was the issue of Belarus joining the GATT.  Agreement was reached on all issues.</p>

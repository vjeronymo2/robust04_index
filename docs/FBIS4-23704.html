			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- First Deputy President  Thabo Mbeki publicly took his colleague F W de Klerk to task on  Friday [10 June] for suggesting a truth commission could  undermine the goodwill and sense of national unity which had  begun to take root since President Nelson Mandela's inauguration.    Addressing the World Economic Forum summit in Cape Town, Mr  de Klerk told international business leaders that South Africa  would be foolish if it "precipitately tore out the stitches from  wounds which are only now beginning to heal".    But Mr Mbeki, speaking from the same platform, said his  sister-in-law was still looking for her unionist husband who had  disappeared without trace in Durban about seven years ago. "We  are trying to find him and we are hoping somewhere in South  Africa there is somebody who knows what happened, who will come  and say I am sorry...because of the particular times in which we  were, we took him and because of who he was and what he was  doing, given those times, unfortunately we got rid of him.  That's why you can't find him. Because then his wife and two  children can at last say he is dead and do whatever custom and  tradition demand they do in the circumstances. It's that kind  of truth, (Deputy) President de Klerk, that we are looking for."  His sister-in-law could then become part of the process of  national reconciliation, Mr Mbeki added.    Earlier, Mr de Klerk said South Africa had to be very  careful  how it approached sensitive questions relating to the past,  particularly with regard to amnesty, indemnity and the truth  commission. "We agree that processes have to be developed to  put the political crimes of the past behind us once and for all,  that the wounds of the past must be healed. But such a process  cannot be allowed to develop into a tug of war or even a running  sore which might continue to suppurate for years." The reality,  he said, was that during the past conflict, unacceptable crimes  were committed by followers of all sides and factions. "We have  just completed four years of hard negotiation aimed at resolving  that conflict. We would be foolish if we precipitately tore out  the stitches from wounds which are only now beginning to heal."    Mr de Klerk also said it was important that South Africa  "build well" and not make basic errors that could weaken its  national structure in the future. He had no problem with  affirmative action, but the country should be very careful about  the way it implemented such programmes, and dared not throw  merit out of the window. "Instead of drifting into new  state-sponsored discrimination against some members of our  society, we should redouble our efforts to remove any vestiges  of discrimination against any South African."    Other issues that would have to be handled with sensitivity  and care were land ownership, financial discipline, the size of  the civil service and the funding of the Reconstruction and  Development Programme.</p>

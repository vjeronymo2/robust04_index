			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government's draft package of deregulation  measures, which will form the core of the external economic  policy the government plans to announce on 29 March, is aimed at  promoting imports. In this package, the government expressly  states such principles as the following: 1) to completely  abolish or consider for review all regulations barring the  import of foreign products; 2) to ease the system of standards,  licensing, and labeling to levels comparable to those in other  nations; and 3) to completely abolish dual inspection procedures  whereby products which have been inspected prior to being  shipped from a foreign country are reinspected after being  imported into Japan. It is expected that based on these  principles, the government will consider nearly 100 items for  deregulation.    In February, the government compiled "ways to promote  administrative reforms in the future" (administrative reform  outline), which includes a list of 161 items for deregulation.  Regarding these items, the government expressly states in its  draft deregulation package that a comprehensive draft bill on  deregulation will be submitted during the current Diet session  to implement deregulation promptly.    Ever since the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. framework trade  talks, the United States has stepped up its market-opening  demands against Japan. Taking this into account, the government  has spelled out measures to drastically ease regulations,  standards, and licensing procedures for the import of foreign  products. Concerning discrete Japanese regulations which  virtually bar the import of foreign products, the government  intends to consider plans to completely abolish them, or, if  this is difficult, to at least ease them to the level in other  Western nations.    In addition to such principles, the government plans to  prepare on 29 March a separate list of items for deregulation,  including inspection procedures for electrical appliances and  standards and licensing procedures for automobiles. Moreover,  the Administrative Reform Headquarters working panel on import  promotion, market liberalization, and distribution systems plans  to start on 28 March to hold discussions on items for  deregulation which are to be included in the second stage of the  compilation of the government's external economic policy in late  June. During these discussions, a study will be made of such  matters as regulations on the sales of pharmaceutical products  through mail and the labeling of qualitative indicators on  textile products.</p>

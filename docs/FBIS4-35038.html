			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The national council of CUT [United Labor  Confederation] last night decided to begin a series of rallies  on 11 July in response to what it considers the government's  lack of attention to its petitions.    The resolution was approved unanimously by the 60 council  members who met at CUT headquarters.    On 11 July, called the "Day of National Dignity" in memory  of  the date the copper mines were nationalized in 1971, CUT will  stage two rallies along the Alameda, one beginning at the Plaza  Italia and another in the Central Station.    Among other measures, which will be revealed today, the CUT  national council decided to call a meeting of Confasin (National  Labor Confederations, Federations, and Unions) for 21 June,  during which they will agree on future actions.    Last night CUT appointed a committee that will organize the  rallies and the other activities scheduled by CUT with the  purpose of mobilizing a maximum number of workers.    In the past few days CUT has hardened its criticism of the  current administration.    On 8 June, CUT President Manuel Bustos said that relations  between the government and workers are at a turning point  because of some pending labor reforms.    Bustos said that the workers are demanding changes to the  collective bargains law, the dismissals law, and the National  Training and Employment Service (Sence). He also said that CUT  is willing to discuss the pending problems with the government,  but he expects the government to make some decisions.    CUT Vice President Arturo Martinez said on 13 June that the  rally does not mean a strike, but a call to attention by the  workers.    A series of labor conflicts have taken place at different  companies in the past 15 days during collective labor bargains.  [passage omitted]</p>

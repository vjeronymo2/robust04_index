			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Serbs seek support for rump Yugoslavia SERBIA IS forging ahead with creating a rump Yugoslavia despite the appeal from Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia for recognition as independent republics. Mr Borisav Jovic, Serbia'a representative on the Serb-controlled state presidency, yesterday went to the United Nations in an effort gather international support for the new Yugoslav state. A Serbian government statement said: 'It is in the interest of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia to remain part of Yugoslavia, because of the high degree of integration and common interests,' Borba, a Belgrade daily, reported yesterday. Serbia this week announced a draft law as 'the basis for the historic reconstruction of Yugoslavia'. The law says local elections could be held by autumn for a provisional constitutional assembly comprised of 30 representatives from each republic. Under President Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia has insisted that Yugoslavia continues to exist even after the international recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Serbia is now stepping up pressure on Bosnia and Macedonia to remain part of a revamped Yugoslavia. The parliament of Bosnia is tomorrow expected to approve a referendum on independence for the central republic's 4.4m population of Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats. Even Montenegro, Serbia's closest ally, this spring plans to hold an independence referendum. Macedonia has recalled its representatives from the dwindling ranks of the federal parliament and foreign ministry. Bosnia and Macedonia have announced plans to introduce their own currencies, following the lead of Slovenia and Croatia. This would leave Serbia and tiny Montenegro as the only republics still using the Yugoslav dinar. Critics dismiss Serbia's plans to resuscitate Yugoslavia as an attempt to inherit the common property of the 73-year-old state. The borders of the new state have yet to be determined. Tanjug said: 'The borders would be democratically agreed by the nations which wish to remain in Yugoslavia.' However, the prospects for peaceful negotiations over borders remain slim. The Serb-dominated federal army controls one third of Croatia's territory, where local Serb leaders say they refuse to be part of an independent Croatia. Talks between the Croatian and federal military in Pecs, southern Hungary, late Tuesday night broke down when the two sides could not agree on the conditions of the army withdrawal from Croatia.</p>

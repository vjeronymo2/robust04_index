Three months ago, Jobim was  elected rapporteur of the constitutional revision process--the  corrections that are to be made in the 1988 Constitution. He has  had not a moment's peace since then. After barely two weeks as  rapporteur, he had to swap his cellular telephone with a friend  and install an answering machine in his house. Jobim spends  hardly any time at home now. He eats, drinks, and sleeps  constitutional revision. "During the day, I even drink tea and  coffee while talking about the revision," the deputy joked. The  task is Herculean. The deadline for submission of amendments has  now expired; there are a total of 17,000 suggestions. All of  them will pass through a screening process coordinated by Jobim,  who will have four deputy rapporteurs to help him with the job.    So far, all this work on a subject as important as the  constitutional revision has been obscured by the Budget CPI  [Congressional Investigating Committee]. Legislators will have  to work hard from now on, if the revision is to be finished by  15 March, the date set by Congress for promulgation of the  revised text. The importance of the subject merits such an  effort. "The country needs this revision," Jobim said. "The  bottlenecks that hold back production and the economy are in the  tax area, and in the concentration of monopolies in the hands of  the government." At age 47, married, three children, an attorney  on leave from his partnership in a law firm with offices in  Brasilia and Rio Grande do Sul, Jobim will have even more work  to do between now and 15 March. He wants to end government  monopolies, change the social security system, establish an  external control over the judiciary, and approve a tax reform  package that will reduce the number of taxes and increase the  number of taxpayers. Last week, in the midst of reading the  proposed amendments, the deputy gave VEJA the following  interview:    [Costa Pinto] Are you sure we are going to get a revision?    [Jobim] Yes, we will get a revision. All we need to do to  make this more obvious to the general public is to agree on a  minimum agenda listing the topics of the revision. Starting this  week, I will hold separate conversations with all the party  leaders to reach such an understanding. I am going to talk to  parties that oppose the revision, such as the PT [Workers  Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], PC do B [Communist Party  of Brazil], and the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]. We will  start the debate on the revision by discussing legislative  immunity, a subject on which those parties cannot fail to  express an opinion. Once we have given it an initial kick, the  revision will get moving.    [Costa Pinto] What will be on this minimum agenda?    [Jobim] The agenda will represent a consensus of my  conversations with the leaders. I see two blocs of issues.  One--economic--includes tax reform, changes in the monopoly  system, and restructuring of the pact between the federal  government and the states. The other--political--concerns  modifying the elections system.    [Costa Pinto] Will the revision generate a revised and  expanded, or a revised and abridged, edition of the Constitution?    [Jobim] As rapporteur, I want to produce an abridged version  of the Constitution. We have made a rule: no inventions. There  is no room for unnecessary novelties, for creating new issues  and new chapters. To the extent that more issues are placed into  the Constitution, the powers of Congress are reduced and those  of the judges, of the Judiciary, expanded. The  constitutionalization of subject matter leads to the  jurisdictionalization of politics, i.e., giving the Federal  Supreme Court an opportunity to rule on everything that is done  in this country, because everything becomes a constitutional  matter; this curtails the freedom of the Executive Branch and  the legislators.    [Costa Pinto] How will the Congress find time to debate the  merits of the 17,000 amendments submitted for the constitutional  revision?    [Jobim] We are not going to discuss the amendments one by  one, only the topics of the revision and their merits. We have  received 80 amendments that regulate the president's use of  "provisional measures." I will not read all of them. We need to  find out what the majority thinks about the subject and then  draft consensus amendments inspired by those 80 original  amendments. You would not believe how much repetition there is  in those 17,000 amendments.    [Costa Pinto] Is the 1988 Constitution that bad?    [Jobim] I would divide the 1988 Constitution into two parts.  The part on individual rights and guarantees, which is very  good, and the part on the design of the State--which is faulty.  We must redefine federalism and the system of government,  because the Constitution is very unsatisfactory on those points.  We have to do something about the Judiciary, an area where the  1988 Constituent Assembly made no progress at all. The way money  is spent in Brazil is wrong, and the CPI's are proof of that.  When we drafted the present Constitution, we were looking  backward. Everything that the military had done looked wrong to  us. That is not reality.    [Costa Pinto] It is not for lack of laws that Brazil is in  crisis. Do we really need this revision, which is, after all, a  process of enacting new laws?    [Jobim] We do. The bottlenecks that hold back production and  the economy are in the tax area, and in the concentration of  monopolies in the hands of the government. In 1988, we gave  special favors to outmoded monopolistic protectionism, something  very common in mercantile capitalism, and we forgot to protect  the user, the consumer--in short, the taxpayer. We ended up  creating an economy of special privilege, a monopolistic economy  that leans toward statism, that does not protect the ordinary  Brazilian. This habit of creating laws is a fault we inherited  from the Portuguese. They thought they could resolve things that  way, and even today they have one of the world's most  complicated bureaucracies. But, on the other hand, you cannot  modernize institutions without enacting laws. Our big mistake  was to transform laws into speeches, making everything polemic.    [Costa Pinto] In an election year, will legislators be  capable of drafting a Constitution that reduces the size of the  State, changes the tax system, ends retirement based on length  of service, and redistributes the obligations between governors  and mayors?    [Jobim] Administrative decentralization is one of the  strongest trends that is emerging in this revision. It is a way  of redesigning the State by redoing the federative pact. The CPI  on PC Farias concluded that the corruption of the Executive  Branch was possible only because of the concentration of powers  in the hands of the president of the Republic and the ministers.  States and cities, which won more revenues starting in 1988,  must now assume new obligations, and the federal bureaucracy  that is entrenched in Brasilia opposes this, because it would  curb Brasilia's power. The suppliers are another group that is  rising up against decentralization. It is easier to corrupt a  centralized State--you just go to Brasilia--than to travel  around the country buying special privileges. With  administrative decentralization, you also dilute the power of  politicians, who love to propagate problems so they can sell  solutions. This renovation of the State has to be part of the  party discourse. One legislator cannot take an unpopular  position like this because he will get burned, but the parties  have an obligation to adopt this line. After all, if they expect  to come to power, they need to be concerned about what they will  inherit.    [Costa Pinto] Why, and by whom, was the agreement made not  to  meddle with the so-called "social conquests" of the 1988  Constitution?    [Jobim] I did that. Early last year, I was at a meeting of  businessmen in Porto Alegre, attended by American economists,  and everyone jumped all over the rights of workers as stated in  the Constitution. I told them that if they thought the purpose  of the revision was to take away worker rights, they were not  only mistaken, but they would kill all chances of accomplishing  anything. The revision would become ideologized, and centrist  parties like the PMDB and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] would be shoved over toward the Left and forced to forge  alliances with the PT and the communist parties. I made them  realize that the important thing is to change the economic order  and the social security system, end the monopolies, and  modernize the federative pact. After that, the leaders of the  PMDB and PSDB agreed to take a firm stand against changes in the  social conquests. The PFL [Liberal Front Party] did not take a  position, making it clear that it would go along with that  agreement.    [Costa Pinto] Two polls, one by Diap and another by  MultiConsultoria, found that more than 70 percent of the  legislators want to change the electoral system by instituting  mixed district voting. What kind of election system is Brazil  likely to have after the revision?    [Jobim] The trend I have observed in the amendments  submitted  is toward the mixed district vote. Our election system has  outlived its usefulness. It dates from 1932, which was the  Getulio Vargas era, when Minas and Sao Paulo were taking turns  electing the presidents, when there were no political parties.  After this revision, we will probably have election of regional  deputies and national deputies. The current election system is  brutal: it induces the country not to think. No one gets elected  on national issues.    [Costa Pinto] Might the revision vote on only the most  pressing topics now and leave the rest to 1995?    [Jobim] No. There will be only one revision. The revision  proposed by the 1988 Constituent Assembly has to begin and end  without intermissions. And how could we carry out a revision in  1995, with a new Congress and a new president? If new the  president has a majority, he would conduct a revision in his  image and likeness. If he is weak, he would become a hostage to  Congress.    [Jobim] From what you have already read of the amendments in  the tax area, what model of tax collection and how many taxes  are likely to survive in the revised Constitution?    [Costa Pinto] There are eight kinds of complete proposals  for  tax reform. Six of them retain the classic concept of taxation  on income, consumption, and property. What almost all of them  have in common is elimination of points of over-taxation, such  as a reduction in the burden on payrolls, in exchange for a new  withholding tax rate of 5 percent that would catch all wages and  salaries. There are also two more radical proposals, such as the  one by Flavio Rocha, which would leave Brazil with only three  taxes: the IPMF [Provisional Tax on Financial Operations], the  tax on foreign trade, and a tax on beverages and games of  chance. Then there is a proposal by Deputy Luis Roberto Ponte  that would leave us with eight taxes.    [Costa Pinto] Will Brazil have fewer state enterprises and  be  free of the monopolies after 1994?    [Jobim] The state enterprises are the thorn in the side of  this revision, and this country. The State is no longer an agent  of production as it was in the 1950's and 1960's. State  enterprises are not a subject of the constitutional  revision--monopolies are. Today we have three big state  monopolies: petroleum, telecommunications, and nuclear energy.  No amendments suggest changes in the nuclear field. As for  petroleum, some amendments that would completely abolish the  monopoly, leaving Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]  with nothing to do. Others seek a middle ground--maintaining the  monopoly on exploration and drilling for petroleum in the hands  of Petrobras and privatizing the refining and distribution. Then  there are amendments that would allow private enterprise to  enter all phases, by government concession. The problems in  telecommunications are exactly the same, and the proposals are  similar. Now from what I have already seen and discussed in the  Congress, I can say with certainty that the monopolies will not  stay the way they are. How they will change, I cannot yet say.  We need to get a feeling as to what kind of State the majority  of congressmen want. An interventionist State? A regulatory  State? A do-nothing State? This issue will split the body  between neoliberals, advocates of greater flexibility, and  statists.    [Costa Pinto] Hasn't the attention paid to the Budget CPI  cooled off the debates on the constitutional revision?    [Jobim] Actually, it was a good thing that the spotlights  were turned toward the CPI. Without unproductive debates on  bureaucracy, the revision was able to get a head start on its  deadlines and only now, when ideology and the different parties'  plans for Brazil are coming to the fore, will we go back to  discussing ideas. That is why the CPI did not hurt us, it  helped. Now that the CPI's deadline has been extended to the  24th, voting on the revision could start on the 26th.    [Costa Pinto] But the revision has to end on 15 March. And  Carnival falls in the middle of that period. Isn't that too  little time for the public to participate in the revision?    [Jobim] The timetable is certainly tight, but the public  should and will participate in the debate. But I must remind you  that this is not a Constituent Assembly, and nothing is going to  be invented. We are only going to rewrite and delete. Tax  reform, which is perhaps the most controversial topic and the  one that most directly affects the average citizen, has been  under discussion for two years now. The rest are well-known  topics--they may be controversial because they are ideological,  but I do not see the general public mobilizing against the  revision. The vested interests are against it, yes. But it seems  to me that they are also against citizens and taxpayers.    [Costa Pinto] How can a good Constitution prevent, or at  least make it more difficult for thieves to get into the  political machinery and how can it prevent reruns of CPI's like  the ones on PC Farias and the budget?    [Jobim] We can close the loopholes in the Constitution that  are open to corruption. We do not need to stiffen the penalties  against corrupt individuals, what we need to do is prevent  corruption by reducing the size of the State. If Brasilia's  power over the aspirations of Brazil is diminished and the  oversight mechanisms are strengthened, we will have made a fine  contribution to this country. Increasing the repressive  machinery does not reduce corruption; on the contrary, it raises  the stakes in the battle of good versus evil, and makes the  corrupt more creative.    [Costa Pinto] Will the revision tend to improve the  relationship between the executive, judicial, and legislative  branches, or will the three parties continue to clash with each  other?    [Jobim] The American Constitution created three branches of  government so that they could share the power. Now--and this is  not merely a Brazilian phenomenon--we have separate institutions  that fight among themselves for the power to be a branch of  government. The Executive Branch wants to be the Legislative  Branch and get rid of the Judiciary. The Legislative loves to  play at being the Executive, and the Judiciary likes to be all  three together. In a democratic state, power exists only if  those who hold it are responsible to the nation. There is a  social duty to be accountable to the ordinary people, but none  of the three branches permit administrative oversight and they  do not have independent sources of revenue. When people talk  about external control over the Judiciary, they are talking  about the rendering of an administrative and financial  accounting. On that point I will not yield. There is no  justification for a superior court judge--in Brasilia for  example--to take two years to write up the opinion on a decision  on which the full court has voted. The decision is not valid  until the opinion has been issued, so why is that judge holding  back those opinions? I don't know. But that situation exists,  and it is going on right now.    [Costa Pinto] And the PMDB? Don't you feel uncomfortable  belonging to a party that is the target of so many charges of  corruption, one that has no platform?    [Jobim] We must not confuse personal relationships with  political ones. The problem with the PMDB is that we have no  party line. We have nothing to say to the country. We have no  platform and no model for Brazil. Having a platform is crucial  to party unity. If it does not exist, then unity moves into the  personal field. In 1994, we peemedebistaswill take  refuge in our regional realities and will, in the last analysis,  be absent from the national political debate. We in Rio Grande  do Sul decided not to leave the party because southerners have a  hard time understanding such changes. We decided to stay and  fight to purge the party of the bad apples and give the party a  purpose.    [Costa Pinto] If Quercia or Sarney get control of the PMDB  machine and become viable presidential candidacies, would you  vote for them?    [Jobim] There is no possibility of my voting for either of  them. I would even work against them, and would urge the PMDB in  Rio Grande do Sul to rebel against them.    [Costa Pinto] Does the fact that the government has had no  leader in the Chamber for three weeks now, and has not submitted  proposals for the revision help, or hinder?    [Jobim] The administration's absence from the revision is  unfortunate. The logic of the presidential system of government  depends heavily on the president of the Republic. He sets the  tone for the opposition. We lack an opposition simply because  there is a feeling that we also lack a government. Itamar has  forgotten that he sits in a chair where one is supposed to think  about the country.    [Costa Pinto] And Itamar--does he help, or hinder?    [Jobim] He neither helps nor hinders, and that's the worst  of  it. He is neglecting his duties. His administration lacks  substance. It's spongy. One minister pulls the government to  one side, wanting to enact a tax reform and balance the books,  but another minister wants to rehire 100,000 civil servants.  Itamar is the head of a government that lacks direction. Note  that I am not questioning the president's intentions--only the  way he is doing his job.</p>

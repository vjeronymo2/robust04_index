			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We are witnessing the final hours of formalism in  the practice of the Cuban labor union movement. We no longer  patiently accept the repetitive rhetoric uttered by those who  are constantly emitting general slogans but who barely broach  the specific and objective reality on which they should act.  This is the opening sentence of the editorial printed in today's  TRABAJADORES newspaper entitled: "Who Are the Drafters of Our  Policies?"    The editorial continues: We are not talking about the labor  unions getting away from politics and ideological work. It is  time that we realize the labor union movement's singular  political responsibility for education in the battle for  survival, as well as for later, when we enter a world that will  be different in many ways.    The editorial points out the need for labor unions to be  part  of all of today's and tomorrow's political battles. The  editorial underscores: It is necessary to be on the offensive at  all times. The time when the tradition was to wait for the  decisions from the top for every movement and every action is  over. The article reaffirms: That is why we proudly salute all  the labor union leaders who have been struggling decisively to  maintain a high level of morale, discipline, and order in their  work centers.    The editorial goes on to say that nothing can be more  demoralizing than idleness, indolence, negligence, shoddiness,  the lack of control over production costs and other expenses,  embezzlement of resources, and the waste that characterizes the  atmosphere of some work centers. The editorial stresses: The  objectives and general principles by which the workers and their  labor union representatives should guide themselves have already  been established. These principles stem from an analysis of the  situation the country faces and the predictable path we will  have to travel to change it.    It is necessary that the labor union leaders assume their  role of revolutionary activists, their role as leaders capable  of explaining to and informing workers of the general situation  of the country and what the workers can do at their work centers  to fight back and improve the situation. The article also refers  to the need to profoundly debate the topics related to financial  organization, because what is being attempted has to be  congruent with the idea that workers are the owners; therefore,  the solutions should be based on the consensus of the work force.</p>

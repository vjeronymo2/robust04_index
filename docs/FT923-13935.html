			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Revlon scales back stock offering REVLON, the US cosmetics and consumer products company taken over by Mr Ronald Perelman, the corporate raider, is to scale back sharply the size of its planned common stock offering to 11m shares from 20m. The company blamed the generally poor market conditions for equity deals, Reuter reports from New York. Mr James Conroy, Revlon senior vice-president for corporate affairs and special counsel, said the company had also reduced the target price for the shares to a range of Dollars 14 to Dollars 15 a share from Dollars 19. This means Revlon will raise roughly Dollars 145m instead of nearly Dollars 400m originally planned.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Tyminski leads 'X' party MR STANISLAW Tyminski, the main populist challenger to Poland's ruling Solidarity establishment, was formally voted in yesterday as leader of his new 'X' party at a congress in Warsaw. The Polish-Canadian businessman has been barred from running for parliament in elections expected this autumn, following a new electoral law requiring five years' residence to become a deputy. The electoral law, approved by the Sejm, the parliament's lower chamber, on Friday, has yet to be passed by the upper house. It adopts a proportional system for the Sejm favouring smaller parties. The Senate will be elected on a first-past-the-post system. The 'X' party's delegates, representing some 5,000 members, met behind closed doors with officials promising details of its programme later in the week.</p>

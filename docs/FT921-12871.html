			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Saint-Gobain slides 25% to FFr2.5bn SAINT-GOBAIN, the leading French glass, pipes and building materials group, yesterday reported a 25 per cent decline on last year's profits, indicating a slight recovery from the 40 per cent fall in the first half. Net profits fell from FFr3.35bn (Dollars 610m) to FFr2.5bn, on sales up by 9 per cent, from FFr69.07bn in 1990 to FFr75.05bn last year. All of the sale increase came from the first full-year incorporation of Norton, the US abrasives group, and Solaglas, the British building glass-producer, both bought in early 1990. Stripping these out, sales fell by 1 per cent. Flat glass prices improved slightly towards the end of last year, while volume growth has started to slacken in Germany. Sales remain depressed in France and show little sign of recovery in the US, said Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, the chairman.</p>

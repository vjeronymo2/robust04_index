			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates unsettled THE uncertainty surrounding the franc continued to unsettle the outlook for French money market rates yesterday, writes Stephanie Flanders. In a widely expected move, the Bundesbank yesterday set a variable 14-day repo tender, switching back from last week's fixed rate pact. Traders now expect the German central bank to allow some fall from last week's 7.30 per cent rate, in order to support the French authorities. Few traders now consider a cut in the German Lombard or discount rates to be very likely tomorrow, especially since the pressure on the franc seems to have lost some of its earlier momentum. Once again, French money market rates caught some of the uncertainty. Three-month rates ended at around 7.50 per cent, down from the previous close of 7.87 per cent. Earlier, trading had taken rates as low as 7.37 per cent. Some considered the fall in three-month money to reflect a realisation that there was little sense expecting France to increase interest rates at present, given the country's economic weakness. This view was supported in a poll taken by IDEA, the London-based financial information company, showing that 78 per cent of the dealers polled did not think that the French would raise interest rates. The Bank of England took the sting out of a moderate Pounds 900m shortfall in early round discount market dealing. The remaining shortage took somewhat longer to despatch, with the markets trading at close to 6 per cent throughout the day. Overnight rates conformed with this pattern, at 5 7/8 per cent. Further out, the London money markets reacted with guarded optimism to the favourable domestic output figures announced in the morning. The 2 per cent rise in May industrial production and 1.8 per cent increase in manufacturing output were significantly higher than pre-dicted. Although wary of reading too much into one, possibly rogue, figure, traders felt that the data had dented hopes of an imminent cut in interest rates. 'Optimists have looked forward with almost tunnel vision to a cut in rates, no matter what,' said one London trader. 'It is healthy that this has been punctured, but one output figure does not change the belief that rates will eventually fall.'</p>

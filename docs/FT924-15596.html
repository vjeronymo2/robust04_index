			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Gardening: Teaching the apple to eat its own worm IN THE fruit world, the emphasis on pest and disease control is changing from reliance on chemicals to breeding natural resistance into plants so they need to be sprayed less often or, preferably, not at all. This I learnt during a visit to the Institute of Horticultural Research at East Malling, Kent, the leading fruit research station in Britain. Some of the progress made is based on work that started a long time ago, the full potential of which was not realised until the recent disillusionment with the long-term effectiveness of chemicals and their effects on the environment. Thirty years ago, for example, Dr Ray Watkins was beginning to look for new apple tree root stocks which, in addition to restricting the growth of the apple varieties grafted on them, would also be resistant to woolly aphid and crown rot. It would also give a better uptake of calcium which would improve crop storage. These new root stocks were collectively known under the letters AR to distinguish them from the MM root stocks raised at East Malling. Little has been heard of them and I do not think that any AR root stock has been released for commercial use. However, this is likely to change for much new breeding is going on and some of the results look promising. One AR root stock has already been identified which could provide a replacement for the much-used MM106. It was at East Malling that the self-pruning, columnar apple trees - some are marketed as Ballerina apple trees - were produced. The breeding work continues and one red-fruited variety, Teleman, looks particularly promising. There is also a search for resistance to scab disease and mildew. Efforts are being made to ensure regular bearing by a method which is new to me. This is based on belief that it is the production of seeds that really puts a strain on the apple trees, reducing the production of fruit buds for the following year. Some apple varieties, such as Wellington Bloomless and Spencers Seedless, can produce fruit without seeds and some columnar trees with this characteristic are on trial at East Malling. Another approach to regular cropping in apples is to produce varieties with flowers that are tolerant to frost or those which produce pollen which will fertilise at quite low temperatures. One such variety, Falstaff, is already on the market and doing well. It is a regular cropper and an excellent pollenator for other varieties including Fiesta, another fine East Malling introduction. Falstaff also has the merit of being self fertile. Both Fiesta and Falstaff figure prominently in current East Malling apple breeding because of their commercial success. To give some idea of the scale of breeding that is necessary to get results quickly, 30,000 seedlings from these and other varieties have been produced. Of these 1,500 have been selected for fruiting and 10 have gone on to the national food trials at Brogdale, Faversham, Kent. The search for resistance to scab disease and mildew continues. So far the most promising seedling has Fiesta as one of its parents, the other being an unnamed seedling selected at East Malling for its high resistance to both these diseases. It is hoped that in about 10 years the scab-free commercial apple will be a reality. Even resistance to apple canker, troublesome on some varieties, is being investigated. Breeders will say no more than that sources of resistance to this most intractable of diseases have been located. Similar work is being done with pears and an improvement in the popular Concord, which was bred at East Malling, is being sought. Again, attention is being given to disease resistance, most particularly to fireblight which, when it occurs, means the destruction of affected trees. Strawberries are an important crop at East Malling and here again high priority is being given to improvement in pest and disease resistance, notably to verticillium wilt, powdery mildew and the two-spotted mite. Pegasus is an example of a recent introduction with a useful level of resistance both to verticillium wilt and to crown rot. It is said to grow well on heavy soils. Calypso, which is not yet available to home gardeners, is an everbearing strawberry with fruits that are less susceptible to mildew than those of Rapello, the variety it most closely resembles. Unfortunately its leaves are susceptible so it must be sprayed.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Minister warns of Scottish 'grievances' THE government must frame policies which are not only good for Scotland but which are acceptable to most Scots if the union is not to lose sympathy and support, a senior Scottish Office minister said yesterday. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, minister of state for Scotland, said he believed Scotland would now 'enter a post-devolution era' after the defeat in the general election of the Labour party, which had proposed a devolved Scottish parliament. The credibility of Labour's devolution proposals was in tatters and the Scottish party had split into factions ranging from those who wanted to play down the constitutional issue to those who were crypto-nationalists, Lord Fraser told Conservatives in Nottingham. He added that the threat to the union would return 'unless we deal with the perceived grievances and concerns which caused it to appear in the first place'. The Conservative's success in the election had given the party 'a tremendous opportunity to make a new start in Scotland'. Lord Fraser, who has responsibility for constitutional affairs in Scotland, gave no indication of any new ideas the government is considering for the government of Scotland. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has said the government is 'taking stock' of the issue. As an illustration of the government's new approach to running Scotland, Lord Fraser said that the test for membership of health boards and of health trust boards would be 'real skills, drive and determination to provide first-class health in the 1990s'. This was taken as a signal that the government would no longer confine appointments to health boards to people with Conservative sympathies, as has happened in the past few years.</p>

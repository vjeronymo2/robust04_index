			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1982, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed advisory levels for vomitoxin in wheat and wheat products to assist States and others in use and disposition. On September 16, 1993, FDA issued updated advisories for certain human food and animal feed products containing vomitoxin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's new advisories set the level for vomitoxin in finished wheat products intended for human consumption at 1 part per million (ppm). Levels were not established for wheat intended for milling because milling processes used to produce flour substantially reduce vomitoxin levels, to varying degrees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's new advisories also set levels for products intended for use as animal feed. Grains and grain by-products destined for ruminating beef and feedlot cattle older than 4 months or chickens were set at 10 ppm provided these products do not exceed 50 percent of their diet. Grains and grain by-products destined for swine and all other animals were set at 5 ppm provided these products do not exceed 20 percent of the swine diet or 40 percent of the diet for all other animals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the grain industry in the marketing of wheat, FGIS had offered vomitoxin testing at its Commodity Testing Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. The TLC analysis is very time consuming, thus limiting the number of analyses available in a single day. Providing the service under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 also limits the availability of service since it is provided only by FGIS and State cooperators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the widespread occurrence of scab this year in certain areas of the country and the market's demand for rapid, onsite testing capabilities, FGIS decided it is in the best interest of the grain industry to offer vomitoxin testing as an official service at field locations using quick test kits under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act. This action permits FGIS, delegated States, and designated agencies to provide the grain industry with official service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGIS evaluated the cost of providing this service and established different fees for qualitative and quantitative analyses. FGIS fees for vomitoxin testing will also vary depending on whether the service is initiated as an original FGIS inspection or as an appeal inspection of an original service provided by an official agency. FGIS fees for vomitoxin testing services initiated as an original FGIS inspection service are $7.50 per test for qualitative analysis and $12.00 per test for quantitative analysis plus the applicable hourly rate per service representative required to obtain a sample and perform the test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGIS fees for vomitoxin testing services initiated at the appeal inspection level are $35.00 per test (regular workday) and $44.00 per test (nonregular workday) for qualitative analysis, except as otherwise provided for in fee Schedule A. For quantitative testing, the fees are $40.00 per test (regular workday) and $50.00 per test (nonregular workday). This fee per test does not include a sampling fee. Delegated States and designated agencies are responsible for establishing their fees subject to approval by FGIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comment Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FGIS received two comments during the comment period announced in the September 23, 1993, interim rule (58 FR 49421). Both comments supported the action to offer the service as official criteria under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter encouraged FGIS to place emphasis on ensuring vomitoxin testing is done at origin, and to promote further test kit research and development to increase test speed and reduce costs, and to improve accuracy and consistency. The commenter also requested that FGIS confirm that the rule would not mandate ``official'' testing or prohibit or restrict unofficial vomitoxin testing agreed to by the buyer and seller. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Widespread occurrences of vomitoxin in the United States are very unusual in wheat and similar grains. This year's (1993) weather conditions in certain areas of the country led to scab infection in wheat. Thus the occurrence of vomitoxin is a localized problem. FGIS believes that requiring vomitoxin testing at origin would impede the orderly marketing of grain. In addition, this action permits FGIS, delegated States, and designated agencies to provide, upon request, to the grain industry official vomitoxin testing services for grain under the authority of the USGSA. An applicant for service can request vomitoxin testing at any time. However, buyers and sellers may agree to do otherwise. FGIS has and will continue to encourage vomitoxin test kit research and development to increase test speed and reduce costs, and to improve accuracy and consistency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

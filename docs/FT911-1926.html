			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Fizz goes out of champagne exports CHAMPAGNE exports have gone flat as recession, rising prices and the Gulf crisis have taken the fizz out of buyers' appetite for high-priced bubbles. Shipments to the British market - traditionally the largest export outlet for champagne - halved in the first three months of this year, as total exports fell by 28 per cent to 12.2m bottles. Germany, whose champagne consumption has in the past run at little more than half the UK's, was the only country to record higher shipments in the first quarter, with a rise of 3 per cent to 2.6m bottles making it for the first time champagne's biggest export market. The shipment figures may be distorted by dealers' running down stocks. But even the depletion figures, which reflect actual sales, are expected to show that there has been a substantial slip in consumption. 'The first phenomenon is the Gulf: for the first three months of the year the big hotels and restaurants of London, places like the Dorchester, were virtually empty, and the same is true around the world in places like the Mamounia in Morocco,' comments Mr Frederic Heidsieck, export director of Louis Roederer. Mr Heidsieck also fears that champagne prices in many countries may have reached or exceeded the levels that the trade has long regarded as psychological limits: Pounds 15, BFr1,000 or DM50 a bottle. If these thresholds have as much power as some shippers fear, drinkers may turn to the high quality sparkling wines now produced in countries like Spain and Australia - often by traditional French houses in search of diversification. Grape in these countries cost only FFr2.50 or FFr5 a kilogram, whereas in Champagne grapes rose last year to a minimum of FFr32 a kilo, following the ending of a trade agreement that had governed prices for 30 years. However, champagne makers are putting a brave face on the plunge in shipments. They say that many brands raised their prices by 10 to 15 per cent on January 1, so dealers who had stocked up before this increase reduced their orders as they sold off their old stock. 'It is clear the champagne market is less easy than it was, but the situation is still not dramatic, and in April we began to feel the first tremors of a revival,' commented an official of Moet et Chandon, the champagne market leader. Mr Claude Taittinger, head of the champagne house that bears his name and chairman of the federation of French wine and spirits exporters, says: 'The first quarter was not good, but we are now entering a new phase with some reassuring phenomena.' In any case, dwindling demand will probably not force champagne prices down. Frost, which hit around 30 per cent of the Champagne area's vineyards last month, seems likely to curb this year's supply enough to prevent any price slump - even if many of the affected vines may flower again, and even if the worst of the frost was in the lower quality Aube and Aisne districts, not in the grand cru areas of the Marne.</p>

Last year, public security organs cracked a total of 1.21  million criminal cases which occurred in the current year, a  12.3-percent increase over 1992, and cracked some 290,000 cases  which occurred in the previous year. Their ability to crack  criminal cases has obviously improved and efforts against  criminal activities have been stepped up.    Of the 1.617 million criminal reports received by public  security organs across the country in 1993, 539,000 were very  serious cases, an 18-percent increase over 1992.    At present, public security problems in a few cities and  counties are comparatively salient and the masses there have  reacted strongly to this. The Ministry of Public Security has  already urged public security organs in all localities to step  up blows and to mainly straighten out order in a few areas where  public security problems are salient.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEWS;  </P> <P> THE RIME AND REASON OF STORIES COLDLY TOLD;  </P> <P> THE SNOWY EKTACHROME PRINT LANDSCAPES OF LARRY JOHNSON ARE BRACING . . . AND  UNNERVING.  </P> <P> Judging from his exceptional new Ektachrome prints on view at the Stuart Regen  Gallery in West Hollywood, it is the winter of Larry Johnson's discontent.  Figuratively and literally.  </P> <P> Here, discontent signifies the opposite of contentment, but it flatly means the  opposite of content, or essential meaning, too. Johnson's large-scale pictures,  which feel as empty as the vacuum of outer space, are radically drained of  typical notions of visual meaning. Each features a snowy landscape, but it's  more than just the image that generates their frostbitten coldness.  </P> <P> Johnson's pictures -- they're photographic, but it doesn't do to call them  photographs -- feature text-laden signs incongruously planted in Disney-like  renditions of icy, winter fields. Each Ektachrome print began as a small  landscape painting. Commercially printed text was then added to a space left  for the sign, and the whole thing was photographed. One print, enlarged to as  much as 5 by 7 feet, was made, and the small painting destroyed. Each print is  thus a "unique original," which deftly collapses painting, printing and  photography into one another.  </P> <P> The huge enlargement of the painting and its printed typeface fuzzes their  edges, softening the crisp line and the saturated colors. Indigo skies are  pierced by barren trees, clumps of freshly fallen snow artfully cap the  mountaintops, and neither animal nor human being is glimpsed. In fact, the only  trace of human life is the presence of the big signs, one per picture, which  carry peculiar tales about beauty, existentialism, transcendence, identity and  alienation -- classic subjects in modern art.  </P> <P> Johnson's stories aren't lofty or learned. They have the chummy, casual  demeanor of gossip or gags; the dissertation on beauty is told through chatty  references to hand creams and cosmetics, the one on transcendence is a black  joke about dead rabbits. And visually, the disconcerting image of a  sign-in-the-wilderness recalls nothing so much as illustrations in a children's  book, or perhaps a common animation cel.  </P> <P> With their showy air of highly refined triviality, there's something dandified  in both the image and the text. Johnson is a virtuoso of a camp aesthetic,  which is here turned toward the banal pretentiousness of the canons of modern  art. But his own art never sneers. Instead, its icy coldness is bracing -- and  unnerving. Johnson's pictures are like wake-up calls. No one appears in the  remote and empty picture to read his signs -- no one save the solitary viewer  in the gallery who stands before them. And any questions of essential meaning  are democratically left to him.  </P> <P> * Stuart Regen Gallery, 619 N. Almont Drive, West Hollywood; (213) 276-5424. To  Jan. 5. Closed Sunday and Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quirky Conception: In several group exhibitions during the last few years, the  sculptures of Patrick Nickell have compelled attention for their unpretentious  means and the quirkiness of their conception. Often made from cardboard, the  abstract, sometimes large-scale forms played against such traditional  sculptural concerns as gravity, weight, permanence and aggressiveness. Products  of the hand, rather than the foundry or construction shop, they redirected  sculptural conventions toward improvisation in the makeshift studio.  </P> <P> "Built for Speed," as Nickell's first gallery solo show is tellingly titled,  does the same, but in ways that suggest a new sophistication and complexity.  The eight, modestly sized wall-sculptures at Sue Spaid Fine Art are composed  from cut and glued corrugated-cardboard and plastic wrapping. Sometimes, their  surfaces are marked with pencil or felt-tip pen. Added up, these are ordinary  packing and labeling materials familiar to the shipping clerk.  </P> <P> With a seemingly casual, extemporaneous elegance reminiscent of the eccentric  work of Richard Tuttle, Nickell fashions these packing materials into  unassuming containers not intended to hold objects, but meant to carry a  sculptor's primary substance: space. The cardboard is most often cut into a  long, lozenge-like shape (imagine the tongue of a shoe), then folded in various  ways. Finally, it's made into one plane of an otherwise transparent volume,  through the addition of plastic wrapping.  </P> <P> The small object that results may be appended to others like it, or pierced  with other forms, or nested inside them. Because folded cardboard wants to  unfold, stretching the plastic taut around the volume, the enclosed space gains  a tensile resonance that is quietly vibrant. Some of these space-containers get  fairly baroque -- if that's not too florid a word for small sculptures made  from such humble materials -- and when they do, they can scuttle out of  control. More often, they mix just the right amount of peculiarity and calm  assurance.  </P> <P> * Sue Spaid Fine Art, 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd.; (213) 935-6153. To Dec. 30.  Closed Monday and Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life With Dada: The significance of the iconoclastic Marcel Duchamp to the  1960s watershed in art cannot be overstated. Pop, Minimal and Conceptual art of  the period claimed a historical foundation in his early, life-long insistence  that meaning is not simply inherent in a painting or a sculpture, but is  instead contingent upon the context within which the work of art is made and  experienced. Art is an idea that emerges from a whole culture, the Dada artist  once explained, which means the spectator participates in making the pictures.  </P> <P> This commitment seems especially relevant to "Marcel Duchamp: 1887 -- 1968" at  Shoshana Wayne Gallery in Santa Monica. Assembled in part as a reminder of the  widely influential exhibition of the artist's work held in the fall of 1963 at  the old Pasadena Museum of Art, the gallery show prompts questions. For  instance, the poster for the museum show was based on a police "Wanted" poster,  with Duchamp cast in the role of outlaw. Could the poster have been a seed that  blossomed several months later in Andy Warhol's series of outlaw paintings,  "Most Wanted Men"?  </P> <P> A display of photographs by Julian Wasser shows Duchamp and Warhol at the  Pasadena Museum opening. Also shown are Edward Ruscha, Larry Bell, Billy Al  Bengston, Eve Babbitz, Dennis Hopper and others, suggesting the possible  importance of the show to a number of younger artists and writers on the West  Coast. This last will be the subject of the collected essays in "West Coast  Duchamp," to be published this winter by Grassfield Press, in association with  the gallery.  </P> <P> If meaning is contingent on context, however, it might be equally productive to  turn around the show's presumed question of influence, and wonder whether  Duchamp himself might have been affected by his foray to Los Angeles. Of the  show's 22 assembled works, 16 are multiple editions, all of them issued after  the Pasadena show, in 1964-65. Why suddenly issue editions of earlier work?  </P> <P> Supervised by the artist and his steadfast critical champion, Arturo Schwartz,  the multiples are based on Duchamp's classic "readymades" from a half-century  before, in which ordinary, mass-produced objects were designated as art: a  bathroom urinal called "Fountain," a typewriter dust cover named "Traveler's  Folding Item," a snow shovel titled "In Advance of a Broken Arm" and more.  </P> <P> Certainly the multiples responded to widespread contemporary interest in  Duchamp's Dada objects from the 1910s, many of which had been lost. The  punster-artist may have perceived a new "readymade market." And a layer of  resonance also was added in multiple versions of unique art objects that had  begun life as mass-produced items.  </P> <P> Still, perusing this provocative show it's reasonable to wonder what role, if  any, might have been played by the European expatriate's experience in the  first mass-culture city in the world. Let's hope "West Coast Duchamp" will  speculate.  </P> <P> * Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 1454 Fifth St., Santa Monica; (213) 451-3733. To Jan.  15. Closed Sunday and Monday.  </P> <P> </P></p>

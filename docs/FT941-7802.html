			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Wise men The so-called 'wise men' of British economics have opened up the economic policy debate, highlighted major issues and increased their saliency in public discussion. They have also been a valuable sounding board for the Treasury. This stimulus to public understanding is welcome, but there is a case for taking the process further still. The panel of economic forecasters was proposed by the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, in his 'Mansion House' speech of October 1992, which also announced the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report. Combined with the new inflation target, these changes defined the government's post-ERM approach to economic policy. The panel, subsequently known as the wise men, was to provide an independent benchmark for Treasury forecasts. It comprised economists from all sections of opinion. Inevitably, they would disagree, providing convenient cover for the Treasury's mistakes. But that heterogeneity genuinely reflected the diversity in opinion. The panel's latest report, published yesterday, underlined the persistence of these disagreements. It also showed, once again, the emergence of strange bedfellows. This time, for example, arch-monetarist Patrick Minford agreed with the neo-Keynesian Wynne Godley, against the other four, on the need to cut interest rates still further. The publicity generated by this officially sponsored dialogue is greater than the participants would secure on their own. They are, of course, not the only good economists working on macroeconomics, but they are a capable enough group. The panel has proved its limited worth, but now needs to be supplemented. In Germany the government funds six research institutions to produce rich and detailed economic analysis. The UK, on the other hand, has moved away from this. Starved of funds, many forecasters have closed. The government should help support as many independent institutions as possible to provide forecasts and analysis. Another approach would be to establish an independent council of economic advisers, on US lines, to publish regular forecasts and analysis. Such a council could supplement, or substitute for, the Treasury's team of forecasters. It would make sense as part of an attempt to reduce the dominance of the Treasury over economic policymaking. The chancellor of the exchequer may be tempted, instead, simply to sack the wise men. This would bring the government a long way back towards business as usual. What must not be forgotten, however, is that the panel was created as part of an effort to defuse the anger and contempt born of policy failure. The wise men should continue to shed light on the complexities of the UK economy in preparation for the point at which inflationary pressures again become a serious challenge.</p>

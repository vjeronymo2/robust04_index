			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Man in the News: King of diamonds - Julian Ogilvie Thompson Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, the South African company that controls the world diamond market, spent yesterday in the Northern Transvaal. It should have been a happy outing, attending the opening of De Beers' new R1.1bn (Pounds 200m) Venetia mine, a project which should produce 5.9m carats of diamonds a year. He could have been forgiven, however, if the prospect of more diamonds had left him feeling slightly queasy. With unfortunate timing, the opening coincided with what was probably the worst week for De Beers since the collapse of the diamond market in 1981-82. Tuesday's announcement from the board, meeting in Kimberley, that there would probably be a 'substantial reduction' in the final dividend did not only knock about 18 per cent off the share price but also precipitated a heavy fall in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It led to accusations that De Beers had misled the market, thus dealing a blow to the credibility of one of South Africa's best-known companies. The patrician, self-assured Ogilvie Thompson, also chairman of the Anglo American mining house and its offshore associate Minorco, may be the world's most powerful mining executive, but he will have been ill-prepared for the assault unleashed on his judgment and that of De Beers. Both in Johannesburg, and to a lesser extent offshore, there has been widespread criticism of the handling of the dividend cut. De Beers sought to defend itself with a statement on Thursday which starts: 'The allegations that De Beers has lost credibility are unfair and ill-founded.' Later in the statement, Ogilvie Thompson adds: 'Our credibility hinges on our being honest and I believe that is exactly what we have been . . . it was precisely because we did not want to mislead the market that we warned of a final dividend cut.' There is little sympathy for this reasoning in Johannesburg. When things are going well, people are prepared to tolerate the high-handed behaviour for which De Beers and Anglo are noted. But when a bitter pill is to be delivered, companies need better investor relations than those enjoyed by De Beers and Ogilvie Thompson if a hostile reaction is to be avoided. The nub of the problem is that until early July, Ogilvie Thompson continued to predict higher rough diamond sales by the Central Selling Organisation (CSO) - the De Beers organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds - in the second half of 1992. Although these bullish sentiments were at odds with market signals, most observers chose to allow De Beers the benefit of the doubt, given the company's record of accurate forecasting. But Tuesday's announcement indicated that De Beers had got it wrong. The dividend cut and the imposition of quotas, whereby the CSO buys 25 per cent less than its contractual commitment from producers, reflect the extent of the error. The board said two factors - which only became fully apparent in mid-July - combined to stymie their earlier forecast: flat demand, when an economic upturn was expected, accentuated by the 'precipitous plunge' in Tokyo's Nikkei index; and the 'sudden and unprecedented explosion' in the supply of illicit diamonds from Angola. Some industry analysts do not believe the outlook for the market could have changed as quickly as De Beers suggests. Of the two factors mentioned, there is sympathy for the Angolan problem, but little for wrongly predicting an economic upturn. Critics suggest that De Beers should not have been so bullish. Part of the reason why De Beers' announcement was greeted by such a furore this week is that Anglo and De Beers are famous for their conservative financial orientation. Ogilvie Thompson exemplifies this conservative culture. Son of a former Chief Justice of South Africa, and a Rhodes scholar, he has grown up in the image of the Oppenheimer family, following Harry Oppenheimer, whose personal assistant he was for four years, to become chairman of the two groups. Like his predecessor at De Beers, he has cultivated an exquisitely polite, highly Anglicised manner - reflected in his preferences for French wines, shooting and fishing. His manner and tastes sit uneasily in the rough and tumble business world of Johannesburg. Though his ability and voracious work appetite are acknowledged, many in the South African investment community are riled by a regal manner which is too obviously a 'cut above' for many people's taste. He is regarded as the personification of Anglo's arrogance: 'that arrogance that people come to Anglo, Anglo doesn't go the people,' in the words of one observer. There has been a simple reason for the stand-offishness - De Beers and Anglo have been financially self-sufficient, neither having had a rights issue. Neither has, therefore, needed the investment community, which they have kept at arm's length. Complex interlocking shareholdings, pivotally controlled by the Oppenheimer family, have also put the companies beyond the reach of corporate raiders. This week's controversy has again raised questions about the quality of management at Anglo. The question is also being asked whether Ogilvie Thompson isn't spreading himself too thinly by being chairman, simultaneously, of three large companies. Pressure is also mounting for improved disclosure from De Beers. Investors are prepared to accept secrecy when De Beers gets things right, but not when it gets things wrong. At the Venetia opening yesterday, Harry Oppenheimer conceded that De Beers was facing 'grave, immediate difficulties'. He went on, though, to say that these are 'the sort that we understand and have faced successfully at many times in the past'. Unfortunately, he was not talking about investor relations. Ogilvie Thompson may find it harder to rebuild trust with investors than to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium in the diamond market - though achieving the latter would doubtless help the former.</p>

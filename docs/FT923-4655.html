			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Kenyan faction picks Odinga A KENYAN former vice-president, Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, convened a congress of the country's divided opposition movement FORD yesterday and was chosen as presidential candidate in a vote boycotted by party rivals, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The meeting widened a split along tribal lines among opponents of President Daniel arap Moi, in power for 13 years. He has promised Kenya its first multi-party election for 26 years. The opposition chances turn partly on whether FORD (Forum for the Restoration of Democracy) can campaign as a cross-tribal alliance.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Knyazev: "Our Newspaper's Holiday"] </F>   [Text] A view from the spectator hall, row 16, seat  2, 5 March 1994    Prokhanov deserves a vacation.    The titanic work for unifying national forces, the  constantly  failing attempts to keep all of the largely different leaders in  the mainstream of the overall idea, the immense mass of  believers and people who cannot believe should have been crowned  with a triumph.    Prokhanov should have been able to see this overflowing  hall,  to hear the approving voices, to rub elbows and backs with those  advisers who for a long time supported him just as he supported  them in his newspaper.    There were almost no analysts in the hall. They were mainly  people who carry on their shoulders the pain and offense to Rus,  its traditions and catastrophes. They live in that same  "tomorrow" at which the newspaper is aimed, believing in that  "tomorrow" and doing everything within their power for it.  Attending meetings, burning bonfires in front of the White  House, disseminating the newspaper, they give perhaps their last  rubles for the holy Russian cause.    This is a spectator hall. The people are ready at the will  of  the leaders to obey the order, to go, to flee, to shout, or to  moan. The people, without whom there are no leaders, on whom the  leaders rely, without whom the leaders cannot live. The foremost  part of our nation.    The leaders are on the stage.    Anpilov, Konstantinov, Astafyev, Terekhov, Baburin, Pavlov,  Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov.    On the stage are Ilyukhin, Dugin, Penkov, Bondarenko,  Chikin,  Filatov.    The last six are not leaders themselves. But they are people  without whose help and support many of the leaders could not get  by. They are people whose advice and actions are necessary,  people who are closest, who could independently decide issues  within the framework of their authority. Very important leaders  of the second level.    All of them spoke.    The main theme of the speeches was not to allow ourselves to  be provoked to armed uprisings which are called "civil war."  This was discussed by Dugin on the basis of materials from the  Spanish press and Ilyukhin after the meeting of Vybros on 2  March.    A peaceful scenario for development is possibly less  preferable to the president and his team, but all of his  variants have also been played through. And not in our favor.    At first Filatov was struck and then he calmed down. He was  struck by the fact that the 220,000 criminals to whom the  president gave amnesty make up 10 divisions of his supporters,  but he was calmed down by the assurance that a victory would  require only one division and only because it would be led by  the General Staff.    It is very important to have the support of the creative  intelligentsia in art, which is provided by the Russian part of  it. This was in the speech by Penkov, an excellent actor and  human being.    Terekhov just got out of Lefortovo. He looks tired but ready  for more battle.    Anpilov, Konstantinov, and Baburin. What is the behavior  this  year of the leaders of 1992, when their phrases and slogans were  valued?    Zhirinovskiy is sure of himself. Today is not only a holiday  for the newspaper, but also a triumph for the opposition who  opened the doors to Lefortovo and Sailors' Rest. He in no way  diminishes his role in the Duma. He is the only one who  supported the State Committee for the State of Emergency. He is  the only candidate for president. In general he is a unique  individual. He is not a Russian Hitler--"why pin that label on  me?" Zhirinovskiy is a candid human being; he has no secrets. He  wants to be first, and he tries. But his openness makes him  extremely vulnerable.    Mr. Astafyev took advantage of this, teasing Zhirinovskiy a  little. Astafyev called for unity. This is not new. A unified  front in the Duma, a single president for all to back in the  elections. The only thing he did not do was the main thing in  such a situation, he did not say: "We have before us the only  person I believe in" and give his name. "I give him my vote and  the vote of my party. Lead us!" He also failed to say something  else: "I will take full responsibility for the future of Russia.  I know not only WHAT, but also HOW to do this for all of us.  Entrust your fate to me."    Nobody said that.    The most stirring speech was Nikolay Pavlov's. "We cannot  believe the government. They are deceiving us again! They have  already outfitted us with our former clothing of a red and brown  color! We are again being subjected to the chaos of unemployment  and internecine war! We need our own Russian national party!" A  person who threw himself under the bullets and APC's.  Personally, he is desperately brave. He walks in the vanguard,  but he is not a leader.    And, finally, Zyuganov. His stated dream is a coalition  government.    I bought two brochures containing his speeches and articles  on the way out. "Peace--to the people, the land--to the  peasants, the factories--to the workers"--but for today's  conditions.    If there is a need we will have to do a detailed critical  survey of everything published by Mr. Zyuganov, but what he said  on 5 March, in my view, does not answer the question of how to  arrive at victory.    They are all patriots. They are all Russians. And the same  laws of psychology apply to all of them.    The first who is prepared to give himself for the good of  Russia must cease being an egoist. He must take a risk, giving  himself and his party to another leader, admit that he is not  the only one with correct ideas. He must agree to be the second  or third. But how?    Petr turned Russia over to the Romanovs. He went to learn.  Nikolay II--to Stolypin. Rozenfeld and Apfelbaum--to  Dzhugashvili. There are precedents, and not all unsuccessful  ones. If there is no one to whom you can be subordinate and you  cannot take the burden on yourself--admit it! That you are weak,  that you cannot do it, leave....    The Siberian Petr Romanov in the issue of ZAVTRA printed on  the night of 5 March did not say HOW either. But he indicated  the bottom line of answers to the question WHAT. I would give  exactly the same answer.    HOW--the PEOPLE. How are they to act? How much are they to  sleep, how much are they to earn, if they are responsible--for  what? Incentives. Which? Measures of encouragement and coercion.  Who must work and under what conditions? Who must not impede the  work and what should be done with them? Who should be taught  what?    I do not have a party. I give myself and everything I am  able  to do to Petr Romanov. I believe in him and am prepared to share  with him both the work and the responsibility for it.</p>

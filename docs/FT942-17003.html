			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK tax rises give cause for pessimism Sir, Your article on the effects of UK tax rises ('Shoppers in the line of fire', April 2) reflects the emerging consensus among many economists that the recovery will continue to gain pace this year and next despite higher taxation. Our analysis of the current situation and of past tax rises supports a somewhat more pessimistic view. It also suggests that we should look closely at the effect of last year's budgets on both consumer spending and investment. Both of the last two large tax hikes, under Labour in the mid-1970s and under the chancellorship of Geoffrey Howe at the start of the 1980s, coincided with falls or stagnation in consumer spending. Though those experiences will not be repeated, this does suggest the rate of increase in consumer spending should be slowed by the tax increases. Past tax rises were offset by substantial cuts in interest rates and, in the latter case, by the relaxation of controls over personal borrowing in the 1982 Finance Act. This time the reverse is true. Though there may be some delayed effects from the interest rate cuts over the last two years, the next movement in interest rates is just as likely to be up as down, while lenders, particularly in the housing market, are becoming more cautious. Consumer confidence indicators suggest that the recent tax rises have made the personal sector more cautious, while we should not put too much faith in the confidence boosting effects of falling unemployment as most of this is down to increases in less secure areas of employment such as part-time work and self-employment. One of the best hopes may be that retailers continue to offer sufficiently large discounts - such as those available in the January sales when the month-on-month fall in the price of clothing and footwear was the largest for 70 years - to allow consumers to spread their incomes further. However, with unit labour costs rising, this will squeeze profit margins. Given the strong links between current and expected profits and investment levels, we should therefore be looking closely at what the budget means for the recovery in investment just as much as that for consumer spending.

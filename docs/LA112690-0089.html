			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL STALLS PLANS FOR HOUSING PROJECT  </P> <P> A controversial housing development has been put on hold by the City Council,  because it would add a major thoroughfare through a now-isolated neighborhood.  </P> <P> The 99-acre project of 76 custom homes is proposed by Irvine-based Concorde  Development.  </P> <P> It has drawn criticism from the nearby neighborhood of Connemara-by-the-Sea  estate homes, because it calls for linking Camino Las Ramblas with San Juan  Creek Road.  </P> <P> This link would create a major route west to Interstate 5 from eastern San Juan  Capistrano, through a series of hills.  </P> <P> Currently, the Connemara estates and an older development of homes atop Valle  Road enjoy the quiet privacy of being on dead-end streets.  </P> <P> City planners are concerned that if Camino Las Ramblas is extended, the impact  on current residents would outweigh the benefits of another through street.  </P> <P> The council voted to refer the issue to the advisory Traffic and Transportation  Commission as well as to the Planning Commission for further review.  </P> <P> Concorde Development has offered to pay for building the Camino Las Ramblas  extension through the 900 acres of hillsides, in exchange for approval of its  custom-home project.  </P> <P> The road project is estimated to cost at least $5 million.  </P> <P> Also at issue is whether the road and the custom homes can be built without  violating the city's ridgeline protection ordinance, which prohibits  construction within 200 feet of a hilltop.

Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HIGHWAYMEN AID HOMELESS  </P> <P> The Highwaymen -- country music stars Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny  Cash and Kris Kristofferson -- arrived at their concert with more than 80 tons  of food in tow to give to the area's needy.  </P> <P> "We waste food in this country," Jennings said.  </P> <P> Jennings and his wife, singer-songwriter Jessi Colter, praised the  hunger-relief organization Feed the Children in collecting the food and urged  concert-goers to donate more canned goods.  </P> <P> The produce, canned goods, cookies and potatoes loaded on four tractor-trailer  trucks are being distributed to more than 50 area churches, food banks,  shelters and other organizations.  </P> <P> The Highwaymen, who played Tuesday night at the Sun Dome, collected canned  goods for the organization at each stop of the group's 18-city tour of the West  and Southwest.  </P> <P> Colter said 1.5 million pounds of food has been distributed so far during the  tour.  </P></p>

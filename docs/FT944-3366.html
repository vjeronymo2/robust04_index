			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Retail sales surge by 1.2% US retail sales surged last month, a further sign of buoyant economic growth despite a series of interest rate increases this year. The Commerce Department said sales rose 1.2 per cent last month  - more than twice the increase projected by most forecasters  - and by nearly 9 per cent in the year to November. Data for October were also revised up to show an increase of 1.3 per cent from September. Bond traders, however, were mollified by separate figures for wholesale prices indicating that rapid growth is apparently still putting only limited upward pressure on the prices of finished goods. The producer price index rose 0.5 per cent last month and by 1.3 per cent in the year to November  - roughly in line with market expectations. The closely-watched 'core' producer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose only 0.1 per cent, less than expected. Most forecasters expect the Federal Reserve to try to curb growth by raising short-term rates significantly in coming months. The Fed could tighten policy again as early as next Tuesday but many analysts say the next tightening move will be delayed until late January. Retail sales showed across-the-board strength with robust increases in building materials (up 2.9 per cent from October), furniture (up 2.3 per cent) and cars (up 2.2 per cent.) So far in the fourth quarter retail sales excluding cars, which tend to be volatile, have grown at an annualised rate of about 8 per cent in real terms, up from about 6 per cent in the third quarter. Although inflation still appears subdued at the level of finished goods, pressures are building at earlier stages of production. The core producer price indices for crude and intermediate goods rose 3.4 per cent and 0.9 per cent last month. Over the past six months, core intermediate goods prices have risen at an annualised rate of 7.5 per cent. 'The Fed has to raise short-term rates significantly if it is to avoid a hard landing in 1995,' said Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. Mr Berner expects real economic growth to peak at an annualised rate of 6 per cent this quarter before slowing to about 2.5 per cent next year.</p>

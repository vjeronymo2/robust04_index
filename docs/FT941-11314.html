			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: CAE takes CDollars 429m charge CAE, the international flight simulator maker, has taken a CDollars 429m (USDollars 327.4m) charge to cover problems at its US subsidiary, CAE-Link. Link, acquired in 1988, has suffered a sharp decline in military simulator and flight training orders in the past three years. Mr John Caldwell, CAE president, said: 'Virtually no new military programmes will be awarded before 2000 and this write-down aligns the value of Link with this outlook.' Link has halved its payroll to 3,800 and more jobs will be lost this year, Mr Caldwell said. However, he said profits were improving and Link would move into navigation systems. The order backlog stands at CDollars 600m. After the special charge, CAE reported an overall net loss in the third quarter of CDollars 419m, or CDollars 3.86 a share, against net profit of CDollars 10.9m, or 10 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 264m, compared with CDollars 254m. The nine-month loss was CDollars 405m, or CDollars 3.73, against a profit of CDollars 23.6m, or 22 cents, on revenues of CDollars 768m, up 5 per cent. Before special charges, profit was CDollars 33m, against CDollars 32.7m. CAE's Canadian business has been affected by lower commercial aircraft simulator orders. Rio Algom, the Canadian mining group, raised CDollars 180m with its issue of shares and warrants, or CDollars 23m more than originally estimated. Canadian Pacific's Fording Coal unit is buying a large high-grade wollastonite deposit in north western Mexico. The mineral is used as a substitute for asbestos.</p>

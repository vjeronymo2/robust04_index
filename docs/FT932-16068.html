			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Change in Russian diamond trade urged RUSSIA would make more from the diamond trade if it abandoned its right to sell 5 per cent of its production and put everything through De Beers' Central Selling Organisation (CSO), according to a senior Russian diamond industry executive. Mr Sergei Ulin, a director of Almazy-Rossii Sakha (ARS), the state-dominated company which produces and markets Russian diamonds, believes 'it's quite evident that changes are required'. In the past he has defended Russia's 1990 agreement with De Beers under which 95 per cent of rough diamond exports must go through the CSO. 'The world is very different from when we signed the agreement, and we are different too,' Mr Ulin said. He now believes that the separate sale of 5 per cent - agreed so that Russia had a means of checking the price it was paid by De Beers - is undermining the CSO's 'one-channel' system which aims to keep prices as high as possible. Some parliamentarians and the State Committee for Precious Stones and Metals have on the contrary complained that 5 per cent is too little and that the sales are only allowed in Moscow. 'I don't believe that 5, 10, or 15 per cent, whether it is sold in Moscow or anywhere else, will give us the information which we would like to have,' Mr Ulin said. It would be better for Russian representatives to attend De Beers' diamond sales or 'sights' in London as did some other producers to ensure fair play. He also clarified ARS's plans to overhaul, along market lines, the system whereby rough stones are sold to Russian-based diamond cutters. This will consist of holding sights for cutters, forcing them to buy a full range of stones, including difficult ones they are not used to cutting.</p>

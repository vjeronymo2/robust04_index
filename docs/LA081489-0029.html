			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> 5,000 RALLY IN SUPPORT OF LABOR STRIKES  </P> <P> About 5,000 rallied in Pittsburgh, Pa., to support a number of labor strikes --  including those at Eastern Airlines, in Appalachian coal mines and at telephone  companies around the country. Members of dozens of labor unions came to  Pittsburgh in buses and caravans of cars and trucks. AFL-CIO President Lane  Kirkland, in a letter read at the rally, urged Congress to intervene in the  Eastern Airlines dispute and "to recognize the legitimate interests of working  people." He also chastised President Bush for inaction in the coal strike.  United Mine Workers President Richard L. Trumka said: "They try to make us  believe that each one of our disputes is a separate little blip on the screen,  . . . we're here to tell them that when it affects one of us, it affects every  last one of us and we'll stand together."  </P></p>

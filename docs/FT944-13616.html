			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Australian inflation at 1.9 percent Australia's consumer price index rose 0.6 per cent in the September quarter, bringing the annualised inflation rate to 1.9 per cent.  The figure represented little change from the previous quarter when the CPI rose 0.7 per cent, and the annualised rate stood at 1.7 per cent.  It was also in line with market expectations, although some nervousness was generated earlier in the week when the Reserve Bank of Australia increased interest rates by one percentage point.  The move was interpreted as a pre-emptive strike designed to keep inflation under control. Despite the reassuring figures, bond prices weakened yesterday, with some analysts suggesting the inflation figures may now deteriorate. They noted that the severe drought gripping east coast farm areas has so far been largely deflationary as farmers 'de-stock', but could have inflationary consequences as produce supply tightens.</p>

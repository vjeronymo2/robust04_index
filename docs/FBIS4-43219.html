			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens (A.A.)--Greek Cypriot Defense Minister  Kostandinos Iliadhis will arrive in Athens today to hold talks  on the "joint defense doctrine" between Greece and south Cyprus.  Iliadhis, who will be accompanied by General D. Vorvolakos,  commander of the Greek Cypriot National Guard, will hold talks  on Tuesday [14 June] with Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis;  Deputy Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris; General Khristos  Limberis, chief of the Greek General Staff; and the force  commanders.    Although no official disclosure has been made on the joint  defense doctrine, the increasing reports in Athens that Greece  and south Cyprus have abandoned the concept because of foreign  pressure and legal and military reasons have drawn attention.  Sources close to the Greek Defense Ministry have said that the  two sides will not be able to broaden their cooperation beyond  the coordination of their rearmament programs. Regarding the  legal reasons that have obstructed the realization of the  agreement Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Greek Cypriot  Leader Glavkos Kliridhis reached on the joint defense doctrine,  the same sources said: "According to the Zurich Agreement,  Greece is one of the guarantor powers of Cyprus. The  implementation of the joint defense doctrine would violate the  Zurich Agreement. Furthermore, as a member of NATO and the  Western European Union [WEU], Greece does not have the right to  conclude a joint defense agreement with a foreign country. Such  an agreement would make south Cyprus look like a member of NATO  and the WEU."    Regarding the military reasons for the abandonment of the  doctrine, the sources said: "The joint defense doctrine will  require the deployment of Greek troops, military aircraft, and  arms in Cyprus. That is impossible under the existing  conditions."    Meanwhile, the sources recalled the strong pressure the  United States, NATO, and the European Union have put on Greece  in connection with the joint defense doctrine.    Regarding the future of military cooperation between Greece  and south Cyprus, the sources stressed the following: "What is  left is the coordination of the rearmament programs and the  plans that will be put into effect in the event of a war with  Turkey. That process has been in effect for the past five  years. Much of the arms of the Greek Armed Forces and the  Greek Cypriot National Guard are similar. Meanwhile, Greece  will probably supply the Greek Cypriots with the AMX-30 B-2  tanks and Leonidas armored personnel carriers it will  decommission and with some Milan antitank missiles. Joint  military exercises may also be held in Greece. It is essential  for the Greek Cypriots to establish their own air force units.  Used Mirage F-1 and MiG-21 aircraft are available in the  markets. They are in good condition and relatively inexpensive."</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Construction orders up in private and public sectors The value of construction orders won by contractors in the UK rose by a tenth to Pounds 18.06bn during the first 11 months of last year compared with the corresponding period in 1992. Figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment indicate that a broad-based recovery has begun in one of the worst-hit industries during the recession. According to the department the improvement in orders accelerated during the latter part of last year. The total value of orders at constant 1985 prices, after allowing for seasonal variations, were 14 per cent higher during September, October and November than the previous three months, and 23 per cent higher than during the corresponding period a year earlier. Officials said that new orders during the latest three-month period rose in every work category compared with the corresponding period in 1992. The biggest increases over the 11 months were in public and private-sector housing where the value of orders in current prices rose by 35 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. Public-sectors orders, other than for infrastructure, rose 21 per cent on the same basis while private industrial orders rose by 7.8 per cent. Infrastructure orders were 2 per cent and private commercial orders 1.3 per cent lower over the corresponding 11 months in 1992. Contractors say that orders have begun to increase but remain concerned about low prices. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, has warned that too many companies are charging suicidal prices. This threatened to undermine the recovery in domestic orders.</p>

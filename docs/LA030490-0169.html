			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS HOLD OFF CLEVELAND  </P> <P> It has been a year and eight days since Waad Hirmez returned to the Sockers  from a frightful half-season with the Los Angeles Lazers.  </P> <P> And Saturday night, following the Sockers' 5-2 victory over the Cleveland  Crunch (14-22) before 7,944 at the San Diego Sports Arena, life was good again.  A heaping spoonful of chuckles.  </P> <P> This, despite all the losses. Despite the fact that the team is still missing  Branko Segota and Brian Quinn, its offensive bulwark. And despite all the games  that Hirmez has looked a step slow and a touch off his game.  </P> <P> "A year later, I'm back here in San Diego," said Hirmez, who scored two goals  to give him seven in his past four games. "I'm the happiest person at the  moment. I never wanted to leave San Diego."  </P> <P> And now, courtesy of Mr. Hirmez, we have the "Cliche of the Game" award.  Hirmez, asked about the Sockers' chances to get back into the Western Division  race, responded: "It's not over until the fat lady sings."  </P> <P> Come on, Waad.  </P> <P> "That's right, baby," he said. "You've got it. I'm not giving up."  </P> <P> Hirmez's second goal came with 6:16 remaining and the Sockers clutching a 3-2  lead, which is not much of a lead at all the way the Sockers have played this  season.  </P> <P> Anyway, midfielder Ben Collins set things up beautifully for Hirmez, pulling  the Cleveland defense to the right and sending a pass back to Hirmez, who sent  the ball into what was virtually an empty net. Of course, Hirmez jumped on the  glass to celebrate his accomplishment, which keeps the Sockers (16-21) in third  place in the Western Division, six games behind first-place Dallas.  </P> <P> Hirmez's hot streak was perhaps prompted by Socker Coach Ron Newman, who  benched him for two games following his return from a four-game layoff with a  hamstring injury. Hirmez didn't like sitting and decided to do something about  it.  </P> <P> "He felt I wasn't sharp enough," Hirmez said. "I really got upset about that. I  wanted to go out and prove to him that I am as sharp as ever."  </P> <P> As they did in Friday's 4-3 loss to St. Louis, the Sockers jumped to a 2-0 lead  early on a first-quarter goal by Zoran Karic and a second-quarter goal by  Hirmez. Karic took a chip from Cacho, turned and sent the ball into the right  corner over the head of goalie Otto Orf, who played for the Sockers during the  second half of last season.  </P> <P> Early in the second quarter, Hirmez took a crossing pass from defender Ralph  Black and punched it in left-footed to make it 2-0. St. Louis midfielder  Michael King scored as the quarter closed, dribbling left and sending a  carpet-hugger past goalie Victor Nogueira, who stabbed at the ball from his  knees.  </P> <P> Black scored his eighth goal of the season through defender Drew Ferguson's  legs 1:35 into the third quarter to make it 3-1. Late in the quarter, former  Socker Paul Wright fed midfielder Dev Reeves, who knocked it in from the left  side of the goal mouth to again tighten the game.  </P> <P> Hirmez took care of things after that with some late help from forward Jim  Gabarra, who slipped a shot between Orf's legs to give the Sockers their  three-goal margin of victory.  </P> <P> A much-needed 10-day rest lies ahead, which is as good a time as any for this  team to hunt down a bit of consistency and heal their bangs and bruises. This  team still has a lot to prove and wants very much to do it.  </P> <P> "I heard some of our fans saying we're not going to make the playoffs this  year," Black said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Socker Notes  </P> <P> Owner Ron Fowler said Saturday that the Sockers are still involved in serious  trade negotiations with two teams, but talks with the St. Louis Storm have  cooled. "I would be surprised if we were able to work a trade with St. Louis,"  he said. "I think they feel we are desperate to make a trade. What they want  and what they are proposing does not make any sense. Two of the teams felt we  were very, very desperate." . . . The Sockers have a 10-day break -- their  second longest this season -- before they play host to St. Louis March 13. . .  . Saturday's game concluded the ninth of an MISL-leading 13 back-to-back  series.  </P></p>

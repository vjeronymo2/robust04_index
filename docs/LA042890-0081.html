			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BYRD HONORED AFTER RECORD 12,134TH VOTE  </P> <P> Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) was honored Friday for casting more votes than  anyone in Senate history.  </P> <P> Byrd's vote on an amendment to a $3.4-billion supplemental spending bill was  No. 12,134.  </P> <P> He cast his first vote on Jan. 7, 1959.  </P> <P> "Sen. Byrd has maintained a voting attendance record of 98.4% during his Senate  service," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said in a tribute.  </P> <P> The previous record was held by former Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.), who cast  12,133 votes during his 31 years in the Senate.  </P> <P> "He has made a remarkable record in the Senate," said Sen. Strom Thurmond  (R-S.C.). "He is one of the ablest parliamentarians who has ever served . . .  throughout the history of the Senate."  </P> <P> Byrd, 72, responded to the tribute by saying: "Records are made to be broken,  and this record will be broken in time."  </P> <P> Byrd went back to business after the tribute, delivering a speech criticizing  the Bush Administration for not finding Japan in violation of trade agreements.  </P></p>

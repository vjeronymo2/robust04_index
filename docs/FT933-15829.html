			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU rejects Labour's plan for vote reform THE CAUSE of electoral reform in the Labour party received an unexpected setback yesterday when the conference of the TGWU general union, the biggest union affiliated to the party, narrowly rejected a motion calling for acceptance of the principle. In spite of support from the union's executive and Mr Bill Morris, the general secretary, the motion fell by just 19 votes and a motion supporting the electoral status quo passed with a comfortable majority. The decision follows a similar rejection of electoral reform at the GMB general union and may effect the consultation processes which are continuing in other large unions. The party's Plant Commission has come out in favour of the principle of reform, but several senior members of the party remain strongly opposed to changing the first-past-the-post system. Mr John Smith, the party leader, has, however, said that if Labour wins the next election he would support a referendum on the issue. The cause of electoral reform in the TGWU may have been damaged by association with the current debate on re-shaping the links between the unions and the party. Unions such as the TGWU are feeling on the defensive and left and right are finding common cause against the 'modernisers'. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, yesterday urged Mr Smith not to draw back from reforming links between the party and the unions. Mr Laird also announced that the AEEU membership had voted to keep the union's political fund. A 25 per cent turnout of the union's 900,000-members voted 3-1 in favour of continued financial support - worth about Pounds 1m a year - for Labour.</p>

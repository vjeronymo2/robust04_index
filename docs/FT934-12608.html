			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Technology: R&amp;D in a tussle over EC funding - Member states have a contradictory approach towards the next five-year spending plan Europeans will hear a lot about the role of science and technology in the weeks ahead. This month, the European parliament welcomed Europe's scientific and industrial elite to a two-day 'science summit' in Brussels. At the end of November, the European Community will sponsor a week of 'scientific culture' in an attempt to improve the general understanding of science and technology through a series of conferences, competitions, open days and exhibitions across Europe. Meanwhile, in a somewhat less celebratory atmosphere, EC research ministers are trying to decide on the size and shape of the next five-year 'framework' programme of EC-funded research and technological development, to run from 1994 to 1998. The framework programme is the EC's fourth since 1984, and the European Commission's proposal for Ecu13.1bn (Pounds 10.2bn) of funding makes it look like the biggest so far. The 1990-94 framework programme - which will overlap its successor - was worth Ecu6.6bn. But appearances are misleading: R&amp;D spending remains pegged at about 4 per cent of the overall EC budget. The Commission may have to struggle to prevent member states from chipping away still further at that figure. When EC research ministers met in Luxembourg recently for their first substantive discussion of the Commission's plans, nine member states backed a figure of Ecu13.1bn. But the Community's three largest paymasters - Britain, France and Germany - said it should be reduced by Ecu1bn or more. The proposals require the unanimous approval of the 12 member states. Antonio Ruberti, an engineer by training and former Italian minister for research and university affairs, took over responsibility for the EC programme of science, research and development at the beginning of the year with a two-year mandate. He wants to move quickly, but so far is clearly frustrated by the apparent contradiction between member states' desire to improve economic performance and their grudging attitude towards research spending. 'When it comes to earmarking resources to be devoted to research in individual member states and in the Community, all sorts of difficulties arise which are not consistent with statements of principle as to the strategic role of research,' he told a Brussels press conference. Part of the problem is that some governments still have lingering doubts about the value of the EC's framework programme. After nearly a decade, critical observers are bound to ask why a programme aimed at improving the performance of EC industry against US and Japanese competition has not given the Community more of a competitive edge. Large projects such as Esprit, the EC's flagship information technology programme, are criticised for their lack of commercial impact, while industrialists complain that Brussels spurns market-oriented projects for fear of distorting competition. 'You can't at the same time want to increase competitiveness and say that any project which by some misfortune leads to an industrial application can't be financed,' argues Viscount Davignon, chairman of Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, at the science summit. These criticisms are not entirely fair. The framework programmes account for only a tiny proportion of overall research spending in the EC, so Community officials argue that some blame for a technological deficit should be laid at the door of member states and companies. Moreover, the Community is supposed to concentrate on basic research; a separate pan-European programme, Eureka, exists to help companies collaborate on projects with direct market applications. There are also notable exceptions to the over-simplified claim that EC-funded research rarely leads anywhere: ICL's launch earlier this week of an advanced computer system, partly based on technology developed under Esprit, was one of them. Nonetheless, Ruberti is on his mettle to produce a fourth framework programme which answers some of the main questions raised by past programmes. To do so, he has decided to concentrate resources on fewer areas, promoting so-called 'generic' technologies which will benefit a range of different industries and serve wider EC objectives such as economic integration, employment, environment and infrastructure improvements. A Commission working document outlining the possible contents of the Ecu13.1bn programme says that projects for the next five years should respond to the 'real needs' of technology consumers. For example, information technology and communications would still represent more than a third of the Commission's proposed research budget, but Esprit would lose its current high profile and its name. IT projects would have broader applications, linked more closely to market needs. The Commission has high hopes, for example, that the EC can gain a lead over Japan and the US in the development of tiny, intelligent machines known as microsystems with uses from medical diagnosis to cable maintenance. A network of some 120 research bodies and companies, mainly small or medium-sized, was set up under the third framework programme and is already discussing what may be required. Under the fourth framework programme, specific proposals for basic research will be considered for funding. Similarly, in the field of industrial technologies, which would take up 16.5 per cent of the proposed budget, the Commission hopes the EC will fund technologies which might help equip the 'factory of the future', while the Ecu1.32bn channelled towards 'life sciences' would focus on the use of biomedicines in the fight against Aids. A further Ecu530m will be devoted specifically to disseminating and exploiting the results of research projects, so that EC companies actually benefit from Community-funded innovation. A special effort will also be made to co-ordinate Community and national R&amp;D strategies, helping to end the framework programme's reputation as an unlucky '13th' research effort. The speed with which the Commission has produced these outline proposals has a political purpose. Following ratification of the Maastricht treaty, the fourth framework programme will be one of the first Commission proposals subject to a new and complex legislative procedure involving consultations between European parliament, ministers and Commission. If, as seems possible, ministers and Euro-MPs disagree on the size of the research programme, then there is a risk that implementation will be delayed. 'This (working document) is so that nobody can say that the Commission has not made its suggestions and ideas clear,' explains one Brussels official. What is already clear from the Commission plans is that Ruberti wants to avoid the same traps as his predecessors. Whether he succeeds may not be apparent until long after his 24-month mandate expires - and a great deal of EC money has been spent. Member states will have to decide, probably before the end of this year, how much cash they are prepared to risk to carry out those ambitions.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             FOURTH EC RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT                       FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME (1994-98)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COMMISSION PROPOSAL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In millions of Ecu (as proportion of R&amp;D programmes) Information and communications technologies               3900  (35.7%) Industrial technologies                                   1800  (16.5%) Environment                                                970   (8.9%) Life sciences and technologies                            1325  (12.1%) Clean and efficient energy technologies                   1050   (9.6%) Nuclear safety and security                                495   (4.5%) Controlled thermo-nuclear fusion                           980   (9.0%) Research for a European transport policy                   280   (2.6%) Socio-economic research                                    125   (1.1%) Co-operation with third countries &amp; int'l organisations    790 Dissemination and utilisation of results                   600 Stimulation of training and mobility of researchers        785 TOTAL                                                    13100  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: European Commission  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

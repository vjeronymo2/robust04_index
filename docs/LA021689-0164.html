			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> RECORD COLD, RECORD-HIGH UTILITY BILLS  </P> <P> The recent record cold weather in Southern California may set another kind of  record for consumers next month -- in utility bills. What can you do if you've  got a $200 gas or electric bill that you just can't pay all at once? There are,  happily, some options.  </P> <P> And some monetary assistance for low income families.  </P> <P> All three utilities -- Southern California Gas Co., Southern California Edison  and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- report that they will work  with their customers on a case by case basis to make special arrangements in  paying gas or electric bills during this period. Representatives of each  utility, though, stress that customers call company service representatives as  soon as possible to work out a payment plan, not wait until they receive a  turnoff notice.  </P> <P> "We want people to call us as soon as they're aware it (their bill) is an  unmanageable situation," said the DWP's James Derry, director of consumer  services. "We have a lot more latitude in setting up a payment schedule if they  don't wait until the last minute or until the guy is at the door to shut off  the electricity."  </P> <P> The majority of Southern California residences are heated by gas, but residents  in those communities with all-electric homes are likely experiencing their own  brand of skyrocketing heating costs.  </P> <P> As a gas company spokesman notes, the principle is simple: "higher gas usage  translates into higher gas bills."  </P> <P> To get a handle on yours, check out the therm usage box on your gas bill this  month to see how many units your household is consuming. If you use more than  62 therms of gas a month in the winter, the rate per unit after that increases  from 37 cents a therm to 78 cents. That can add up pretty fast.  </P> <P> Electric bills also can creep up more quickly than you realize during unusually  cold winter weather, especially if you're using one of those small, portable  electric heaters that doesn't have a thermostat.  </P> <P> "We have this problem a lot with some of our elderly people," Derry said. "To  save on heating bills for the whole house or apartment, they'll get one of  those small portable heaters without a thermostat, and then it runs constantly  16 hours a day. They weren't aware, and then they come in with a much bigger  bill. It happens every winter when it gets cold. Once we tell them what's  caused the bill to be higher, we rarely have a repeater.  </P> <P> "We advise them to look for the energy rating on the heater and get one with a  thermostat so they can set it at a given level and it won't run constantly," he  added.  </P> <P> One way Southern California Edison has of helping with large bills, especially  for its elderly or disabled customers, is a program called "third party  notification."  </P> <P> "A customer can ask us to notify a third party if their bill becomes past due,"  explained Suzanne Hughes, supervisor of consumer affairs for Edison. "We send a  copy to the designated person who can remind them to pay it or assist with the  payment. A pretty large percentage of our customers are using the program."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Billing Plan  </P> <P> All three utilities also offer an option called a "level pay billing plan" to  customers. What this does is average out your bills over a 12-month period so  you won't have a $150 bill one month and a $35 one the next. You can join one  of these plans anytime in the first few months of the year, providing you have  been a customer for one year. That's so the company has criteria by which to  set an average figure for your bill.  </P> <P> If your bills seem way too high -- even considering the cold weather -- you  should call your utility and request a home energy examination of your house to  find out what you can do about conserving energy and lowering your bill. That  service is free from each of the utilities.  </P> <P> And if you are a low-income senior citizen, handicapped or disabled person or a  family at poverty level income, you may not know you actually can get some  monetary help from each utility's assistance fund for low income customers.  </P> <P> All are administrated by United Way through 127 service agencies in Southern  California, among them the Salvation Army, Lutheran Social Services, Catholic  Charities, Chinatown Service Center and the Retired Seniors Volunteer Program.  </P> <P> To qualify, you must appear in person at one of the designated agency offices,  have a past due bill or turnoff notice and be able to show figures stating your  total household income, either monthly or annually.  </P> <P> Basically, you cannot receive assistance if you have income over certain limits  set by the federal government. For example, if you're single, you can't have  income of more than $625 a month or $7,501 a year; for a family of four, the  limit is $1,262 a month or $15,145 in a year.  </P> <P> If you are receiving State Supplemental Income (SSI), you automatically qualify  for assistance and do not need to have a past due bill. And handicapped or  disabled persons who are unable to go to one of the agencies' offices may  authorize a friend or relative to appear for them.  </P> <P> The maximum payment you can get from any of the utility assistance funds is  $150 per household per year. Once you qualify, you get a voucher that will pay  the specific bill. But according to United Way officials, there is a limited  amount of money available for utility bill assistance and the money goes fast  because there are so many people who need it.  </P> <P> Last year, Southern California Edison gave assistance to 8,860 households;  Southern California Gas Co., 6,828; DWP, 891. Of course, that number of  households translates to several thousand people, considering the fact that a  household served is usually composed of one to five people.  </P> <P> "We always run out of money, because this is a huge problem," United Way's Sal  Perrotta said. "These funds are virtually a drop in the bucket, but they do  help these agencies who wouldn't have any other way to assist the people who  need help."  </P> <P> Funds are gathered through customer contributions to all three utilities.  Southern California Edison matches its customer contributions dollar for dollar  from shareholder funds; the Southern California Gas Co. contributes $250,000 in  addition to whatever its customers have given. But the DWP is not permitted to  match contributions to its Project Angel (Assist Neighbors by Giving Energy for  Living), because it is a rate-payer-owned utility, run by the City of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Both Southern California Edison and the gas company began their assistance  programs this month, but the DWP probably will not begin its annual Project  ANGEL program until mid-April -- because that program only kicks in after  customer contributions have reached $100,000. This year, that will probably be  in mid-April and again in October.  </P> <P> "That's given away in an eight-hour day at five centers throughout the city,"  Derry noted.  </P> <P> For additional information about the SoCalGas Gas Assistance Fund, call the gas  company office number listed on your bill; for Southern California Edison's  Winter Energy Assistance Fund, call its 24-hour Action Line at (800) 952-5062.  For Project ANGEL assistance, call the DWP Hotline in your area: Metropolitan  Los Angeles, (213) 481-5800; San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles, (818)  984-3303; Harbor, (213) 639-9442.  </P> <P> For more information on assistance with utility bills that you may get from  federal or state programs for low income families, call Info Line, California's  largest information and referral service.  </P> <P> Ask about the Energy Crisis Intervention Program that is funded with money from  the federal government and administered by the state. And families on SSI or  Aid to Dependent Children may want to ask about another government plan, Home  Energy Assistance Program.  </P> <P> Info Line telephone numbers are: Los Angeles, (213) 686-0950; West Los Angeles,  (213) 551-2929; LAX area, (213) 671-7464, South Bay/Long Beach, (213) 603-8962;  San Gabriel Valley, (818) 350-6833; Burbank/Glendale, (818) 956-1100; San  Fernando Valley, (818) 501-4447; Antelope Valley/Santa Clarita Valley, (800)  422-1535; all other areas, (800) 242-4612.  </P> <P> Consumers living outside Los Angeles also might want to check with their own  city governments to see if there are any utility assistance programs.  </P> <P> For example, Pasadena, which has its own department of water and power, just  started a utility assistance fund for its customers in February. It's called  Project APPLE -- Assisting Pasadena People with Limited Emergencies.  Information: (818) 405-4409.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Sergey Suntsov; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Suntsov] Until quite recently there was no  clear-cut policy on personnel matters. But with the formation  within the president's office of a council on personnel policy  -- whose membership includes the chairmen of both houses of the  Federal Assembly -- this situation has changed, Vladimir  Shumeyko told journalists today. The journalists asked him to  comment on the resignation of Sergey Shakhray and to explain how  this might affect policy on interethnic problems.    [Shumeyko] I only hope that with Yegorov's appointment to  this post all these problems can move on from the phase of  theoretical assessment to the phase of practical solutions,  quite independent of the interests of the PRES [Party of Russian  Unity and Accord].    [Suntsov] New Minister Nikolay Yegorov hails from the same  area as Vladimir Shumeyko. He is Shumeyko's man. Vladimir  Shumeyko commented on this positive fact. He said that he had  participated in the formation of the government on one single  occasion, in December 1992. On that occasion, on instructions  from the president, he helped Viktor Chernomyrdin draw up the  government list.    [Shumeyko] Since then I have not taken part in the formation  of the government. As far as my relations with the president  are concerned, they are exactly as close as they need to be in  order to facilitate joint work on affairs of state.    [Suntsov] Journalists also asked about the possibility that  former Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov, who is now a deputy in  the State Duma, might become chairman of the Central Bank of  Russia. That is unlikely to happen in the near future Vladimir  Shumeyko said. The chairman of the Federation Council feels  there is no need at the moment for emergency measures to boost  the economy. Only culture and science need active support from  the authorities, he said.    Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists about bills sponsored by  the government and Federation Council that envisage assistance  for newspapers and publishing houses. Whereas the government  plans to reduce profits tax by 50 percent and VAT to 6 percent,  the Shumeyko draft proposes the abolition of all levies on the  press, except for commercial and pornographic publications.</p>

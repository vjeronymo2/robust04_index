			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hungary promises to support state banks HUNGARY vowed yesterday to recapitalise its troubled financial sector after the disclosure in the Financial Times that loan losses at Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi Bank, the two largest commercial banks, had wiped out their capital. AV RT, the state holding company, said it would be ready to put proposals on new capital for the banks it owns before the government's economic cabinet in two or three weeks. A World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission is then due in June to discuss a broader programme to restructure Hungary's problem debtors as well as to recapitalise problem banks, said Mr Teleki, chairman of the AV RT. Mr Teleki conceded yesterday new capital was necessary, but would not comment on a recommendation by the World Bank for an infusion of Ft100bn (Dollars 1.1bn) to bring the capital adequacy of the whole banking sector up to 4 per cent of assets on international accounting.</p>

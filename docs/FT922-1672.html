			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Levy is threatened to curb packaging A LEVY may be introduced to curb extravagant use of paper and packaging for food, clothing and other consumer goods if voluntary action fails, Mr David Maclean, a junior environment minister, warned in the Commons yesterday. He supported demands from all quarters of the Commons for further pressure to be imposed on packagers and retailers to reduce unnecessary packaging and waste. Mr Maclean acknowledged the advantage of action on a European Community basis to deal with the issue, but emphasised the importance of ensuring that taxation of needless packaging should be handled at national level. Although the government had no objection in principle to 'an economic instrument such as a packaging levy', he stressed that the role of the EC in fiscal policy needed 'very careful consideration'. Mr Maclean said officials of his department had met representatives of the packaging industry three times in the past six months to discuss ways of eliminating unnecessary packaging and reducing the amount of wrapping that is thrown away. The government had indicated that it was prepared to take action 'if the industry does not produce substantive proposals'. Mr Maclean said the British Retail Consortium had recently issued guidance on retail packaging to its members and their suppliers. Next week, he said, the industry would announce an initiative to deal with complaints about over-packaging. Illustrating his department's commitment to recycling, Mr Maclean said 230 tonnes of waste paper had been collected since October 1990. He predicted that the target of recycling 25 per cent of household waste would be achieved in the year 2000.</p>

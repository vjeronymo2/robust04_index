			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: China signs two Brazil ventures Brazil and China, two of the world's largest developing countries, have signed two agreements in an effort to boost trade during a week-long visit to Brazil by China's president Jiang Zemin and foreign minister Mr Qian Qichen. Trade between the two countries remains small but is increasing after several years of decline and this year is expected to reach Dollars 1bn. Brazilian exports of steel and primary products are growing, while Chinese consumer goods have appeared in Brazilian shops as the country has lowered tariff barriers. China is to set up a joint venture to extract iron ore from the huge Carajas mines in northern Brazil. This will be shipped to supply China's growing steel industry. The two sides have also agreed a Dollars 150m joint venture satellite project, where the first of two planned Brazilian-owned satellites is scheduled to be launched in October 1996 by a Chinese rocket. The satellite will be used to monitor atmospheric pollution and forest reserves. John Burton adds from Seoul: Samsung Aerospace yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with Aviation Industries of China (Avic) to develop mid-size commuter aircraft with 50 to 100 seats. It is the third civilian aviation project to be announced in as many months by a Korean company and the second involving Avic. Daewoo Heavy Industries and Korean Air are also co-operating with Avic in developing passenger jets with a 100-130 seat capacity. The two Sino-Korean projects are meant to tap the potentially large aircraft market in China, while reducing both countries' dependence on western aircraft manufacturers by developing their own aerospace industries. Samsung estimates that the Chinese demand for commuter airliners could reach 200-300 aircraft by 2010, while Korea may need 100. The Phoenix project involving Samsung and Avic will begin development of the airliners next year and plans to start production in 1998.</p>

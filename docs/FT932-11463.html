			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Fear of unemployment still high: Nearly half of men worried over job security - MORI survey MORE THAN 40 per cent of workers in Britain are worried they could find themselves out of a job within the next 12 months, according to the first of a monthly series of MORI surveys, published in the Financial Times today. The survey findings about people's fears of losing their jobs come despite recent, more encouraging, economic indicators, and optimistic messages from government ministers emphasising signs of recovery. There is a risk that concern about jobs could yet damp hopes that a marked increase in consumer confidence will add momentum to the UK's emergence from recession. Those who felt the most vulnerable were men, people between the ages of 45 and 54, and C2s - skilled workers. Job insecurity was felt most strongly in the south, particularly in greater London, and among full-time, rather than part-time, employees. The survey, which was commissioned from MORI by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions research group, should give some indication each month of how far confidence is returning. Official jobless figures fell in March by 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted total of 2.94m. This second successive monthly fall took analysts by surprise, and the government has warned it is still too early to tell if unemployment has peaked. The IRS/MORI index found 41 per cent of workers said they were concerned - 21 per cent were 'very concerned' and 20 per cent were 'fairly concerned' - about the possibility of being made redundant or becoming unemployed over the next 12 months. A question asking why individuals were worried about losing their jobs drew a range of answers. Changes in the National Health Service and uncertainties arising out of hospitals moving to trust status were mentioned by some health service employees. Other workers feared their companies would lose contracts or would cut jobs after takeovers. Nearly half of men, 46 per cent, were concerned about losing their jobs, compared with 35 per cent of women. More than a quarter, 27 per cent, of workers who were aged 45-54 said they were 'very concerned' about becoming unemployed, compared with 17 per cent of those aged 25-34. Professional and managerial employees were not spared anxiety: 28 per cent of ABs feared for their jobs. However, nearly half - 48 per cent - of skilled workers were worried they might lose their jobs in the next year. In greater London, 46 per cent of workers were concerned for their jobs, compared with 37 per cent in the north of England. MORI interviewed 1,024 adults aged 18 and over in full- or part-time work, face-to-face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points throughout Britain on April 22-26. Data were weighted to match the profile of the population. Survey of economic forecasts, Page 10</p>

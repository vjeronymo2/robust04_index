			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Big electricity users 'suffering high price rises' Big industrial users of electricity in the UK have suffered disproportionately from price increases since electricity privatisation, says a report published yesterday by the Chemical Industries Association. The report says that the only large European country where prices have risen faster in the past six years is Italy. It adds that UK electricity prices have increased by about 42 per cent since privatisation of the electricity industry was mooted. It says electricity prices are 13 per cent to 18 per cent higher than average of prices in Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. Only German large users pay more for electricity than those in the UK. The association said energy-intensive companies were being damaged by uncompetitive electricity prices. Corrective action was needed toprevent erosion in the sector. The association said that the huge increases in prices could not be justified by a corresponding increase in costs. In six years the price of industrial fuels, accounting for half of the total cost of electricity, had fallen by 10 per cent. Claims by the UK electricity generators that Continental suppliers were subsidised were dismissed by the study. It concluded that there was little evidence of such subsidies. The association said one of the reasons for the large increases was that there had been little effective competition in generation. It called for an 18 per cent reduction in prices for large users by: A mechanism for trading outside the pool, the industry's wholesale trading market. A 20 per cent reduction in distribution costs through the regional electricity companies. The creation of dedicated generation. This would mean customers who accepted the risks of trading outside the pool with a fossil-fuel supplier would not have to subsidise nuclear energy. Meanwhile the pool's annual report yesterday said the average selling price of electricity traded through the pool was Pounds 26.61 per MWh in the year to April 1. This compared with an average price of Pounds 24.19 in the previous year. The report said that there had been a number of price jumps during the year because of occasional shortages of plant available to meet demand.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              WHAT BIG INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES ARE PAYING  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Belgium  France  Italy  Netherlands  Germany       UK                            (pence per kilowatt/hour)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25MWuser        2.98    2.94   3.28         2.57     4.21     3.62 80MWuser        2.79    2.67   2.99          2.5     3.99     3.52  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Chemical Industries Association  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

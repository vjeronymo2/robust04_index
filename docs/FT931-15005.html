			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Haitians warned not to make sea crossing THE Bush administration's policy of returning Haitian boat people intercepted at sea will continue 'for the time being' under the new government, President-elect Bill Clinton announced yesterday. Mr Clinton had been sharply critical of the existing approach both in the campaign and subsequently. But he said he had been 'profoundly moved' by the dangers taken on by the would-be Haitian refugees. Recently a boatload carrying an estimated 400 Haitians foundered, with the loss of almost all on board. Mr Clinton also broadcast to Haiti yesterday urging its citizens not to take to their home-made boats. He promised a renewed effort to find a democratic solution there and cited the mediating mission of Mr Dante Caputo, the former Argentine foreign minister. Under intense pressure from both the Bush administration and Mr Clinton's aides, Fr Bertrand Aristide, the ousted Haitian president, has also broadcast this week urging his countrymen not to flee to the US on the assumption that the incoming administration would be more welcoming. He called for the UN to dispatch human rights observers to Haiti as a first step to restoring democracy and his own position. Mr Clinton, pressed at a news conference about his apparent change of mind, insisted he had always drawn a distinction between economic and political refugees. He said a majority of those processed for asylum by the US had been turned down because they did not meet internationally accepted criteria. He endorsed Fr Aristide's call for UN observers and promised to set up in Haiti more centres to screen applicants. He also repeated that he was only adopting an 'interim' policy, which would change 'when I am fully confident I can do so in a way that does not contribute to a humanitarian tragedy'. Nevertheless, the Haitian lobby in the US promptly condemned Mr Clinton for breaking his word. He has also been accused of having made a rash commitment to change policy before appreciating the complexities of the issue.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Recession and weak dollar push Hogg down RECESSION, tough conditions in the reinsurance market and the weakness of the US dollar combined to depress pre-tax profits at Hogg Group, the insurance broker, to Pounds 6.8m for the half year to June 30 compared with Pounds 8.26m. Earnings per share were 20 per cent lower at 6p (7.52p). The dividend is maintained at 3.15p per share. The result, which was broadly in line with expectations, produced a positive response from the market and the shares were marked up 14p to close at 131p. Turnover from broking rose to Pounds 56.1m (Pounds 55.9m) and by an underlying rate of 3.2 per cent. However, the group was hit by tough conditions in the London reinsurance market, as well as in the UK credit insurance and political risk insurance markets in which it specialises. Income from the London retrocession (reinsurance of reinsurance) market fell by Pounds 750,000, while that from credit and political broking dropped by a further Pounds 600,000. Mr James Vaughn, chairman, said that recession had depressed the turnover of many companies buying credit insurance, reducing premium volume and the size of commissions earned by Hogg. In addition, Hogg was feeling the effect of a cut in commission rates introduced last year by Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurer, with which it places significant amounts of business. The effect of the weaker dollar (41.17 per cent of Hogg's income comes from the United States) and the strength of sterling against other overseas currencies cut income by another Pounds 750,000. Expenses rose to Pounds 53.1m (Pounds 51.7m) and by an underlying rate of 5 per cent. UK expenses increased by 8.5 per cent against turnover of 7.9 per cent. US expenses fell by 2.1 per cent against a turnover reduction of 3 per cent. The increase was attributed to costs arising from the development of new business, as well as redundancy payments and restructuring expenses. Despite the increase in costs staff numbers were down overall by 1 per cent. UK staff numbers were flat, while US staff numbers fell by 5 per cent. Lower interest rates (down by 20 per cent in the UK and by 35 per cent in the United States) reduced investment income to Pounds 2.63 (Pounds 2.94m) after taking into account interest payable. The share of profits from associated companies remained unchanged at Pounds 1.13m.</p>

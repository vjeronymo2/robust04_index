			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Peres by political </F> correspondent Gadi Sukenik in the studio on 29 April -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Sukenik] The IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] withdrawal will be completed some two to three  weeks after the agreement with the PLO is signed. Will the  closure imposed on the territories be lifted?    [Peres] If the knives are set aside, the closure will be  lifted. This time, however, they -- not just we -- will have an  interest in removing the knives. They will be in charge of the  well-being of the people. They will be in charge of their  income, their security, and they will have to maintain relations  with Israel that enable them to resume work in Israel.  Previously, a Palestinian interest that focused on opposite  goals was created. This time they have an interest in running  their self-government.    [Sukenik] For example, do you foresee the possibility that  Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the founder of Hamas, will be released from  prison?    [Peres] If Ahmad Yasin announces he is for peace and against  violence -- and not that he opposes violence only within the  territories, as he previously said -- I am for releasing him.  He is an old man with paralyzed legs. All that he has left is  a mouth and a head. If he calls on his people to stop terrorism  and embark on the path of negotiations, we will sit with him.

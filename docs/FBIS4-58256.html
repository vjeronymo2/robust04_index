			<p>BFN     [Text] Jordanian political parties and national forces  have set up a popular committee to counter agreements of  capitulation and normalization with the Zionist enemy. The  provisional administrative body of the committee has called a  meeting for 1800 on Thursday, 5 May, 1994, to ratify the bylaws  and obtain official registration.    Following is the text of the committee's bylaws:    At this stage, the Arab world, as well as Jordan, is being  targeted by a ferocious U.S.- and Zionist-led imperialist  offensive to consolidate the foundations of a Middle East order  with the necessary mechanisms, as a counterbalance to a  pan-Arab, democratic, revivalist strategy, by deepening the  dependency of Arab regimes and by the recognition of and  normalization with the Zionist enemy.    The Gaza-Jericho accord, the Jordanian-Israeli agenda, and  the ongoing negotiations between the Zionist enemy and the Arab  regimes are only the beginning of a plan to impose the so-called  Middle East order.    First -- The Objective and Functions:    Based on the above, the Jordanian parties are setting up a  committee to resist negotiations, hegemonic American-Israeli  agreements, and political, economic, and cultural normalization  with the Zionist enemy. The committee's work will aim for a  dual function:    1. A determined stand against the hegemonic and normalizing  effort in Jordan and its attendant results, particulary the call  for a confederation grouping the Palestinians, Israel, and  Jordan, as well as resistance to attempts to impose U.S.-Israeli  economic dominance on Jordan so the country's political future  is exposed to threat.    2. Laying bridges and forging coordination with all  nationalist and democratic forces in the Arab and Muslim arenas  that have rejected the hegemonic and normalizing agreements,  above all the Palestinian forces that are taking a negative  stand toward the Oslo and Cairo agreements and the  Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The aim is to uphold the historic,  inalienable rights of the Arabs in Palestine, including the  right to self-determination, repatriation, and statehood.    Second -- The Means:    To advance the goals and functions of the committee, the  following activities are to be pursued, not excluding other  approaches:    1. The publication of a monthly bulletin specialized in  pointing out the dangers of the Zionist presence and exposing  those who establish contacts with the Zionist enemy. The  bulletin will have a cultural, political, and scientific  orientation.    2. Organizing panel discussions, lectures, and rallies to  point up the dangers of the Zionist presence and the risks to  Jordan and the Arab nation that normaliztion carries.    3. The formation of popular bodies in Jordan to marshal  public pressure to forestall any move to scrap or amend  legislation barring dealings with the Zionist enemy in the  political, economic, and cultural domains, or any other spheres,  and to keep the boycott of Israel in place.    4. The formation of subcommittees of economic experts,  businessmen, trade unionists, and professionals to combat the  economic opening to the Zionist enemy, which is potentially  detrimental to Jordan's industrial and agricultural sectors.  The subcommittees should also resist dependency on the Zionist  economy.    5. The formation of cultural subcommittees to counter and  expose cultural normalization with the Zionist enemy in any  shape of form and to block all channels to promote cultural  penetration of our society, including any amendments to the  school curricula to further the cause of cultural normalization  with the enemy.    6. Any politician, merchant, intellectual, writer, unionist,  or journalist who does business with Israelis must be isolated.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: French bank to securitise commercial property loans Bankers Trust International has arranged a FFr9bn securitisation of commercial property loans, designed to restructure the balance sheet of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the French bank. The securitisation is split into three tranches, consisting of two asset-backed commercial paper programmes and one bond offering. The deal will allow CdE to refinance itself without the need for further capitalisation, according to Mr Graeme Thomson of Banker's Trust's global investment bank division. The first two tranches consist of FFr1.5bn to FFr3bn of revolving credit back-up facilities, one in French francs and one in dollars, supporting, respectively, a billets de tresorerie (BT) programme, and a dollar commercial paper programme, both maturing on December 31 1998. The third tranche is a FFr4.5bn fixed-rate bond due December 31 1998, to be arranged by a group of French banks next month. Under the structure, CdE sells its property loan portfolio to a special purpose vehicle. CdE's shareholders, Assurances Generales de France, Credit Foncier de France, Union Assurance de Paris, Caisse des Depots et Consignations and Groupe des Assurances Nationales, all act as guarantors. There is also an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee from MBIA, a triple-A rated specialist insurance company.</p>

But this in a way that is noticeably friendlier to  the environment than that to which we are currently accustomed,  with less discharge of noxious emissions and dust, better  quality, and more recycling of residues.    Right next to the Maas Power Plant, a large conventional  coal-burning plant for generating electricity that is scheduled  to be shut down in 2000, the Cooperating Electricity Production  Enterprises (SEP) have built a demonstration plant that is to  gasify coal based on a process developed by Shell. This new  power plant, with a capacity of 253 megawatts of electricity  (MWe), is currently the largest of its kind in the world. The  system must prove itself during a three-year demonstration  phase. If successful, a big brother of "Buggenum" will be built  in Borsele, Zeeland, with a capacity of 600 megawatts.    The part of the Limburg installation that generates  electricity is already operating on natural gas as an element of  the startup program, and is providing 100 megawatts of  electricity to the public network. In a few weeks the colossal  coal gasifier will also be started up, says Eng. G.D. Zon, the  project director of Demkolec, a subsidiary of the SEP set up  specifically for the new project. After that, the capacity will  be gradually increased to the maximum. Ultimately the power  plant will process 2,000 metric tons of coal a day.    According to Zon, the electricity that his installation will  then deliver is still about 20 percent more expensive than that  coming from a 600-megawatt powdered coal plant, but "Buggenum"  is intended to be a model for the large-scale application of  coal gasification. "At a capacity of 600 megawatts with high  efficiency, the production price is competitive. But we are  primarily interested in the environmental advantages. If all  this succeeds, and you put price tags on all the aspects, then I  think that a coal gasifier will end up being cheaper."    Coal gasification is not a new technology, as many  Limburgers  in particular know, because right in front of city hall in  Maastricht stands a statue of Father Prof. Pieter Johan  Minckelers, who discovered 210 years ago that heating pit coal  in an old barrel releases gas that is well-suited to launching  hot-air balloons and to lighting and heating. Since the  beginning of this century, the system has been applied by  municipalities on a large scale for the production for city gas,  but in the 1960's it was supplanted by cheaper and much cleaner  natural gas. For decades, industry has used the cheap gas  obtained from the production of coke, and during World War II  the Germans made synthetic gasoline from coal gas. Beginning in  1935, tests were also conducted with the underground  gasification of pit coal, but this has yet to yield commercial  success.    Coal gas as a fuel for generating electricity is indeed new.  In the late 1980's, Shell emerged as the winner of a bitter  struggle with competitors Texaco and British Gas Lurgi and was  able to provide the SEP with its technology, which came from the  technique that the company uses for oil gasification. All the  oil companies threw themselves into gasification technology  during the 1970's, says Eng. Zon. "After the first oil crisis,  they expected a shortage and a sharp price increase for oil and  natural gas. Because of that, the raw materials for the  petrochemical industry would also become much more expensive,  and so an alternative was sought. Synthesis gas, which is  created from coal gasification, is also suitable as feedstock  for the chemicals industry. That is why you now see all the oil  companies following this route. They have invested a great deal  of money in it. Coal gasification also generates hydrogen, and  the petrochemical industry always needs that. And it is easy to  combine the carbon in the gas with the hydrogen to create  substances that you need in the chemicals industry."    Modern natural gas-fired electric power plants can easily  achieve efficiency of more than 50 percent or even a little  higher. The test installation in Buggenum achieves 43 percent,  because of the applied technique. "Just look at our STEG unit  (steam and gas are both fed into turbines and the power is  converted into electricity via a generator) and then we will  achieve more than 50 percent," says Zon. "Then you have to  consider that we produce our own gas, while a natural gas plant  has its fuel delivered ready to use. But for this sort of power  plant there is an entire battery of equipment that treats the  gas and keeps it under pressure."    According to the director of Demkolec, a 600-megawatt coal  gasification plant should be able to achieve efficiency of 47  percent, and theoretically even 50 percent. But Zon is no  fetishist; he points out that the most modern powdered coal  plants will match the performance of coal gasification in terms  of efficiency and environmental properties. "I think that you  should install both systems side by side, in a competitive  relationship, with regard to power plant availability, cost per  kilowatt hour, and environmental performance." This opinion  diverges from the Master Plan for Electricity Supply, in which  the government, if "Buggenum" is successful, expresses a  preference for pit coal gasification alone in generating  electricity, aside from the two other fuels: natural gas and  uranium.    The government and electricity producers are in complete  agreement that coal is absolutely essential to the large-scale  generation of electricity. In the 1970's, the ideal mix of fuels  was determined to be one-third natural gas, one-third coal, and  one-third nuclear energy, but that mix was never achieved due to  the problems with opposition to nuclear power plants. Zon, who  was the director of the Nucon engineering firm for a number of  years, which specializes in nuclear energy: "If we were to  decide tomorrow to build new nuclear power plants, then in my  opinion you would have to regard coal gasification differently,  because nuclear energy remains cleaner and cheaper. Three fuels  with one-third each: That should remain the goal, that is  preferable in terms of the environment and price and also in  terms of fuel availability."    The assortment of fuels used right now is quite different.  Last year, 57 percent of the electricity produced in the  Netherlands was generated with natural gas, 37 percent with  coal, and 6 percent with uranium. In order to maintain the share  of coal--a relatively cheap and widely available fuel--at that  level, coal gasification is essential as one of the techniques  for cleaner burning. The coal is combined with pure oxygen in a  gasifier at a temperature of 1,500 degrees Celsius and a  pressure of 30 atmospheres. The coal gas product is then cooled,  purified, and subjected to "deep desulfurization," Zon explains,  through which the discharge of sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; )  is sharply reduced. The pure sulfur residue can be easily sold  on the domestic market, because the Netherlands currently still  imports sulfur.    By diluting the coal gas, the content of nitrogen oxides  (NOx) is sharply reduced. Purification (with water) of the gas  ensures a very limited discharge of matter from the power plant.  The water is purified again and evaporated, which leaves salts  as residue. Coal gasification has another environmental  advantage: The greenhouse gas CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  can be captured  easily and cheaply before combustion, although that has a  negative effect on efficiency. This is not yet being done in  Buggenum, but it can be considered for new, larger power plants.    Over the next two years, Demkolec will test seven types of  coal of various composition in the power plant and based on that  draw up a "blueprint" for new gasification plants. In the third  year, "Buggenum" will work with the SEP's National Efficiency  Program, the goal being to show that the availability of the  power plant is greater than 70 percent. There are currently 120  people working at the plant on day-to-day operations, plus  another 35 experts, including a number of people from Shell and  KEMA [Arnem Institute for the Testing of Electrical Engineering  Equipment], for testing, the demonstration program, and  evaluation.    "Shell has worked for 15 years on the total course of this  technology," says Zon. "But the potential for large-scale  application of this clean technology has increased sharply over  the past five years in particular, so that we can now say  confidently that it is becoming affordable and competitive for  the Netherlands, which together with Germany has the strictest  environmental regulations in the world."</p>

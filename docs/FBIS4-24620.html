			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the Chinese  Government is keen to develop friendly ties and cooperation with  Slovenia.    In his talks with Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister of Foreign Affairs Lojze Peterle here this morning,  Qian said that China is ready to promote bilateral cooperation  in all spheres.    Lojze Peterle arrived here Tuesday [31 May] evening on a  six-day official visit to China.    There is no obstacle to the development of Sino-Slovenian  cooperation, Qian said.    During Qian's September visit to Slovenia, the two countries  signed a number of cooperation agreements and the first session  of a Sino-Slovenian Commission on Economy and Trade was held.    Slovenia's prime minister is to visit China within the year,  which will coincide with the second session of the commission.    These are all signs of the gradual deepening of the  all-round  ties between China and Slovenia, Qian noted.    China adopts a positive attitude towards developing economic  and trade links with Slovenia, and there existed a good basis  and potential for this cooperation in the past, Qian said.    To fully tap this potential, the two governments should  encourage their enterprises to contact each other more  frequently and adopt more ways of cooperation, he said, adding  that the sister-city relationship should also be reinforced.    He expressed the hope that the contacts between Slovenian  businessmen, who are here with the deputy prime minister, and  their Chinese counterparts will bear positive results.    Peterle said that he was happy to be here, and that his trip  would deepen bilateral ties.    He agreed with Qian that the two countries should adopt  various forms to propel their cooperation to a new high.    The visit to China by Slovenia's prime minister later in the  year, and the meeting of the Economic and Trade Commission of  the two countries would lay a solid basis for further  cooperation between the two countries, Peterle said.    After the talks, Qian and Peterle, on behalf of their  governments, signed an agreement on the mutual exemption of  diplomatic and service passport visas.    Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo and Slovenian  Ambassador to China Ivan Senicar [name as received] were present  at the talks and the signing ceremony.</p>

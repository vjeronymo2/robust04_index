Publication of this announcement does not obligate the Corporation to award any specific number of grants or obligate the entire amount of funds available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional factors that may be taken into account in the selection process include population density, geographic distribution of programs, and diversity among participants and program strategies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notification of tentative selection will be made by April 1, 1994. Selections will be considered tentative until execution of a final grant agreement, which may require discussions between Corporation and program staff to resolve remaining financial or programmatic issues and to refine and/or further develop plans or specific strategies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Corporation anticipates providing extensive technical assistance to successful applicants between the time of selection through the launch of project service activity, and throughout the summer. This assistance will include a mandatory 3 day training/technical assistance workshop to be conducted for all Summer of Safety program directors and key staff in late April. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Appendix provides suggestions for how you might approach the development of a Summer of Safety program. It is meant to be thought-provoking and is not a required process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Identify the Crime/Violence Problem To Be Addressed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By working directly with local law enforcement, canvassing door-to-door in neighborhoods, attending community meetings, setting up meetings for law enforcement with community groups, contacting and surveying local businesses, public agencies, service organizations, youth groups, senior groups, etc., your organization can identify specific crime problems which confront the community and concern residents. The types of issues most readily identified through this kind of analysis include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Specific population needs (e.g., seniors who are afraid to go to the market after dark, or children who can't use a playground because of drug activity, debris or disrepair, or teenagers who get in trouble when a facility_theater, club, etc._closes for the evening, or targets of hate crimes); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Physical hazards (e.g., drug houses, vacant structures used for drug trade or other illegal or disorderly purpose, abandoned vehicles, missing street lights, broken fences, dangerous vehicle traffic patterns, open-air drug markets); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Resident safety concerns (e.g., fear of crime and victimization, need for crime prevention information_locks, etc., lack of information about crime within neighborhood); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Unreported or undetected criminal activity (e.g., drug use or sales in a neighborhood location, gang activity, prostitution, victims of crime who have not reported the victimization or who continue to be victimized_especially victims of domestic violence or fraudulent solicitors/practices). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Pick The Partners <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Think broadly about the range of organizations that are already involved in reducing crime and violence in your community, or that may be interested in joining such an effort. Try to determine which ones have missions, resources or experience comparable to yours. City agencies, especially local law enforcement agencies, should be considered. Other possible partners include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Schools (including higher education institutions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Private non-profit organizations (particularly those that work to prevent crime and violence or that work with youth or victims of crime). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Community and neighborhood organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Senior or neighborhood centers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Private businesses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Please read Program Narrative section 2(g) (``Partnership'') carefully regarding the delineation of roles and other aspects of creating a useful partnership. Keep in mind that, while effective partnerships will involve many elements in a community, eligibility to receive funds and parameters of allowable activities are limited. (See sections entitled, ``Eligibility'' and ``Limitations''.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

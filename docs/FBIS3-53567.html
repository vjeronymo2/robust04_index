The first of these is a  change in U.S. policy and its dealings with the Arabs,  particularly with the Syrian president, who has proved his  ability to negotiate and make great political gains through the  imposition of a just and honorable settlement.    In a statement he made today, Minister Dallul paid tribute  to  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for promoting the Arab position,  noting that he did not treat the Golan issue as more important  than the Lebanese, Jordanian, or Palestinian issues. He said  that the lesson of the historic summit is summed up as the need  for steadfastness in pursuing Arab rights and not to follow the  method of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which is facing new  obstacles every day.    Information Minister Michel Samahah said that the summit  between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill  Clinton has moved the Middle East into a new era and laid the  basis for achieving a just and comprehensive peace. He said:  What happened yesterday put an end to efforts to achieve a  separate peace. It also put an end to Israel's efforts to deal  with each Arab party separately. The summit emphasized the  comprehensive nature of the solution, the justness of the Arab  demands, and the need for a just and comprehensive peace based  on the UN resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242, 323, and  425, and on the principle of land for peace.    Minister Samahah saluted President al-Asad for supporting  Arab rights, particularly Resolution 425. He said: We must  give due credit to the one who represented Arab dignity and  expressed the Arab desire to negotiate on the basis of a firm  and principled position, thus winning international recognition  for Arab rights.    He said: The Geneva summit is a new turning point. We must  face the challenge through unity. Minister Samahah was speaking  at a meeting with Milhim Karam, chairman of the Editors  Association, and members of the association's council.</p>

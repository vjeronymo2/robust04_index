			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By NONGMIN RIBAO reporter Sun Yongren (1327 3057 0088) and </F> XINHUA reporter Hua Guiqin (5478 2710 0530)]    [Text] Nanchang, 27 May (XINHUA) -- "We should make the  acceleration of the economic development of major grain and  cotton production areas a systems engineering project, ensuring  a steady increase of grain and cotton production, all-around  development of the economy, and more income for farmers." This  is the common understanding reached by economists attending a  national seminar on the economic development of major grain and  cotton production areas.    Over the years, for historical and many other reasons,  China's major grain and cotton production areas have, on the one  hand, provided large amounts of commercial grain and cotton to  the whole country and made important contributions to the  national economic development and improvement of the people's  living standards; on the other hand, these areas have seen a low  level of overall economic development, slow growth of local  financial revenues, and comparatively low income for farmers.  To properly resolve this outstanding problem in the Chinese  rural economy, leaders, experts, and scholars from Heilongjiang,  Jilin, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang Hunan, Hubei,  Anhui, and Jiangxi -- the major grain and cotton production  areas -- attended a seminar cosponsored by the State Council  Research Office and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to discuss  measures to promote grain and cotton production areas' economic  development. Yuan Mu, director of the State Council Research  Office, gave a keynote speech at the seminar.    The seminarians held: China has always attached great  importance to grain and cotton production. The Central Rural  Work Conference, convened last October, explicitly called for  prioritizing support for major grain and cotton production  areas' economic development. However, in the past we paid more  attention to grain and cotton production within the context of  promoting production, than to systemamtic study and solutions of  questions related to these areas' all-around economic  development. As a result, many areas faced the predicament of  "major grain and cotton production counties having weak industry  and being in financial straits," causing fluctuations in grain  and cotton markets. A summary of historical experiences and  lessons shows that we should make the promotion of major grain  and cotton areas' economic development a systems engineering  project. This is a new strategic concept for solving problems  related to grain and cotton production under the condition of a  socialist market economy, about which leaders at all levels and  relevant departments should reach a common understanding.    In line with this new concept for major grain and cotton  production areas' economic development, the seminarians  suggested that attention be paid to identifying and solving  problems related to the following 10 issues: Defining a  comprehensive and correct economic development goal for the  major grain and cotton production areas by shifting from the  previous simple mode of grain and cotton farming to the  establishment of a comprehensive goal that organically combines  steady growth of grain and cotton production with all-around  economic development and a rapid increase of farmers' incomes;  making agricultural modernization the foundation of economic  development, with the emphasis on extensive popularization and  application of science and technology to revitalize agriculture;  bringing into better play the areas' advantages in grain and  cotton production as they form the foundation and pillar as well  as provide the source for steady growth of farmers' incomes in  these areas; continuously readjusting and optimizing these  areas' production structures, ensuring a stable growth in the  total grain and cotton output while actively developing  diversified management and nonagricultural undertakings;  transferring surplus laborers from these areas through various  channels and strengthening efforts to organize, guide, and  manage such transfer; gradually introducing large-scale  operations to these areas and, first of all, utilizing these  areas' advantages in grain and cotton production by promoting  large-scale comprehensive agricultural development projects;  establishing a pricing system conducive to a stable increase of  grain and cotton output and in line with the principle of  production cost plus reasonable profit; establishing a new  system for grain and cotton procurement and market in keeping  with a market economy; establishing fair and reasonable  relations of interests between grain and cotton producing and  marketing areas; and adopting effective goverment preferential  policies toward major grain and cotton production areas, mainly  in terms of providing funds, loans, major scientific and  technological projects, the pattern of processing industries,  and foreign trade exports.</p>

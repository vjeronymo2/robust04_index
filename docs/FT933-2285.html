			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Claims on milk prices attacked MR ANDREW DARE, chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board, has attacked claims by some of the UK's large dairy companies that consumer milk prices will rise when the Pounds 3.3bn industry enters a free market next April. Mr Dare said: 'There will certainly be some rises in price, but they should be modest.' He believes consumer prices should not rise by more than 8 per cent and will be kept down by intense competition among dairy companies. The UK's dairy industry became embroiled in a row about pricing after Mr Dare held out the prospect of higher prices to farmers for their supplies if they joined Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk Marketing Board, which is to be abolished. Mr Dare believes that the removal of the current pricing system, which charges dairy company customers different prices for milk depending on its end-use, will see consumers paying higher prices for products such as butter or cheese. 'But prices to UK farmers are not high by European standards. I don't see why UK farmers shouldn't get higher prices while consumer price rises are kept at a modest level,' he said. A report by Adas, the government's farm development service, says farmers should be wary of counting on higher payments over the long term. Mr John Sumner, head of dairy development at Adas, said: 'The milk price could stay good for a couple of years as milk buyers bid for supplies, but after that the effects of a Gatt settlement will bring pressure on prices.' The Adas report, which is due to be released on Wednesday, urges the industry to become more involved in higher-quality, added-value products such as dairy desserts, fromage frais and soft cheeses as a way of competing against imports. The UK produces only 85 per cent of its own dairy needs, and is constrained by European Community quotas from raising output. But countries such as The Netherlands and Denmark produce two to three times their own consumption and look to the UK as a lucrative export market. The UK's dairy trade deficit was Pounds 609m last year. The abolition of the Milk Marketing Board introduces competition into milk buying for the first time since the 1930s, and many UK dairy companies are looking to buy directly from farmers. The forces of competition could speed up the rationalisation of the dairy industry, with many plants closing because of over-capacity. The size of dairy farms is expected to increase as many smaller producers go out of business. Mr Sumner believes that a third of the UK's 29,000 dairy farmers will leave the business by the year 2000, pushed by pressure on incomes and tempted by high asset values - such as the price for selling EC quota. 'Farmers have a short period of fairly good profits in the next couple of years when they should improve their facilities and gear up their financial base for the hard times to come,' he said.</p>

Commenting on the results of his trip, Churkin told TASS  that  these meeting had concentrated on Bosnian settlement,  specifically the possibility of disengaging Croatian and Muslim  forces.    As for Bosnia's territorial division and state arrangement,  these issues need to be thoroughly examined, the Russian envoy  noted. He is going to discuss them during Monday's meeting with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    Speaking about the Russian peacekeeping battalion deployed  in  Sarajevo, Churkin said neither the Muslim side nor the regional  command of peacekeeping forces had any claims to it. The  battalion is to be shortly reinforced with about one hundred  extra fighters expected to arrive in Sarajevo in late March.    As for the current situation in the Bosnian capital, Churkin  believes it has notably changed for the better. "For the first  time over the past year, the situation here is close to normal.  Moreover, Krajisnik has told me that Serbs and Muslim reached  agreement on movement of civilians in Sarajevo and around it.  This is a very important decision", Churkin stressed.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Further rise in orders indicates US recovery NEW orders for US manufactured goods continued to rise in April, adding to evidence of a distinct but still restrained recovery in economic activity. The Commerce Department said new orders rose by Dollars 2.4bn or 1 per cent, the fourth consecutive monthly increase. An increase of 0.7 per cent in orders for non-durable goods added to the 1.3 per cent rise in durable goods orders already reported by the department. Shipments of manufactured goods rose by 0.2 per cent, with higher non-durable deliveries offsetting a decline in shipments of durable goods. Economists said the statistics confirmed previous indications of some form of economic recovery, but shed little additional light on its strength. Some analysts noted that the pick-up in orders was no stronger than a similar revival last summer that soon fizzled out. Adding to caution was the announcement that the value of orders in hand with manufacturers fell for the eighth consecutive month to Dollars 501.8bn, their lowest level for nearly three years. The strongest sectors for new orders in April were home goods and apparel - where orders climbed by 3.4 per cent - and automotive equipment, up 2.8 per cent.</p>

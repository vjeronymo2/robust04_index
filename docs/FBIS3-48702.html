			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] In the predawn hours of 18 January, two satellites  were placed in the satellite fairing of the H-II, which is  scheduled to be launched from the Tanegashima Space Center,  located in Minami Tanega-cho, Kumage-gun, on 1 February by the  National Space Development Agency of Japan [NASDA]. Launch  preparations for Japan's first purely domestically produced  rocket have been completed, and only some detailed work remains  to be done.    The two satellites to be launched in the H-II will be the  OREX, the orbital reentry experimental vehicle for the HOPE,  Japan's version of an unmanned space shuttle now being  developed; and the VEP mini satellite, a payload to verify the  H-II's performance.    The 12-meter-tall satellite fairing containing these two  satellites was slowly moved on a trailer from the satellite  fairing hangar at 0250 on 18 January, taking about two hours to  travel the two kilometers between the hangar and the Yoshinobu  launch pad launch-test tower.    Then four cables lifted the fairing up about 40 meters,  where  it was docked to the rocket, which had already been placed in  the launch tower.</p>

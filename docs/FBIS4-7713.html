			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Congressman Frank McCloskey spent yesterday  and today in the capital city of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At today's  news conference McCloskey stated his impressions of his visit to  Sarajevo and Mostar. Guests at the conference were Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic and the President of the Serbian  Consultative Council Ljubomir Berberovic. Nedzad Leko reports:    [Begin recording] [Leko] Congressman Frank McCloskey,  member of the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees in  the U.S. Congress, said that the renewed attacks at Gorazde and  Bihac confirm that the war is not over.    [McCloskey, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation  read by Leko] There is no doubt at all that the war still  continues. Sarajevo, despite everything, is not a free city. It  is a city under siege although it is not being shelled at the  moment. I visited Mostar on two occasions on Friday and  Saturday. The people on the eastern banks are still suffering,  the food is inadequate, there is no electricity, they drink  unfiltered water from the Neretva River. In the meantime, the  terrible ethnic cleansing continues, particularly in the region  of Banja Luka and Prijedor. Sixty thousand citizens of Gorazde  are under siege. Many things still need to be done. In  comparison to the pre-war situation, only 24,000, or 7 percent  of the non-Serbian population, has remained in the region of  Banja Luka. The entire world continues to turn a blind eye  while this ethnic cleansing continues in Banja Luka and other  areas. The planned evacuation from Prijedor is against all the  provisions of international law and human ethics. That is why  we need to ask ourselves what the world is doing, why is it not  acting? Something must be done. The world must not turn a  blind eye to this. When I return to Washington, I will request  the Administration to send U.S. personnel here. For the time  being, these do not need to be peace forces, but logistics  personnel, engineers, administrators, medical crews. I believe  that this would help maintain the peace between the Bosniaks and  the Croats.    [Leko] Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called on the  international community to react urgently to the attacks on  Gorazde and the ethnic cleansing.    [Silajdzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation  read by Leko] The question is why the UN Security Council is  not reacting to this. What does the term safe haven mean if not  the protection of the civilian population in Gorazde and Bihac?  Second, why is the Convention on Genocide from 1949 not  observed, when genocide continues in Bosnia-Herzegovina? The  process of ethnic cleansing is being drawn to a close in Banja  Luka and Prijedor, genocide is being completed. This, of  course, to a great extent calls into question the continuation  of the peace process. If in this way a situation is created  where there will be no non-Serbian population in the occupied  areas, then this creates a different situation at the  negotiating table. The problem is that the international  community minimizes this fact, which in turn creates yet another  situation, that is, these people are encouraged to carry on.  They are attacking Gorazde, Bihac, they are ethnically  cleansing Prijedor, Sipovo, Banja Luka, yet there is no  reaction. Our question is why the Security Council is not  reacting to this, because they have an obligation to react.    [Leko] Dr. Ljubo Berberovic, president of the Serbian  Consultative Council informed the correspondents about the  measures this body was taking in connection to this.    [Berberovic, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation  read by Leko] The Serbian Civic Council and the Serbian  Consultative Council in Sarajevo have written to the UN Security  Council demanding urgent action to stop the further maltreatment  of civilians and any further ethnic cleansing. If this is not  done, there will be little chance of successfully defending  Bosnia- Herzegovina as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural  community. We have proposed that groups of observers be  urgently sent to Banja Luka and Prijedor as the first step  toward maintaining chances for a successful continuation of the  peace process.    [Leko] At the end of the news conference, Congressman  McCloskey said that it was still not too late for the salvation  of hundreds of thousands of human lives. Genocide and ethnic  cleansing must be stopped by an urgent action of the  international community. [end recording]</p>

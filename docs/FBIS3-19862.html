			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Udo Bergdoll editorial: "Dialogue With the Russian Bear"] </F>   [Text] Meetings between Helmut Kohl and Boris Yeltsin and  telephone conversations between Klaus Kinkel and Andrey Kozyrev  have become a matter of routine for the chancellor and the  foreign minister. Both consider it necessary to have the  closest possible contact with their Russian counterparts. Bonn  does not expect a smooth development concerning the major power  in the East which is split socially and destroyed economically,  but which wants to become a superpower again. Thus, Bonn does  not want to miss any opportunity to exert influence as long as  possible. For this reason, the foreign minister is again  visiting his Russian counterpart in Moscow -- to accelerate the  lengthy talks on the return of cultural goods, for example, but,  above all, to continue the dialogue on security in Europe.    Two tendencies are beginning to emerge -- a reassuring and  an  alarming one. On the one hand, it seems possible to transform  relations between Germany and Russia into normal bilateral  relations. On the other, however, Russian and Western interests  seem to diverge. According to U.S. ideas, Russia should be a  partner, but it might also develop into an unpredictable  competitor. In fact, Kozyrev is considered a Western-oriented  man. Yet if one analyzes his statements about Moscow's role in  Europe and the world, they reveal a new imperialist claim.  Thus, Bonn also wavers between hope and fear when the few  reformers that Yeltsin still has spell out what they understand  by "strategic partnership" (Kozyrev) with the United States and  collective security in Europe. It is now the task of German  foreign policy to avoid setting the wrong course.    The close personal contact with the rulers in Moscow is  advisable for Bonn because the diplomatic development between  the two capitals is not free of friction. The Russian  ambassador to Bonn, Vladislav Terekhov, was Soviet ambassador  before the fall of the Wall. At the beginning of the coup  against Gorbachev, he came to the Chancellor's Office to  announce the names of the new partners in the Kremlin. He must  know a great deal to survive for such a long time in his  position in Bonn, members of the diplomatic corps have pointed  out. Recently, Terekhov has again been behaving in a way that  made Bonn officials believe that they have missed another coup.  The following may serve as an example: Those who doubt that  the Baltic republics belong to Russia are told by the Russian  ambassador that this region has been part of Russia for 250  years and that it is nobody's business when the troops withdraw.  The smooth withdrawal of the Russian soldiers from Berlin and  East Germany is an absolutely positive result of the new  relationship between Bonn and Moscow. Chancellor Kohl ensures  that the withdrawal of the Red Army, which advanced as far as  Central Europe under Stalin, is taking place without any  humiliation. One can only hope that justice will also be done  to the Western Allies who were the protectors and not the  occupiers of Berlin. Attentiveness vis-a-vis the East requires  an explanation to the West if it is not to be misunderstood.    For Germany, Russia is a major power that must be integrated  in a new system of European security and whose isolation should  be prevented. Bonn also shows understanding that such a big  country does not want to be treated in the same way as smaller  states from its former sphere of influence. However, Russia's  ideas about the future balance, which seem harmless at first  sight, conceal Moscow's hegemonial claims. The Russians want  NATO to be subordinated to the seemingly dead CSCE. The Western  alliance could then ensure order in its sphere of influence, and  Russia could do the same in the CIS states. In fact, the West  also believes that Russian soldiers should end the bloodshed in  the Caucasus. Yet NATO does not want to give them a permanent  mandate or a blank check. Russian troops should only be allowed  to refer to the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris upon  the wish of all parties to the conflict. The West believes that  everything else would be assistance in reawakening the former  Soviet Union. However, there is no longer any place for "vital  spheres of interest" in Europe, as claimed by Moscow, after the  fundamental changes that have taken place. Thus, the  "Partnership for Peace" must not be the final response to the  desires of the reform states in Central and East Europe for  security under NATO cover.    Moscow has intensively looked to Bonn for some time because  only Germany has provided substantive financial aid so far. At  the moment, the Russians are focusing on the United States.  They can only be confirmed as a world power by the United  States. After all, their determined attitude vis-a-vis Bosnia  and the fear of being humiliated by NATO and the United States  led to the cease-fire of Sarajevo without air strikes. For  Bonn, Moscow is a Janus-faced partner. Should it look to the  future? Or should it look back in anger? It is going in both  directions at the same time.</p>

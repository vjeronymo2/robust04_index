			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 16 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President  Clinton today outlined several new steps to fight the nation's  plaguing crime.    In his weekly radio address, Clinton said the government  will  encourage weapons frisks in gang-infested public housing to  prevent crime if tenants agree.    "We'll encourage more weapons frisks of suspicious persons,  and we'll ask associations to put clauses in their leases  allowing searches when crime conditions make it necessary," he  said.    He said residents will be empowered to organize tenant  patrols to ride elevators and to look after the public spaces in  high-rise public housing units.    Clinton also announced a federal allocation of some 30  million dollars to crack down on the growing crime wave in  public housing, to help residents to "take back their homes."    He said the government will provide more programs such as  midnight basketball leagues "to help our young people say no to  gangs and guns and drugs."</p>

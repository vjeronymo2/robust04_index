			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITION 128;  </P> <P> EPA CHIEF QUESTIONS PROVISIONS OF 'BIG GREEN'  </P> <P> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly joined the  controversy over a sweeping environmental initiative on the November ballot,  calling it potentially costly and disruptive.  </P> <P> In remarks to reporters after a speech at a clean air conference in Los  Angeles, Reilly stopped short of taking a position on Proposition 128, known as  "Big Green" by its supporters, saying: "I will observe with fascination what  California does with it."  </P> <P> The EPA administrator, who was also in California to boost the Republican  gubernatorial campaign of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, raised questions about the  initiative, which Wilson opposes.  </P> <P> The initiative could result in fairly significant new taxes on gasoline and  other fuels because of provisions that call for a 40% reduction in carbon  dioxide emissions by 2010, Reilly said.  </P> <P> He questioned the scientific basis of "novel" sections that would outlaw trace  amounts of pesticides on food if laboratory tests concluded that they caused  cancer in animals when ingested in high doses.  </P> <P> "It could be disruptive and obviously involves setting up a very different  pesticide registration testing program than exists for the rest of the U.S. Yet  if it passes, we will do everything we can to work with it," Reilly said.  </P> <P> Reilly also questioned whether it makes sense for California to reduce the use  of chemicals that destroy the upper atmosphere's protective ozone layer four  years earlier than 2000, the year called for in the Montreal Protocol, a treaty  signed by the United States.  </P> <P> The initiative calls for phasing out chlorofluorocarbons by Dec. 31, 1996.  </P> <P> "I think it's a question of whether it makes sense to go down that road when  after a great deal of scientific analysis and international negotiations the  world community has agreed on the year 2000," Reilly said.  </P> <P> Reilly said the additional time was allowed by the treaty so more energy  efficient substitutes could be developed.  </P> <P> "There's an awful lot in Big Green," Reilly added. "It would appear to have  very significant costs associated with it," he said.  </P> <P> He also noted that Wilson was concerned about the creation of an elected  statewide environmental advocate.  </P> <P> Reilly said other provisions in the initiative are praiseworthy.  </P> <P> He said the ballot measure, though costly, would not be ruinous to the economy  and could promote savings through energy conservation. Reilly said that if the  initiative fails, he hoped it would not mark a turning point in public support  for environmental concerns.  </P> <P> "If it fails, I think one would only point to how extremely inclusive and  ambitious it is and then speculate perhaps if fewer (proposals) had been  involved, if the costs had been lower and schedules somewhat different that the  result might have been different," Reilly said.  </P> <P> Speaking on the opening day of a three-day California Clean Air and New  Technologies conference at the Los Angeles Bonaventure Hotel, Reilly said the  public and private cost of environmental regulation in the United States will  rise to $200 billion annually by 2000, or up to 3% of the gross national  product -- twice the current level.  </P> <P> Reilly said Congress was close to enacting "the most sweeping and innovative  clean air act in American history." He said that the Bush Administration is  concerned that Congress may not complete work before adjourning later this  month.  </P> <P> He also criticized provisions of the bill being hammered out in a House-Senate  conference committee, particularly an amendment to provide up to $250 million  to retrain coal miners who might lose their jobs because of the bill's limits  on sulfur dioxide emissions from coal that cause acid rain.  </P> <P> "I think that is bad economic policy, bad social policy and certainly bad  environmental policy," Reilly told reporters. "And we don't trust the ceiling  of $250 million."  </P> <P> Asked if the President would veto the bill if that provision remained, Reilly  replied, "I am not going to talk about a veto right now. We're much more  concerned to encourage the Congress to move with dispatch on the legislation. .  . . Our concern is very much to get a bill that the President can sign."  </P></p>

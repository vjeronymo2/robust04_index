			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`mes' report: "Ministers To Move to Old Berlin Buildings"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- The government has agreed that most federal  ministries will occupy existing old buildings when they move to  Berlin. This will permit saving about two-thirds of the  1.5-billion-marks [DM] savings called for by the Bundestag  Budget Committee, said Irmgard Schwaetzer, minister for housing  and city planning, in Bonn. On Wednesday [1 June], the cabinet  approved an "accommodation concept" which, apart from a complete  reconstruction of the Reichstag, only envisages the construction  of a new Chancellery and Foreign Office.    Whereas the intention until now was to accommodate some  two-thirds of the federal ministries in old buildings in Berlin,  almost 90 percent of the ministries will be thus accommodated,  according to the new plan. The government believes that the  resulting savings will amount to about DM980 million. The  Budget Committee had called for savings of 1.5 billion, so that  the total cost of the move to Berlin does not excceed DM20  billion. The move is supposed to begin in 1998, but the exact  date depends on when the reconstruction of the Reichstag, the  Bundestag's new home, will be completed.    There is no doubt that a new Chancellery will be built on  the  bend of the Spree River, close to the Reichstag. On the other  hand, the Foreign Office must do without a completely new home  for the time being. The cabinet decided that the Foreign  Ministry will only occupy part of a new building, and that most  of it will he split up among existing buildings.    As for the other ministries due to move to Berlin, there  will  be a general refurbishment of the buildings they are due to  occupy there. Thus, previous plans to build new buildings for  the Justice and Finance Ministries have been canceled. Also  abrogated is the plan to build the "Hexagon," which was supposed  to accommodate representations of those government departments  remaining in Bonn.    The new concept approved by the Cabinet will now be placed  before the Budget Committee and the Joint Financial Committee of  the Federal Government and Berlin Senat. Berlin Mayor Eberhard  Diepgen welcomed the government's decision, saying that the  schedule for the government's and parliament's move to Berlin  could now be kept. "Costs and space requirements are now geared  to needs" he said.</p>

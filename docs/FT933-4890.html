			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Travel links under attack LARGE CHAINS of travel agents are recommending their parent companies' holidays to customers, with more than a third offering no alternative, a report published today by Holiday Which? magazine says. Magazine staff visited 80 travel outlets. Most of the travel agents which form part of large groups initially suggested holidays sold by their parent companies, although some suggested alternatives. The magazine said three-quarters of Lunn Poly outlets visited suggested Thomson holidays. Lunn Poly is owned by the Thomson group. Half the shops later suggested holidays from other operators. Two-thirds of Thomas Cook branches offered either the chain's own holidays or those of Owners Abroad, the tour operator with which it is linked. At Hogg Robinson branches half the initial suggestions were for holidays from Airtours, the parent company. At Pickfords Travel, also owned by Airtours, three-quarters offered trips to Paris from the parent company. Fewer Airtours holidays to Crete were offered by Pickfords staff.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong rebounds 1.3% as index futures surge Many of the Pacific Rim markets were helped ahead by Tokyo's firmer tone. HONG KONG staged a strong rebound, with the Hang Seng index 112.44, or 1.3 per cent, higher at 9,125.21, as the market was buoyed by a surge in index futures. But turnover contracted to HKDollars 4.55bn from Monday's HKDollars 5.58bn. The index tumbled on Monday amid fears that the government might introduce Governor Chris Patten's political reform package at a meeting of the Executive Council yesterday. Reports that the council had given the go-ahead for the introduction of part of the democratic reform bill came after the market closed. Bank of East Asia topped the actives list, climbing HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 44. HSBC rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 85.50 and Hang Seng Bank added HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 58.50. After the market closed, the government announced that it had awarded new telecommunications licences to units of Hutchison, Wharf and New World. Hutchison was steady at HKDollars 31, Wharf was up 40 cents at HKDollars 26.90 and New World gained 40 cents at HKDollars 27.30. HK Telecom, which will lose its monopoly on domestic conventional telecommunications in 1995, rose 30 cents to HKDollars 14.70. TAIWAN finished lower on profit-taking after Monday's 5.3 per cent surge, although optimism after the ruling Nationalist party's victory in elections last week continued to support shares. The market index shed 30.61 to 4,353.90 in a large turnover of TDollars 47.2bn. Heavy profit-taking, particularly in financials, was attributed to recent weakness in Tokyo and Hong Kong. SEOUL took a turn for the better, after four straight sessions of declines, on renewed demand for export-orientated blue chip manufacturing issues. The composite index rose 6.52 to 811.06 in Won687.6bn turnover, up from Monday's Won618.8bn. Demand for the blue chips was attributed to better than expected third-quarter GNP growth, improving industrial output and current account surpluses for the second consecutive month. NEW ZEALAND was easier as investors paused to assess the new cabinet, although a late buying spurt took the market off its low for the day. The NZSE-40 capital index finished 20.93 down at 2,021.62, having dipped to 2,008.80 earlier. Turnover was still reasonably high at NZDollars 85.75m. The late demand was largely confined to Fletcher Challenge, which appreciated 7 cents to NZDollars 4.07, Carter Holt Harvey, which ended only 3 cents off at NZDollars 3.43, and Telecom, a net 9 cents down at NZDollars 3.90. AUSTRALIA was marginally weaker after bargain hunters lifted the market off early morning lows. The All Ordinaries index finished 0.9 off at 2,009.4 after a day's low of 1,994.8. Among leading shares, News Corp rose 15 cents to ADollars 9.83, while BHP shed 10 to ADollars 16.40. SINGAPORE closed easier, but afternoon sentiment was lifted by the healthy rebound in Tokyo and investors returning to buy speculative Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 2.78 at 2,096.14 after setting an intraday low of 2,090.73. KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by strong demand for utilities, with sentiment boosted by the rebound in Tokyo and Hong Kong. The composite index climbed 24.35 to 996.45. Tenaga and Telekom firmed 80 cents each to MDollars 16.40 and MDollars 19.20 respectively. KARACHI advanced after seven successive days of falls, the KSE 100-share index firming 8.35 to 1,691.79. BANGKOK closed at the day's high after local mutual funds bought bank, finance and brokerage shares in the afternoon. The SET index gained 14.44, or 1.11 per cent, at 1,309.95 in thin turnover of nearly Bt8bn. JAKARTA ended on a mixed note, although sentiment was positive on selected stocks. The official index was 1.68 lower at 518.78. SHANGHAI B shares continued to lose ground amid worries that the market would head even lower on fears that US fund managers were losing some of their appetite for Asian stocks. The B index slipped 1.31 to 81.42.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Economic slowdown pushes currency to record low THE Australian dollar fell to a record low of 49.1 on the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index (TWI) yesterday after government figures showed that economic growth has stagnated at the lower end of official forecasts. The statistics bureau said that the average measure of gross domestic product grew by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter, following revised growth of one per cent in the three months to December. The figures indicate that the Australian economy is growing at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent, the lower end of the government's 2.5-3 per cent target. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, had earlier forecast 4 per cent growth. Confirmation of the moderate rate of growth fuelled unease in financial markets following the release on Monday of a worse than expected current account deficit for April. The Australian dollar closed at 67.45 US cents in Sydney from 67.68 cents on Monday, when it fell 1.5 cents in response to the poor current account figures and at Y71.97 against the yen from Y72.38. On the TWI, the dollar fell from 49.4 on Monday to 49.1, below the previous low of 49.3 recorded in 1986 after Mr Keating, the then treasurer, warned that Australia faced a 'banana republic' debt crisis. The poor economic indicators suggest that the government will face serious constraints in fulfilling election promises to achieve a significant reduction in unemployment, currently 10.7 per cent. Standard and Poor's, the international credit rating agency, said Australia's current account deficit was 'a major concern', and warned that faster economic growth would cause 'inevitable balance of payments pressures'. The agency said the current account deficit reinforced concerns about the impact of the government's growing budget deficit on demand for imports. The budget deficit is forecast at ADollars 16bn (Pounds 7.23bn) this year and ADollars 18bn in 1993/94, compared with ADollars 12bn last year.</p>

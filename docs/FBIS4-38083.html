			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Terence White] </F>   [Text] Kabul, June 27 (AFP) -- At least 10 people were  killed or wounded when a jet loyal to the ex-communist Uzbek  General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam bombed an east Kabul residential  area early Monday [27 June], witnesses said.    The plane dropped between four and six bombs shortly before  9:00 am (0430 GMT), hitting civilian homes, the witnesses said.    "I was sitting down playing cards when suddenly there was a  huge flash and an explosion," Mohammad Karim told AFP. Karim,  an ex-military serviceman, who still had blood on his hands from  digging out the dismembered corpse of one victim, said he  thought most of the bombs dropped were in the 250-kilogram (550  pounds) range, but possibly there was one 500-kilogram (1,100  pound) monster.    In one house locals dug with shovels to rescue a man buried  alive, then turned their attention to another house where two  children were said to be under the rubble. Hysterical women  from the bombed houses cried in the street as neighbours were  packed belongings in taxis to flee the scene. [sentence as  received] The final casualty toll will not be known until all  the wreckage has been cleared from the bombed area.    The bombing may have been in retaliation for the loss of two  strategic posts in eastern Kabul at the weekend when forces  loyal to Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani captured Bala  Hesar and Maranjan Hill from the coalition alliance of Dostam  and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar.    Meanwhile the rival factions in the east of the city  continued to trade heavy artillery fire all morning.</p>

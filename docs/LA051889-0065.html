			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAGLE ROCK SET TO DEFEND GIRLS' GYMNASTICS TITLE  </P> <P> Although Eagle Rock High has won four consecutive girls' gymnastics  championships, it is seeded below Cleveland in the City Section championships  at Wilson High 7 p.m. tonight. Eagle Rock Coach Jan Freis-Martinez is unfazed.  </P> <P> In fact, being seeded second is just fine, thank you. Last season, Eagle Rock  clinched the title from the same position.  </P> <P> This year, however, repeating should be more difficult. Jennifer Mickschl, the  Eagles' top gymnast, might have a stress fracture in her wrist that,  Freis-Martinez said, will almost certainly keep her from competing.  </P> <P> "It's heartbreaking," Freis-Martinez said of losing Mickschl. "We were looking  at three nines and a high eight from her."  </P> <P> Senior Bobbi Dudley should help pick up the slack. Dudley, who finished first  in the league and seventh in the City in diving, competes at the Class 1 level  in vault, beam and floor and Class 2 in bars.  </P> <P> For the first time in the five years, Marshall has fielded a team. The  Barristers, who will compete, are paced by junior Suzy Karlic.  </P></p>

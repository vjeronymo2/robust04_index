			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Karstadt sees difficulty in maintaining earning levels KARSTADT, Germany's largest department store group, sees difficulties in maintaining its earning levels at the previous year's levels because of the country's recession, Reuter reports from Essen. 'Despite the unfavourable (economic) environment, we are confident we will achieve satisfactory results again in 1993, although it will be difficult to reach the previous year's levels,' Karstadt said in its 1992 annual report. In 1992, Karstadt's group net profit fell to DM224.1m (Dollars 140m) from DM257m the previous year, while group third-party sales climbed to DM20.6bn from DM19.1bn. Karstadt planned to continue to focus on department stores, mail order houses and tourism in the future, although it would create new stores for glasses called 'Optik Point'. 'The development of our company and its considerable potential make it clear that we remain on a successful path with concentration on our three main businesses,' he said. Of the group's 1992 sales including tourism turnover, which totalled DM21bn, department store sales accounted for 61.7 per cent, mail order sales for 16.32 per cent, service turnover for 19.16 per cent and wholesale turnover for 2.79 per cent.</p>

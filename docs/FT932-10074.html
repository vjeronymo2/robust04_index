			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Business and the law: Equal pensions ruling clarified - European Court At the end of April the European Court delivered its preliminary opinion in four cases brought before it seeking clarification of equal pension rights following the court's Barber judgment of May 17 1990. Advocate General Walter Van Gerven, delivering the opinion, said the equal treatment principle may not be relied upon to claim entitlement to an occupational pension acquired in connection with periods of employment served prior to May 17 1990, except in the case of employees or those claiming under them who have before then initiated legal proceedings or claimed under applicable national law. According to Mr Van Gerven, contracted-out and supplementary occupational pension schemes are characterised by their 'accruing' nature - an employee accrues pension entitlement on the basis of his or her periods of employment. There is a distinction, therefore, between the creation of pension rights on the basis of completed periods of service - at least for fixed-benefit schemes as in the Coloroll case - or completed payments of contributions, for fixed-contribution schemes, and the exercise of such accrued pension rights when the pension first falls due for payment. This interpretation largely coincides with that adopted in the 'Protocol on Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community' annexed to the Maastricht Treaty. Mr Van Gerven also answered a number of further questions: Which forms of occupational pension are subject to Barber? Barber applies not only to contracted-out occupational schemes but also to all other forms, including supplementary pensions. Are sex-based actuarial calculation factors compatible with equal treatment? Use of such factors constitutes, at least in so far as it results in different contributions and benefits for men and women, unequal treatment on the ground of sex prohibited by the Rome Treaty. Like Barber, the temporal effects must be limited to after the judgment date. Who may rely on equality principles applied to pensions? Employees and surviving spouses, including those entitled to certain kinds of widower's pension, may do so, subject to appropriate temporal limits. It is immaterial whether an occupational pension scheme is funded exclusively by employer's contributions or also by compulsory or voluntary employee contributions. However, where only employees of one sex are members of an occupational pension scheme, they will have no such right, provided the employees within the company or division concerned are all of that sex. May equality principles be relied upon against trustees? Employees or those entitled under them may do so. Trustees of occupational pension schemes are obliged by Community law to do everything within their powers, even if that involves overriding legislation, contracts or trust deeds, to ensure equal pension benefits. National courts responsible for supervising trusts must comply with Community law principles requiring effective and equivalent remedies. However, questions relating to the liability of a pension scheme and that of the employer in the context of equal treatment infringements, particularly where the funds of one party (such as in Coloroll) are insufficient, can be dealt with only at national level. National rules on liability must be no less favourable than those which would apply to similar national claims and be effective. May future pension schemes reduce available benefits in the interests of equality? For past infringements, the only remedy is to increase the benefits to the level of the advantaged sex. For future service, Community law allows employers to reduce pension benefits provided they are the same for men and women. Cases C-109, 110, 152 and 200/91, Ten Oever, Moroni, Neath, Coloroll Pension Trustees Ltd, Advocate General Van Gerven, Opinion, 28 April 1993. BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paul Stepak, M.D.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 51 FR 17556 (1986). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that all five factors were relevant in determining whether Respondent's registration should be revoked. As to the first factor, the administrative law judge found that Respondent has a current license to practice medicine and handle controlled substances. As to the second factor, Respondent failed to execute prescriptions to account for the disposition of Schedule II controlled substances, and attributed controlled substances to patients who had not received them. As to the third factor, Respondent was convicted of one felony count of falsifying records related to the dispensing of controlled substances. As to the fourth factor, Respondent violated New York State laws relating to controlled substances, and surrendered his previous DEA Certificate of Registration for cause. As to the fifth factor, the administrative law judge found that there was no indication that Respondent himself has abused drugs, but Respondent inferred that his wife took the amphetamines due to her own drug problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that Respondent's guilty plea to the felony was motivated by his desire to spare his wife from prosecution. The administrative law judge also found Respondent's testimony to be sincere, and gave substantial weight to the fact that the State of New York had exacted full and fair retribution for Respondent's conviction. Respondent was discharged from probation two and one-half years early, and has accepted responsibility for his conduct and failures regarding his wife's chemical dependency, which has now been successfully treated. Consequently, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's registration not be revoked. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Government filed exceptions to the recommendation of the administrative law judge contending that Respondent's testimony had failed to respond to the issue of diversion of the controlled substances and his subsequent cover-up activity; that Judge Tenney had applied undue weight to the character evidence presented by Respondent; and that, in any event, Respondent has not shown that he does not pose a continuing threat to diversion, especially with regard to Schedule II controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator concurs with the administrative law judge's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0636021, issued to Charles A. Buscema, M.D., be and it hereby is, continued, and that any pending applications, be, and they hereby are, granted. This order is effective on August 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

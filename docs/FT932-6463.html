			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Treasury mandarins await new orders THERE WERE no tears and even some jokes as Mr Norman Lamont bade farewell yesterday to his ministerial team and top aides at an impromptu party in his Treasury office. As mandarins sipped white wine and nibbled nuts and crisps, the Treasury geared up for its first meeting today with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the first chancellor since Lord Howe in 1979 to have had no experience as a Treasury minister. Treasury officials, accustomed to providing a barrage of briefing documents during a change of government, were yesterday waiting to see what their new chancellor would want before swinging into action. However, beyond the unlovely Linoleum Palace overlooking Whitehall, some commentators are already urging Mr Clarke to take a hard look at the Treasury's techniques for devising economic policy and its relationship with the outside world. Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, one of the 'seven wise men' appointed earlier this year to advise the Treasury, said Mr Clarke should 'turn the Treasury upside down' in a quest to learn from recent policy mistakes. These included the too-loose monetary policy that led to the late-1980s boom and the 'disastrous' period of membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Warwick Lightfoot, a former Treasury adviser to Mr Lamont and now a Royal Bank of Scotland economist, said the new chancellor should 'rebuild' economic policy by immediately pruning the budget deficit and reviewing the mechanisms for setting interest rates. A specific item some outsiders want Mr Clarke to examine is the relationship between the Treasury and the Bank of England in monetary policy. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel, said Mr Clarke should announce he will take more notice of the Bank in setting interest rates, a move he said would strengthen the government's credibility with financial markets. Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasts at London Business School, and another of the wise men advising the Treasury, warned that the new Chancellor would have to take 'decisive action' against the budget deficit, possibly by increasing taxes and cutting spending. Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, also a 'wise man', said he hoped Mr Clarke's would have better 'political skills' than the former chancellor. Mr Peter Fellner, UK economist at NatWest Capital Markets, was among those in the City unmoved by yesterday's events. He said: 'I can't see Kenneth Clarke being any different from Norman Lamont. The chancellor might have changed but the problems facing the country haven't'</p>

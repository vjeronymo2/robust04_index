			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Ukraine 'needs Dollars 1bn in aid to implement reforms' Ukraine will need nearly Dollars 1bn in foreign assistance this year to implement radical economic reforms, according to senior Ukrainian officials. A high-level Ukrainian delegation, including possibly President Leonid Kuchma, is expected to attend the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meeting in Madrid this week to plead Ukraine's case. On Friday, Ukrainian officials reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF on an economic reform programme which they say is the first step in a comprehensive package of reforms to be announced early next month. The agreement, the first since Ukraine announced its independence three years ago, and the economic programme being prepared by the government have helped convince western observers that Ukraine is on the verge of attempting its first serious leap into market reforms. But Mr Roman Shpek, minister for the economy and leader of the Ukrainian side in negotiations with the IMF, said at the weekend that Ukraine will require Dollars 960m aid before the end of the year if it is to meet the IMF target of a budget deficit no higher than 10 per cent of GDP. 'Of course, the Ukrainian side must take the first step in market reforms, but we are ready to do so, and we hope that the west will respond,' Mr Shpek said. 'Now that we are ready to launch our reform programme, we are looking for a non-inflationary way to cover our budget deficit and this is where we hope that the west will help us.' Mr Shpek said Ukrainian leaders would ask the US to convert Dollars 200m earmarked for technical assistance projects in Ukraine into direct financial aid. He said another source of immediate financial assistance could be the IMF, which, if the Ukrainian deal is signed as expected this week, could provide a first tranche of Dollars 365m to Kiev soon. Mr Shpek said Ukraine would turn to the Group of Seven industrial nations and Russia for an additional Dollars 400m. He said the reform programme included radical price liberalisation, although some controls would remain on bread prices. The state-controlled exchange rate was to be unified with the free market rate, trade policy would be liberalised, the confiscatory tax regime overhauled and privatisation accelerated. Mr Shpek predicted that the programme would cause inflation to jump to about 50 per cent a month, but it would then fall to 5 per cent a month.</p>

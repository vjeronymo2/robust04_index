			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA)-- China's timber resources  have been growing steadily while the resources in other part of  the world are on the decrease, Chinese Forestry Minister Xu  Youfang said here on the eve of the "World Environment Day".    The average annually-added timber resources had surpassed  the  annual consumption for the 10th year since 1984, while during  1977-1981, the country's timber resources shrank by an average  of 18.7 million cu m [cubic meters] annually, the minister said.    He said that China's timber resources grew by 400 million cu  m on average each year during 1989-1993, while 320 million cu m  of timber was cut down.    During 1984-1988, the figures were 366 million cu m and 344  million cu m, respectively.    The minister attributed the steady growth to the common  efforts of the Chinese people.    The Chinese Government made it one of its basic policies to  green the country and improve its ecological environment.    At the suggestion of Deng Xiaoping, the National People's  Congress passed a resolution in 1981 calling on Chinese people  to plant trees every year, so as to help green the country, the  minister recalled.    Ever since, Chinese leaders have been taking their lead in  early spring each year to plant trees.    Up to date, about 18 billion trees have been planted by  individuals all over the country.    Several large ecological projects initiated in the late  1980s  also contributed to the growth of forest resources, including  the shelterbelt network stretching from northeast to northwest  China, 13,000 km coastal shelterbelt network and a large program  to plant 6.6 million ha of trees, using 300 million U.S. dollars  of world bank loans.    Facing a serious ecological environment and insufficient  forest resources, China will continue its efforts to green the  country and increase its forest coverage rate to 15.3 percent by  the year 2000, the minister said.    By the year 2000, the gross forest output value will be  increased to 300 billion yuan (38.4 billion U.S. dollars) from  the present 140 billion yuan (17.9 billion U.S. dollars), Xu  said.</p>

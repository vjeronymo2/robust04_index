			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Poverty tests the democratic spirit in Bolivia: Economic stresses threatening a republic's constitutional procedures IF THE COUP last weekend in Peru and the abortive uprising in Venezuela in February are to have a domino effect in the Andean region of South America, Bolivia could well be next. President Jaime Paz Zamora set alarm bells ringing on Wednesday, when he warned that 'Congress should work properly for there to be no need to close it.' Officials immediately 'clarified' his statement, promising he had no intention to threaten Congress. Diplomats and independent analysts doubt Mr Paz Zamora will copy President Alberto Fujimori's military-backed takeover in Peru. They say he was voicing his frustration over the legislature's refusal to pass important government bills. Although Bolivia has suffered more coups d'etat in nearly two centuries of existence than its hard-pressed citizenry can count, it has managed to stagger from crisis to crisis and retain a democratic regime for the past 10 years. However, political stresses are growing more severe as Bolivians become weary of unrelenting orthodox economic policies, corruption, deepening poverty and intensifying concentration of wealth. Many are wondering how much longer the democratic regime can survive. Pessimists wonder whether the weak coalition government can survive until the presidential election due in May 1993. Optimists expect it will last, only to hand over power to a strongman with shaky democratic credentials and little interest in continuing laissez faire economic policies. Bolivia adopted market reforms in 1985, when hyper-inflation had reached 25,000 per cent a year. It cut the budget deficit, shrank the public sector, introduced trade liberalisation and virtually eliminated the debt to foreign commercial banks by buying IOUs on the secondary market. Despite the huge cost in jobs and income levels, the reforms were popular. Inflation fell to 15 per cent during each of the past three years and modest economic growth got under way. The free market consensus became a national policy embraced by all main parties. The problem now is that reform has not stimulated enough growth to dent Bolivia's profound poverty. There is a widespread conviction that the sacrifices of reform have not been worthwhile. Yet, Bolivians vividly recall the military coups of the 1970s and the chaos of hyper-inflation, and do not want a return to instability. Real incomes are lower than in 1985, unemployment and underemployment are widespread, urban poverty is growing - as any visitor to the capital La Paz can see by visiting El Alto, the world's highest urban slum at nearly 4,000 metres. Last year, government spending on education, health and housing fell to just Dollars 28m (Pounds 16.2m) - the lowest figure since 1985. The government has promised to raise the level to Dollars 99m this year. However, it is trying to hold public sector wage increases below inflation. The government is paralysed by indecision. It is pulled in opposite directions by the contradictory demands of special interest groups, the US government and the local armed forces. Several groups are watching from the wings. One is led by General Hugo Banzer, who was a long-serving military president in the 1970s. His ADN party backs Mr Paz on condition that he help Mr Banzer become president next year. Mr Banzer's strongman image is one of his chief attractions. A group of populist parties is capitalising on both worsening poverty and a resurgent 'endogenous' movement. They would cast aside orthodoxy in favour of a blend of left-wing economics and traditional tribal organisation. Then there is the military. The generals appear to back Mr Paz and the democratic system. But a vocal group of junior officers, with links to the trade unions, openly identifies with the Venezuelan rebels. They accuse commanders of corruption, and condemn the conservative consensus, US influence, and falling military budgets. Businessmen claim Bolivia's economic problems have dramatically narrowed the scope for change. Mr Alvaro Ugalde Canedo, general manager of Inti Raymi, a big US-owned mining company, said: 'The economy is not growing at the same rate as the expectations of the people. It does not matter which government comes in - it will have the same economic restrictions as the previous ones. (Policy) changes will only be nuances.' For all that, the explosive themes of corruption and poverty are beginning to combine. A top government official said: 'All we need is a big corruption scandal or for government people - particularly generals - to be threatened with exposure, and the whole house of cards will fall.'</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Bitter-sweet outlook for UK beet growers - The early arrival of freezing weather is threatening to take the icing off sugar profits Unlikely as it may seem to those not involved in its production and processing, the apparently cold and boring sugar beet crop generates a great deal of heat and emotion. Paradoxically, that is especially true when, as last weekend, growers wake up on a November morning to find their roots covered with snow and the weather forecasters speaking of severe frosts for the next few days. About 40 per cent of the national crop is still in the ground and a further 20 per cent has been lifted and is stored in clamps on farms. If the weather stays below freezing for long those roots so far undelivered to processing factories will be vulnerable to frost and subsequent rotting. Should that happen the beets will become unsuitable for processing and even if they are lifted and delivered to one of British Sugars' nine factories they will be returned to the grower at his expense. All he can do with them then is feed them to livestock or spread them back on the land and plough them in. As a sugar beet grower myself, I hope very much that the cold snap will be short-lived. Naturally enough, we growers want to deliver our roots to factories as quickly as possible. But British Sugar, the monopoly processor, now part of Associated British Foods, operates a system of permits to control deliveries and match its processing capacity. On present calculations this measured approach to what is admittedly a big crop will mean some roots are still sitting in clamps until the end of next February or beyond. British Sugar says growers should protect their clamps from frost and ventilate them to stop the rotting of roots lifted after they have been frozen in the soil. Growers say effective protection is almost impossible to achieve and in the face of having to purchase costly covers and the probable need, after Christmas, to hand sort every root to avoid rejection at the factory, that British Sugar should increase its processing capacity. The crop, say growers, should be delivered over a much shorter period, as happens in most other continental countries. British Sugar replies that one of the main reasons it is the most efficient processor of sugar beet in Europe is that it runs its factories for longer - more than five months a year, compared with only three months by many continental processors. Growers retort that British Sugar is profiting at their expense and that the company should not ever have closed nine factories during the last 20 years. British Sugar counter-claims that the nine that remain have been uprated to such an extent that they are capable of processing far more than the previous 18. And so the arguments continue. Strength of feeling is intensified by the fact that both sides know that the other is making good profits out of the crop. According to a recent Midland Bank farm planning booklet the growth margins that an average sugar beet grower can expect to make in 1994 varies between Pounds 438 and Pounds 575 an acre. That compares with a winter wheat growth margin from Pounds 245 to Pounds 282 an acre and for potatoes, which are much more risky, of Pounds 566 an acre. Meanwhile sugar beet growers are well aware that British Sugar raised its profit level from Pounds 139m in 1992 to Pounds 162m in 1993 and that the latter figure represented two-thirds of total ABF profits. It does not improve relationships between growers and the processor of their beets when financial journalists describe British Sugar as 'ABF's cash cow'. But the current prosperity of sugar beet is unlikely to last. It was one of the few crops to escape the axe during the reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy. EC guaranteed prices continue at a refined sugar equivalent of some Pounds 550 a tonne. The world price is nearer Pounds 170 per tonne and most sugar producing nations in the EC are producing large surpluses (with the notable exception of the UK, which is allowed to produce only half its domestic consumption). It was intended that the sugar beet guaranteed price system should be reformed and lower production quotas imposed by July 1 next year. Because of complications and pre-occupations with a Gatt agreement it has subsequently been decided to delay tackling the matter for a further year, until July 1 1995. But if the Blair House accord were to become the basis for a Gatt deal the price of sugar beet would be cut by 16 per cent over six years and overall EC quota entitlement reduced by 2.5 per cent per year. Needless to say the UK industry, as a deficit producer, would fight to avoid such a quota cut being applied across the board. Indeed there is every justification for the UK entitlement being increased. Whether the fight would be successful is open to speculation, the sugar quota may well be bargained away in return for concessions perceived more necessary for other sectors. Meanwhile I am bound to concede that British Sugar must be right to stay as efficient as possible. So long as it does not expect me and other growers of sugar beet with snow-covered clamps to bear all the risks.</p>

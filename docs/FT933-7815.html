			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Mobiles break into the big time: Can cellular communications replace traditional networks American Telephone and Telegraph's Dollars 12bn-plus merger with McCaw Cellular Communications is the biggest takeover in telecommunications history. It is also likely to be the biggest challenge in AT&amp;T's history. Nobody doubts that Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T's naturally cautious chairman, is right to see mobile communications as 'absolutely central' to his industry's future. The question is: how central and how soon? It is tempting to look back for inspiration. Early railways provided local connections to canals; the first car buyers in the US were farmers shifting their produce to rail. As for the telephone, it was seen originally as an access system for the telegraph. Western Union, the world's largest telegraph service, spurned the offer to buy Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patents for Dollars 100,000, and rued the day ever after. As Mr Robin Meakin, mobile communications analyst at CIT Research, the London-based consultancy, puts it: 'In cellular communications, we have seen many of the same arguments about technological redundancy rehearsed, and many of the same business plans discussed.' The analogies apply up to a point. It is no coincidence that few of the more imaginative and aggressive marketers of mobile communications have been the traditional fixed-wire operators. McCaw, for all its financial vicissitudes, was a trailblazer in the US; companies such as Vodafone, Mannesmann and Hutchison were prime movers in Europe. It is also true that the technology is now at hand for cellular communications to compete head-to-head with fixed-wire companies for the first time. New digital cellular networks currently coming on stream in the US and Europe are enhancing capacity and quality. The regulatory and competitive structure is in place too: rival companies are licensed across the US, and most European governments have licensed - or soon will - competing operators to provide a digital service to the pan-European GSM standard. Even where telecommunications operators still have a legal monopoly, efforts are being made to give mobile services a separate, competing identity. Belgacom, the Belgium monopoly, last month hived off its unit to build a digital GSM network into a separate division, and invited Pacific Telesis (Pactel), the US operator, to join as a 25 per cent strategic partner. By the same token, in the US the 'Baby Bell' regional companies believe the McCaw takeover is a regressive step. They have responded angrily, arguing that the move will allow AT&amp;T to re-enter the local market from which it was evicted at the break-up of the old Bell company in 1984. Pactel, a Baby Bell which is also one of the top five US cellular operators, yesterday reportedly claimed: 'AT&amp;T is going to roll over everybody on the highway; it is on an orgy of reintegration.' The reality is unlikely to be as simple as that. For the foreseeable future, cellular and other wire-less technology will complement, not replace, the fixed wire. It is not another railway displacing the canal - a mode of transport which had virtually no advantage, or potential for development, over the steam engine on tracks. It is more like the car, the train and the aeroplane coexisting in tension - the three appealing to distinct, but related and overlapping markets, each developing new strengths. The fixed-wire has two key, continuing strengths. It is far cheaper than wire-less technologies yet developed. And what it loses in mobility it gains in capacity. Prices are still going up in parts of the cellular industry. Handsets for digital cellular services are at least double the price of their analogue counterparts - and 10 or more times the cost of fixed-wire handsets. As for call tariffs, serious competition has only recently begun to bring down cellular prices significantly. As it does so, fixed-wire tariffs are falling sharply. In the UK, the imminent launch of Mercury's PCN 'One-2-One' network is pushing Vodafone and Cellnet to cut tariffs. But standard business tariffs for the London area are still double or more BT's peak rate tariff; and for most calls made in the afternoon the premium is far higher. In the US, charges are generally lower, although they vary greatly between the 700-plus cellular operating regions. To take Southwestern Bell in Dallas, the basic package comes at 38 cents a minute for the first 200 minutes after a Dollars 49.95 access charge. The local peak call rate on the fixed network is 24 cents a minute, which Southwestern cannot beat even for its heaviest users. While price competitive wire-less local networks are some way off, the introduction of fibre into the 'fixed' local network is set to bring a wide range of broadband, multimedia services to businesses and households that mobile systems will be unable to match. Vice-President Al Gore's 'super highway' is already under construction: in the US and much of Europe, even many medium-sized businesses now have their own fibre connections, and the laying of fibre across local exchanges is not far off. Discarding simplistic notions of wireless networks 'replacing' the fixed wire does not, however, dampen mobile's prospects. Rather, it highlights the importance of the industry developing new markets and innovative relationships between different, complementary technologies. The room for complementary growth remains vast. Since 1984 the US market has grown from about 1m to 12m subscribers. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association estimates that the top 11 US cellular providers added 627,580 subscribers in the first quarter of 1993, compared with 481,670 in the same period of 1992, and there is no sign of growth tailing off. Europe now has more than 6m subscribers - double the tally three years ago. In the UK alone, Vodafone and Cellnet have added more than 250,000 customers so far this year. All the signs are that the industry is starting to penetrate the mass consumer market. A detailed analysis of the US subscriber base by Economic and Management Consultants International, a Washington-based group, suggests that personal use of cellular phones rivalled business use by the end of 1992, and is now growing far more quickly. EMCI's five-year projections for the US cellular subscriber market give 14.4m subscribers by the end of this year, 17.7m by the end of 1995 and 25m by the end of 1996. Such projections are necessarily little more than 'guesstimates', given the data from which they project. And the scare about possible brain cancer links to mobile phone use which swept the US earlier this year underlines the youth of the industry and its susceptibility to swipes from unexpected directions. But the trend is unmistakable. What does this mean for AT&amp;T's Dollars 12bn gamble? First, upward curves are not enough. The trends, and McCaw's existing capacity to exploit them, are more than reflected in the purchase price, so sitting on the wave will not yield much of a real return. AT&amp;T may fashion a new key to unlock the market faster. For instance, a report last year by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded that the current duopoly arrangement in place in most areas was 'unlikely to provide a product at a competitively set price'. The field is open for someone to prove it wrong. However, the greatest challenge and opportunity for AT&amp;T is to exploit wire-less services as an extension of its existing portfolio. As Mr Meakin of CIT puts it: 'In future, real commercial success will lie in providing as many types of local access technologies as possible - in being a truly technology-independent local access provider.' AT&amp;T has two clear qualifications for achieving that goal. Its existing marketing and research strength - the Bell laboratories invented cellular in the first place - make it well-placed to integrate wire-less with its other services, offering businesses and consumers single billing arrangements, personal numbering, attractive 'one-stop' packages including mobile and fixed-link long-distance facilities, and so on. Second, lacking a local network, AT&amp;T will be largely unconstrained by the fear of competing against itself in developing the local market. Whatever the reality, that fear has proved a notable constraint for many operators. There is, however, a critical assumption behind the latter point: that the existing regulatory structure which bans the Baby Bells from fixed-link long-distance operations and AT&amp;T from local networks stays intact. The structure, established in 1984, is under fierce assault, and AT&amp;T's McCaw deal is another hammer blow. If the edifice crumbles and a free-for-all is the result, today's map will be no guide to the future.</p>

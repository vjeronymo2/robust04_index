Airline tickets already may be  adjusted using URV's. Afterward, it will be fuel, electricity,  and postal rates' turn.    Resolution No. 134, signed on 18 March in Brasilia,  authorizes the adjustments of airline tickets, using the  previous period, that is, on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of every  month. The 11 March increase had been postponed waiting for  this guideline. Airline companies still are negotiating the  conversion of airline tickets into URV's. Two weeks ago,  airline companies increased tickets 26.33 percent.    The other rates also will be indexed using URV's, but they  will still be expressed in real cruzeiros to avoid losses in the  collections by state-run companies over the conversion [into  URV's] by using the average prices of the last four months of  1993, as determined by Provisional Measure No. 434. Finance  Ministry experts reported that the next increase will be  implemented in April, already using the URV's variation.    This regulation is not compulsory for the rates of state-run  companies. The federal government will monitor the variation in  these state rates to prevent abusive adjustments.    In Sao Paulo, Finance Ministry special adviser Jose Milton  Dallari on 21 March asked the manufacturers of car paints --  Basf, Renner, and Akzo -- for an explanation of prices in URV's  between 15- and 20-percent higher than the average prices of the  last four months of 1993. The entrepreneurs told him the  increase was caused by a price increase in vinyl acetate, a raw  material manufactured only by Rhodia. Dallari asked them to  send him a cost sheet by 25 March. If the explanations are  unconvincing, he said, this case may be submitted to the free  competition defense organizations for consideration under the  law on oligopolies control.    The Finance Ministry adviser also met meat-packing plant  owners and transportation company executives. The National  Association of Overland Transportation Companies reported that  it already has been implementing the adjustments using the URV's  for one week with an 11- to 20-percent reduction in freight  charges, depending on the cargo, and the removal of financial  costs and inflation adjustments. A National Association of  Overland Transportation Companies director said the reduction  will be maintained if the manufacturing companies do the same.    In Dallari's opinion, most entrepreneurial circles "still  are  negotiating and seeking an agreement." He said it is quite  likely that by late March most prices will still be adjusted by  using real cruzeiros.    In Rio de Janeiro, pharmaceutical representatives on 21  March  delivered to Finance Ministry experts in Rio de Janeiro  documents with information on the variation of their prices  since the URV's implementation. The data will be reviewed by  Jose Milton Dallari, who already has declared that he believes  the price adjustments of medicines are high and that he will ask  for a revision. The meeting had been scheduled to begin at 1400  with the presence of Dallari, who was delayed in Sao Paulo.    At Dallari's request, the meeting was not canceled, but his  absence somewhat minimized the meeting's importance. Some  important pharmaceutical entrepreneurs preferred not to attend  the meeting.</p>

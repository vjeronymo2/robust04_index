			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Eskom in R470m power deals ESKOM, the South African power utility, has said it will be participating in three projects costing about R470m (Pounds 86m) to help ease an energy crisis in neighbouring states, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. Mr Ian McRae, Eskom's chief executive, told a news conference yesterday that countries such as Zimbabwe and Zambia, which rely heavily on hydro-power, had been badly affected by the very severe drought in the region. Mr McRae gave details of three projects which could realise a vision he has long had of creating an interlocking regional power grid hitherto impeded by South Africa's pariah political status: Linking the South African grid at Messina in Northern Transvaal with the southern Zimbabwean grid at Beit Bridge. This will cost about R7m and should allow 40MW of power to flow into Zimbabwe by November. The second, costing about R145m, involves strengthening links between the Spitskop power station in the north-western Transvaal and Gaborone, the Botswana capital. From here the power will be transmitted northwards via existing lines to Francistown, and from there to Bulawayo, a key link in the Zimbabwean grid. This will allow 100MW to flow from Eskom into the Botswana system from May next year and, if necessary, from there to Zimbabwe and Zambia. The most amibitious scheme, still not finalised, involves spending R315m developing a line which runs from the Matimba station in Northern Transvaal, across south-eastern Botswana, to Bulawayo. This would take 500MW of power into the systems of these countries.</p>

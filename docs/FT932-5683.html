			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious debut for Zeneca THE FIRST day of official trading in the newly demerged ICI and Zeneca shares proved mildly disappointing, according to dealers, in terms both of actual volume of business and performances of the shares. But traders also pointed out that activity in Zeneca, newly introduced to the FT-SE 100 Index, accounted for 5.8 per cent of turnover in the Footsie stocks and 2.5 per cent of the market's volume yesterday. US investors were aggressive supporters of both stocks post the demerger and helped to drive ICI shares up from an opening of around 608p to 636p, compared with 608p for the 'old' shares last week. 'ICI is seen as a prime recovery stock,' said one specialist. Turnover in ICI totalled 6m shares, with much of the activity in the stock generated very late in the session when the big US funds were said to have moved in as strong buyers. The two classes of Zeneca stock were also boosted by late buying from the US. The 'old' settled at 630p ex-rights, compared with last Friday's 'grey market' closing level of 632p, while the 'new' ended at 334p, compared with Friday's 'grey market' level of 37p. Turnover in Zeneca 'old' reached 10m shares and the nil-paid saw volume of 2.6m.</p>

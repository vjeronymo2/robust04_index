			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> BOARD ORDERS STUDY ON FUTURE SERVICES  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors Tuesday ordered the preparation of a long-range  plan on how county government will provide services in the future to South  County residents.  </P> <P> In light of the rapid growth in the South County, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez  said Tuesday, there is a need to begin deciding immediately how government will  deliver critical services there.  </P> <P> Plans for various facilities are being discussed, including a new, expanded  south court and sheriff's substation and a larger social services office in  Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and Vasquez, whose districts cover the South County,  said in a letter to the board that the county in the last two years has tried  unsuccessfully to find space for the Public Defender and Probation Department.  </P> <P> The county administrative office, General Services and the Environmental  Management Agency were told to prepare the plan and return it to the board in  120 days.  </P> <P> The board said it should include:  </P> <P> * An assessment of future needs for services based on population projections  and demographics for the South County.  </P> <P> * An assessment of the type, size and location of government facilities needed  in South County.  </P> <P> * A study of available resources and funding methods, including land swaps,  lease-back arrangements and development agreements with builders.

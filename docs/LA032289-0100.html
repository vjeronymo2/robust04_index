			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Centel Sees $1.4-Billion Deal: Centel Corp. said it expects to sell its cable  television division this month for more than $1.4 billion and use the proceeds  to pay a special dividend to stockholders. Pressured by a takeover effort  headed by investor Asher B. Edelman, the company said last year that it was  planning to sell the cable unit and expand its telephone and cellular  communications operations. Centel said it signed non-disclosure agreements with  the bidders for its Centel Cable Television Co., of which it is the 82.4%  owner, and declined to identify the parties. The company said it would pay its  Class A shareholders a special cash dividend of $45.625 a share from the  proceeds of the transaction, for which it expects to realize a $525-million net  gain.  </P></p>

(CSBC) announced Wednesday.    Construction of the frigate, named "Cheng Ho" after a noted  Ching Dynasty admiral, began on Dec. 21, 1990, and the vessel  was launched in September 1992. "The ship will be delivered to  the Navy about five weeks ahead of schedule," a CSBC official  said.    Construction of three other such warships are under way at  the CSBC's Kaohsiung shipyard, and the last one is scheduled to  be delivered to the Navy in 1999.    The first of the frigates, which are modeled on the US  Perry-  class frigates, went into service last May. The 4,200-ton  frigates have a cruising speed of 27.5 nautical miles per hour,  according to the CSBC.    The ships will be armed with locally-manufactured  Hsiung-Feng  ship-to-ship missiles, US standard ship-to-air missiles, [word  indistinct] submarine torpedoes, and phalanx weapons systems  built by the General Dynamics Corp. of the United States. The  weapons system uses a closed-loop radar to spot and track enemy  missiles and to direct fire from an M-61A1 Gatling gun capable  of firing 3,000 rounds per minute. In addition, the vessels  will carry anti- submarine helicopters.    The eight vessels, which will eventually cost the Navy more  than NT$40 billion (US$1.5 billion), are to replace part of the  Navy's aging fleet. The Navy had 24 destroyers and nine  frigates as of [word indistinct], according to the International  Institute for Strategic Studies.    The ROC also agreed on a US$4.8 billion deal in 1991 to buy  16 Lafayette-class frigates from France.</p>

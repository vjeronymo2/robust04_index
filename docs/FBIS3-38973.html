Speaking after a meeting with Bosnian Premier Haris  Silajdzic, where Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin was also present, Andreatta said "my impression was that  the tension which has risen over the past few days has now  subsided a lot, and that the Russians realise that NATO action  (in Bosnia) would be aimed at getting positive results."    "It is not our job to use weapons simply for the sake of  using weapons," Andreatta told the press. "They must be used as  a political tool for achieving a certain solution. If, as it  seems, heavy weapons are to be withdrawn, this has already been  achieved and in this case arms will not be used or will be used  only where heavy weapons remain in place."    The Italian diplomatic chief was referring to a UN-brokered  ceasefire agreement reached Wednesday afternoon between Bosnian  Serb and Moslem forces.    Andreatta described his talks with Siladjzic as "long and  complex", with the Bosnian premier offering a view of peaceful  co-existence between Moslems and Croats "which differed from  that of peace negotiators and which had both interesting and  problematic aspects which will have to be studied further."</p>

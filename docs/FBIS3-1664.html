Today's China is a country with a prosperous economy and a  stable society. A bright future lies ahead of us. The wheel of  history is rolling forward, and nobody can resist it. [Li  smiles after finishing this remark; video shows attendees  applauding him]    Li Peng also noted: Under the current situation, the burden  is heavier and the responsibility is greater for the PWC. He  encouraged everybody to work harder and make greater  contributions to the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong  Kong and the prosperity of the motherland. This has been a  report by Beijing Central Television. [video shows shots of Lu  Ping and attendees at different tables]</p>

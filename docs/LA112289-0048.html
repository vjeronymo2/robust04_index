			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN POSTPONES CAMPUS VISIT TO AVOID PROTESTERS  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan postponed a visit Tuesday to Loyola Marymount  University, where students and others indicated they would protest his  appearance.  </P> <P> Reagan gave as an official reason his sympathy with the Jesuit community, which  is mourning the killing of six priests in El Salvador last week.  </P> <P> Several people called the Jesuit-operated university to protest Reagan's visit,  according to David Herbst, a student and chairman of the speakers program. Some  blamed Reagan's policies in El Salvador for contributing to the slayings last  Thursday, he said.  </P></p>

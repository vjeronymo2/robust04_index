			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 2 Jan (EFE) -- Members of  the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) today freed some 120  inmates from the prison of San Cristobal de las Casas in  Chiberos, where the rebels have clashed with military forces.    The San Cristobal prison has practically become the line of  combat between an as of yet undetermined number of EZLN members  and the forces of the Mexican Army, anonymous sources told EFE.    Most of the freed inmates are reportedly Indians, according  to the sources. The EZLN is made up primarily of Indians of the  Tzeltales, Tzotziles, and Tojolabales tribes.    The sources also reported that the town of Ocosingo  northwest  of San Cristobal has been virtually cut off after EZLN members  blew up the bridges of La Florida and La Virgen at the entrance  and exit of Ocosingo.    It was also reported that the San Cristobal de las Casas Red  Cross ordered the suspension of its services given the lack of  guarantees for its workers.    At least 14 guerrillas have died and some six soldiers and  three civilians were injured, two of whom are Red Cross members  who were injured when the ambulance in which they were traveling  was fired upon.</p>

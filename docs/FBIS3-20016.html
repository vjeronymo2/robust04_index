In a statement after the  meeting, Denktas reported that the chamber officials briefed him  on their contacts with the Greek Cypriot Chamber of Commerce and  he, in turn, spoke to them on recent developments concerning the  confidence-building measures package.    Denktas explained that the package was changed extensively  in  favor of the Greek Cypriots, adding that equality and balance  must be secured. Denktas declared that he concurs with the  chamber of commerce view to the effect that if the package is  accepted in its present form, the benefit to the Turkish Cypriot  side is practically zero.    Asked to comment on the Greek Cypriot administration  spokesman's statement that the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International  Airport matter is a minor issue, Denktas said that the  disagreement or the difficulty is over basic issues and these  cannot be termed as minor matters. Every issue and every  article is serious and vital, Denktas went on, because if there  is to be an agreement, it must be one that envisages  well-intentioned cooperation and protects the rights of the two  sides in a balanced way. He stated: Once the balance is upset  and the door is opened to the advantage of one side against the  other, we cannot achieve anything. Therefore, it is wrong to  advocate that only minor issues are outstanding and that  everything will be all right once these are resolved.</p>

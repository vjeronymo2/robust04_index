			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: French-Italian textiles group formed A NEW grouping in the speciality textiles business is being formed through a deal between Chargeurs Textiles, a subsidiary of the Chargeurs group of France, and Fincori, a privately-owned Italian textiles group, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Under the transaction, Chargeurs is selling Delcer, a leading French producer of knitted textiles for sports and leisure use, to Sgat Italia, a specialist maker of outer wear owned by Fincori. In return, Chargeurs Textiles will take a 35 per cent stake in Sgat Italia. The acquisition follows Fincori's purchase last December of Sitel, a French company which is the leading manufacturer of textiles for winter sports wear. Adding Delcer to the grouping will create Europe's leading producer of speciality textiles for sports and leisure wear. The group is expected to have annual sales of around L175bn (Dollars 145m) and almost 700 employees. Terms of the deal, which is being conducted via a rights issue by Sgat Italia, have not been revealed.</p>

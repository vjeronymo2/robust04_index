			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas The recent surge in British Gas's shares looks a little odd since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's verdict on the company's fate is due to be unveiled tomorrow. Admittedly, that doom is not binding - the Department of Trade and Industry has yet to pronounce. In a market powered by hopes of lower interest rates and the search for yield Gas's dividend looks attractive. Still, the risks will not be clear until the report is published, and the MMC has a reputation for surprises. The main areas of concern are the structure of the industry, the rate of return British Gas is allowed to earn on its pipeline, and the abolition of the company's monopoly of the domestic market. A full break-up of the company looks improbable, but the MMC may insist that its operations are split into separate subsidiary companies, increasing overhead costs. Gas's pipeline returns seem unlikely to be increased substantially, but a higher rate may be allowed on new investment. Abolition of the domestic monopoly is definitely on the cards, though that may be phased over a period of years. None of which will do much to improve the company's financial prospects. Non-regulated exploration and production activities will start to generate substantial cash by the mid-1990s, yet much of that will be needed to replace and expand reserves. Since British Gas wants its dividend to be covered twice, the attractive yield is unlikely to be fattened by hefty dividend rises. Those who have bought ahead of the news will have to hope they have read the MMC correctly.</p>

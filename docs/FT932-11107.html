			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / US calls for Asian Bank loan review THE US yesterday called for an independent review of the Asian Development Bank's loan portfolio in a policy statement which underlined US reservations about a proposed doubling of the ADB's capital and reaffirmed sharp differences between Washington and Tokyo over the bank's future. Mr Jeffrey Shafer, designated by President Bill Clinton as US assistant treasury-secretary for international affairs, argued at the ADB's annual meeting in Manila that Asian countries owed their economic success more to the investments arising from their own thriftiness than to money from abroad. The ADB, he said, should be thrifty too. 'It need not - and it cannot - go on rapidly increasing its lending year by year,' he said. 'More consideration of the scale of lending and the adequacy of current resources is needed before a decision on a capital increase can be taken. There is time for this.' Mr Shafer said the bank should put more stress on reversing the declining quality of its projects than on expanding its portfolio. Although the Clinton administration's policy and staff dealing with multilateral financial institutions have yet to be finalised - Mr Shafer left soon after his speech to attend his Senate confirmation hearing in Washington - the US delegation in Manila did emphasise the Clinton themes of helping the poor and protecting the environment. 'Growth as measured by the GDP accounts can become an obsession, the environment can become degraded in its pursuit, leaving future generations worse off, not better off,' Mr Shafer said. 'This is unsustainable development.' Other western shareholders in the ADB - with their own national budget problems - - gave qualified support to the US call for thrift. Germany, for example, backed the idea of an independent examination of the ADB's performance but said the bank needed more capital to expand its activities in poorer countries. Mr Kimimasa Tarumizu, the Japanese ADB president, has called for a doubling of the bank's present capital of Dollars 23bn. He has been strongly supported by the Japanese government and developing Asian countries such as Indonesia which receive ADB loans. Yesterday Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, gave unequivocal support to the proposed capital increase in his speech to the ADB governors. 'The bank's . . . own calculations indicate that its ordinary capital operation may reach the lending limit some time in the second half of the next year at the latest,' he said. Asked what he thought of the US proposal for an outside inquiry into ADB loans, Mr Hayashi said an internal task force, as proposed by Mr Tarumizu, was the 'sound and orthodox way'. China and India, which each borrow about Dollars 1bn a year from the ADB in ordinary loans, yesterday reiterated their appeals for credit from the ADB's soft-loan window, the Asian Development Fund. Although China and India are poor enough to qualify for ADF assistance, donors have so far refused to allow them access to funds because they fear the demands from the two largest populations in the world would be too heavy.</p>

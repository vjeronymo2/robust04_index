			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Nippon Steel Corp. expressed  regret Thursday [19 May] at a U.S. International Trade  Commission ruling that Japanese steelmakers are selling certain  steel products in the U.S. market at unfairly low prices.    "It's regrettable that our argument was not understood, but  this is the ITC's final ruling, so we'll consider what to do in  the future by considering the implications of it," a Nippon  Steel official said.    At stake in the ruling are two types of special steel --  grain- oriented steel and stainless angle used in heavy  electrical machinery and the construction industry.</p>

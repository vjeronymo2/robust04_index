			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Rugby's shares rise as payout is held THE share price of Rugby, Britain's third largest cement manufacturer, rebounded by 5 per cent from 160p to 169p yesterday after the group announced a rise in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 30.2m and held its dividend. The figures made a welcome start to a week in which several large UK construction group are expected to announce interim dividend cuts. Half-year results include figures from Wimpey today, Taylor Woodrow tomorrow and Amec, John Laing and Blue Circle on Thursday. Few British construction or building material companies will be able to announce any rise in pre-tax profits for the first six months of this year. Rugby, which is maintaining its interim dividend at 2.85p, offset an 8 per cent fall in UK profits from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 17.3m with higher earnings from Australia and the US - aided by a fragile recovery in construction output in both countries. Profits were further boosted by Pounds 3.1m of interest received compared with Pounds 1.8m at the corresponding stage last year. The group had cash in hand of Pounds 23m at the end of June. Prospects for UK construction, however, look bleak with no recovery in sight for housebuilding and commercial property investment. Public spending on construction remains under pressure in the government's autumn spending round. Manufacturers expect UK cement sales to fall about 8 per cent this year following last year's 16 per cent decline. However, Rugby reported cement profits only 0.1 per cent lower at Pounds 10.3m. It was helped by good winter weather for construction in south-east England, where most of its cement plants are. UK structural steel profits by comparison slumped 98 per cent to just Pounds 16,000 while UK joinery profits fell 6.8 per cent to Pounds 7m. Overseas profits rose 47 per cent to Pounds 9.8m in spite of adverse currency translations from US and Australian dollars. Profits from Australian cement and lime, sold to the construction and aluminium industries, rose 8 per cent to Pounds 5.1m. Group earnings per share rose from 6.31p to 6.86p. Turnover fell marginally to Pounds 283.7m from Pounds 270.9m. Lex, Page 24</p>

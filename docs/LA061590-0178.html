			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEFICIT SHRINKS 17% TO $6.94 BILLION  </P> <P> The U.S. trade deficit shrank dramatically to $6.94 billion in April, the  second lowest level in the last six years, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the 17% improvement from a March deficit of $8.36  billion came entirely from a big drop in imports, which offset a smaller  decline in U.S. export sales.  </P> <P> Imports totaled $39.25 billion in April, 6.2% lower than March, with the  decline attributed primarily to lower demand for foreign oil and a big drop in  auto imports.  </P> <P> Exports fell by 3.5% to $32.3 billion. But this was considered only a small  drop off an all-time high of $33.5 billion set in March.  </P> <P> America's trade performance has been a pleasant surprise so far this year, with  the deficit showing a much larger improvement than many analysts thought  possible.  </P> <P> Through the first four months, the deficit has been running at an annual rate  of $92.16 billion, compared to a deficit for all of 1989 of $108.99 billion.  </P> <P> Many analysts are now forecasting that the 1990 deficit will drop below $100  billion for the first time since 1983 as export growth remains strong enough to  offset a growing dependence on foreign oil.  </P> <P> That would spell good news for the Bush Administration, which is counting on a  strong trade performance to keep the economy out of a recession. Over the last  three years, fully one-third of overall U.S. economic growth has been supplied  by surging export sales.  </P> <P> The April deficit of $6.94 billion was the smallest since a February imbalance  of $6.10 billion with both months turning in the best trade performance since a  $5.7-billion imbalance in December, 1983.  </P> <P> For April, both oil imports and auto imports were down by about $1 billion  each.  </P> <P> The 20% drop in oil imports to a total of $3.75 billion reflected a drop in the  volume of shipments and price.  </P></p>

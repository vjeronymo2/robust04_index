			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The staggered transportation strikes were suspended  once the government appointed a commission to mediate the  conflict. This was reported by Simon Ladera, president of the  Union of Independent Vehicles, who added that the union's  intention is not to exert any type of pressure on the  commission. Thus, there is a 10-day truce in the strike.  Ladera asserted that the suspension of the strike is not a  reaction to the Transportation and Communication Ministry's  alleged threats to revoke independent vehicle licenses. The  union leader also recommended that Interior Minister Ramon  Escovar Salom take charge of security or, better yet, that he  should take charge of the insecurity in the country because more  drivers are being killed by criminals every day and the  government is taking no steps to end the situation.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Increased research leaves Celltech losses higher at Pounds 7.46m PRE-TAX losses at Celltech, the biotechnology group which plans to float in the 1993-94 year, grew from Pounds 6.58m to Pounds 7.46m in the 12 months to September 30, as investment in research and development rose 13 per cent from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 12m. Operating losses declined to Pounds 9.32m (Pounds 9.45m) but interest receivable fell to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 2.87m), as cash reserves shrank to Pounds 16m (Pounds 23.8m). In the current year net cash outflow is expected to amount to about Pounds 7.8m. Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive, said Celltech had had 'a successful year'. He added that it had achieved important advances in the R&amp;D programmes and in the alliances with pharmaceutical partners. The company received milestone payments of Pounds 2m as the first tranches in the Pounds 26m agreement with Bayer, the German pharmaceutical group. Celltech's collaboration with American Cyanamid for the development of antibodies to treat cancer was extended, and an agreement was recently announced with Schering-Plough to develop and commercialise recombinant antibodies to cytokines. Turnover declined to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 17m) and the operating profits from Celltech Biologics rose to Pounds 518,000 (Pounds 468,000). CB's manufacturing capability is to be expanded with a new facility in New Hampshire, which will finance the construction through the issue of Pounds 16.2m of state guaranteed bonds.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / British Gas may lose monopoly on household supply: MMC recommends sale of trading arm; Higher prices threatened BRITISH GAS could eventually lose its monopoly to supply gas to 18m households and be forced to sell its trading activities if the government adopts recommendations made yesterday by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The commission proposed a nine-year timetable for the introduction of competition to the gas market. Its recommendations were more far-reaching than had been expected. If accepted by the government, they would lead to the largest corporate break-up ever seen in the UK, and bring about a transformation of gas transport and supply. The introduction of full competition in household gas supply would mean Britain going further than any other country, including the US, in freeing up the market for domestic users. Consumer groups warned the changes could lead to higher prices. The commission's main proposals were: Divestment of British Gas's trading arm by the end of March 1997. That would leave the company to concentrate on gas transport and storage. Reducing its monopoly to include only customers using less than 1,500 therms of gas a year - most domestic customers - on March 31 1997, with removal of the entire monopoly three to five years later. Setting a rate of return for its pipelines operations of 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent on assets. Reducing its pricing formula for household customers to 4 percentage points below the rate of inflation, from the present 5 points. British Gas, which was privatised in 1986, said the proposals would result in the loss of at least 20,000 jobs at the company and keep its profits below levels achieved in recent years. But the City pushed the company's share price up 4p to 328p as it welcomed the removal of some of the uncertainty surrounding the industry for the past year. Shares also rose after British Gas said its pre-tax profits in the second quarter would not be less than Pounds 503m. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said the recommendations would allow the company to plan ahead with greater certainty. But they would place British Gas under financial strain and force a review of its investment programme. Mr Graeme Odgers, chairman of the commission, said the proposals would introduce competition to the gas industry in a controlled way, bring 'considerable benefits' for consumers, 'avoid problems on safety' and 'ensure appropriate regulation'. But the commission angered consumer organisations by recommending that consumers bear the cost of the proposed changes on the grounds that the development of competition will benefit them in the long run. Mr James Cooper, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, said: 'If these recommendations are implemented it appears that large numbers of domestic customers will pay more for their gas.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will have to decide whether to adopt the commission's recommendations. The government may shy away from some of the changes because they could lead to higher prices for domestic customers and would come in the wake of the furore over VAT on domestic fuel bills. Mr Neil Hamilton, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday the government had not reached a view on the commission's findings. But Ofgas, the industry regulator, said it believed the commission had been 'overly cautious'. Ofgas and many of British Gas's rivals, which supply industrial customers, would like to see the gas market freed up at the sametime as the supply of electricity is scheduled to be freed in 1998. The monopolies inquiry was called a year ago after a series of rows between British Gas and its regulator. Sir James McKinnon, head of Ofgas, wanted the commission to set a rate of return that British Gas should be allowed to earn from its pipelines operations. Mr Brown, however, asked for a full review of the company's activities. British Gas was last subject to an MMC investigation in 1988, when competition in the industrial supply market had been slow to develop since privatisation.

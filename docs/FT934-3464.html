			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (18): Managers deterred by the bottom line - Italy, activity is low, but privatisation may bring opportunities Dormant, rather than extinct, is how Italian investment bankers see the buy-out and buy-in scene on their home ground. The number of transactions concluded over the past two years, and currently being negotiated, is low. KPMG Peat Marwick's report on mergers and acquisitions in Italy shows that there were only eight MBOs and five MBIs last year, against aggregate totals of 15 in 1991 and 30 in 1990. And no improvement on 1992 is expected when the statistics are compiled for 1993. Stefano Tanzi, a partner in KPMG's corporate finance group, notes that the figures in his firm's report are limited to operations involving investment banks and funds. They exclude operations in which financial packages were put together by other intermediaries such as commercial banks. Mr Tanzi believes these other intermediaries probably undertook a similar number of transactions last year as the investment banks and funds. However, it is possible that the number of buy-outs and buy-ins undertaken by other intermediaries has dropped even more sharply than the number in KPMG's 'professional MBO market'. As the effects of the recession show through in company results, Italy's commercial banks are recording much higher levels of non-performing loans. Licking these wounds, they are becoming still less willing to examine buy-out and buy-in opportunities, as financing these entails higher risk than normal commercial lending. Paolo Colonna, of Schroder Associati, a protagonist in Italian MBO business, criticises the behaviour of the country's commercial banks, describing them as 'hysterical and irrational'. He comments: 'With banks being hyper-careful and cutting normal credit lines to business clients, it is not surprising that they are not financing MBOs.' But business fundamentals, like profits and financing costs, as much as reluctant banks and finance shortages, are the reason why deals have fallen from favour, regardless of the fact that, even before the 1991-1992 downturn, Italy had never featured among the leaders in this kind of operation. 'Even attractive businesses became unattractive when the economy turned down,' remarks Stefano Marsaglia, managing director of Rothschild Italia. Corporate profits are suffering in the recession, and this makes repayment of debt difficult. Managers are less willing and less able to consider buying out their companies' owners when bottom lines are negative or showing only small profits. Another deterrent is the cost of financing. Although real interest rates have dropped significantly from the peaks reached in summer and autumn 1992, they are still high. The prime rate recorded by the banking association ABI in September was 10.4 per cent, while the average interest charged on borrowings from banks was 12.9 per cent. With consumer price inflation at 4.5 per cent, the cost of money discourages buy-outs. Reflecting the increasing aversion to indebtedness, the average debt-to-equity ratio of MBOs and MBIs completed in Italy last year was 1.9. This continued the steady decline from a level of about 4 that was recorded in 1989. 'Investors are tending to reduce the risks associated with leveraged acquisition operations in today's uncertain economic conditions. They are allowing companies higher levels of capitalisation,' says Mr Tanzi. He notes that managers and investors have learnt from buy-outs that have gone bad due to debt overload. What are the prospects for next year? Prices are clearly an important factor. Mr Marsaglia considers that they are still high, the combination of this and high interest rates making transactions expensive. 'Next year should be more active, as the prospect of economic recovery will be closer, but it will still be difficult.' Italy's privatisation programme, which finally seems to be getting under way, may provide some opportunities. Indeed, before the recent break-up and sale of two divisions of the SME food, grocery retailing and catering group, controlled by the IRI state holding corporation, there was speculation that managers might become owners. That this did not happen owes something to price. Against the financial muscle flexed by the likes of Nestle and Unilever, managers are hard pushed to find the resources to make winning bids. 'The price was too high, and the cash flow offered by the target companies too low. Moreover, the restructuring needed is too difficult for a managers' bid to be credible,' remarks Mr Colonna, about the SME privatisations. He is even more dismissive of the idea that the troubled state-owned ILVA steel corporation might be privatised through an MBO. He says that, apart from ILVA's heavy losses, the capital-intensive and cyclical nature of the steel business prevents an MBO from being feasible. Opportunities are most likely to arise during post-privatisation re-structuring, as new owners sell activities that do not fit their business strategies. Italy's ENI state hydrocarbons holding corporation is thought to have several good targets in its chemicals and engineering sectors. Indeed, re-structuring generally could lead to more deals. Under pressure to focus on core businesses, Italy's large private-sector groups are expected to shed non-strategic subsidiaries. This could give a boost to MBO and MBI transactions, and so also could the re-organisation of Italian assets by multi-nationals. At Schroder Associati, Mr Colonna is bullish. 'We are already seeing a faster tempo in the closing months of this year. Next year the number of transactions will be higher.' Who will put up finance for this expected growth? In an area where banks will continue to tread warily, buy-out funds will have a role. 'Italy's image leads to difficulties with US investors, but Europeans do not have too many problems in understanding the situation and opportunities,' says Mr Colonna. Having raised L95bn (Pounds 38.3m) five years ago, Schroders are now launching another fund of a similar size. About half has been raised, and investors are expected to subscribe a further L40bn-L50bn early next year. 'It is a good time to buy,' affirms Mr Colonna.</p>

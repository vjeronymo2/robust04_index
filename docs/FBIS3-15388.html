I am strongly convinced of that,"  Belarusian Foreign Minister Pyotr Krawchenko, currently here on  an official visit, told ITAR-TASS today.    Speaking of results of his Bonn negotiations, Krawchenko  said  "the visit has been prepared for over a year and very  thoroughly. We have signed two very important documents in Bonn,  including the memorandum on interaction in overcoming Chernobyl  consequences.    "Belarus is the first state to conclude such an agreement  with a leading European nation. Paradoxically, many countries  avoided cooperation on the issue at the interstate level. This  memorandum is the first document of the sort. In fact, charity  exceeded the assistance Belarus received through state channels.  Germany is the leader in this respect, 40 per cent of charity  aid is its."    Asked about 1994 meetings between German and Belarusian  leaders, Krawchenko stressed "we have discussed a possibility of  German visit of Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. I  hope the visit will be held in 1994. Its precise date has not  been specified as Germany is expected to have 19 elections,  including parliamentary, this year. It will be hard to find  time for the visit in the near future."</p>

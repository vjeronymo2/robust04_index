			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Japan's trade surplus soars as strong yen lifts exports: Weak consumer demand forecast to hit company profits JAPAN's current account surplus soared in July to Dollars 9.641bn (Pounds 4.84bn), 89 per cent higher than a year ago, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. The announcement came as researchers at Nomura Securities forecast a bigger than expected fall of nearly 18 per cent in company profits this year, in the wake of static consumer demand. The rise in the current account surplus marks the 16th consecutive month of year-on-year increases and will add to the growing discomfort of the Japanese government, which has faced sharp calls from its trading partners to bring down the trade surplus. The current surplus is a record high for the month, with the trade surplus alone, which excludes invisible items such as tourism and insurance, rising from Dollars 8,624bn to Dollars 11,647bn. It puts Japan on course for record current account and trade surpluses this year. Imports during the month rose by a scant 0.4 per cent, while exports climbed by 12 per cent. The anaemic state of imports reflects the weak state of domestic demand in Japan because of the slowdown in the economy. In spite of government efforts over many years to reduce Japan's dependence on exports for economic growth, exports are turning out this year to be an important contribution to GNP growth. A finance ministry official attributed most of the increase in exports to a rise in the value of the yen compared to a year ago. Japan once again became a net importer of long term capital in July, amounting to Dollars 374m, compared to capital exports of Dollars 7.43bn in June. Japanese net purchases of overseas securities declined sharply from Dollars 4.85bn to Dollars 1.18bn, with bond purchases falling from Dollars 5.06bn to Dollars 2.02bn. Foreigners were net purchasers of Japanese stocks and shares worth Dollars 591m, compared to Dollars 1.95bn in sales during June. The forecast of falling company profits by Nomura Research Institute (NRI), the research arm of Nomura Securities, is a bleak revision of its initial prediction of 10 per cent pre-tax corporate profits for the year to March 1993. Japanese companies had expected a rebound in earnings during the second half of the fiscal year, but are starting to revise down profit forecasts following the prolonged economic slowdown. An unexpected slump in consumer demand is hitting profits. Although the Japanese government expected stable consumer spending to lead the country out of recession, recent statistics reflect an increasing loss in consumer confidence. The government's failure to announce its economic support package earlier will also delay recovery. The government last week announced its package, which includes Y10,700bn (Pounds 43bn) in public works spending. NRI said the effects of the package are not expected to be felt until next fiscal year. Delayed rationalisation of operations and increasing depreciation costs were also cited as causes for lower than expected profits. Profits at the electrical machinery and precision instrument sectors are expected to plunge 23 per cent, down from an initial projection of a 7.7 per cent decrease. The chemical sector is expected to show a 38.6 per cent fall, the financial industry a 12.1 per cent fall, and consumption related companies a decline of 8.4 per cent. However, for the next fiscal year to March 1994, NRI says the effects of the government's package will be felt, and together with an increase in consumer demand, will lift corporate profits by 8.5 per cent: the first rise in four years.</p>

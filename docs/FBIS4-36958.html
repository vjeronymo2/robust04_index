			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, Jun. 11 (MAP) -- The identification of  persons eligible to vote in the projected UN referendum in the  Sahara is meant to make sure that the persons concerned actually  meet one of the five criteria required for participation in the  referendum.    This came in the interview assistant special representative  of the UN secretary general for the Sahara and Chairman of the  Identification Commission Eric Jensen had with Moroccan  'L'OPINION' daily.    Jensen said some of the criteria are simple while others are  not. The simplest one is that of the persons on the lists of the  Spanish census of 1974.    The identification process is meant to check up if the  persons are actually eligible to vote in the referendum, he  said, adding that "there are difficult cases, because some times  the documents produced are very old, so it was necessary to  associate chioukhs who know the [word indistinct] in the  identification operation."    To a question on the duration of the operation, Jensen said  "it is too early to tell. We have nearly 56,000 registered  persons, but we expect much more."    "For the time being, I do not see any political  difficulties." The two sides "ensured me that they are ready to  apply the Security Council resolutions." "This means that we  will actually start the identification process," he said.    The five criteria required for participation in the  referendum are that people's names be on the lists of the  Spanish census of 1974, the people who were living in the  territory as a member of a Sahrawi tribe at the moment of the  census of 1974, but who could not be covered by the census, the  relatives of these two first groups (the father, mother and  children), the people born to a Saharawi father born in the  territory, the people, member of Saharawi tribes belonging to  the territory, who lived in the territory for six consecutive  years or intermittently during a cumilative period of 12 years  before December 1st, 1974.</p>

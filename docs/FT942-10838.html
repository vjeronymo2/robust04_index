			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Gummer seeks to revitalise town centres Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, will reinforce his commitment to revitalising town centres this week with a report which warns that property owners and financial institutions must invest in cities or risk them becoming US-style 'ghost towns'. Mr Gummer will launch the government-sponsored report, the result of a year-long study, at the Cities 94 urban regeneration conference in London's Docklands tomorrow. . The report warns that cities face a choice between the North American example, where retailing has been sucked out of many town centres by out-of-town developments, and the continental European model, where high population density, good transport facilities and attractive streets have kept city centres popular. The report's recommendations stress the need for property owners and investors, including insurance companies, banks and building societies, to play a part in regenerating urban centres. If that is not achieved voluntarily, it suggests, the only solution might be US-style business development districts, where property owners must pay a local levy to fund town-centre promotion and improvements in the urban environment. Mr Gummer has already published two controversial guidance notes for local authorities, PPG6 and PPG13, emphasising the importance of restricting development of greenfield sites and restor-ing the vitality of town centres. The new report - by the Urban and Economic Development Group, the planning consultancy, and four other partners - explores ways of achieving the latter and of assessing the impact on town centres of edge-of town and out-of-town developments. It recommends that local authorities produce a 'town profile', a vision of where the town should be going, and a strategy to support it. It adds that local authorities should also set up town-centre management groups, bringing together local officials as well as forums representing all the main interests including councillors and officials, retailers, chambers of commerce, property owners and community groups. A report published today by Corporate Intelligence, the retail research group, warns that the government's tougher stance on out-of-town retailing could threaten the development of US-style factory outlet centres and thus restrict consumer choice. It says nearly 30 such centres, which group together manufacturers' shops selling branded goods at low prices, are proposed in the UK, but several may not receive planning permission under the new rules.</p>

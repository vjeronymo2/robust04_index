			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Britain's outlook 'best for 50 years' says Major The economic outlook in Britain is the best for nearly 50 years, Mr John Major, the prime minister, claimed yesterday. In a clear attempt to reap a political dividend from the recent steady improvement in most indicators of economic performance, Mr Major used a speech to British businessmen in Saudi Arabia to set out his most optimistic assessment of the economy since the end of the recession. But as an indication of the difficulty the government faces in persuading the electorate that the recovery is under way, an opinion poll yesterday showed that consumer confidence fell back earlier this month. The survey, conducted by Gallup before the base rate rise last week, showed that the proportion of people who believed the economy was improving fell slightly this month compared with August. Less than a fifth of households expect their household budgets to improve this year, the poll also found, suggesting that there is little likelihood of an inflationary consumer boom later this year. Mr Major, however, yesterday insisted that the UK was at 'a historic turning point' in its economic performance. 'We are now standing at the threshold of an economic recovery unlike any that we have seen since the second world war. We are determined that this is going to be a recovery without inflation, a recovery that will last, a recovery for the long term,' he said. UK officials said the prime minister's bullish tone was partly intended to reinforce his upbeat economic message to King Fahd, delivered during several hours of 'very friendly' talks. The Saudi government is an important purchaser of UK government debt, and its willingness to remain in the market is regarded as an important indicator of the overseas credibility of British economic policy. However, Mr Major's positive message was also an attempt to reverse the trend of many opinion polls which suggest that the economic recovery is not being translated into an increase in support for the government. He brushed off last week's half point rise in bank base rates to 5.75 per cent as a necessary measure to hold down inflation. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday described the rate rise as a pre-emptive strike aimed at protecting a non-inflationary recovery. He ruled out early tax cuts and pledged to stick to his policy of reducing public borrowing. Confidence slips, Page 11</p>

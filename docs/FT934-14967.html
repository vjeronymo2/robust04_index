			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Major's press secretary to leave MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday signalled a fresh attempt to rebuild the government's battered public image by appointing a senior diplomat to replace his outgoing press secretary. Mr Major said that Mr Gus O'Donnell, his press secretary for four years, would be replaced in January by Mr Christopher Meyer, Britain's deputy ambassador in Washington. Mr O'Donnell, a career economist, is leaving to take up a senior Treasury post. He is thought to have been seeking an opportunity to return to the Treasury where he used to work, partly to avoid becoming too closely identified with the prime minister and the Conservative party. Mr Meyer, a highly respected diplomat who was head of the Foreign Office press office from 1984 to 1989, has been deputy head of mission in Washington since last year. The prime minister said he was 'very sad' about the departure of Mr O'Donnell who had done 'a difficult job with great skill and good humour'. But the appointment was welcomed by rightwingers, many of whom believe Mr O'Donnell bears some of the blame for the government's presentational difficulties over the last year. One senior backbencher said: 'There has been considerable criticism about the prime minister's private office, and many of us have been looking for changes.' Another blamed Mr O'Donnell for remarks attributed to the prime minister in which rightwing backbenchers were dismissed as 'barmy'. He said the change could 'only be an improvement'. Downing Street denied suggestions that Mr O'Donnell had been forced out to appease the right. He is to become head of the Treasury monetary group, which advises on interest rates and exchange rate policy. Mr O'Donnell was working on monetary aggregates at the Treasury when he was promoted to press secretary by Lord Lawson, the then chancellor. He remained in the job when Mr Major became chancellor in 1989, and moved with him to 10 Downing Street. Mr O'Donnell has told friends that he has 'bitter-sweet' feelings about leaving Number 10, but is pleased to be returning to a 'fun' job at the Treasury. Mr Meyer, a fluent Russian speaker and expert on Russian politics, is described by colleagues as an intelligent high flier destined for the top of diplomatic service. Mr Major said that Mr Meyer's 'fine record' in Washington and his experience in the Foreign Office press office would 'stand him in good stead for this challenge'. Like Mr O'Donnell, Mr Meyer will be able to indulge the prime minister's love of sport. He plays tennis and squash, and is a supporter of Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club.</p>

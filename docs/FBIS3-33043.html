As the Brazilian Government's final attempt  to solve this problem, Amorim accepted U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor's invitation to meet at 1330 today.    According to the foreign minister, bilateral disagreements  may be overcome through the joint effort of the interested  parties. In Amorim's opinion, the controversial items -- the  local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, the retroactive  recognition of patents (pipeline) [preceding word in English],  the parallel importation of medicines and microorganisms, gained  strength given the interpretation by each country. These  differences, said Amorim, became more obvious during the GATT's  Uruguay Round.    One of the things Amorim intends to explain Kantor is that  Brazil fully accepts the section related to industrial  protection (TRIPS) [Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights].  Amorim added that he must explain that the Brazilian Congress  does not intend to reject the TRIPS. The foreign minister went  on to explain: "The problem is that Congress will only vote on  the TRIPS after its text has been signed by all the countries  that signed the agreement during the meeting in Morocco last  April." Amorim added: "I am certain Congress will approve it."    The agreement that may be reached today will have a  significant impact on the approval of the Brazilian Industrial  Property Code (CBPI) that has been submitted to the Senate.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Airbus sees sharp fall in orders AIRBUS INDUSTRIE said aircraft orders fell to around 100 in 1991, well below the 404 of 1990 and the group's earlier 1991 forecast of 145, Reuter reports from Paris. An Airbus spokesman also said the group delivered slightly fewer than the 170 jets it forecast for 1991. It delivered only 95 aircraft in 1990 because of a strike at one of its partners. All of the civil aircraft makers expected orders to plunge in 1991 because of losses suffered by most world airlines and a natural pause after the buying binge in the late 1980s. The airlines have been hit by economic downturns in the US and much of western Europe and by the Gulf crisis of late 1990 and early 1991, which slashed world airline traffic. Airbus is a consortium made up of France's Aerospatiale British Aerospace L, Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain and the Deutsche Airbus unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz It booked a record 421 orders in 1989. China signed contracts worth Dollars 100m (Pounds 53m) in 1991 to sell 32 civilian aircraft to 11 countries and areas, the China News Service said, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Iran is ready to return six Kuwaiti aircraft flown to safety by Iraq during the Gulf War last year, Mr Assad Kotaite, the head of the UN aviation authority has said, Reuter reports from Nicosia.</p>

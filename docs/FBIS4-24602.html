			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese State Councillor  Li Tieying stressed here today that it is a major point of  China's diplomacy to maintain its co-operation and friendship  with the Third World countries.    Meeting with Fa'iz Sa'igh, director general of the Syrian  Arab News Agency, and his party here this morning, Li said China  needs to know the rest of the world, while the latter needs to  understand China.    "We fully support XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in its activities of  establishing friendly ties and co-operation with its  counterparts abroad," he added.    Li said he was glad to note that Guo Chaoren, director  general of XINHUA, had signed with Sa'igh yesterday an agreement  on the exchange of information and co-operation between the two  agencies.    Sa'igh said that the aim of signing the agreement was to  promote such ties, adding that he believed that co-operation  between the two agencies will surely grow with the coming into  effect of the agreement.    It will also enable the two agencies to introduce their  respective countries' achievements to the world in a better way.    On China's foreign polices, Li said that China always  pursues  an independent foreign policy of peace, opposes any form of  hegemonism, supports the efforts that the arab people have made  in safeguarding regional peace and their efforts for  accelerating the peace process in the Middle East.    He urged all parties concerned in the Middle East to settle  their regional disputes through dialogues and negotiations so as  to bring about permanent peace.    Sa'igh said Syria has made unremitting efforts for the  settlement of the Middle East issue in a complete, fair and  reasonable way, and hopes that the relevant resolutions of the  United Nations will be fully implemented.    During the meeting Li briefed the visitors on China's  economic growth, and reform and opening to the outside world.    The Syrian visitors arrived here May 31 as guests of XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY.</p>

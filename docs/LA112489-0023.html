			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: BORN UNDER THE STAR OF LAST-MINUTE SHOPPERS  </P> <P> Candice Bergen admits to being a notorious last-minute Christmas shopper. She  does so in the opening pages of a new Spiegel catalogue where she also lists  her 42 last-minute holiday gift ideas. Among her favorites are a silver-plated  makeup set and a turquoise flannel shirt that reminds her of her Uncle Lou who  lived in a cabin in the Adirondacks. The popular star of "Murphy Brown" isn't  the first to speak for the company. Bianca Jagger and Jacqueline Bisset already  have. But she is the first to guest-edit her own catalogue. "She's a great role  model," explains Rob Logendyke of Spiegel, about the choice. Other changes at  Spiegel include plans to carry clothing by several of New York's leading  younger designers, including Marc Jacobs for Perry Ellis, Charlotte Neuville  and Carmelo Pomodoro, all of who will be photographed by the famed Scavullo for  their Spiegel portraits.  </P> <P> Oh Giorgio! Strutting Their Armani Stuff  </P> <P> Jazz pianist Harry Connick Jr., whose rendition of "It Had to Be You" made him  the musical sensation of "When Harry Met Sally," gave a concert at the Wiltern  Theatre last weekend. And between tunes he admitted to having an incurable  fashion disease -- "Armani-itis." Strutting across the stage in a gray wool  suit by Italian designer Giorgio Armani, he added, "I'm broke, but I sure look  good." The post-concert dinner celebration looked like a meeting of the  similarly affected. Columbia Pictures President Dawn Steel wore an Armani  single-button jacket and pants, actor D.B. -Sweeney wore a suit from the  Italian designers Emporio line, and Armani-philes Billy Crystal,  </P> <P> Michael Keaton and Matthew Modine also dressed the part.  </P></p>

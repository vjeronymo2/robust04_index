			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KASAY'S FIELD GOAL KEEPS ALABAMA WINLESS, 17-16  </P> <P> John Kasay's 40-yard field goal with 1:31 remaining lifted Georgia to a 17-16  victory over Alabama on Saturday, extending the Crimson Tide's longest losing  streak in 34 years to five games.  </P> <P> Kasay's third field goal of the game capped a fourth-quarter rally from a 16-6  deficit.  </P> <P> Georgia drove 71 yards to cut the lead to 16-14 on Larry Ware's three-yard  touchdown run with 5:53 left.  </P> <P> Ware threw a halfback pass to Chris Broom for the two-point conversion.  </P> <P> When Alabama failed to move after the kickoff, Georgia took over at the Alabama  45 with 4:10 remaining.  </P> <P> Garrison Hearst had a 17-yard run in the drive that bogged down on the 23, and  Kasay came in to kick the game-winner.  </P> <P> Georgia (2-1) squared its Southeastern Conference record at 1-1. Alabama fell  to 0-3 overall and 0-2 in the SEC, and is in the cellar of a league it has  dominated.  </P> <P> The loss left Gene Stallings still looking for his first victory as the Crimson  Tide coach, a position he took in January when Bill Curry left for Kentucky.  </P> <P> Alabama's last five-game losing streak came when the 1956 team lost its first  four to give the Tide 17 losses in succession over three seasons.  </P></p>

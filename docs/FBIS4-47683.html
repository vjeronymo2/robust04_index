			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IEC officials Pieter Cronje, Humphrey </F> Khoza, and Kumi Naidoo at IEC headquarters at Gallagher Estate,  Midrand -- live]    [Text] [Cronje] Good evening ladies and gentlemen. We have  been getting in the election results of this election. At this  stage, the results come from the Western Cape Province, but they  are only for the National Assembly. As the results became  available, what we will give you from Gallagher Estate at the  IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] Media Center, would be  three components: provincial totals for the national ballot, in  other words, the votes cast in the Western Cape, Northern Cape,  and the remaining provinces for the national ballot. Secondly,  we will give you the provincial ballots for the provincial  legislatures, and thirdly, we will give you the overall total  for the national ballot, the National Assembly. at the moment,  just a repeat: We have only National Assembly ballots emanating  from the Western Cape. There the latest results are as follows:  PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], 112; Soccer Party, 8; Freedom  Front, 641; Workers' List Party, 4; Women's Rights Peace Party,  3; Ximoko Progressive Party, 4; African Christian Democratic  Party, 150; African Democratic Movement, 3; African Moderates  Congress Party, 15; African Muslim Party, 25; ANC, 4,696; DP  [Democratic Party], 544; Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa, 12;  Federal Party, 21; IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], 132; the Keep It  Straight and Simple Party, 24; LUSAP [Luso-SA Party], 13;  Minority Front, 34; NP [National Party], 14,436    The rejected ballots number 184.    [Khoza] Let me give you an overview of the regional reports  with regard to the counting process, as it continues. You will  recall that at an earlier briefing we did say that we had some  human resource, or staff, or personnel problems at the counting  centers in Queenstown and Umtata in the Eastern Cape. We are  pleased that staff at Queenstown sub-regional office have gone  back to work and at Umtata there has been an acceptance of the  agreement in principle, and therefore counting started at 5PM  this afternoon.    In KwaZakhele, as I promised to report, the allegation of  tempering with ballot boxes is still being investigated and the  South African Police are involved.    Empangeni -- we have a technical error there in that the  lines are down, therefore we cannot be fed with information. I  just want to emphasize that that does not necessarily say work  or counting is not continuing. It's just that we cannot be  accessed. Newcastle as a center -- Vryheid and Ngotje are still  reconciling. In North-West Mafikeng Center, the center is still  trying to address its staffing problems. We have problems with  staff at the Mafikeng center as well.    In Schweizer-Reneke, Vryburg, Bloemhom and Delareyville  counting is continuing. In Christiana counting is continuing,  and it is believed that results are imminent. Khanyetsa -- they  are not counting as yet, but reconciliation is continuing. In  Taung and Kuruman they are at the reconciliation stage. In the  Northern Transvaal, Thohoyandou Center, reconciliation was  completed in Messina and they are awaiting confirmation to  proceed with the counting. In Soutpansberg reconciliation has  just begun. It is estimated that the process should be  completed by 7PM this evening. In Phalaborwa reconciliation has  begun. No stations have started counting as yet. Ellisrus --  still reconciling, counting is imminent, and I will hand over to  my colleague, Kumi, to give you an updated situation as far as  the Nasrec Center [National Exhibition Center] is concerned.    [Naidoo] Judge Kriegler, Mrs. Helen Suzman, and  representatives of the major political parties met at Nasrec  this afternoon where votes for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] province are being counted, to discuss difficulties  around the reconciliation process which has delayed the start of  the count. The reconciliation is acknowledged to be a cause for  concern. In order not to delay the counting in this important,  most populous region in the country, which should be under way  already, a working system as agreed -- whereby the ballots which  can be reconciled, will be reconciled -- allowing the counting  to begin immediately. In the interim each party will appoint a  representative to a team which with the IEC will deal with all  problem cases, dissolve as any as possible by agreement, and put  the ballots into the count. A second team will deal with the  more problematic cases where agreement could not be reached, and  continue to try to find agreement on these cases.    Meanwhile, all objections are being noted and will be lodged  with the IEC to be dealt with at headquarters. The results that  become available will be tally figures before the resolution of  disputes. The IEC appeals to party officials to cooperate with  the IEC in getting the answers to the voters as expeditiously as  possible.    [Cronje] Ladies and gentlemen, we discussed the situation at  the Mitchell's Plain counting center, where at a previous  briefing we announced that over half of the total votes will be  handled. I have an update for you that an agreement was reached  between the IEC and the parties there. They are expediting the  process of reconciliation. Instead of the counting officers  checking individual boxes from voting stations against the  counterfoils, the counting officers will receive the boxes,  count the papers, and keep the totals, and then transfer that  straight into party support, but while doing this a group of  auditors will sit with the tallies from the first count and they  will use those tallies as a check for the counterfoils. The  counting officers will give the results from the boxes and the  auditors will then give their count of the reconciliation.</p>

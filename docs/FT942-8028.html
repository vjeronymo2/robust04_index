			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Management: Weird and crazy world of Tom Peters On my desk is a photo of world famous management guru Tom Peters smiling broadly in a pair of pink boxer shorts. The picture has been taken for his forthcoming book Crazy Times Call for Crazy Organisations, an ambitious work aimed at everyone from the chief executive to the janitor. In an accompanying letter sent by Peters to 'various friends' in the media, he explains that the idea of a Dollars 15 book for those who cannot afford his Dollars 2,000 seminars 'felt right - very, very right'. He also warns that book is going to make readers angry. Before I have even opened the covers I am a feeling annoyed, though not perhaps in the way the author intended. The title gets on my nerves a little; the picture, a lot. Why is it that management gurus feel the need to grow their hair, wear kipper ties or have their pictures taken half undressed? Perhaps the sad truth is that most people will not buy books about organisational structures unless a zany personality is thrown in too. The thesis by which Peters hopes to enrage his audience is that there is no future for sane companies in this insane world. Organisations must go beyond the management crazes they are now grappling with - re-engineering, TQM, empowerment, change - and enter an era of revolution and reinvention. He may be quite right, but I am worried about his premise. Why does he think these are the craziest times for 200 years? They strike me as being sane enough, if sometimes a little grim. I'm not sure I like his recommendations for individual behaviour either. He urges us to behave like entrepreneurs building portfolios of skills and marketing our wares. We are also advised to use words like 'apeshit', 'weird', and 'freaky'. This sounds like a recipe for Tom Peters clones. He certainly has no problems when it comes to selling his own wares. He has already put in a plug for his next book which he says will be a 'Wit and Wisdom' format, and should be with us in a matter of months. I hate to think which item of clothing he will take off to market that one.                           *      *      * McKinsey, the management consultancy which prides itself on the quality of its analysis, is being alarmingly thorough in its latest recruitment efforts. It is looking for accountants with top degrees, flawless professional qualifications, and up to seven years' glittering experience in the real world. Anyone answering the description should send in a full CV including their grades in the A-level exams they did at school. Come off it, McKinsey. Is it really relevant what an experienced, top-flight accountant was like at school? If so why stop at A-levels? What about O-levels? Or those new exams that 7-year-olds do? Why not find out when they took their first steps or counted to 10? As I fluffed my own A-levels, it is natural that I am a little sceptical. But I'm sure Tom Peters would agree that what sorts out successful people is that they go on learning and reinventing themselves.                           *      *      * The issue of oldies in the boardroom has surfaced again following the appointment of 72-year-old Sir Michael Palliser to the board of Exploration Company of Louisiana. Ageist remarks about the choice have made some Veds (Very Elderly Directors) quite cross. Roland Shaw, the 72-year-old chairman of Premier Consolidated, wrote an irate letter to the Financial Times pointing out that the great Armand Hammer was in his nineties when he stepped down at Occidental Petroleum. Now I am sure that veteran diplomat Sir Michael will do an excellent job helping this little, loss-making oil company in its search for the black stuff in China. I also agree with Shaw that some directors stay on the ball for a long time. I would not have chosen Hammer as an example, though. His many critics would say he was a raging megalomaniac who spent more time furthering his own reputation than that of his company. However, as a general rule, 70 does seem is a bit old for a seat on the board. As people get on in years they get less willing to embrace change, while non-execs who have retired from executive jobs have less relevant experience to offer as time goes on. There is, of course, no point in being too dogmatic about it. The ever youthful Sir John Harvey Jones with his flowing locks (and kipper tie) has just reached 70 and has said now is the time to stop being a non-exec. Meanwhile, Lord Weinstock, his exact contemporary at GEC, is showing no immediate signs of passing on the mantle.                           *      *      * Mary Spillane, who makes a handsome living telling western businessmen whether single or double breasted suits better flatter their physiques, is now planning to set up in Russia. 'The new Russian elite wear shiny suits which don't fit properly. They look very greasy, flash - not trustworthy. They need a lot of help,' she says. Some might say that the idiosyncratic dress sense of Russia's new businessmen is not the most pressing of the country's problems as its economy goes into free-fall. Yet Spillane is raring to go, and has lined up a grant from the Bank of Siberia and found a partner who used to be the Visa Officer at the Russian Embassy in London. Perhaps Peters is right. These are crazy times, after all.</p>

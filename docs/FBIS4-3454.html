			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President  Jiang Zemin inspected the Beijing International  Telecommunications Center here today, urging concerted efforts  to make telecommunications work better serve the country's  economic development.    Jiang, general secretary of the Central Committee of the  Chinese Communist Party (CPC), said that the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council are pleased at the rapid  development of China's telecommunications services in recent  years.

At a TV conference room, he talked by video telephone with  the head of Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau -- about supplies  of vegetables, traffic conditions and development of  telecommunications in Shanghai.    Jiang urged Shanghai and Beijing telecommunications bureaux  to learn from and compete with each other.    At the international telephone control room, he urged the  operators to devote efforts to their study of foreign languages.    In a meeting room, Jiang listened to a report from Beijing  telecommunications bureau and the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications.    He said that the establishment of a socialist market  economic  structure demands a highly developed telecommunications network.    He called on various departments within telecommunications  and posts services to enhance cooperation and use state  investment to its best advantage.</p>

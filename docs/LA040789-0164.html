			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NRA SUPPORTS WAIT FOR GUN BUYERS  </P> <P> The National Rifle Assn. broke tradition today and endorsed Oregon legislation  requiring a waiting period and a background check for handgun buyers.  </P> <P> "To my knowledge this is the first time we have endorsed a bill with a waiting  period," Brian Judy, the NRA's liaison to nine Western states, said after  endorsing an Oregon bill that would require a 15-day waiting period for buying  a pistol. Judy said it also is the first time the most powerful anti-gun  control lobby in the nation has actually helped develop a bill requiring  handgun purchasers to wait before getting the weapon.  </P></p>

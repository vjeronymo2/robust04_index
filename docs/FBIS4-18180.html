			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gillian Tett in Brussels and Daniel Green in </F> London: "Europe's Chemicals Sector Hopes To Pool Research"]    [Text] An initiative to promote industry-wide  collaboration on research and development in Europe's chemical  sector is to start next month, it emerged in Brussels yesterday.    It would mark the first attempt by companies to pool their  research resources to combat the growing U.S. an Japanese threat.    The sector has been suffering from chronic overcapacity  especially in petrochemical and bulk chemicals. Some  unprofitable European plant are protected from closure by  national governments even though their prices are deeply  undercut by newer plants especially in Asia.    Mr. Dirk Hudik, ICI's manager of European affairs, said  yesterday that research directors from European companies would  meet next month to identify suitable areas for sector-wide  research.    Programmes would probably centre around environmental  research, to develop waste management technologies, greater  energy efficiency and sustainable production. Another  possibility could be the use of information technology in  process control, Mr. Hudik added.    Two more meetings are likely over the next six months, and  the companies aim to submit concrete proposals to the European  Commission by the autumn in the hope of attracting funding.    Under its research programme, the Commission usually  provides  half the funding for joint industry projects which have hitherto  been limited to pre-competitive research.    With the European chemical industry facing shrinking margins  and mounting research development costs, there has been growing  interest in exploring collaboration.    Mr. Peter Schwarz, head of research at the Italian chemical  group Enichem, said yesterday: "We believe co-operation will be  a large part of operations in the future, particularly in the  situations of high risk of financial exposure which are present  in the chemical area."</p>

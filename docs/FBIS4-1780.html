			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The General Office of the CPC Central Committee Issues a </F> Circular Concerning Organizing the Broad Masses of Cadres To  Conscientiously Study the Theory and Basic Knowledge of a  Socialist Market Economy"]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Mar (XINHUA) -- The General Office of  the CPC Central Committee [CPC CC] recently issued a circular  urging the party committees of all levels to organize the broad  masses of cadres to conscientiously study the theory and basic  knowledge of a socialist market economy.    The circular pointed out: At present, the whole party and  the  whole country are striving to carry out the guiding spirit of  the 14th National CPC Congress and the decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC CC. China's economic  restructuring has developed to a new stage where overall  progress and major breakthroughs are integrated. In China, the  establishment of a socialist market economy and further  emancipation and development of the productive force mean a  great creative undertaking, an arduous and complex project  involving all of society, and a brand new subject which should  be handled properly in establishing socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Facing the new situation and tasks, we are  confronted with many unfamiliar and incomprehensive things which  require our earnest and arduous efforts to study them. How well  cadres of all levels and particularly leading cadres study the  subject has great bearing on persisting in carrying out the  party's basic line to the fullest extent, on initially  establishing a socialist market economy by the end of this  century, and on smoothly carrying out the second strategic goal  of national economy and social development. For this purpose,  the CPC CC has decided to urge the broad masses of cadres to  conscientiously study the theory and basic knowledge concerning  a socialist market economy during the course of organizing  comrades of the whole party to study and master Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    Concerning the major content and basic requirement of  the study, the circular points out:    1. The establishment and development of a socialist market  economy constitutes an important part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This  theory is an ideological weapon which we must master in carrying  out our economic restructuring. In studying the theory of a  socialist market economy, we must, first of all, comprehensively  and systematically study relevant expositions in Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's works to understand the guiding spirit and essence of  his ideas. The report of the 14th National CPC Congress and the  decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC CC, which  are formed with the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as a guide, must be used as required reading  materials for studying the theory and basic knowledge of a  socialist market economy. It is necessary to understand in a  broad and deep-going way from these materials the guiding  ideology, target requirements, basic principles, major links,  and work arrangements for conducting this reform. It is  imperative to study various principles, policies, and reform  plans adopted by the CPC CC, as well as relevant laws and  regulations in an effort to carry out a socialist market  economic system. Meanwhile, it is necessary to pay attention to  the study of basic knowledge of a socialist market economy. The  book entitled "What a Socialist Market Economy Is," jointly  compiled by the Development Studies Center under the State  Council and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, can be used  as a popular textbook. Cadres at all levels, no matter whether  they are engaged in economic work or otherwise, should have a  full understanding of the importance of the study and enhance  their self-awareness and sense of urgency.    2. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of linking  theory with practice and manage to apply what one has learned.  Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, and based on China's basic  socialist system and economic development, we should emancipate  the mind, seek truth from facts, and conscientiously study and  boldly borrow all useful experiences of other countries of the  world that conform with the rule of modern socialized production  during the course of developing their market economy. Efforts  should be made to integrate the study of the theory and basic  knowledge of a socialist market economy as well as the party's  principles and policies with the summing up of practical  experiences of each locality, department, and unit in carrying  out reform and economic construction and with the efforts to  study and resolve understanding problems and working problems in  the current reform drive.    3. Efforts should be made, through study and education, to  ensure that cadres at all levels will achieve practical results  in the following three aspects: First, it is necessary to  further unify the ideology to carry out the guiding spirit of  the 14th National CPC Congress and the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC CC. We must correctly understand the intrinsic  characteristics of a socialist market economy and have full  understanding of the necessity, urgency, and arduousness of  setting up this new economic system so as to strengthen the  self-awareness and resolution of carrying out the party's line,  principles, and policies, and to push forward and support the  reform with one heart and one mind. Second, it is necessary to  master the theory and basic knowledge of establishing a  socialist market economy as well as relevant principles and  policies, strive to understand and handle issues involving new  theories and ideas, be bold in exploration and practice,  promptly sum up new experiences, continuously enhance working  standards, and gain initiative in pushing forward reform and  economic development. Third, it is necessary to have an  all-round understanding of the inner relationship between  developing a socialist market and rigidly following the  principle of the party spirit in running business, consciously  uphold the party's ideal and faith, and persist in a correct  sense of value, integrity, and self- discipline so as to resist  the corrosion of passive and corrupt phenomena and withstand the  new test faced in the new period.    Concerning the methods and measures of the study,  the circular points out:    1. Teaching plans for all regular training classes of party  schools, institutes, and centers at all levels should be  properly readjusted to arrange necessary time for teaching  special courses such as the theory and basic knowledge of a  socialist market economy, as well as relevant plans, principles,  and policies for the reform. In addition, rigorous checks and  evaluations of such efforts should be carried out.    2. Party schools, institutes, and centers at all levels  should sponsor, in a planned way, backbone cadres' training  classes and special topic study classes for the study of the  theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy.    3. It is necessary to organize on-the-job studies for the  majority of cadres. Necessary time for the studies must be  ensured in accordance with various situations. The study  methods should proceed from reality and be flexible and varied  in form. In general, the method of releasing cadres from work  to enable them to study in classes can be integrated with that  of individual studies. Other methods include a combination of  reading, supplementary lectures, and discussion.    4. The central study groups of the party committees at all  levels should treat the study of the theory and basic knowledge  of a socialist market economy as one of the important elements  and strive to study them better and genuinely play exemplary  roles.    5. It is necessary to launch a publicity campaign to educate  the people about the knowledge of a socialist market economy by  putting mass media to full use. The central television station  as well as provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal  television and radio stations should arrange proper times for  broadcasting special supplementary lectures. All localities and  units should organize cadres to watch or listen to these  programs. In accordance with needs, some video or audio tapes  may be produced as a supplementary aid to cadres' studies.  Newspapers, publications, and propaganda and public opinion  departments must closely coordinate this educational campaign  and launch their work purposely to give publicity to good study  experiences.    Concerning the organizational and leading work,  the circular emphatically points out:    1. Party committees at all levels should conscientiously  strengthen their leadership by paying great attention to the  study and education of the theory and basic knowledge of a  socialist market economy among all cadres. Major efforts should  be made to ensure a success in the study and education of  leading cadres of party committees and governments, cadres of  economic administration, and cadres in charge of the management  of the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises on or  above county level. Localities should formulate practical plans  and, in accordance with the characteristics and the needs of  practical work of those cadres who are in various trades,  professions, departments, and levels, put forward various  specific requirements and adopt various methods for the study  and education. In addition, they should pay great attention to  carrying out these plans. In order to achieve effective  results, it is necessary to have good preparation for and  regular inspections of the work. Efforts should be made to  avoid formalism. Cadres' study should be considered as an  important content of their evaluation. Under the unified  leadership of the party committees, party organization  departments as well as publicity departments of the party  committee at all levels should be responsible for carrying out  the work of organizing and implementing study and education.    2. The State Economic and Trade Commission is responsible  for  the unified arrangement of the study and education of  enterprises' leading cadres and administrative personnel. The  Work Committee for Organs under the CPC CC and the Work  Committee for Central Government Organs shall arrange for the  study and education of cadres working for the CPC CC and the  state organs.    3. Each level is responsible for its own work, with a higher  level supervising lower levels. The Organization Department and  the Propaganda Department of the CPC CC will conduct a selective  inspection by the end of this year on the study of the central  studying groups of all provincial, autonomous regional, and  municipal party committees as well as on that of the central  study groups of the party committees (party organs) of the CPC  CC and the state organs.</p>

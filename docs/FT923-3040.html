			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Germany's lead soon followed THE BUNDESBANK'S decision to cut its lending rates yesterday was swiftly followed by rate cuts in some other European countries. Reductions were mainly confined to countries whose currencies form the hard core of the European exchange rate mechanism, while others, wary that the German move was too small to allow much room for manoeuvre, chose to wait at least until after the French referendum. The Bank of Belgium said it would cut its discount rate to 8.25 per cent from 8.5 per cent. Its emergency lending rate - equivalent to Germany's Lombard rate - was cut from 11.5 to 11 per cent. In the Netherlands, the central bank lowered its three key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points. In Austria, whose schilling is informally linked to the D-Mark although not part of the ERM, the central bank cut its lending rates to the same level as in Germany. The Swiss, whose currency is also informally associated with the D-Mark, cut the discount rate to 6.5 per cent. Denmark, which usually follows German rates closely, had not decided yesterday how to react. In Norway, analysts reckoned the central bank was unlikely to cut interest rates soon, partly because the German move was too small to influence Norway. Japanese officials dismissed suggestions that Tokyo should cut interest rates but welcomed the realignment of European currencies. Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said Japanese interest rates were already low.</p>

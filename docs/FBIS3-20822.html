Mueller also met with other officials of the  Ministry of Economic Relations and Development.    Mueller and Ravbar favorably assessed Slovene-German  cooperation. Slovenia has a positive trade balance with Germany,  which certainly proves that the German market is open to  Slovenia. Another sign is the well developed cooperation in the  area of investments, which will increase in the future. Mueller  said that Germany will continue to support Slovenia in its  efforts to join the European Union. Ravbar cited Slovenia's  efforts to become a member of GATT. She proposed that Germany  help Slovene enterprises participate in German conferences and  seminars dealing with strategies and opportunities for  improvement and development of various economic sectors.</p>

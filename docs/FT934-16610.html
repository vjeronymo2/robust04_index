			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shift on food retailers FOOD retail shares bounced forward as BZW, one of the sector's leading brokers, joined the growing band of commentators to believe that the share price falls of recent months have been overdone. The broker moved from 'sell' to 'hold' on two of the sector's biggest stocks and adopted a more positive view on the sector as a whole. Mr Bill Curry at BZW said: 'Since we turned sellers in early March, the sector has under-performed by 30 per cent. But we believe there is now evidence of food price stability creeping back into the sector.' The broker moved Tesco, up 9 1/2 to 200p ex-dividend, and Argyll, ahead 10 1/2 at 298 1/2 p, to a hold, and retained the same recommendation on J Sainsbury, 12 1/2 forward at 428 1/2 p. To encourage investors, BZW also launched a food retail warrant incorporating a basket of stocks by market capitalisation. The Pounds 100m launch is one of the first to include solely UK traded stocks.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: McKay Securities advances to Pounds 2m McKay Securities, the Berkshire-based property group, bucked the sector trend with a rise from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 2.01m in pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September. The increase reflected gross rents and service charges ahead to Pounds 5.48m (Pounds 4.74m) and was struck despite interest charges of Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 1.18m) although this excluded Pounds 378,213 (Pounds 633,010) of interest and outgoings on development properties which was capitalised. The interim dividend is raised to 3.2p (3p), payable from earnings of 6p (5.5p) per share.</p>

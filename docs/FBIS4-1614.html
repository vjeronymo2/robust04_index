			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren today expressed his satisfaction with the growth of  ties between China and Iceland.    Meeting with visiting Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin  Hannibalsson and his party here today, Rong said that concerted  efforts of both sides have enabled bilateral friendly ties and  cooperation in the political and economic fields to continue to  develop since they established diplomatic relations 20 years ago.    Recently, he said, such relations have developed with good  momentum.    Rong said that China and Iceland greatly differ in national  conditions, but the two sides share identical or similar views  on many international issues.    Under the present complicated and changeable international  situation, furthering bilateral ties conforms to the common  interests of the two countries, he said.    Rong said that China is ready to work together with Iceland  and raise bilateral relations to a new level.    Rong briefed the visitors on China's present political and  economic situation.    Noting the fruitful cooperation in many aspects,  Hannibalsson  said he was impressed by China's economic growth and  achievements in other areas.    He expressed appreciation for the far-sighted policy that  the  Chinese Government has been pursuing.    Jiang Enzhu, vice-minister of foreign affairs, attended the  meeting.</p>

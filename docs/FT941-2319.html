			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Beijing fears trade sanctions on rogue regime When China's Premier Li Peng hinted at the weekend the US should make some gesture towards recognising North Korea, he was repeating standard Chinese advice for easing the nuclear crisis. But Beijing's prescription for dealing with a rogue regime appears not to be attracting much support in the west, where pressure is building for stronger UN condemnation and possible trade sanctions. It is this latter possibility that alarms China. At this stage, it would be likely to oppose vigorously any attempt to impose economic penalties on North Korea. The question for the US and other western powers would be whether to risk fracturing the Security Council consensus, or yielding to Chinese pressure for further diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis. Western officials in China believe Security Council consensus would be hard to achieve on any punitive measures. At best, Beijing may be persuaded to abstain on a resolution of condemnation. They contrast the North Korea crisis and the Gulf War of 1990-91, in which China abstained on the vote imposing sanctions against Iraq, but fell into line on implementing them. This time, the stakes for China are higher and the complications infinitely greater. North Korea may be seen in the west as a renegade state, but to the Chinese, North Koreans have been allies in war, and their two countries share a common border and a fairly extensive trading relationship. Chinese leaders may well regard recent developments in North Korea with dismay and its idiosyncratic leadership a menace to civilisation. But they seem firm in their views that confrontation carries greater risks than likely rewards. The immediate question for western powers is whether to give quiet Chinese diplomacy further scope and possibly active encouragement without any real hope that such an approach might work. Chinese officials believe the west has failed to appreciate fully the depths of North Korean paranoia over its growing isolation following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the virtual disappearance of friends in eastern Europe, and vast changes in China, which proved a less-than-steadfast ally by normalising relations with South Korea in 1992. These officials say Pyongyang wants to reduce its isolation, and it is prepared to make concessions to escape from its predicament; hence Beijing's advice to the US that they should try to avoid at all costs placing the North Koreans in a corner.</p>

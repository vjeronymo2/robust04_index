			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Management: Riga's recruits - The challenges faced by two new business schools Sandwiched between a dilapidated former Soviet military barracks and a dingy Soviet-style apartment block, the renovated Stockholm School of Economics in Riga gleams like a jewel in the winter gloom. Inside the building the mood is equally bright. 'This school will give me opportunities I would never have had otherwise. It is the best in Latvia,' says Uldis Kalnins, an 18-year-old, high-school graduate and one of 56 students in the first-year intake. SSE Riga, inaugurated last month, is a unique collaboration between Swedish and Latvian partners designed to help the Baltic states grow into fully-fledged market economies. It will provide 100 students a year from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with intensive undergraduate tuition in economics and business. The aim is to create a new breed of entrepreneurs, academics and administrators - people who can quickly assume positions of influence and transform attitudes in countries that were part of the former Soviet Union until three years ago. The school's name reflects the leading role played by the Stockholm School of Economics, both in initiating the project and providing management. Indeed, it was a casual chat between Staffan Burenstam Linder, the SSE's president, and some Baltic state students three years ago that first gave rise to the idea. Burenstam Linder seized on it eagerly. 'I like bold ideas and I like entrepreneurship,' he says. There were plenty of hurdles, but eventually Burenstam Linder received financial backing, co-operation from the Latvian authorities, and a distinguished building in central Riga to house the new school. Funding is being provided by the Swedish and Latvian governments, the Soros Foundation, and a few private donors. The Swedish government will provide as much as SKr80m (Pounds 7m) over 10 years, mainly to cover education costs. The Latvian side meets local charges, such as heating and electricity. The Soros Foundation gave Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) to renovate the building and build a new auditorium. The school is 51 per cent owned by the SSE and 49 per cent owned by the Latvian government. Three years of normal university teaching will be crammed into two. This saves costs and gets the graduates into the system as soon as possible. The first year's intake - for practical reasons, Latvians only - are aged between 18 and 25 and come from a mixture of backgrounds. They do not have to pay tuition costs or fund their own maintenance, avoiding a common situation in eastern Europe where students have to take on part-time jobs to finance their studies. Teaching will initially be carried out almost exclusively by SSE staff, although a much greater local and international input is desired in the long-term. Indeed, great store is being placed on the school's international credibility, which is one reason why the teaching language is English. The programme is deliberately being pitched at undergraduates, as there are currently too few good graduates for effective courses to be run at a Masters level. There will also be a doctoral programme, but this will be run out of Stockholm until it has been built up in Riga. The worry with this arrangement is that it increases the risks of a 'brain-drain'. If students decide to continue their education abroad after the two years in Riga, the chances of them staying abroad rather than working back home increase. The hope is that over the next 10 years the school will attract donations, building up a sufficient endowment to stand on its own feet. When this point is reached, it would no longer be run by the SSE. If the venture is successful - and the early signs are promising - Burenstam Linder sees no reason why the concept should not be transplanted to other former Soviet cities such as Tallinn or St Petersburg. The project is seen as a practical way for Sweden to support the Baltic states while helping to cement long-standing cultural and historic ties. 'A lot of aid to eastern Europe disappears down a black hole. Here we have full control over how it is spent,' says Per Unckel, a former Swedish education minister who was involved with the project. But there are also voices of caution. Peter Wallenberg, one of many top Swedish industrialists who attended the inauguration, says the school can only do part of the job of transforming the economies of the Baltic states. 'It is very important that the students come out into an environment which they recognise from the instruction they have had. Otherwise they will go abroad,' he warns.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CHINA BECOMES A PETAL-PUSHER  </P> <P> China has adopted a new ploy to recoup costs of the Asian Games held in Beijing  -- require schoolchildren to buy the wilting flower displays.  </P> <P> "We have to buy them," said a student as he and his school friends took bunches  of flowers home.  </P> <P> Schoolchildren are required to buy pots of chrysanthemums, daisies and dahlias  at the cost of about 30 cents. The flowers are sold on street corners.  </P> <P> More than 2 million pots of flowers decorated Beijing during the games.  </P> <P> Many Chinese were forced to buy bonds to pay for the games and some complained  that police stopped cars outside the northern city of Tianjin to touch drivers  for $1 contributions.  </P></p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: German rivals would see ICI demerger argument as spurious Sir, Before we are carried away on the wings of City euphoria in the wake of the ICI announcement ('ICI sets out radical plan to split its operations', July 31), it may be instructive to compare ICI with the international chemical industry's pace-setters, Hoechst, Bayer and BASF. For them, the argument - used by Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's chairman, to justify the demerger - of having separate technologies catering for discrete, bounded product lines, is spurious. They are intent on reaping economies of scope (the diffusion of generic technologies, of management expertise and vocational skills, across broad product ranges and production processes). They also seek scale to leverage competitive advantage. There is little evidence of their diversifying into unrelated product areas; rather they penetrate the spectrum of the chemical sector, with the crucial proviso that relevant organisational capabilities and massive financial resources be seen through to successful product commercialisation. Also of prime importance to them is to build up long-term, stable and solid relationships with a range of 'stakeholders', not only Mittelstand suppliers and clients, but also unions, works councils, chambers of commerce, universities, research institutes, industry associations and public authorities. Such links are a means of reducing 'transaction costs' (to use the economic jargon) in creating and improving advantage, particularly in upgrading human capital within the firm and in diffusing technology. Hoechst, Bayer and BASF have organisational capacities and financial resources to add value across the span of the chemical sector, and they are embedded as science-based manufacturing firms in the conducive environment of Germany's social market economy. ICI's financial weakness has led it to a strategic change of direction that is heavily reliant on short-term, reductionist financial criteria. Given its current competitive problems, the decision taken may well be the least-worst option available to it for the longer term. Finally, one has to bear in mind the external constraints of this policy choice: shareholder pressure and a British home base that leaves much to be desired for technology-driven large industrial firms.

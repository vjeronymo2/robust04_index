			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Francois Mitterrand by Paul Amar </F> and Patrick Poivre d'Arvor in the Elysee Palace -- live]    [Excerpts] [Poivre d'Arvor] Good evening, Mr President.  [passage omitted] We will start with the event of the day, the  accession of Nelson Mandela to the presidency of the Republic of  South Africa. In the past five years in the Elysee you have  lived through an amazing acceleration of history; how do you  react to what happened in Pretoria today?    [Mitterrand] The events in Pretoria -- in South Africa, that  is -- are among the most important and most symbolic of the  whole history of the relations I would call -- very roughly, of  course -- colonization and decolonization. A whole group of men  and women who were used to thinking in a different way have  abandoned any idea of racism, or at least of any application of  a racist system. Apartheid was an abominable system. It took  the courage and intelligence of a lot of leaders, especially of  two of them -- the black African leader Nelson Mandela, and  Frederik de Klerk, the white man -- to make a success of  something that could scarcely be guessed at.    I am very happy to think that it was here, in the Elysee,  that Mandela and De Klerk met for the first time to dine. I had  invited both of them so as to be able to contribute to bringing  them closer together -- of course people other than me, and  especially the two of them themselves have done most of the  work. I got to know Mandela as soon as he came out of prison,  where he had stayed about 27 years. He came to see me quite  often; we often spoke on the phone. I have great esteem and  respect for de Klerk.    Today is a day of great happiness for me. We have enough  painful things. There is some hope in the Middle East, timid  and fragile to be sure, but hope nevertheless. And this success  in South Africa.    [Amar] So there is this hope for a better life, which is  like  a miracle in South Africa. Yesterday in north Africa, much  further north....    [Mitterrand, interrupting] Which comes from the strength of  will of a few men, their strength of will, the clarity of their  intelligence, and their moral courage. That is not a miracle.    [Amar] There is a danger of a return to obscurantism in  north  Africa, a danger which is costing French nationals dear. Two  French religious figures were killed on Sunday [8 May]. What  can France do, what should France do, first to protect French  nationals? Are you asking all French people living in Algeria  to return to France?    [Mitterrand] That has been done. They have been advised to  do this. We can only give advice. I think all the French  people living in Algeria have been told that we, the government  and I, want them to return to France to save their lives. If  you want clear instructions, there they are.    [Poivre d'Arvor] And in the face of the upsurge of  intolerance, a number of people are worried about a massive  influx of refugees to France. What should the country do in  such a case?    [Mitterrand] It all depends on the result of the struggle  taking place now in Algeria. It is very difficult for a French  person to say anything about it without taking extreme  psychological precautions. We have special experience of  Algeria, we were, after all, the country regarded as the  colonizer, the colonial power, let's say.    You can have different views about this. France was useful  to Algeria, but the Algerians don't like us to say so, or to  take a patronizing tone to give them advice in one direction or  another.    [Amar] May we have your view about what is happening there?  The current government wants elections -- it said so recently;  if these elections end up with a victory for the  fundamentalists, are you not worried about the arrival of an  Islamic republic very close to France?    [Mitterrand] The Algerian people will do what they want to  do. You cannot be a democrat here and question the concern of a  people somewhere else to decide their fate themselves.    Of course you can hope that they will be more enlightened  and  that the economic crisis affecting the Algerian people, as it  affects many others, will not distort their judgement, that they  won't simply react by rejecting those in government to give  their votes to others who are promising a kind of society that  -- in my view, at least -- is not a society of progress.    [Poivre d'Arvor] But we can say that 32 years after the end  of the Algerian war the country is adrift?    [Mitterrand] Adrift is a strong word. But there is a civil  war. A civil war; so this is, I hope, a provisional, though  dramatic, conclusion. The country needs to find the right  slogans, to find its basic truths. I don't myself think --  since you are asking my opinion -- that it is in fundamentalism,  religious fundamentalism; that people should have a faith, that  they practice it, that they respect it, that they want others to  know about it and to understand it, is reasonable -- but by  violence and death, no.    [Amar] Violence and death, you say, violence and death in  Bosnia. At present 11 French people, 11 aid workers of a French  humanitarian organization, Premiere Urgence, are being held by  the Serbs. In your opinion, Mr. President, are they prisoners  or hostages?    [Mitterrand] One can use whichever word one wishes. They are  prisoners and they have the value of hostages. They can be used  by those holding them as bargaining counters in exchange for  this or that political concession or military concession.    [Amar] And France does not have the means to bang its fist  on  the table.    [Mitterrand] To bang its fist on the table, what does that  mean? Does it mean for example to achieve what it is difficult  to achieve in a country one does not know well, which has many  natural defenses, which is hilly, and find these hostages or  these prisoners -- they are both of these -- and free them? If  this were to be the case, then I would not tell you: We are  going to do it, but I do not think this would be the right  action to take. We would be taking enormous risks with their  lives, and I believe that negotiation is still possible. So, as  far as banging our fist on the table is concerned, well I do not  think so, I think that negotiation must be tried first.    [Amar] This hostage-taking reveals much about the attitude  of  the Serbs. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was quite  pessimistic, speaking in the last few days, I believe it was  Sunday. If a diplomatic solution does not come about, he  suggested, we should perhaps envisage the withdrawal of the  French troops of the UN peacekeeping force.    [Mitterrand] On this matter I believe that Mr. Juppe --  naturally, we have discussed this problem together a great deal  - Mr. Juppe was speaking above all to all of the countries which  have something to say on the matter and can take some action  concerning the situation in Bosnia. In other words, the  Americans, the Russians, and all of the countries which make up  the European Union [EU]. It was for these countries that his  remarks were intended. If you do not want to launch serious  negotiations among yourselves, and reach agreement [changes  thought], there have been partial negotiations, the Europeans  have achieved a result which one might have considered to be  adequate a few months ago, but it failed. However, the Americans  were not exactly involved in these discussions, and when the  Americans became involved, then it was the Russians who were  absent. As you know, people have different interests --  traditions, old alliances, play a part -- to the extent that we  have not yet ever managed to bring together the three interested  parties which are external to the local debate, the Russians,  the Americans, and the EU, and it is for the French in  particular to hold an international conference with these three  big powers, under the aegis of the United Nations, with the  warring parties, of course.    The Russians and the Americans had agreed to discuss the  matter in a month's time, although that is already two weeks ago  now, and we, the French immediately said -- and Mr. Juppe was  our spokesman, since he is the foreign minister -- things must  move faster. I remember, I said eight days -- these eight days  have already been exceeded, and this is yet more time lost for  achieving a return to peace and sparing further victims. We,  the French, are there and we are determined to see that this  negotiation takes place, because only negotiation will succeed  in restoring the necessary concord in this country. [words  indistinct]    I had not reached that stage yet. Excuse me if I am speaking  at length, but the subject lends itself to that. If in fact our  partners -- whether American, European and even Russian --  refuse to do this, then it means that they do not wish to give  the United Nations the means to accomplish its mission, and  France has the greatest number of UN soldiers -- by far -- we  have about 10,000 men out there. So, if they really do not wish  to do that, then we will have to say that we do not accept a  situation in which we are risking the lives of our soldiers for  nothing.    [Amar] And on a larger scale, one rather has the impression  that the United Nations, NATO, and the West as a whole are  always lagging behind the pace of events to a certain extent,  and that in the end the Bosnian Serbs are going to achieve what  they wanted, in other words a real ethnic partition of the  country.    [Mitterrand] One may fear this, one cannot say that you are  wrong, but one has to see what the map of the different ethnic  groups -- Croats, Serbs, and one cannot say it is an ethnic  group, but the Muslim community -- in Bosnia looked like, to see  that the Serbs, who are above all farmers, like the Croats on  their side, have already occupied the largest part of the land  and that the Muslims were concentrated, are concentrated, in the  towns, so what people call the ethnic partition in this case  would be quite disastrous. One cannot recognize a principle of  this kind, but the real local situation is such that one has to  take into account the fact that the towns and the countryside  are not inhabited by the same groups.    [Amar] The Serbs there are generally spread beyond there.    [Mitterrand] Nor do we wish to confine ourselves to a Muslim  Bosnia in which each of the towns would be separated from its  neighbor, with territories between these towns which would be  hostile and in a state of latent war. So, the negotiators have  to divide up on the ground the regions in which the Muslim  Bosnians, the Serb Bosnians or the Croat Bosnians are in the  majority. This is what the negotiators have done, and they have  acted properly, but they have not succeeded because the consent  of the interested parties is required, and so far this has not  been obtained.    [Amar] The international community managed to stop the  invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and it was a spectacular and  successful operation. The international community at first  intervened effectively in Somalia. Why has it not managed to  halt the terrible massacres that have taken place recently in  Rwanda?    [Mitterrand] Rwanda now. The situation is not the same. I  don't want to make a speech about Iraq....    [Amar, interrupting] No, no. I am asking about Rwanda.    [Mitterrand] [passage omitted] In Iraq there was a dictator  with a strong army, in a country with a very clear structure, a  very ancient and strong country, and once it had devoured  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia would have been greatly threatened. How  would Syria have resisted, how would Jordan have resisted -- all  of them would have been dominated by Iraq. So then it would  have become a power bordering on Israel. And you can see what  sort of potentially explosive situation that would have been,  what possibilities for conflict. If this had been in the time  of the Soviet Union -- which still held solid not so long ago --  it could have meant a danger of total war. So you have to  realize that precautions were taken there in the Middle East in  the way that they were.    As for Rwanda, things are different. On a human level they  are of the same kind.    [Poivre d'Arvor] There is talk of 200,000 dead.    [Mitterrand] There is talk of 200,000 dead. If you remember,  this was a former Belgian colony, and Belgium has done a good  job, and as a European country, has kept a sort -- not of  tutelage over it, but let's rather say a sort of preferential  association with Rwanda. But since it is a francophone country,  France has constantly been called in to help. And we sent  soldiers there, both to help to protect our compatriots living  in Rwanda, and at the same time to protect Belgians and all the  European nationalities there, who asked us to -- and that is  what we did.    But we are not going to send an army to fight. It is not our  job to fight everywhere, even when horror leaps into our faces.  We don't have the means to do it, and our soldiers cannot be  the international arbiters of the passions that today are  shattering and tearing apart so many countries.    But -- let's be positive -- we are at the disposal of the  United Nations. It was the United Nations took charge of this  problem, but which, faced with the violence of the fighting and  killing of the two presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, and the  advance of the opposition movement based in neighboring Uganda  -- because of ethnic affinities -- the United Nations withdrew,  and it is not for us to replace it. That is not our role. We  are at its disposal. We are willing to be good soldiers of  peace for the United Nations. We have to be asked; it has to be  organized; there have to be others with us.    [Amar] Mr. President, we can see, through this rapid review  of the world situation, as this interview will last only one  hour, that disorder is still prevailing, there is still fear and  threats. At the moment when this fear and disorder still exist,  you said a few days ago that France will not resume nuclear  testing, neither today nor tomorrow?    [Mitterrand] No, wait, let's be precise so things are very  clear. In my speech the other day on France's nuclear defense  and nuclear deterrence, I announced a decision. This was my  decision and it was about stopping nuclear tests. I took this  decision and I informed Mr. Bush, who was President of the  United States then, Mr. Major who was already prime minister of  Britain, and Mr. Yeltsin who is the head of state of Russia.  They said yes to me, we will stop, we will accept what is a  so-called moratorium, that is, we will not carry out nuclear  tests during a certain period of time. At the end of this  period, Mr. Clinton wrote to me saying he would like us to  extend the moratorium, that is extend the period during which no  nuclear tests are carried out. I said yes immediately, of  course, because this was in accordance with my position. A  second request has recently been made by Mr. Clinton, which is a  good idea, and we are slowly heading toward the cessation of  nuclear tests.    [Poivre d'Arvor] And you added that nobody would do it after  me.    [Mitterrand] That is why I said let's be precise. Stopping  nuclear tests is a decision, it was mine and one of my  prerogatives, thus it will be implemented as long as I am here  except when it might be modified because one of our partners has  gone back on his word and resumed nuclear testing, which would  undermine our nuclear deterrence. But on the other hand, when I  added, and I was not joking because it was not a laughing  matter, with somehow a personal manner, perhaps even with humor,  considering the protests that greeted my decision [sentence as  heard]. There are some people who want us to carry on with  nuclear testing even when there is no need for it. I said to  them this is just an expectation; first there was a decision,  now this is an expectation. I was addressing -- I don't know  who -- my successors perhaps.    [Poivre d'Arvor] With those 800 guests, you did not seem to  be joking, on the contrary, you seemed quite firm?    [Mitterrand] No, I said it was an expectation. I said: You  will not do it because this [issue] will involve so many  political and diplomatic issues, security considerations and the  fact that at the same time other nations, except the five  nuclear powers, are prevented from possessing nuclear weapons.  We say we don't want nuclear proliferation and at the same time  we do the contrary. This discourse is hard to sustain. I think  it is a good thing for all the people of the world if these  nuclear tests, that is these pollution-prone explosions, do not  multiply.    [Amar] Mr. President, Edouard Balladur, the prime minister,  expressed an opinion different from your own this morning.  Francois Leotard said: These nuclear tests are necessary for  technical reasons. Alain Juppe said: It is a major point of  disagreement between the president of the republic and us. Can  this major point of disagreement, to quote him, damage  cohabitation until 1995?    [Mitterrand] It is a major point of disagreement. I informed  the prime minister, the defense minister, the foreign minister,  of my decision. I said: There will be no more nuclear testing  as long as I am president. Naturally, the day when I am no  longer there, those who succeed me will be completely free and  this decision will be entirely theirs. I would add as a  prediction, hypothesis, diagnostic, that I would be very  surprised if they were to do this, because the conditions are  difficult [as heard]. Very good. So, Mr. Balladur said  something which is quite true -- we have a disagreement, but in  this case it is the president who takes the decision. Well, I  acted in accordance with my rights.    [Poivre d'Arvor] Right, we are going to talk about Europe  now.    [Amar] Just a quick word on the subject of defense, because  it is important. You said something else. You said that if on  the occasion of the debate in parliament on the military  programming law an amendment is introduced by the deputies  concerning the possible use of nuclear force....    [Mitterrand, interrupting] Amendments, yes.    [Amar] Or amendments, concerning the possible use of nuclear  force outside the country to settle a conflict abroad, you would  appeal to the people, in what way would you do this?    [Mitterrand] Because the decision is that of the president  of  the republic. Use of the atomic bomb, the atomic weapon first  and foremost, is intended so that there will no war [as heard].  It is a deterrent weapon aimed at ensuring that war does not  happen -- not to win it, because if one has a real force, as in  France's case, one inspires so much fear, as a result of the  destructive capacity of the nuclear bomb, that no one will make  war on us. That is the doctrine and it absolutely must be  preserved, but once one has said that, one has to be logical  with oneself, it does not mean that one must stockpile weapons,  make nuclear weapons, when one does not need more, or act in  such a way that all the other countries rush to outdo one  another and the world ends up going up in flames.    [Amar] Does making an appeal to the people mean a referendum  on this matter?    [Mitterrand] This means that on such a serious matter, which  I have attempted to define as quickly as I can, if parliament or  the government were involved in a serious disagreement with me,  yes, I would ask the people to settle the matter. [passage  omitted]    [Amar] There is a European country which has just changed  its  leaders, namely Italy. Silvio Berlusconi is the new prime  minister.    [Mitterrand] So I'm told.    [Amar] If neofascist ministers are appointed in his  government, how will you react?    [Mitterrand] I think -- this is an embarrassing question,  because the problem is embarrassing, but I think that the first  right to be respected is that of a democratic people, a  democratic regime -- which is the case in Italy. It is important  to maintain the sovereignty of this people. It has given many  votes to the neofascist party, which will probably be -- which  may already be --represented in Mr. Berlusconi's government.    [Poivre d'Arvor] This is happening right now because the  prime minister is submitting his list to the president.    [Mitterrand] Personally, I am not happy about it, but I  acknowledge the Italians' right to choose, all the more so  because the neofascist party does not have a majority and I  don't think that this party can determine Italian politics.  However, it will play a role, it is a pity. We must educate,  advise, speak to the Italians in a friendly way. I believe that  it would not make sense to say to them: We forbid. This is my  feeling. Of course, if this party made enough progress to have  a majority or to control Italian politics from afar, there would  undoubtedly be some problems.    [Poivre d'Arvor] You would not mind meeting some of these  ministers, would you?    [Mitterrand] Would I not mind? I do not feel at all [changes  thought], we will see, I would be surprised if Mr. Berlusconi  was ill-advised enough to appoint a neofascist as the foreign  minister, for instance. I would be really surprised. If he  did, he would make a major mistake, but, well, I would only meet  the prime minister, namely Mr. Berlusconi....    [Poivre d'Arvor, interrupting] For whom you do not feel any  special repulsion, do you?    [Mitterand] I do not feel any repulsion. I feel neither  attraction nor repulsion. Now that he is the prime minister of  a friendly country, I will be very reserved in my remarks.  However, as far as the foreign minister is concerned, it is  essential that he should be a convinced democrat since he will  have to build the Europe created by the Maastricht Treaty with  us. [passage omitted]    [Amar] How long do you think your successor should be at the  Elysee, five years? Seven years? A two five-year term or a two  seven-year term? I ask the question because Valery Giscard  d'Estaing has relaunched the idea of a five-year presidential  term. What is your opinion?    [Mitterrand] Mr. Giscard d'Estaing is in favor of a  five-year  presidential term. He succeeded Mr. Pompidou who initiated a  constitutional reform bill passed by the parliament. All that  was necessary was to submit the issue to referendum but Mr.  Giscard d'Estaing did not do it.    [Poivre d'Arvor] But you could have done it yourself?    [Mitterrand] Yes, I could have, yes I could have! I was not  in favor of the five-year presidential term. Two years before  the presidential elections of 1981, I was in favor of a system  that seemed better to me but which I find difficult to defend  today. I tell you this in confidence: I was in favor of a  single seven-year presidential term. I feel embarrassed today.  If my successor would like to do it, I think he would be right  ro do so.

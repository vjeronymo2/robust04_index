			<p>BFN     [Text] Rengo [the Japanese Trade Union Confederation  headed by Akira Yamagishi] held a Central Committee session in  Fukuoka city on 2 June. In the session, the Central Committee  discussed ways to reform the current tax system and adopted a  platform supporting the future raise of the indirect tax rate to  secure financial resources for social welfare security in a  society of senior citizens. With regard to Rengo's response to  the future realignment of political parties, the Central  Committee decided to create "a Rengo politics and policy forum"  in July that will become a key body to rally liberal political  forces, including the opposition Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] and the ruling Democratic Socialist Party [DSP].  The Central Committee also approved a package of plans for the  spring labor offensive and the study of the possibility of Rengo  discontinuing the traditional demand for uniform wage increases.    With regard to reforming the current tax system, the Central  Committee adopted a "basic guideline for reforming the current  tax system" and set the ceiling of the people's tax burden rate  at 50 percent. During the session, the Central Committee called  on the government to increase public spending for basic pensions  and medical treatment of the aged and emphasized that "Rengo  would pay attention to how the indirect tax will be handled."  Several attendees argued against raising the indirect tax,  saying: "Our support for raising the indirect tax rate may be  interpreted as our approval of consumption tax hikes," but their  argument was overridden by the Rengo leadership. Explaining how  Rengo plans to promote the reform of the current tax system, the  Rengo leadership said Rengo would propose that: 1) unfair  taxation be addressed; 2) a comprehensive taxation and a  taxpayer numbering system be introduced; 3) the consumption tax  be revamped so as to abolish profit tax [ekizei] and shift to  invoices [shiokurijo]; and 4) the retrogressive tax be eased.  The Rengo leadership was not specific about how it will promote  the reform of the current tax system.    The platform did not clearly indicate the shift of the  consumption tax to an earmarked tax that the SDPJ has advocated,  but only said: "The priority shall be given to spending the  budget for the social welfare." The platform accepted a  proposal from the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers'  Union for the "creation of a local consumption tax."    Rengo Central Committee decisions made during the session  will centrally affect debates of ruling parties and the SDPJ on  reforming the current tax system. The Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] is moving closer to what Rengo is advocating in connection  with the reform of the current tax system and how the LDP  responds to those decisions will draw attention.    The forum will be organized by politicians of political  parties that have supported, cooperated with, and maintained  friendly relations with Rengo, and opinion leaders and  representatives of organizations that can cooperate with Rengo.  Rengo will call on "politicians who participated in forming the  Hosokawa government to join the forum," (according to a senior  Rengo official). The forum is likely to be formed in tune with  the tripolar theory expounded by President Yamagishi, who has  described the LDP as a conservative A, and Komeito and Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] as a conservative B.</p>

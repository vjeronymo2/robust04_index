			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Peres agrees to speed PLO aid Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres and PLO head Yassir Arafat agreed yesterday on ways to speed up donations to Palestinian self-rule projects and to put the thorny issue of Jerusalem on one side for the time being, agencies report from Oslo. 'We have the peace process back on track,' Mr Bjoern Tore Godal, Norwegian foreign minister said. The agreement, signed after a concert honouring the peace breakthrough a year ago, was expected to put to rest bickering over the status of Jerusalem, even though the city is never mentioned by name in the final draft. In a 14-point document the PLO agreed to stick by the declaration of principles under which Jerusalem's status would not be discussed for two years. Palestinian negotiators in Paris last week demanded to use part of the money for health and education programmes in East Jerusalem. Israel objected, saying any issue on Jerusalem was off limits until 1996, under the peace accord. The talks then stalled.</p>

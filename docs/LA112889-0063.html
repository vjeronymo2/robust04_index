			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: ANDERSON SUITS RAMS SWIMMINGLY  </P> <P> Flipper should have been a Dolphin.  </P> <P> How many passes did Mark Clayton catch Sunday for Miami?  </P> <P> Only four? Poor baby.  </P> <P> How about Mark Duper?  </P> <P> What's that? Three! Three lousy passes?  </P> <P> Flipper caught 15.  </P> <P> Do you know how many passes the entire Miami Dolphin team completed against  Pittsburgh?  </P> <P> You got it -- 15.  </P> <P> The same number Willie (Flipper) Anderson latched onto for the Rams in Sunday's  20-17 overtime party at the expense of the where'd-he-go-now New Orleans  Saints.  </P> <P> Fifteen catches for 336 yards. No man ever got that many yards for Miami  catching passes, even with Dan Marino doing the throwing. No Dolphin on Sunday  even got 100 yards.  </P> <P> Aw, you say the Dolphins had to play in the rain? Hey, babe, that's what  Dolphins do. They play in water. They splash around real frisky-like and make  Dolphin noises like "Fa!" and "Be!" and pop up once in a while to catch fish.  So it rained a little at Miami.  </P> <P> Flipper probably would have caught 30 passes there.  </P> <P> Look what he did Sunday night at New Orleans -- indoors, yet. All but one of  Anderson's 15 catches were for 10 yards or longer. Diving, sliding, kneeling,  reeling -- he flipped, he flopped. He'd fetch 'em and catch 'em. He ran them  down like Ashley Whippet after a Frisbee. Willie went around in a circle. He  did everything but balance balls on his nose, like a seal. Flipper became the  greatest creature on land or sea since -- well, since Lynn Swann.  </P> <P> What a night it was for Willie Lee Anderson Jr., who made more catches in one  day than he did all of last season. Whatever he ate for breakfast, be sure he  eats it again.  </P> <P> As a rookie from UCLA, Flipper had 11 grabs. As a second-year man, his season  total had grown slightly, to 19 going into Sunday night's game at the Louisiana  Superdome. But Henry Ellard, who already had 61 this season, couldn't play  because of an injury.  </P> <P> Better get back out there, Henry. Remember Lou Gehrig and Wally Pipp.  </P> <P> Actually, the Rams have the luxury of being able to use Anderson and Ellard  simultaneously. Both catch passes thrown by Jim Everett, the quarterback in  John Robinson's Guys Whose Names Begin With Vowels passing attack.  </P> <P> In the huddle, here's what Everett usually calls: "Henry, you go long. Flipper,  you go longer."  </P> <P> Anderson is the deep threat, the decoy, the guy who cuts loose like Carl Lewis  and goes streaking down field, until the worn-out defensive back's tongue is  sticking out like Michael Jordan's. Willie Anderson uses more fly patterns than  a seamstress.  </P> <P> He was aware that Everett would be looking for him, with Ellard out. "But I  never dreamed of having a day like this," he said.  </P> <P> Who would? Who could?  </P> <P> Robinson called it the greatest work by a receiver in all his years of  coaching. Everett said he was still somewhat in shock. Anderson's college  coach, Terry Donahue, said he wished he had him back, and probably wondered why  -- even with Troy Aikman around -- Flipper never caught more than seven passes  in one game. Anderson's high school coach in New Jersey probably wondered why  he had made Flipper a quarterback.  </P> <P> As for the Saints, they probably wondered why they didn't use a prevent  defense. You know, like locking Flipper in the locker room to prevent him from  playing.  </P> <P> On ESPN, Joe Theismann, who knows something about quarterbacking, clued in the  TV audience as to what Everett was calling in the huddle. The sophisticated Ram  strategy for the fourth quarter, Theismann said, was: "Willie, get loose."  </P> <P> He was more than half-serious. When a guy has a day like Flipper was having,  you don't bother calling Power X Blue 83 Eagle Left anymore. You call Willie  Get Loose.  </P> <P> The whole game became "Win One for the Flipper." Teammates even asked for his  autograph afterward, saving the scorecards as souvenirs.  </P> <P> On the flight home, he and the Rams were singing. By practice Monday, Anderson  was hoarse.  </P> <P> "Everybody's been calling and saying, 'Do you know what you did? You did more  than (Jerry) Rice! You did more than Swann!' " he said.  </P> <P> And what did he get for his trouble?  </P> <P> Trouble, that's what he got. Bawled out by his coach, that's what he got. While  watching game films Monday, Ram offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese got on  Anderson's case for running poor routes.  </P> <P> "Come on," a skeptic said.  </P> <P> "I'm serious," Anderson replied. "The coaches kind of chewed me out for it. I  was supposed to push deeper up the field. Everett and I, it was like we were  playing street ball. I was just getting open and he was hitting me."  </P> <P> Hey, this guy got open like nobody's ever gotten open. Three hundred and  thirty-six yards! Know how many yards the leading Ram receiver had at the  Superdome in 1985? Try Barry Redden -- two catches, 34 yards.  </P> <P> Doesn't matter if your quarterback is Dieter Brock or Dan Marino -- 336 yards  for one receiver is a whole lotta yards.  </P> <P> Tough luck, Marino. Flipper could have been a Dolphin.  </P> <P> Miami had every chance. Willie (Flipper) Anderson was still eminently available  in 1988's college football draft when Don Shula's Dolphins made defensive end  Eric Kumerow their first-round pick. He was still available in the second  round, too, when they took Jarvis Williams, a defensive back.  </P> <P> You would think the Dolphins would do anything to get a guy whose grandmother  nicknamed him Flipper because as a baby he made crying noises that sounded like  dolphin talk.  </P> <P> It's like San Diego in last year's draft taking that guy who should have been a  Ram: Marion Butts.  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / This Week: Sport If I were Lennox Lewis, I shouldn't mind too much about losing my WBC heavyweight championship to American Oliver McCall. I should think: I am a multi-millionaire; I have kept my beauty and my brain intact; I have perhaps done as well as any man ever did out of this dangerous, destructive sport. I have simply lost a title, the currency of which is dropping faster than the pound on Black Wednesday. Boxing used to impress me more than any other sport. Before a fight I would go through agonies of vicarious fear, unable to believe that two men were about to face an unknown, possibly deadly fate. I would watch the contest in a state of complete tension, willing and dreading the moment when it would catch fire. In that moment - the sparking of fists, the flare of energies, the sudden awareness that victory and defeat had become absolute - the world blazed into life; then the moment would pass into something vicious and bloody and I would hate what I was watching. However, its fascination was still irresistible. 'I'm going to the fight,' I would say to myself and I would thrill and shudder at the thought at what may lay within those words. For the boxers of course, the sport still wields this huge and terrible power. The second round punch that caused Lennox Lewis to stagger like a drunk about the ring for about half a minute did, effectively, take away from him his future and give it to Oliver McCall. But to the spectator - or at least to me, to the taxi driver who took me to the fight, and to the man who sat there next to me half asleep - the punch has lost its power. It is now clear that when the world title split into four - the WBC, the WBA the WBO and the IBF - it was destroyed. It is hard for spectators to believe in the absolutes in victory and defeat when they know they are watching only one quarter of an absolute. And, without that belief, the dignity and significance of boxing disappears. All that is left is a pornographic excitement, a power of dollars reaching higher than Don King's hair and the print-out of a brain scan. An exposed myth, some people would no doubt say, and they are probably right. The symbol - and, to an extent, the architect - of what boxing has become is Chris Eubank. Adopting what some think of as an ironic stance (so that's what he's doing when he poses in the ring), he conceals a real lack of ability with a show of honesty. He hates what he does, he tells us. He knows that it is vicious and exploitative. He is only in it for the money. Thus he gets his blows in first, forestalling criticism of yet another lacklustre performance by telling us that he intended it to be lacklustre, that he is intelligent enough to do only what is necessary in order to win. And Chris Eubank is a tremendous draw. Crowds flock to his appalling fights. By turning himself into a pastiche of the idea of a sporting celebrity, he has become a sporting celebrity. He, and whoever invented his tremendously clever persona, has given British boxing new life even as they help to destroy it. At the Lewis-McCall fight, it even seemed to me that the crowd had become a pastiche of a boxing crowd. Hitherto, whenever I have walked into a fight arena the atmosphere has breathed out like that from a dragon; but it failed to do so yesterday morning. I realised then that the images of boxing, deprived of their dignity and significance, are tired, tired, tired. The posse of tough men, in leather overcoats and sunglasses, shuffling round the fighter as he makes his way into the ring - they looked tired. So did the shrewd-eyed promoter with a fine spray of blood and sweat upon his dinner jacket. So did the seen-it-all men with broken noses and Reggie Kray accents. So did the bejewelled women, watching near-naked gladiators as if they were models displaying the new collection from Chanel. So did Oliver McCall, spitting like a sabre-toothed tiger, thrusting his victory at the crowd with an aggression to which there was no possible response. They are all tired. It is all burlesque, and not very entertaining burlesque at that. In the minute after his knock out though, Lennox Lewis no longer seemed part of the show. He stood in the ring, amid the people who had climbed frantically through the ropes and were now wondering why they had done so. And he looked a little surprised but entirely calm. No doubt the punch had blunted his awareness, but his attitude still seemed remarkable for its self-possession. Meanwhile, McCall, strapping around himself the WBC belt that Lewis's posse had brought into the ring, looked like a thief who had hit someone round the head in order to steal their property. It seemed then as if boxing now confers the greater dignity upon the man who loses, rather than the one who wins.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / BBV ready to run Banesto: Senior managers lined up to take over main divisions BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya, Spain's largest privately owned commercial bank, was yesterday preparing to assume management control of Banco Espanol de Credito following the dismissal of the Banesto board by the Bank of Spain. Nine or 10 senior BBV executives were being considered by BBV last night to run Banesto's main divisions. Mr Alfredo Saenz, BBV vice-president, was named by the central bank on Tuesday as Banesto president in place of Mr Mario Conde. The Spanish Finance Ministry meanwhile confirmed that its insurance authority had intervened in Banesto's insurance affiliate, La Union y El Fenix, dismissing the board headed by Mr Conde, and appointing three officials to run the group. Ownership of Union y Fenix, one of the biggest insurers in Spain, was in the process of being transferred by Banesto to AGF of France, which holds 24 per cent of the Spanish company. Last night it was unclear whether the transfer would go ahead on the terms negotiated by the dismissed board. At Banesto, the new board faces a difficult task. According to estimates in Madrid, the value of the bank's assets would be reduced by about Pta 400bn (Pounds 1.9bn) if its loan and equity portfolios were revalued correctly. That figure includes an estimated Pta 80bn shortfall in the bank's pension fund. Although Banesto had raised about Dollars 775m (Pounds 520m) this year with the help of the US commercial bank JP Morgan, it had clearly not been enough to satisfy the central bank. Two weeks ago, Mr Conde was warned to come up with a solution but had been unable to find funds. The BBV is close to the government and the Bank of Spain, both of which want Banesto merged with a healthy big Spanish bank. Analysts in Madrid said they expected many of Banesto's assets - its industrial holdings, its regional banking affiliate, Banco Vitoria, and its controlling stake in Portugal's Banco Totta &amp; Acores - to be sold off, with the BBV taking the rump of the parent banking business. Absorption of Banesto would make the BBV Spain's biggest bank but it would involve trimming branches. A senior Bank of Spain official said inspectors had found that Banesto's need to provide for pensions had risen from some Pta30bn last year to nearly Pta80bn in October. He added that capital gains in Banesto's industrial corporation had been incorrectly booked. Banesto and the Bank of Spain have long been in dispute about Banesto's treatment of portfolio losses. Bank officials accused Mr Conde of taking profits or losses, whichever made Banesto's figures seem favourable. Mr Roberto Mendoza, the Morgan vice-chairman most closely associated with Banesto, was in Madrid yesterday. Morgan decided its Corsair banking fund should invest Dollars 175m in Banesto earlier this year. Banesto crisis, Page 11 Editorial Comment, Page 11 Lex, Page 12</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unfortunate if Tecs were to decide to downgrade training Sir, The disenchantment of the Training and Enterprise Councils with 'training unemployed people for jobs when there are so few jobs to go around' is understandable ('Good try but could do better', July 14). As the latest Labour Market Quarterly Report reveals, the success of their trainees in finding work is not overly encouraging. In the case of Youth Training, only 49 per cent succeed in finding work, while for Employment Training this figure is 31 per cent. Nonetheless, it would be unfortunate if merely because much training, like much education, is now an exercise in what employment secretary David Hunt describes as 'social welfare', the Tecs were to downgrade training. Naturally it is more exhilarating to be in the front line, fostering economic growth, than in the rear, patching up the casualties of economic decline. However, it would be perverse if, on discovering that training is not the 'midwife' of economic growth, the Tecs should decide that 'nursing' the victims of economic decline is not, after all, a job for the enterprising. Given such a restrictive redefinition of their function, it should not surprise the Tecs if sooner or later someone asks: what do the enterprising actually do?

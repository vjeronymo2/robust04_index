			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance plans Pounds 80m flotation this autumn INDEPENDENT INSURANCE, the general insurer, is aiming to go public in the autumn, with a stock market flotation expected to value the group at more than Pounds 80m. It will be the first general insurance company to seek a listing for at least 30 years. The group announced its plans when disclosing pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.29m (Pounds 4.29m) for the six months to June 30, struck after a Pounds 5.2m (nil) provision for a Lloyd's stop-loss policy. Operating profits increased 121 per cent to Pounds 9.49m (Pounds 4.29m). The underwriting profit came out at Pounds 2.1m (loss of Pounds 1.8m) excluding stop-loss provisions. The company had intended to float earlier this year, but postponed the move because of uncertainty over the size of losses stemming from underwriting stop loss reinsurance for Lloyd's Names, stemming from the 1989 and 1990 years. With the scale of these losses now clearer - they are not expected to exceed Pounds 15m - listing plans are back on track. It is understood that a placing and intermediaries offer could proceed by November. Lazard Brothers have been appointed financial advisers and Noble &amp; Company will be co-sponsors. James Capel have been appointed brokers to the issue. Gross written premiums increased by 56 per cent to Pounds 106.2m (Pounds 68.1m), with Independent taking advantage of increasing rates in both the personal and commercial risks markets. Mr Michael Bright, chief executive, said extra capital was necessary to 'keep solvency up' and fund further growth. The group increased its interim dividend to 7p per share (6p) and forecast a final of 9.5p making 16.5p for the year (14p).</p>

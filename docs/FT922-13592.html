			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / US ruling on pollution may cut Names' losses INSURERS have won a signif-icant victory in a US court case involving a dispute over the costs of a pollution clean-up. The ruling in New Jersey could reduce losses faced by hundreds of Names  - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the Lloyd's insurance market. The decision on Tuesday came in a case involving Diamond Shamrock, a US company which produced herbicides and other chemicals. Potential insurance claims from pollution in the US represent a heavy liability for the London insurance market in general as well as Lloyd's. Mr John Robson of the Anton members' agency said: 'This is an important case for the industry. It's a powerful decision in a state which has not always been sympathetic to insurers.' Mr Robson considers the case to be as significant as the the case brought by Shell against its insurers over pollution at the Rocky Mountain arsenal site in Colorado. A lower court ruling in 1988 favoured insurers, but an appeal has been lodged against it. Insurers expect the appeal to be heard later this year. The latest case arose when Diamond Shamrock was ordered by the US Environmental Protection Agency to clean up dioxin pollution at a number of sites where it had formerly manufactured herbicides. In 1989 the company attempted to have the cost of cleaning one of its sites, at Newark, New Jersey, paid by its insurers. At the same time it sought to recover from insurers some Pounds 23m paid to a group of Vietnam war veterans who had won compensation for disability suffered through their exposure to Agent Orange, a defoliant also made by Diamond Shamrock. The company sued more than 100 companies - which have insured it since 1951, when dioxins were first manufactured at the plant - to recover clean-up costs of several hundred million dollars. Aetna Casualty and Surety led coverage, but much of the cost would be borne by re-insurers including HS Weavers, Dominion and Turegum Insurance as well as Lloyd's underwriters. At Lloyd's, syndicate 932 led a group of syndicates whose exposure totals around Dollars 100m (Pounds 581,000). Judge Reginald Stanton of the New Jersey superior court found at trial-court level in April 1989 that the insurers had no responsibility for site clean-ups, but were liable for the Agent Orange claims. Diamond Shamrock appealed, but on Tuesday the New Jersey appeals court found that insurers were liable neither for cleaning up the site nor for the Agent Orange claims.</p>

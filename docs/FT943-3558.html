			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Lack of attention to customers' says Tesco The UK potato industry pays too little attention to its customers, Tesco, the supermarket group, said yesterday. Mr Andrew Batty, Tesco's fresh produce trading manager, told the World Potato Congress in Harrogate, Yorkshire, that consumers wanted quality, value and reassurance that the food they bought was health-giving and produced with the minimum of chemicals. They were also spoilt for choice. Yet he said: 'One of the things that continues to amaze me about our industry is how much emphasis we put on the growing side of the business and how little we put into understanding what the customer wants.' Mr Batty told the Congress, attended by delegates from about 50 countries, that the supply chain had to become more efficient if growers, processors and supermarkets were to make enough money to survive and re-invest. Tesco has just commissioned research from Adas, the government's farm advisory service, into the feasibility of supply contracts between the group and growers. Mr Batty acknowledged that growers faced an uncertain future with the abolition of the statutory Potato Marketing Board in 1997. 'In periods of uncertainty it's always best to concentrate on what one does best. It is up to us to get on with the business of selling potatoes, as a team clearly focused on providing what the customer wants.'</p>

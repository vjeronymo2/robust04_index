			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F> Sir David Frost; from the "Breakfast with Frost" program on 24  April; Frost in studio, Butrus-Ghali in New York -- recorded]    [Text] [Frost] Earlier I spoke with the United Nations  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and I began by asking him  whether the UN would authorize air strikes if the Serbs met some  but not all of NATO's conditions.    [Butrus-Ghali] This is a very technical question, I perceive  that this had to be negotiated by the people who are on the  ground. If they see that the violation is a real violation then  we will use the air strikes without hesitation.    [Frost] If there is no response to the ultimatum, how does  the coordination work. Can NATO then on the basis of your  letter, and so on, can they just go ahead with air strikes, or  do they have to get your approval?    [Butrus-Ghali] They have to get the approval of my special  representative who is on the ground, because we have troops in a  United Nations forces on the ground, and we must protect them.  So the special representative in coordination or collaboration  with the command of United Nations on the ground will decide  where and when they have to use the air support.    [Frost] They will decide that?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. In other words you need the agreement of  the two parties -- the NATO and the United Nations.    [Frost] Then what about when it comes, Mr. Secretary  General,  to the actual targets, do they have to be specifically agreed.  I mean if one side wants to attack only encampments....    [Butrus-Ghali] ...do you see, there is a perfect  coordination  between the military people of the NATO and the military people  of the United Nations, they will coordinate and they will chose  together what are the targets which ought to be bombed by the  NATO air power.    [Frost] And what about when it comes time to stop. If either  one, if either the UN or NATO want to stop, then the bombing  stops?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, supposing that the United Nations say  for  the time being it will represent a danger for our soldiers or we  are negotiating and let us postpone this air strike. They will  coordinate with the NATO, and the NATO will postpone.    [Frost] Do you think secretary general, that in fact these  air strikes could -- we've seen indications of this -- could  these air strikes endanger in fact, either UN personnel or UN  peacekeeping forces?    [Butrus-Ghali] This is why we are coordinating and this is  why we are insisting to obtain the agreement of the UN. This is  the reason that we want to offer the maximum of protection to  our United Nations staff, to our personnel working in the  humanitarian assistance, and to the peacekeeping forces.    [Frost] There hasn't been progress in Bosnia, and of course  the blame has been attached to the UN. Has it been a major blow  to the UN the fact that there's been no progress?    [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly it is a blow to the image of the  UN, but the expert who knows the reality knows quite well that  the responsibility is shared between the UN and the major member  states. The UN have no army, no money, so unless the member  states will be ready to sustain the decision which had been  adopted by the UN, i.e. by the member states, we will not be  able to execute the different resolutions that have been  adopted. So there is a very special relation between the UN and  the member states.    [Frost] And in fact you're disappointed really at the number  of troops made available?    [Butrus-Ghali] This is another aspect -- we have, since June  last year, been trying to obtain additional troops, and we have  obtained a resolution from the Security Council, but we have not  been able to obtain those additional troops. Because the air  strikes have a value of dissuasion to reinforce the bargaining  position of my mediators, but practically unless we have ground  forces, our forces on the ground, it will be quite difficult to  obtain a military result with air power only.    [Frost] So you were disappointed I presume, that when Friday  [22 April], President Clinton reaffirmed that his troops would  only be available after a peace. You need troops before a peace.    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes I need troops before peace, but I was not  disappointed, because I know quite well what are the positions  of the United States, and the position of many other major  members of the international community, who are ready to help  the United Nations in different other activities, but not in  participating in peacekeeping operations.    [Frost] In terms of the situation though, this action and  the  fact that you asked for this action at the beginning of the  week, I suppose means that you've decided that as of now the  Bosnian Serbs -- the target of these air strikes -- are the  aggressors?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. The Bosnians are the aggressors, but you  see you may have aggressors from the other side too. So the air  strike will punish all those who are not respecting the  resolutions adopted by the United Nations, or the last  resolution which was adopted the NATO.    [Frost] And Mr. Akashi made a reference a few days ago to  there being certain circumstances in which the UN might pull out  of Bosnia. Are there any circumstances in which you might pull  out of Bosnia?    [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly I will not advocate this. But this  decision, if it will have to be taken, has to be taken by the  Security Council. Because the troops are there according to a  decision which was taken by the Security Council. If we want to  pull out the troops, to diminish the number of the troops, this  is a decision that will have to be taken by the Security  Council. I'm in favor to maintain our presence, to continue to  work on the ground until we will find a solution to this problem.    [Frost] Tell me something secretary general, looking back  over the last two years or so, can you perceive from your unique  position, was there somewhere where the international community,  the nations of the world, the tactics went wrong?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes I believe that what is important [is]  that  during the last two years, that the member states still have not  decided if they want to reinforce the United Nations or not.  The member states have not decided if they want to give a role  to the United Nations in peacekeeping operations, in solving  international disputes, in reinforcing international  cooperation. There is still [the fact that] the United Nations  as such is not a priority for the majority of the member states.  They have their bilateral diplomacy, they have their own  defense, and the United Nations is an important instrument but  it is still a marginal instrument. And this is one of the  explanations why, during the last two years, we have not been  able to cope with all the problems, because we have received  demands every day from the 1,600 observers who are working now  in South Africa, to control the elections, to the negotiations  that are going on in Salvador, or in Guatemala, to the situation  in Kigali, or in Bujumbura or in Mozambique, or in Angola....    [Frost] So are you saying you think that while it's clear  that the UN can succeed at peacekeeping, that in fact  peacemaking is getting too difficult a task?    [Butrus-Ghali] I will say that UN can succeed in  peacekeeping  and UN can even succeed in peacemaking or even in peace  enforcement, on condition that we receive the necessary support  from the member states. There are certain elements where  certainly we failed, like what happened in Goradze is a failure  for the United Nations, I will even say more, it is a  humiliation for the United Nations, but this is one setback.  You must see the other element of the other situation where we  have been successful -- in Cambodia, in Salvador.    [Frost] Do you think there's any hope that the safe havens,  so-called, will become safe in the future or will the phrase  safe haven seem like a bitter joke?    [Butrus-Ghali] No the safe haven is just a step toward the  comprehensive solution of the problem of former Yugoslavia. The  safe haven must be considered as just a step. We need to  continue to negotiate, we need a global approach so that we will  reach a comprehensive peace and a comprehensive just and lasting  peace in former Yugoslavia. We must continue to negotiate, we  must continue the dialogue until we find a peaceful solution.  And until we move to a second step -- we have already appointed  a coordinator in Sarajevo for the reconstruction, because this  is the first step, once we agree then we have to build the  peace, we have to do the reconstruction, the rehabilitation, the  return of millions of refugees.</p>

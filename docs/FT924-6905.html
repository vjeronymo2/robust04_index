			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Last-minute push to win US-EC pact US AND EC trade negotiators last night were set for a determined attempt in Washington to settle a long-standing row over European oilseeds subsidies. Twelve trade and farm negotiators from both sides planned to meet for two hours immediately after EC officials flew in to Washington. Talks are to resume this morning with EC negotiators planning to return to Brussels tonight to report back tomorrow to member states. EC trade commissioner Frans Andriessen said last night he believed the parties could quickly resolve the dispute. He told reporters on arrival: 'We do believe we can make it.' But Paris yesterday denounced the Gatt deal Brussels is likely to conclude on agriculture with the US, but did not spell out exactly how it will react. After an inner cabinet meeting, the French government said the conditions for a global and balanced Gatt accord did not exist, recalling France's opposition to any curbs on farm output going beyond last May's EC reforms. An official said the French parliament would probably debate the issue next week. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy urged French politicians to unite to defend French farmers' interests. At the same time, France yesterday claimed backing from EC member states in its effort to limit farm trade concessions in the Community's negotiations with the US today in Washington. A majority of the 12 insist on a 'balanced' agreement with the US, so that any farm trade deal must be compatible with the EC's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), French officials in the Council of Ministers say. More significant, they add, is that Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium and Ireland support France's demand that any agreement to cut subsidised food exports should be less onerous to EC farmers than the deal thought likely to emerge in Washington tonight. The Washington talks, between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, are aimed at settling the EC-US row over oilseeds and clearing the way for world trade liberalisation through the Uruguay Round. They follow the breakdown of negotiations in Chicago on November 3, after which the US imposed Dollars 300m (Pounds 198m) punitive tariffs on EC food exports, effective December 5, threatening the prospect of a full-blown trade war. The French account of Monday night's meeting of EC farm ministers in Brussels is at odds with the conclusions drawn by the current UK presidency of the EC, and the European Commission. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's agriculture minister, accused the Commission and Mr John Gummer, his UK counterpart, of 'political manipulation'. Monday's Council meeting was for ministers only, magnifying the opportunity to present one-sided accounts of what transpired. The propaganda war inside the EC has heated up as conviction has grown on all sides that a deal is close. Mr Soisson produced a paper containing almost the same statistics as at Monday's Council, but all accounts agree he failed to impress his colleagues. France seems to be trying to make it hard for Mr MacSharry to get EC endorsement of any deal, but almost certainly with a view to extracting more concessions for French and EC farmers. A Commission meeting has been set for Friday night, to examine any Washington package. But the 12 have still to decide if some combination of foreign, trade and farm ministers will have final approval. If a breakthrough occurs on oilseeds, negotiators hope to agree a framework for wider reform of Europe's farm subsidies regime. Talks would then shift immediately to Geneva, where all the 108 countries involved in the Uruguay Round could 'multilateralise' the US-EC pact and negotiate long-delayed international trade reforms embracing services, investment, tariff cuts, textiles and improved protection for intellectual property. Failure to reach agreement today would pave the way for US imposition on December 5 of 200 percent tariffs on Dollars 300m worth of EC white wines, rapeseed oil and wheat gluten. An additional Dollars 700m in punitive tariffs could be levied on EC farm and industrial products if no settlement is reached.</p>

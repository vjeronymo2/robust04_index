			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> RIFT REPORTEDLY LED TO PETERS' DEPARTURE  </P> <P> A rift between the Huntington Beach City School District board and Supt. Diana  Peters contributed to her resignation announced this week, according to  district records released Friday.  </P> <P> A nine-page resignation agreement, worked out during six closed-door sessions,  states that there was a "controversy between the board and Dr. Peters over her  employment relationship" that would likely result in legal disputes.  </P> <P> Neither Peters nor district officials would discuss the exact reasons for her  departure, however.  </P> <P> The agreement calls for the district to pay Peters $126,952 in exchange for her  promise not to sue the district for dismissing her before the end of her  contract, which expires in June, 1993. Peters' resignation will be effective  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Since Peters' departure was announced Wednesday, officials have remained  tight-lipped about the matter because the resignation agreement includes a gag  order forbidding board members and Peters from publicly discussing the issue.  </P> <P> "Board members . . . and Dr. Peters shall not make any disparaging or  derogatory remarks, comments or statements regarding each other," the terms  state. And, both sides "agree to report publicly that this agreement is an  amicable resolution of philosophical differences between Dr. Peters and the  board."  </P> <P> District officials have said only that differences developed between Peters and  the board just a year after it gave her a glowing review and extended her  contract. She has been superintendent for four years.  </P> <P> The document lends support to many teachers' and parents' claims that the board  requested Peters' resignation under pressure from the teachers' union. Leaders  of the Huntington Beach Elementary Teachers Assn. blame Peters for labor  tensions that have deepened in recent years.  </P> <P> During 1989-90 contract talks that were stalled for nearly a year, teachers  frequently berated Peters and trustees at board meetings. Union leaders said  they had been planning a campaign to oust three board members scheduled to face  reelection Nov. 6 if they continued to support Peters.  </P> <P> Trustees and Peters have refused to comment on what role the union might have  played in her resignation.  </P> <P> The payment to Peters is not related to salary compensation, the agreement  says. It represents the amount of the remainder of her contract.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the district is scheduled to deliver the full payment to  the outgoing superintendent by Aug. 15. A 10% annual interest charge would be  tacked on to any amount that remains unpaid at that date.  </P> <P> Peters praised the district after her resignation and talked only about "the  many positive things" she believes occurred in the district during her tenure.  </P> <P> As for her future plans, Peters, 44, said this week that "I'll be open to  everything," although she hopes to continue living in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "I'm going to take my time and be very open about my possibilities," she said.  "Of course, it helps having an agreement that takes care of me financially for  awhile." JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Rabobank to pay ADollars 102m for rural bank in Australia Rabobank, the large Netherlands-based co-operative banking group which specialises in the food and agri-business sector, is to buy the Primary Industry Bank of Australia for ADollars 102m (USDollars 75.5m). PIBA, which is being sold by the state-owned Bank of Western Australia (BankWest) as a prelude to privatisation next year, is a significant lender to the country's rural sector. Its assets at the end of March were ADollars 1.83bn, and its main focus recently has been the provision of rural mortgage loans. It has operations in Australia and New Zealand. In spite of the difficulties experienced by farmers in the 1990s, PIBA has been consistently profitable, with after-tax operating profit in the year ended September 1993 amounting to ADollars 11.4m. In the six months to the end of March it made ADollars 9.22m. Yesterday, Rabobank said the acquisition formed part of its strategy of building up operations in the Asian region. The Dutch organisation, whose 1993 assets stood at about Fl 253bn (Dollars 145.4bn), has offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, and expects to add a presence in Thailand and Malaysia. It also plans to open an office in Shanghai in a few weeks. Rabobank said it had 'a special interest in Australia'. It sees the country as a low-cost agricultural producer and a potential beneficiary of the Uruguay Round in the Gatt trade negotiations, which will generally lower trade restrictions. BankWest, which bought PIBA in 1987 when it was a much smaller organisation, said the proceeds from the sale would be used to bolster its capital position ahead of privatisation. It said it 'made strategic sense for PIBA to be owned by a specialist agricultural bank with the capacity to sustain the levels of wholesale funding required for future growth'. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based rating agency, immediately lifted its credit rating for PIBA's long-term debt to AA+ from A, and the short-term rating to A1+ from A1.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DOLPHIN WON'T BE TRADED TO NAVY  </P> <P> Yielding to pressure from animal rights activists, the New England Aquarium on  Monday dropped plans to trade an aggressive dolphin to the Navy's dolphin  training program in San Diego.  </P> <P> The move settled a federal lawsuit filed last month by Citizens to End Animal  Suffering and Exploitation.  </P> <P> The group, which sought to block the trade, claims the Navy trains dolphins for  hazardous duty.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the aquarium arranged to trade Rainbow, an 11-year-old,  450-pound male, to the Naval Oceans Systems Research Center in San Diego for a  partly deaf female dolphin.  </P> <P> The Navy center said it trains and studies marine mammals in underwater  surveillance and other activities.  </P> <P> The aquarium decided to resolve the dispute by agreeing with the Navy to end  the deal, aquarium director John Prescott said.  </P> <P> "We agreed publicly to take a second look at alternative facilities, and we've  done so in good faith," Prescott said.  </P> <P> The aquarium wanted to find a new home for Rainbow because he had become  incompatible with its other show dolphins.  </P> <P> As part of the settlement, the aquarium also asked the U.S.Department of  Commerce to speed up the process regulating transfer of marine mammals between  licensed facilities.  </P></p>

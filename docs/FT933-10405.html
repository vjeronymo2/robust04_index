			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals shares dip - Indication of sizeable profits rise issued to dampen speculation YORKSHIRE Chemicals yesterday indicated that it was expecting a profits increase of at least 20 per cent this year, in an effort to dampen speculation over European trading which had sliced 5 per cent off its share price by mid-morning. Mr Phillip Lowe, chairman, said the fall in the share price - which finally closed 16p lower at 339p - following his comments over the severity of the European downturn had been unjustified upon close examination of the interim results published yesterday. 'The statement, read in totality, should not be regarded as pessimistic . . . realistic, yes, but not pessimistic,' Mr Lowe said. He said the UK group, which derives more than 90 per cent of its sales from abroad, had come through the worst of the European recession: 'We think we are through the bottom.' As a result, he said, 'I would be disappointed if we didn't advance pre-tax profit by 20 per cent for the year as a whole'. The group announced a 17 per cent improvement in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 6m, largely due to the effects of a weaker pound. Sales for the six months to June 30 were ahead 15 per cent at Pounds 55.6m. Stripping out exchange rate movements, pre-tax profits were marginally ahead at Pounds 5.4m on sales down Pounds 400,000 at Pounds 50.5m. Mr Lowe said the group had suffered a particularly difficult first quarter, when price cutting of up to 26 per cent had seriously depressed margins in the textile dyes business. However, prices had stabilised by the second quarter, and the trend was expected to continue in the second half. Yorkshire had achieved 'prodigious growth' in both Australia and the US, Mr Lowe said, while sales in the UK increased as the group penetrated new markets. The group expected further growth in 1994, as the five-year Pounds 42m capital expenditure programme launched in 1991 begins to feed through. So far this year Yorkshire had spent Pounds 5.8m on increasing capacity, 15 more cent more than last year. Earnings per share, restated to reflect the Pounds 24m rights issue in March, rose by 8 per cent to 9.8p. The interim dividend is increased to 2.6p (2.5p). COMMENT The lemming-like race away from Yorkshire which pushed the share price over the edge may have been slightly exaggerated. Few can find fault with the management or the investment programme, which promises to increase capacity significantly by 1994. The real problem appears to lie both in the short-term and in the sector as a whole, which shows no sign of recovery in the latter half of the year. Yorkshire's warning merely reinforced comments made by its colleagues earlier this year. Forecasts are for a near-30 per cent rise in profits this year to Pounds 13m, albeit on the back of currency gains. The rather demanding prospective p/e of 18 falls to a slightly more reasonable multiple of 15 next year on profits of Pounds 14.5m.</p>

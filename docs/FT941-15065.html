			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Earthquake causes heavy damage in Los Angeles A severe earthquake in Los Angeles yesterday left at least 10 people dead and caused widespread damage and disruption to transport and communications. The quake, which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale, caused about 100 fires in and around the city as gas pipes ruptured. In Sylmar in the San Fernando valley, where an estimated 70 homes were destroyed, aerial television photographs showed whole streets in flames. In San Fernando suburb, dozens of cars lining the streets exploded from the intense heat of gas fires. At least a half dozen vehicles were burning on one street. Reports said that 50 buildings in Hollywood were also destroyed and the quake caused many houses - including several million-dollar homes - to slide off their foundations. Many buildings were seriously damaged, including two hospitals, which have been closed. Other hospitals said they were 'inundated with walking wounded'. In the suburban town of Northridge, the epicentre of the quake north-west of central Los Angeles, emergency workers struggled to free residents of a three-storey apartment complex that partly collapsed. The multi-storey park at the town's shopping centre collapsed and people were feared trapped inside. The earthquake struck at 4.31am Pacific Standard Time, according to the US Geological Service. Had it struck two hours later, in the rush hour, fatalities would probably have been much higher, officials said. Yesterday's Martin Luther King holiday also meant that many businesses planned to stay closed, reducing traffic. Nonetheless the death toll was expected to increase through the day as rescue workers searched collapsed buildings. Several raised freeways to the north and west of the city collapsed. The Santa Monica freeway, the busiest in the US, carrying more than 370,000 vehicles daily, was severely damaged in several places. Most of the main arteries to and through the San Fernando Valley, a suburban expanse of about 3m residents, were badly damaged. Police said the quake threw cars from elevated freeways on to streets below. The stark pictures of the pancaked roadways in Los Angeles are reminiscent of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, and in which more than 50 people died. Repairs and reinforcements to the San Francisco freeway system are still in progress, four years later, and are not expected to be completed for at least another two years. Los Angeles, the US's second-biggest city, faces serious traffic problems for years ahead, structural engineers predicted. The city's airports, which were closed in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, reopened by mid morning and United Airlines announced that it was resuming service to the city. However, delays were exacerbated by numerous aftershocks, including two measuring over 5 on the Richter scale. Telephone services to the entire Los Angeles area were limited to emergency services. Officials called on residents to stay off the roads, warning of severe danger. Most of Los Angeles was without electricity and there were power cuts throughout California. Mr Richard Riordan, the city's mayor, declared a local emergency an hour after the earthquake, freeing local emergency services to respond without regard for costs. President Bill Clinton and California governor Pete Wilson also offered emergency support to the city.</p>

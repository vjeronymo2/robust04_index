			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks branch out Asahi Bank and Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking have established wholly-owned securities subsidiaries, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Asahi Securities will be capitalised at Y35bn and Yasuda Trust Securities at Y20bn, the two banks said. Japan's financial reforms enable banks and brokerages to engage in each other's businesses. Five banks have established such divisions in the past year. Several more are expected to follow suit in the next 12 months. Philippine National Bank plans to raise its authorised capital by 150 per cent to consolidate its position as the country's biggest commercial bank, agencies report. The state-controlled bank is to lift authorised capital to 25bn pesos from 10bn pesos.</p>

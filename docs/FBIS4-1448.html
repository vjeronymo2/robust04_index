			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claasen] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] has decided not to extend South  Africa's first democratic election beyond Thursday. This was  announced by IEC spokesman Humphrey Khoza at a Gallagher Estate,  Midrand news conference on Thursday [28 April] morning.    He added that the situation on the ground would nevertheless  be watched closely and that the decision would be continually  re- evaluated. "On the basis of the situation on the ground we  have no reason to think that voting will continue tomorrow," he  said.    He had been informed on Thursday morning that the IEC was  satisfied with the progress of the poll -- and that the  extension of voting days was not considered necessary. When  pressed on the possibility of an extension, he replied that as  matters stood at present, he foresaw no such possibility.</p>

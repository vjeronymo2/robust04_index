			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Brent to slash council tax The Conservative-controlled north London borough of Brent has said that it will cut its council tax next year, in spite of a likely average nationwide increase of 7 per cent. Band D households will pay Pounds 497, exactly Pounds 100 less than last year's bill. The council said it had been able to make the reduction because the cut in its estimated standard spending had been less than expected, while generous 'buffering' grants had limited the total fall in grant to 2 per cent. The administration, in a borough which is regarded as marginal for next year's council elections, attributed the generous settlement to successful lobbying.</p>

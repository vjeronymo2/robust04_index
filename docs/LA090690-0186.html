			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> 1,000 HOMES TO TEST CURBSIDE RECYCLING  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously this week to begin a six-month experimental  recycling program at about 1,000 homes.  </P> <P> The $2,480 monthly cost will be shared by every home and business in the city.  </P> <P> A staff report on that cost-sharing plan will be presented to the City Council  on Sept. 18, Assistant City Manager George Scarborough said. A public hearing  will be held at that time.  </P> <P> The curbside recycling program, which is also being tested in San Clemente and  Dana Point, is San Juan Capistrano's first attempt to comply with Assembly Bill  939, which contains specific guidelines to reduce the amount of waste headed  for landfills. The bill requires all cities and counties to adopt a recycling  plan to reduce their solid waste by 25% in 1995 and 50% by the year 2000.  </P> <P> The 1,000 homes to be served in the experimental phase include the areas of  Harbor Lane Homes and Troy Homes. The program is expected to begin Oct. 3.  </P> <P> The recyclable materials will be collected and then marketed by Solag Disposal  Inc., which holds the refuse contracts for all three cities. Solag Disposal  will collect the materials on the same day the existing trash pickup is  scheduled.  </P> <P> Materials to be collected in three bins include newspaper, glass containers,  metal cans and plastics. Under the terms of the contract, Solag Disposal will  provide its customers with the bins, Scarborough said.  </P> <P> At the end of six months, the city will reassess the program and decide whether  to continue, Scarborough said.

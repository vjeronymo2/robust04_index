			<p>BFN     [Text] This is a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  of Ukraine.    On 13 April Ostankino TV carried information to the effect  that an agreement on solving the Black Sea Fleet issues on the  basis of the Massandra protocol was allegedly reached during the  negotiations in Kiev. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  reports that this does not comply with reality. Ukraine  proceeds from the necessity of a comprehensive approach toward  the Black Sea Fleet issue, with regard to the provisions of the  Dagomys, Yalta, and Zavidovo agreements, as well as the  Massandra protocol.    Besides, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine points  out that the Ostankino report about the visit by the  representatives of the Russian Government to Odessa also fails  to correspond to reality. Contrary to the agreements reached in  Kiev, Russian Navy Commander in Chief Feliks Gromov undermined  the meeting with the command and the officers' personnel of the  Black Sea Fleet to be held jointly with the Ukrainian side. Such  reports and actions, underlines the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  show who is really standing in the way of a just solution to the  Black Sea Fleet issue.</p>

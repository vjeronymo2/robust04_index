FNN chief David Meister told reporters in New York that after looking at the  newcomer's work for several weeks, he feels that "CNBC is really not trying to  compete with us." He also said FNN's research shows that CNBC is in only about  5.3 million homes, not the 13 million homes it claims. NBC's response: "We  stand by our (subscriber) figures and are confident they will grow." Claudia  Puig  </P></p>

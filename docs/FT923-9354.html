			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Bankers attack Italy's rate cut MR Giovanni Goria, Italy's finance minister, yesterday sounded a cautious note on further interest rate cuts following Monday night's decision by the Bank of Italy to lower key rates by half a percentage point. He said: 'I think that the governor of the Bank of Italy has opted for small steps rather than one isolated big step and that is why the markets are waiting in this period.' Mr Goria's comments follow criticisms by some bankers that the Bank of Italy was hasty in lowering the official discount rate to 13.25 per cent and its rate for fixed-term advances to banks to 14.75 per cent. The move was criticised by some economists as being premature because of the continuing uncertainties surrounding the lira, which lost ground against the D-Mark yesterday. The Italian currency was fixed at 756.20 to the D-Mark, against 755.83 on Tuesday. Shares on the Milan stock market closed lower yesterday in thin trading, with the Comit equity index falling by 4.72 to 419.63. Meanwhile, money market interest rates continued to decline, with the Bank of Italy's rate for repurchase agreements with commercial banks declining to 14.29 per cent compared with 15.86 per cent at the last tender offer on July 31 and a peak of 17.56 per cent on July 22 . Bankers have cautioned that the discount rate cut, demanded by industrialists after last Friday's agreement to end the scala mobile wage indexation system, was risky in view of imponderables such as the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union and the need for further detailed negotiations between ministers, employers and unions on a new wage bargaining system, which the government hopes to conclude by mid-September. Meanwhile, strong signs emerged yesterday that the Senate, the upper house of parliament, would approve the government's L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) emergency budget package, passed last week in the lower house. However, dealers warned that the new government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, which has a 16-seat majority, would face a much sterner test when it puts forward its 1993 budget plans in September. Uncertainties over Italy's structural economic problems were among the reasons behind yesterday's decision by a leading Japanese credit rating agency to lower its rating for Italy's yen-denominated debt. JBRI, a subsidiary of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun group, reduced to AA plus from triple A Italy's rating for debt. A similar move has already been made by the leading US debt rating agencies. Italy is the only G7 member not to have triple A borrowing status.</p>

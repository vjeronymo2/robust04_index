			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: A proven model for schools Sir, I read with interest your editorial on education ('Exam results', August 20) and was curious as to why you choose the International Baccalaureate as a proven model. May I suggest that you obtain some information concerning the European Schools in Europe and their already accepted and well-known European Baccalaureate. Between 60 and 70 per cent of the students in these schools are children of those working in European or other international organisations in Europe. The remainder have parents who are not connected with the European/international civil service. The first European School was started in Luxembourg in the 1950s. Today, their stringent examination requirements are appreciated by many nationalities throughout Europe. This system has the strong support of parents and students, unusual these days.

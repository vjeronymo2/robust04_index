			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil issues advance Improving crude oil prices following Opec's agreement to a six-month output plan provided the spur for yesterday's advance in the oil sector as a whole, with one stock given an additional boost by a clutch of recommendations. US buyers were said to have been particularly keen buyers and the day's advances included BP, up 8 1/2 at 324 1/2 p in active trade of 15m shares. Shell Transport was another stock favoured by overseas buyers and the shares added 5 at 670p in volume of 3.9m. Enterprise Oil gained further support from recommendations from SG Warburg and the new oils team at Nomura, which has placed the stock on its buy list. The shares climbed 17 to 458p on volume of 3.8m. Mr Steve Turner at Nomura said the Opec meeting was better than expected and the improvement in oil prices was likely to benefit Enterprise, which has underperformed the market by 18 per cent since April on the back of a poor oil price. Volume in Lasmo jumped to 18m after two cross-trades were done at 135.5p and 135.6p. The shares hardened 2 to 145p.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Arts (Theatre): Wistfully into the past THE original play, a wry comedy, was by Kaufman and Hart, they of The Man Who Came to Dinner and You Can't Take It With You. In 1980 Stephen Sondheim began turning it into a musical for Broadway, where it won some esteem but flopped (some of the songs have stayed around, but it has never had a London production); last week he and his writer George Furth were still working on it in Leicester, obviously to good purpose. This time, it doesn't look remotely like a flop. Like most Sondheim shows, Merrily We Roll Along is noticeably clever. In this case, however, the basic trouvaille came from Kaufman and Hart: trace the history of a bosom threesome, step by step - but backwards, from soured middle-age to their starry-eyed beginnings. Apart from the reverse chronology, the mood of wistful disillusion recalls Sondheim's earlier Follies, though there the principal characters were all performers. The threesome here are two writers and a composer. We first meet Frank, the latter, in 1979 at his Bel Air party to celebrate his new movie-musical, where Mary - suffering from a hopeless block ever since her one successful novel - is a drunken and embarrassing guest. Then, six years earlier, we meet Charley too, on a TV chat show with Frank (at whose party Charley's brilliant new play was mentioned), complaining so indiscreetly that Frank's commercial work has put their collaboration on ice that the ice turns into permafrost on the spot. As the years roll back we learn that Gussie, on the verge of divorcing Frank at the party, used to be married to Joe, Frank and Charley's first big producer, when she was still the toast of Broadway - and when Frank was still married to Beth, an innocent Texan gal. . . Paul Kerryson keeps the story moving swiftly through Martin Johns' steely but flexible set; there are neat choral transitions between the years, and the below-stage band, conducted by Julian Kelly, is first-rate. Maria Friedman makes Mary wonderfully sturdy and hearty, just the sort of girl who would be forever in unrequited love with Frank. Michael Cantwell's nervy, fragile Frank seems more a pawn of fate than a wilful sell-out - there is something odd and secretive about his persona that his role doesn't tap. Evan Pappas, with the advantage of being American, is Charley to the life, plaintive, bespectacled and funny (though in retrospect his Pulitzer Prize seems a bit of a surprise), and he makes the most of his rueful 'Franklin Shephard Inc.]' tirade. Just before the interval, Jacqueline Dankworth's Beth gives the full, passionate treatment to her big number outside the divorce court, 'Not a Day Goes By' - though it makes a wrongfooted introduction: throughout the second act she is sweeter and simpler than that. Gareth Snook is an impeccable Joe, rich and then cuckolded and then ruined. As preening Gussie, Louise Gold looks the part and belts out her music in ripe style; she handles her flamboyant party-talk with a certain disdain, like someone who would prefer not to know anybody who talked like that. If Furth's brisk, jokey dialogue doesn't quite conceal the fact that the characters are out of familiar stock, the teasing interest of the story lies anyhow in its (mildly) revelatory regress, not in the psychology of artistic creation and compromise. Call it sentimental, if you like. What did you expect - a philosophical treatise? But there is an extra tease in this ingenious musical, which is the status of Merrily We Roll Along itself: is it a compromised Frank product, or a sincere Charley one, or the show that Frank and Charley never managed to write? The show itself makes a good case for any and all of those readings, which means that it is at least three times as intriguing as most musicals, and the Leicester team plays it with winning fervour.

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices dip as confidence is challenged - Market Report Optimism was punctured across the range of the UK stock market yesterday, after the Bundesbank made no move on interest rates and the second line stocks reacted from the tumult of the previous session. The blue chip stocks moved nervously after hopes for an early cut in base rates found little support from the UK chancellor of the exchequer, and it was left to specific corporate situations to provide the features. Confidence in the progress of the domestic economy was challenged before the session by a gloomy report from the British Chambers of Commerce. Strength in sterling also discouraged investors in the leading UK export companies. The FT-SE 100 Index moved erratically, reflecting the new uncertainties in the market following the significant outperformance of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index since the turn of the year. An early fall of 12 points on the FT-SE 100 was quickly recovered with the help of the December contract in the stock index futures sector. A strong gain in Guinness shares on the restructured link with LVMH, the French luxury goods and drinks group, and in a handful of other leading stocks, boosted the Footsie. But support waned after the meeting of the Bundesbank policy council failed to produce favourable news on interest rates, and the index soon showed a net fall of 16 points. There was little significant selling, however, and share prices steadied as Wall Street opened with a gain of 5 Dow points in UK trading hours. The final reading put the FT-SE 100-share Index at 3,470 for a final loss of 5.1 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which was driven ahead so strongly on Wednesday by options-related dealings, fell steadily to close 43.4 off at 4,105.4. Dealers said that, once again, the UK stock market appeared sharply divided. The leading 100 stocks, which are dominated by the big fund managers, lacked direction. Many managers wanted to increase investment in the Mid 250 range which has outperformed the Footsie this month, but found it very difficult to get cash into what are often extremely tight markets in these second line issues. Meanwhile, the uncertainty over the progress of the UK economy, and thus over base rate prospects, left fund managers unsure of the outlook across the blue chip sectors. This left investors to concentrate on specific features, including Guinness, where nearly 30m shares traded, and in BOC, RTZ and Standard Chartered. Seaq volume remained very high at 1.11bn shares, with non-Seaq trade at around 64 per cent of the total. In the previous session, retail value on the Seaq volume of 1.32m shares fell to Pounds 1.13bn, reflecting the focus on second line issues. Traders admitted to concern over this week's developments in the Mid 250 stocks, which have been prompted by moves by a leading marketmaker to offer warrants on the stocks, regarded as an attempt to offer a futures instrument on the Mid 250 Index to follow the significant success of the future contract on the FT-SE 100 Share Index. The Footsie future has become an important driving force behind the Index itself and the growth of interest in the Mid 250 range has brought expectations that a similar instrument will be welcomed in this sector. However, this week has reinforced worries over the market liquidity supporting the FT-SE Mid 250 and 350 Indices.</p>

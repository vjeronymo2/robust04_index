			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takuji Masuda, political commentator: </F> "Formidable Chief of Staff Takemura's Shrewd Strategy To Protect  the `Premier' With Sakigake Members Appointed to the Prime  Minister's Official Residence"]    [Text] The Prime Minister's Official Residence is currently  managed by [Masayoshi] Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and  president of Sakigake [Harbinger]. Takemura and Prime Minister  Hosokawa have worked closely since they served as governors and  can now be considered as being on a honeymoon. Takemura is an  indispensable member of the Hosokawa administration. However, it  is said that his relations have soured with Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] Secretary General Ozawa, a key backstage player  in the coalition government. As the political world approaches a  second restructuring, Mr. Takemura must be watched closely.  <H3>  New Nagata-cho Triangle Consisting of Hosokawa, Ozawa, and  Takemura </H3>   Some quarters equate the non-Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  coalition government as the "eight-headed reptile of Japan."  They must be referring to the eight leaders of the seven parties  and one group comprising the coalition.    However, the eight-headed reptile itself is aware that it  possesses only one torso and that if the eight completely  differing leaders opt to act in accordance with their own ideas,  the torso of the reptile will split into eight separate pieces.    That is the very reason why every effort is made to avoid  such a situation. The only reason why the Hosokawa government  has survived for three months despite it being called fragile as  glass is that the respective parties making up the coalition  government earnestly restrain themselves against over-asserting  their positions in the execution of the coalition government's  policies.    However, notwithstanding such a stance, no progress  whatsoever can be made unless someone serves as the policy  administrator and power center for the government. The  individuals who have assumed that role comprise the "trio" of  Morihiro Hosokawa and Masayoshi Takemura, presidents of the  Japan New Party [JNP] and Sakigake, respectively, and Ichiro  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, all of whom were former  members of the LDP.    It is noteworthy that Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief  Cabinet Secretary Takemura are now on a honeymoon. According to  a Sakigake official, the two were on intimate terms during their  days as governors and are "close to being eternal friends." In  terms of the composition of the government, Takemura has assumed  the role of right-hand man and chief cabinet secretary, but  understands that he is basically a sworn friend of Hosokawa.  Thus, there are occasions when Takemura makes a decision for the  government and Hosokawa follows up on the situation with his  approval.    However, cracks have begun to appear in the honeymoon  relationship between Hosokawa-Takemura and Ozawa, who plays a  backstage role. One feels that the vulnerability of the  coalition government in the absence of a true leader or  commander-in-chief, in a benign sense, is beginning to gradually  expose itself at this point.    As an example, Takemura and Ozawa clashed head-on in their  assertions during the compilation of the government's draft of  the political reform law which constitutes the Hosokawa  government's leading critical issue. Concerning the balloting  method for the combined proportional representation electoral  district system, Takemura and his Sakigake, which favors a  moderate multiparty system, advocate a two-vote coded system and  during a public television program, Takemura spontaneously  expressed his true feelings by saying, "If I were to have a  choice, I would prefer a two-vote system."    However, that statement upset Ozawa in that he is of the  feeling that, "We have no choice but to adopt the one-vote  system if we are going to realize a two-major-party system."    Ozawa promptly summoned Takemura to a meeting of the leaders  of the various political parties which the former veritably  controls and admonished the latter severely by stating, "It was  truly imprudent of you as the chief cabinet secretary to  publicly speak in favor of a two-vote system when we haven't  even decided on a government position!" Secretary Ichikawa of  Komeito, who is a sworn ally of Ozawa and who was attending the  meeting, fired an endorsing volley by adding, "Mr. Takemura  should gracefully apologize." At that moment, it seemed as if  Takemura had been completely crushed by the Shinseito-Komeito  alliance.    However, when Takemura returned to the Prime Minister's  Residence, he displayed his anger by saying, "It is only natural  that a variety of views are expressed during the development of  important policies. My statements on television were expressions  of views made as head of Sakigake."    And, he is said to have mumbled, "If this sort of situation  persists, Ozawa and I just might part ways eventually." That  episode marks the beginning of the Takemura-Ozawa war.    This just might be a case where the seniority system concept  of the LDP era reared its ugly head in Ozawa's mind, wherein he  feels, "I may be junior in age to Takemura but I am now a  veteran Diet man reelected for a ninth term in the House of  Representatives. As a three-term Diet man, Takemura has no right  to speak that way."    However, even if Takemura were classified as a three-term  Diet man, he is nonetheless undeniably one of the "eight heads  of the Japanese reptile," and we should interpret this situation  not as an emotional confrontation between two individuals, but a  confrontation of political concepts of Shinseito and Sakigake.  <H3>  Takemura Outmaneuvered by Ozawa on the "Prime Minister  Hosokawa" Concept </H3>   It is said that Takemura did not favor a coalition  government  as it exists today.    It is said that Takemura had favored a "nationwide unified  coalition cabinet," excluding the Communist Party, lead by  former Minister of Justice Masaharu Gotoda who had served as  examining officer when Takemura was hired by the Ministry of  Home Affairs, if a coalition was to be formed, and that Hosokawa  had also concurred in such an approach. Reputedly, the  horizontal ties of bureaucrats who previously served with the  Ministry of Home Affairs are very strong. There was one more  factor that influenced Takemura's ideas. When he was a member of  the LDP, he served as chief of the administrative bureau of the  Political Reform Headquarters when Gotoda served as its acting  chief, and he also embraces political ideas in common with those  of Gotoda.    Takemura mobilized the assistance of Hiroshi Mitsuzuka who  once led his own faction and currently serves as LDP Political  Reform Headquarters chief and junior members of that former  faction and attempted to "talk Gotoda into the idea of becoming  the coalition leader," but Gotoda would not agree for fear of  his unstable health.    As soon as an overwhelming victory by the non-LDP camp  became  evident after the general election of 18 July, a movement gained  momentum and it appeared a consensus had been formed among the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Shinseito, Komeito, the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United Social  Democratic Party to support President Tsutomu Hata (currently  deputy prime minister and foreign minister) of Shinseito to lead  the new government. However, unexpectedly stubborn reaction  arose against Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa on the part of  the Japan New Party and Sakigake, and it created a situation in  which it would be impossible to unify the non-LDP forces under a  "Hata government."    At that time, this writer spoke with several officials of  the  two parties and found that sentiment against Ozawa was  unexpectedly stubborn and one of them even said, "We should not  become a part of the government even if it is born as either an  LDP or non-LDP government."    Takemura himself once made his cautious stance toward Mr.  Ozawa obvious when during a television interview, he said, "I  like Mr. Hata, but Mr. Ozawa... I don't dislike."    Ozawa, who sensed a crisis, met secretly deep into the night  with Hosokawa in a Tokyo hotel four days after the election on  the 22d and strongly urged the latter to accept nomination as  leader of the coalition.    Ozawa is quoted as saying, "Our idea is to make you prime  minister. If you would accept the nomination, a non-LDP  government will be created for the first time in 38 years. Among  members of the SDPJ and DSP are some who oppose a Hosokawa  leadership, but this is an issue that I will resolve  responsibly."    Hosokawa sharply intensified his non-LDP stance following  this discussion. An official of the Japan New Party commented,  "The JNP president, who had seemed to be preoccupied by  something, suddenly came alive, making me promptly feel that  something exciting took place."    We cannot deny the fact that the general public was very  skeptical about the irresolute attitude taken by the Japan New  Party and Sakigake which preferred venturing over a third  course, just when "non-LDP" was developing into a key word  following the general election.    It may have been only logical that Hosokawa gave Ozawa an  affirmative reply in view of the needs posed by the times, but  according to an official of Sakigake, Takemura must have felt  extremely chagrined at the fact that he was "brilliantly  outmaneuvered by Ozawa."    However, Takemura proved he was quick at altering his  stance,  proving his mettle as a former bureaucrat. As soon as a policy  consensus was formed among the seven non-LDP parties and one  group, he wasted no time solidifying his position by leaking to  the mass media that, "I have been asked by Mr. Hosokawa to be  his chief cabinet secretary.    It is said that Ozawa wanted to make Takemura minister of  home affairs or minister in charge of political reform and  nominate his confidants Hiroshi Kumagai or Hajime Funada as  chief cabinet secretary, but in this respect Takemura revenged  himself with brilliance.    Further, Takemura embarked on a project to staff the Prime  Minister's Residence with members of "Sakigake."  <H3>  He Was Quick To Change Political Positions Even When He Was  Governor </H3>   First, the candidate for deputy chief cabinet secretary was  changed from a nominee belonging to Shinseito to Yukio Hatoyama.  According to a JNP official, "It had been agreed that Shusei  Tanaka who is intimate with the prime minister would be  appointed to a deputy chief cabinet secretary position," but it  appears Tanaka had declined the appointment. That's when the  opportunity arose for Hatoyama.    Several days after completing work on cabinet appointments,  Hosokawa decided on a plan to adopt the U.S. special assistant  system and appoint Tanaka to such a post.    According to Tanaka, "I had thought that I would rather not  accept an appointment to the executive level this time around,  but I decided to accept because of an urgent plea from Hosokawa  and a recommendation from party president Takemura."    Thus, work was completed on the formation of a team to  firmly  surround Prime Minister Hosokawa in the Prime Minister's  Residence with appointees from Sakigake.    It is true that Ozawa and Shinseito officials had strong  dissatisfaction about these appointments, but midlevel Diet  members of Shinseito have interpreted the situation as, "Since  the Japan New Party and Sakigake do not have members besides  Hosokawa and Takemura who are qualified to hold cabinet posts,  it is unavoidable that they monopolize posts just below the  cabinet level."    No stories have been heard about complaints being lodged by  Ozawa because of this situation, but it appears as if he is  quick to forgive and forget as a matter of personality.    Now we direct our thoughts to Takemura, who is not as well  known as Hosokawa or Ozawa.    It has been only seven years since he first entered central  government service by being first elected to the House of  Representatives in 1986.    If he had remained in the LDP, he'd still be treated as a  junior Diet man. The best position he could hope for would be  appointment to the post of a committee chairman of the Political  Research Council.    However, many of the Diet men who were elected to office  after the Prime Minister Nakasone double elections in 1986 were  exposed to and harbor a feeling of crisis about "Nagato-cho  politics" plagued by a series of scandals such as Recruit,  Kyowa, and Sagawa.    Takemura is not an exception, and when the Recruit scandal  broke out, he took the initiative in forming the "Utopia Study  Group" composed of one- and two-year Diet men and embarked on  political reform.    It just so happens that when I conversed with Takemura  during  an interview for another magazine, he made a subtle statement  hinting at the formation of a new party and reorganization of  the government which I will introduce at this point.    "Recently, I have come to feel that confidence cannot be  restored unless we undertake a movement to execute a bold reform  of the political world and the LDP--priority of which comes  first is immaterial---which the general public can intimately  sense as having taken place or is in the process of taking  place, because we would be taking only part of the required  actions if measures were restricted only to election system  reform."    And, in reference to the status of future political  reorganization, he said, "During the next two to three years, as  a minimum, we will probably see a number of movements to include  a period in which the political world will assume two major  flows or reorganize into two major political parties."    At that point at the beginning of this year, Takemura may  have already been visualizing establishment of Sakigake, with  the Utopia Study Group as a foundation.    This writer occasionally travels to Shiga Prefecture to give  lectures, but comments by prefecture residents generally  appraise him as being "quick to change positions."    When I recently visited Otsu, a taxi driver made a statement  which could be interpreted as a joke or sarcasm saying, "His  actions should be described as `overtaking from behind' rather  than `serving as a harbinger.'"    It is said, "The wise change themselves to fit changed  circumstances. Midgets change their masks." Just as the beauty  of a leopard's fur is improved through shedding and renewal,  politicians should be allowed to undergo transformation if such  action will empower them to embark on new achievements.    If one asks individuals who are close to Takemura for their  opinion of his characteristics, the reply is, "He is a  politician whose future is ahead of him, but he is not an  opportunist that fits the so-called orthodox definition of the  word. Sources in Shiga Province say that when Takemura was  governor of Shiga, he placed a "great amount of importance on  the concerns of the prefecture's citizens and common people."    Such a stance cannot be appreciated without knowing  Takemura's childhood days.  <H5>  "Utopia Study Group" Served as Prototype for Sakigake!? </H5>   In comparison to the fact that 40 percent of the current  Diet  members are second-generation Diet men, Takemura, the second son  among six children of a poor farm family, lost his parents early  in life and was forced to work himself up from the depths of  poverty.    The influence of such a background inspired him to become an  obsessive reader of books on subjects such as Marxist capitalism  and Engels' communist doctrine, making him a follower of Marxism.    It seems that Takemura's rebellious disposition was acquired  from those days of his early life.    Although he passed the senior national public service tests  with flying colors, he chose to join the Ministry of Home  Affairs. Even such a choice was very typical of Takemura.    The Ministry of Home Affairs serves as the overall  supervisory agency for local governments, but on the other hand,  according to a former bureau chief of the ministry, "It also  serves as the agency that conveys the opinions of local  governments to the central government, providing for a  long-existing `tradition' wherein it and the central government  are placed in a contentious situation."    It is probably because of such tradition that many  politicians who were formerly employed by the Ministry of Home  Affairs or the former Ministry of Internal Affairs possess a  rebellious, antiestablishment characteristic, unlike most  bureaucrats.    As examples, former Diet men of the Ministry of Home Affairs  include the late Yoshimi Furui and Kokichi Nadao, and current  Diet members formerly of the ministry include Seisuke Okuno and  Masaharu Gotoda, while Takemura is of the same lineage.    However, Takemura cast aside his career as a government  official in his seventh year with the ministry and became mayor  of Yokaichi city, his birthplace. At that time, he was only 37  years of age.    Later, Takemura became governor of Shiga Prefecture after a  unique election campaign. In that election, Takemura negotiated  the support of four reformist, middle-of-the-road parties--the  SDPJ, Komeito, DSP, and USDP--(excluding the LDP) and four labor  organizations including the General Council of Trade Unions of  Japan [Sohyo] and Japanese Confederation of Labor [Domei]. At  that time in 1974, it would have not been unusual for a  reformist candidate to use that kind of support, but it was a  first for a conservative on a nationwide basis and became the  center of much attention.    Takemura virtually ran as a reformist candidate and won the  election after defeating an LDP-recommended candidate. There is  the proverb which says, "The child is the father of the man,"  but it may have been a case where young 40-year-old Governor  Takemura's soul was being influenced by his readings of Marxism  as a young boy. The posture then taken by Takemura in the form  of a "grassroots prefectural government" emphasizing the  interests of the citizens seems to have something in common with  the political ideals of today's Sakigake Party.    Probably the main accomplishment of the three-term, 12-year  administration of the Takemura prefectural government was the  establishment of the 1979 Eutrophication Prevention Ordinance  aimed at purifying the waters of Lake Biwa. That ordinance  banned the use and sale of domestic synthetic detergents  (discharge of phosphorous contained in detergent causes  increases in bacteria, attendant advances in red tides, and  eventual pollution of lake waters), provided for the control of  factory discharges and was considered epochal for the times. The  ordinance also provided a fine of less than 200,000 yen for  violations of the discharge restrictions. Needless to say,  detergent manufacturers waged a fierce battle against the  ordinance, but Takemura succeeded in getting the ordinance  passed with the support of consumer groups and reformist  organizations.    Aside from that ordinance, Takemura engineered the  establishment of so-called "scenic ordinances" aimed at  protecting scenic areas. This type of ordinance is now being  established in prefectures throughout the nation as if it were a  logical thing to do, but the Shiga prefecture case became a  forerunner for the nation.    "Environmentalist Takemura" won the strong support of  prefectural citizens and won his second and third terms as  governor with the support of the LDP and all other parties  exclusive of the Communist Party unopposed.    It is said that Takemura pondered extensively whether he  should run as an LDP candidate for the Diet lower house in the  midst of his third term as governor. According to sources at the  Shiga Prefecture government office, he applied for recognition  as a member of the Abe faction of the LDP, although "he was  initially planning to run as an unaligned `Prefectural Citizen  Party' candidate."    Masayoshi Takemura garnered the attention of the central  government circles because he organized the "Utopia Study Group  with 20 members." According to Takemura, he launched a study  group for young Diet men with the "idea of preserving utopian  ideals in politics while advocating reform" as soon as the  Recruit scandal surfaced in summer 1989. He alarmed the public  by disclosing the political funds balance sheets of all members  of the group showing that even "first-year Diet men required an  annual average of 100 million yen in political funds."    When one notes that six of the 13 members of Sakigake are  former members of this Utopia Study Group, it is not difficult  to realize that Takemura used the council as an experiment for  Sakigake.    In his jointly authored book, titled Rise of Junior  Warriors of Nagata-cho, compiled by the Utopia Study Group,  Takemura relates, "The aim here is to mutually cherish our  initial aspirations to become politicians and remain pragmatic  forever while upholding our ideals."  <H3>  Little Politician Overcomes Big Politicians and Becomes  "Takeo Miki" of Heisei Era </H3>   There once was a politician named Takeo Miki (former prime  minister), but Miki like Takemura was a politician who battled  with authority in terms of idealism and reality and survived as  a politician. He was a politician who would pursue idealism to  the extreme limits, but once he sensed he could no longer  persist in such an approach, he would not forget to reverse  gears and quickly compromise with reality.    At one time, politicians ridiculed Miki as a "Balkan  politician," but there was no denying that Miki as a small  political force (immediately following World War II, Miki was  president of the People's Collaboration Party, a middle-  of-the-road party) used a technique which explored ways and  means of overpowering major political parties and control the  casting vote.    It could be that Takemura is the "Takeo Miki of the Heisei  era."    As the leader of a small force of 13 and as a pragmatic  politician with ideals, this is indeed a case of how Takemura  will exercise his skills in forming a new political current as  he maneuvers among strong forces such as the LDP, Shinseito, and  Komeito.    Now, Takemura's political schedule, as manager of the  coalition government, for the period after November is filled  with a number of mentally wrenching issues.    Above all matters, the important issue pending now is  political reform, but a midterm issue is the fundamental reform  of the current tax system.    The list of pending issues is endless, starting with the  review of direct and indirect taxation ratios emanating from the  report submitted by the Tax System Research Council, measures to  be taken to cope with the stubborn recession and income tax  reductions and the settlement of the Uruguay Round talks by the  end of the year.    Among them, an issue of supreme priority for resolution by  yearend, in accordance with Prime Minister Hosokawa's public  pledge, is political reform which is the raison d'etre for the  current government. Now that an agreement has been reached with  seven parties, in the event an agreement to the SDPJ-proposed  amendment cannot be obtained, there is the possibility of a  forced vote to win passage of the original draft.    Sources close to Takemura reveal, "We believe he will call  for yearend dissolution of the cabinet and January elections, if  this session of the Diet fails to produce a political reform  measure." They are saying that his determination is very strong.    Now, in Nagata-cho, there is speculation that movements will  be stirred for political restructuring when the political reform  laws are passed and when general elections are held to implement  the new election system.    The initial restructuring is expected between the first part  of November when the bills pass the House of Representatives if  the legislative actions go smoothly and the latter part of  December. This Diet session most likely will undergo an  extension for two weeks beginning at the scheduled end of the  session on 15 December.    The potential has increased for another split in the LDP and  the surfacing of a movement for a split in the SDPJ in  connection with a revision and compromise concerning the  political reform bills.    And, incipient movements of the foregoing nature suddenly  surfaced in October. It appears that a young group including  Masayasu Kitagawa and Michihiko Kano who belong to the LDP's  Mitsuzuka faction have been making frequent contacts with  Takemura, Kisaburo Tokai, and Hiroyuki Sonoda of the Sakigake  Party and former members of the Mitsuzuka faction. It is well  known that Kitagawa and his group had moved to support Takemura  and Gotoda as prime minister candidates until the non-LDP  government was formed.    Further, 47 members of the "group to create a new LDP"  sponsored by Seiichi Ota and Shokei Arai of the LDP who just  resigned from their factions have approached Sakigake and  Shinseito and are said to be ready to secede from the LDP if  passage of the reform bill is placed at risk during either the  House of Representatives or House of Councilors proceedings.  Officials of the group who met with this writer have said, "In  that event, it will not be a case of defeating the opposition at  great risk, but we will have no choice but to make a crucial  decision with a focus on realizing the passage of the political  reform bills within the year."    Further, the LDP Political Reform Promotion Parliamentarian  League (chaired by former Prime Minister Kaifu; over 160  members) has confirmed its intent at passage by yearend and  that, if members of the executive department of the LDP should  stubbornly resist political reform to the very end, according to  officials of the alliance, they will resolutely separate  themselves from the party conservatives and "form a new LDP and  act as a party within a party."    On the other hand, even in the SDPJ, a group of 20 to 30  conservatives who are absolutely against adoption of a small  electoral district system have shown signs of forming a new  force by the end of the year, indicating that both conservative  and reformist forces are determined to secede and reorganize.  <H3>  Farewell to Ozawa, Who Embraces Different Policy Concepts  and Political Methods </H3>   We should not overlook the fact that, along with movements  of  the foregoing nature, differences in political ideas and basic  policy are becoming obvious among the coalition parties and  within the LDP and that situation and its subtle effect on the  introduction of a new election system just may instigate a  reorganization of the political world.    Of special note is that the LDP has suffered a conspicuous  drop in appeal with the appointment of President Kono, projects  an image of century-end chaos and the appearance of rapid  acceleration of the party dismantling process. The conceptual  confrontation between the Kono group which favors preservation  of the current Constitution and former Foreign Minister Watanabe  who favors constitutional revision is now a decisive one, while  the blueprint for the next political restructuring has been made  clear in the eyes of the public through Kono's Diet statements  during representative questioning in which he circuitously  criticized Ozawa, who aims for a mini-super power, and expressed  support for the constitutional preservation stance of Hosokawa  and Takemura.    To begin with, 17 years ago, when Kono formed the Shinjiyu  [New Liberal] Club, Hosokawa was the first individual that the  former recruited for membership among members of the House of  Councilors and had listed him as a member when he announced  formation of the club.    However, the club encountered the opposition of Kakuei  Tanaka, then leader of the LDP, and the idea of including  Hosokawa as a club member had to be abandoned at the last  minute. It would not be strange for the two with very close  ideas to unite some time in the future.    Further, Tsuneo Suzuki, former member of the House of  Representatives, who has served as President Kono's secretary  and has worked with Kono on political actions ever since the  Shinjiyu Club days, has been a member of the Utopia Study Group  ever since its inception and, according to an official of  Sakigake, in response to solicitations to join Sakigake during  the last general election, "He pondered the invitation  extensively, but chose to remain loyal to Mr. Kono." However, he  is very close to Takemura.    Also, Tanaka, who is the prime minister's special assistant,  once belonged to the Shinjiyu Club, has ideas that are similar  to those of Kono and Suzuki, and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hatoyama expressed views which are in agreement with those of  Takemura and Suzuki during Utopia Study Group sessions. Kunio  Hatoyama, former minister of education and younger brother of  the senior Hatoyama, is now unaffiliated in terms of political  party, but he once was elected to the House of Representatives  on the recommendation of the Shinjiyu Club. Additionally, it is  reported that Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives  Heisuke Kujiraoka, former director general of the Environmental  Agency, was strongly recommended by Kono, Suzuki, and Hosokawa  for his present position.    It is quite possible that the core of a new political force  will be formed in one or two years embracing constitutional  preservation and antinationalism and composed of the current  staff of the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the LDP Kono  group and the Doi-Kujiraoka group in the House of  Representatives.    On the other hand, we can anticipate formation of a new  group  centered on individuals who seek constitutional revision with  Ozawa as leader and including former Foreign Minister Watanabe;  Kozo Watanabe, acting president of Shinseito; Mutsuki Kato,  former LDP Political Research Council and currently unaffiliated  in terms of political party; Takeo Nishioka, former minister of  education; and Toshio Yamaguchi, former minister of labor. It is  said that Takemura's opinion is that "the Hosokawa government  will last until the next general election."    Takemura is currently contemplating a parting of ways with  Ozawa's Shinseito, whose policy concepts and political methods  are entirely different, before or after the next general  election, which is expected to take place at the earliest after  the spring of 1995.    In that event, there is the possibility that Takemura and  his  Sakigake will avoid a unified faction composed of non-LDP  elements and advocated by Ozawa and launch a separate election  campaign.    Takemura once told this writer, "I would like to work  towards  a goal of creating politics that is not deeply influenced by the  obsolete sensitivities of Nagata-cho."    In this regard, it appears that the future political  objective of the "Takeo Miki of the Heisei era" will be to  reinforce his contacts and affiliations with junior and  reformist groups of the LDP and the junior members of the SDPJ  in applying diversionary tactics against Ozawa's Shinseito,  ultimately form a new party of 50 or so members, and become a  core element in a coalition government based on a new framework.  It will be then that Takemura who as an idealistic but pragmatic  politician will demonstrate his true capabilities.</p>

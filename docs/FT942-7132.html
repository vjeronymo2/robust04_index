			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (9): The tail still wags the dog - Derivatives, Tracy Corrigan discusses one bright patch in the markets While conditions have worsened significantly in most markets this year, there is at least one bright patch: the derivatives market. The growth of the exchange-traded market in futures and options and the over-the-counter market in swaps and options shows no sign of abating. In fact, the world's futures exchanges experienced record volume in the first quarter, as dealers, treasurers and investors used futures to try to hedge or reposition themselves, after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates. The reason for the continued activity in the derivatives market, while activity in some other areas has dropped off, is partly that derivative instruments can be used to take bearish as well as bullish positions, so there is no logical reason why activity should slide in a bear market. Also, derivatives can be used to trade volatility, so volume tends to rise when market conditions are volatile. However, the high level of activity in derivatives this year has had some negative impact, most notably by re-arousing fears that the world's financial markets are now driven by derivative rather than cash market trading - or, as is often said, the tail is wagging the dog. These fears were repeatedly voiced in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, when stock index futures were blamed by some observers for precipitating or exacerbating declines. However, the fact that bond losses in the first quarter of 1994 were first seen in the futures markets can also be explained by the greater liquidity of futures, relative to cash markets. Some investors and traders, though, undoubtedly had their fingers burnt, having taken aggressive positions in the futures markets. 'Overall, the amount of business in derivatives markets continues to grow at a healthy rate,' said Steve Smith, an executive director of Swiss Bank Corporation. 'Unfortunately, towards the end of last year a number of proprietary institutions - banks and hedge funds and some traditional investors - had built up large speculative positions, mainly in bonds, to a level which the market place had never seen before. The unwinding of these positions led to a short-term diminution in some areas of activity. However, the ongoing use of derivatives for traditional fund management and for risk management on the treasury side is growing in leaps and bounds.' According to the International Swaps Dealers Association, the notional amount of over-the-counter swaps outstanding is about Dollars 4,500bn. The OTC market has generally been the forum for greatest innovation, developing exotic options such as knock-out options, which reduce the cost to the end user. Some futures exchanges are trying to adapt products from the over-the-counter market, so that they can offer standardised contracts which have some of the flexibility of the OTC market. For example, the Chicago Board Options Exchange has introduced Flex options, which allow standard contracts to be adjusted to individual needs. The swap market used to be closely linked to the new-issues market, but is now increasingly used by companies on an ongoing basis, for treasury management. However, some heavy losses by corporate treasury departments using derivatives has turned off some companies, and could create a more difficult environment for banks marketing these instruments. Germany's Metallgesellschaft had to be rescued by its banks when a trading subsidiary incurred estimated losses of Dollars 1bn on oil derivatives, the largest in a series of losses by companies such as Allied Lyons and Showa Shell. Perhaps even more worrying for banks, Procter &amp; Gamble recently threatened legal action against Bankers Trust, after it took an after-tax loss of Dollars 100m on swaps sold by Bankers Trust. While the legal grounds for such a claim remains shaky, the floating of the notion that banks are irresponsibly marketing risky instruments is damaging, even if it cannot be made to stick. Such developments are likely to attract further scrutiny from regulators, many of whom have already expressed concern about the potential knock-on effects of problems in the derivatives market. Although a number of reports by regulatory authorities such as the Bank of England have adopted a fairly conciliatory tone, there are still calls for regulators to tighten up on derivatives use, or at least to force greater disclosure. The latest warnings have come from the US General Accounting Office, which said in a report that inadequate regulation of the derivatives markets poses a threat to the US and international financial system. The report is expected to increase pressure for legislation to control the markets. The industry has made some efforts to put its house in order, by tightening control standards. The Group of Thirty report on derivatives in 1993 set strict guidelines. Further, US banks such as Citibank have led the way in giving fuller details of their derivatives exposure. Closer scrutiny by regulators and a spate of losses due to poor controls have undoubtedly succeeded in concentrating the minds of bankers at board level, some of whom had risen through the ranks in a pre-derivatives era. The rapid expansion of the derivatives market has forged stronger links between markets. The notional amount of futures contracts traded annually on world exchanges is around Dollars 140,000bn. In many cases, futures markets, with standardised contracts and centralised clearing, are more liquid than the underlying cash markets, and tend to drive cash prices up and down. For example, volume in FT-SE 100 index futures on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) is two and a half times the stock market's turnover. The most active futures contracts are traded in the dealing pits of exchanges, but some contracts, particularly options contracts, have successfully shifted to electronic trading. The battle between traditional open-outcry trading and electronic screen-based trading is likely to take some time to resolve. However, Globex, the 24-hour futures trading system jointly developed by Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, has achieved disappointing volume.</p>

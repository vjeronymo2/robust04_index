			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: 8 MPs wrote to ministers on Nadir SIR Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, yesterday disclosed that eight MPs  -more than previously thought - had made representations to ministers about the case of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Polly Peck boss. But he dismissed demands to name all the MPs concerned. Of the eight, Sir Nicholas said, four had written or spoken to him or to his predecessor, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in the past two years. In a written parliamentary reply, Sir Nicholas explained the figure had risen to eight with the inclusion of letters written by two MPs to the then home secretary. Sir Patrick had replied to these letters on various points. So far, Mr Michael Mates, the ex-Northern Ireland Minister who resigned over the affair, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, and Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary and Mr Nadir's MP, have been publicly identified as having contacted the attorney-general over the case. Sir Nicholas, speaking earlier in the Commons, said that while political donations were not his responsibility, 'what this case makes abundantly clear is that it does certainly not produce any favour or affection, either way, whatever party may be involved'.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES  </P> <P> Joseph Edmiston's statement regarding the "unrealistic" expectations of animal  rights activists contains no more realism than that of his opponents or the  most ardent laissez-faire industrialist, for that matter.  </P> <P> There is no "nature" out there: Edmiston's idea of what is out there is  obviously in his head, and he fervently believes that his mind-set matches his  reality.  </P> <P> Neither does "the duck" of the rights activists exist: which of all the ducks  to be seen is "the duck"?  </P> <P> The most resolutely realistic action is, that when you turn that key to start  your car, you in fact alter and poison the air. When you flush that toilet, you  foul the water and when you put out your 3-plus cans with garbage, you pollute  the Earth.  </P> <P> In fact, we are the most destructive organisms on the planet. Chances that  conservationists, rights activists or industrialists will reverse that are  exceedingly small.  </P> <P> Moreover, the majority of the planet's population, not driving and flushing yet  because it is yet developing, hopes to be driving and flushing by the end of  the decade, or better yet, tomorrow.  </P> <P> In the final analysis, the distinction between rights activist and  environmentalist platforms is moot: They don't deal with the real problem. It  is not out there, it's in here. It is I.  </P> <P> HUGO VAN WOERKOM, Marina Del Rey  </P></p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Time Warner head quits over policy differences MR NICHOLAS J. Nicholas, president and co-chief executive of Time-Warner, surprised Wall Street last night by resigning from the media company because of policy differences with its management and board. He will be succeeded by Mr Gerald Levin, the group's chief operating officer. The shake-up is the latest in a series of controversies at the highly-indebted company ever since the 1989 merger between Warner Communications, the entertainment group headed by Mr Steven Ross, and Time Inc, the blue-chip publishing group. Mr Nicholas, 52, who was viewed as a potential successor to Mr Ross, Time Warner's chairman, gave no details of his differences with the management. He said merely that 'for a company to fulfil its potential requires a clear strategic focus shared totally by its leadership.' There was sufficient difference between himself and the management and board that his resignation should 'enable a single and consistent view to prevail.' Mr Nicholas was the most senior manager at Time Warner to have risen on the Time side of the business. He was a key player in the negotiation of the merger with Warner, alongside Mr Richard Munro, the then chairman of Time. Mr Levin, 52, also rose through the ranks at Time, where he was closely involved in the development of its Home Box Office cable television movie channel. Time Warner has been a subject of controversy since the merger. Critics say it has yet to prove that such a global entertainment conglomerate makes strategic sense.</p>

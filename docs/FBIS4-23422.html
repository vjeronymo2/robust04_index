			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eugene Gunning] </F>   [Text] The ANC is to sell some of its properties abroad to  replenish its coffers. The money will be used to pay off its  debt, because at this stage the debt is "quite large," the  party's senior officials disclosed.    Among the most sought after properties which could come  under  the hammer are a six-bedroom house in Washington worth about 50  million U.S. dollars; as well as a farm in Zambia with an  estimated value of 1 million dollars. At the current exchange  rate the farm is worth about 3.6 million rands.    The ANC said the total value of its properties abroad is  estimated at about 20 million rands.    The proceeds from the sale of the ANC's properties will  apparently not be enough to pay off all the organization's  debts. The election has cost the ANC a lot of money. Before the  start of the campaign there had been the cost to establish an  infrastructure in South Africa while the organization was in  exile for several decades.  <H5>  Debt Burden Relief </H5>   No doubt the money to come in from the property transactions  will contribute toward making the ANC's debt burden lighter.    To further supplement the organization's coffers, it was  announced this week that MPs elected under the ANC's banner will  have to make a contribution toward the coffers. This includes  President Mandela, ministers, deputy ministers, and senators.  Amounts of between 750 rands for an ordinary member and 2,000  rands per month for a minister have been mentioned.    ANC Treasurer General Thomas Nkobi, Administrative Secretary  Henry Makgothi, and Deputy Administrative Secretary Mohamed  Moosajee spoke to RAPPORT about the organization's financial  matters.    They said it is not true that the ANC had bags full of money  as so many people seem to believe. It is no longer a liberation  movement and can therefore no longer depend on funds from abroad.    From now on the ANC is to be run along business lines, and  it  is to become financially self-sufficient.  <H5>  Offices Rented </H5>   Another possibility being considered is to rent out ANC  office space at the ANC headquarters, 51 Plein Street in  Johannesburg.    The ANC's impressive property portfolio abroad has in the  past attracted attention.    Before the legitimization of the ANC the property had not  only been an investment but a necessity as well. The  organization was being run from abroad and for that it needed  space.    This need has now largely fallen away, and property which is  not going to be sold will most likely be rented out.    The first step toward getting rid of the properties began  this week. On Tuesday ANC offices were already being closed  down. Due to administrative reasons, it will take a while  before all the offices are closed as various administrative  procedures still have to be concluded.    The ANC's office in Washington was one of the first to close  its doors.    Among the properties in question are two houses in the U.S.  with a total value of 83,000 dollars, five premises in London  with offices and houses with an estimated value of 2.7 million  rands; a house in Australia valued at 805,000 rands; and houses  in Germany, Sweden, and Belgium.    Also in the neighboring states the ANC has built up a strong  property portfolio.    Especially in Zambia, where its headquarters was situated  before the organization was unbanned, it has property, among  others the farm, a block of flats with 30 apartments, and two  offices measuring 1,500 and 800 square meters, respectively.    In Zimbabwe the ANC has offices and 39 houses with an  estimated value of 4.5 million rands.    Mr. Nkobi said a new company is to be created to see to the  properties.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Capital gains tax - your July allowances THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in July. To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure shown for the month in which you bought it. If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the difference will be your taxable gain or loss. Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in February 1985 and sold them in July 1992 for Pounds 14,000. Multiplying the original cost by the February 1985 figure of 1.510 gives a total of Pounds 9,060. Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 14,000 gives a gain for tax purposes of Pounds 4,940 - which is below the 1992-93 Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax allowance. If you realised no other gains during the year, the profit should be tax-free. If you are selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    CGT INDEXATION ALLOWANCES: JULY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Month          1982     1983     1984     1985     1986     1987 January           -    1.680    1.598    1.522    1.442    1.388 February          -    1.673    1.592    1.510    1.437    1.382 March         1.747    1.670    1.587    1.496    1.435    1.380 April         1.713    1.647    1.566    1.464    1.421    1.363 May           1.701    1.640    1.560    1.458    1.419    1.362 June          1.696    1.636    1.556    1.455    1.419    1.362 July          1.695    1.627    1.558    1.457    1.423    1.363 August        1.695    1.620    1.543    1.454    1.419    1.359 September     1.696    1.613    1.540    1.454    1.412    1.355 October       1.687    1.607    1.531    1.452    1.410    1.349 November      1.679    1.602    1.526    1.447    1.398    1.342 December      1.682    1.597    1.527    1.445    1.393    1.344  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Month          1988     1989     1990     1991     1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January       1.344    1.250    1.162    1.066    1.024 February      1.338    1.242    1.155    1.060    1.018 March         1.333    1.236    1.143    1.056    1.015 April         1.312    1.214    1.110    1.043    1.000 May           1.307    1.207    1.100    1.040    1.000 June          1.302    1.203    1.096    1.035    1.000 July          1.301    1.202    1.095    1.037        - August        1.286    1.199    1.084    1.035        - September     1.280    1.190    1.073    1.031        - October       1.268    1.181    1.065    1.027        - November      1.262    1.171    1.068    1.024        - December      1.258    1.168    1.069    1.023        -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

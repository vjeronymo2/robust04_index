			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: Traders struggle to decipher smoke signals - Wall Street IT WAS not an auspicious start to the New Year. Three days of confused, directionless trading followed by a worrying 36-point drop in the Dow on Thursday that set alarm bells ringing on Wall Street. The only bright spot was the heavy trading volume (more than 300m shares changed hands on Thursday alone), which delighted the brokerage firms who earn commissions handling customers' orders. Yet the heavy volume may be a warning sign of sorts. Some analysts see it as a reflection of the indecisiveness that has plagued the market since the final days of last year. Investors are uncertain about the short-term direction of equities, so they have been frantically switching in and out of individual stocks or sectors in search of either growth opportunities or a safe haven. Many buyers were turning to small stocks for comfort - the Nasdaq composite index surged to a new record high mid week - but that was itself another cause for concern. Many Nasdaq stocks are regarded as speculative investments, and therefore more prone to sudden reversals of the kind that could trigger a market-wide retreat. The chief worry among investors is that with shares looking relatively expensive in relation to earnings and dividends, a substantial correction is around the next corner. That corner may, in fact, have already been turned. The plunge in stocks on Thursday was the market's steepest one-day loss in three months. By mid-morning yesterday, the Dow was another 30 points lower as the downward momentum began to build up. Although prices later recovered some of their lost ground, the market's mood remained fragile. Ironically, while stocks have stumbled, the economic fundamentals have continued to improve. The latest figures on construction spending this week showed a big increase consumer confidence also rose again, and there was a healthy drop in weekly state unemployment insurance claims. Although yesterday's December jobs report was a little disappointing - non-farm payrolls rose by 64,000, and not 80,000 as economists had predicted - the numbers were still moving in the right direction. There was also some good news from an international perspective, in the shape of Thursday's modest cut in German interest rates. The move raised hopes that the Bundesbank will begin to ease policy by degrees, a process which would help Europe's ailing economies and give a welcome lift to demand for US exports. In spite of the brightening economic backdrop, the stock markets remained glum. They were not helped by the threat of renewed conflict in the Middle East, nor by a steep plunge in government bond prices. The fall in bonds was a reaction to the economic figures and to competition from a big influx of new corporate debt. It was also a reflection of growing concern about the incoming President's willingness to tackle the federal budget deficit. The latter could become a significant factor in financial markets over the coming months. After the final budget figures of the Bush administration were released this week showing a likely 1993 deficit significantly larger than expected, President-elect Clinton quickly backed away from his campaign pledge to halve the deficit in four years. The back-pedalling frightened bond investors, who, in the aftermath of the election in November, were willing to give the Democrats the benefit of the doubt on deficit-reduction policies. The bond market's honeymoon with President-elect Clinton, however, is over, and sunny optimism has been replaced by suspicion. Any regular visitor to the US will have noticed that during weekdays the pavements outside big office buildings in some cities are often cluttered with people quietly puffing away on the cigarettes that they are not permitted to light in the warmth and comfort of their own offices. The sight could become even more familiar following the Environmental Protection Agency's decision this week to declare that 'passive', or 'second-hand' smoke is a significant carcinogen that causes about 3,000 deaths a year. Although tobacco companies contested the EPA's findings, concern about the legal implications of the agency's ruling, combined with rumours that New York legislators were considering doubling state cigarette taxes, provoked heavy selling of tobacco stocks. Philip Morris bore the brunt, partly because the company was also the subject of a brokers' report claiming that sales of its top brand cigarettes, Marlboro, have been slipping. On Wednesday, the stock hit a low of Dollars 71 3/4 , a steep decline from its September high of Dollars 86 5/8 , before enjoying a modest rally at the end of the week.  ------------------------------------------ Monday     3309.22   +    8.11 Tuesday    3307.87   -    1.35 Wednesday  3305.16   -    2.71 Thursday   3268.69   -   36.47 Friday     3251.67   -   17.29  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia plans to double oil and gas production ECOPETROL, THE Colombian state oil company, is planning to double oil and gas production in the next six years. To raise money for its ambitious programme the group will make its first ever Eurobond issue next month, according to Mr Juan Maria Rendon, company president. The Dollars 120m issue is the first step in a campaign to raise international finance to increase oil production from 450,000 barrels a day to 800,000 b/d. The group hopes to raise another Dollars 150m this year through selling off assets such as three electricity generating plants and its share in the gas distributing company. Mr Rendon said 'it's a big change in strategy. Historically we have invested only Dollars 200m pa - now we plan to be a big investor'. He said the company had taken the decision as a result of BP's Cusiana and Cupuagua finds, which doubled the country's reserves to 4bn barrels, and optimism about the Piedemonte field to their north. Under Colombian law once fields become commercial Ecopetrol has a half share in equity and development costs. According to Mr Rendon the costs of developing the fields to produce 400,000 b/d will reach Dollars 4bn. Ecopetrol's ability to invest has been hampered by heavy losses last year, largely caused by the bombing of pipelines by left wing terrorist groups, which disrupted production so severely that exports were suspended. Speaking of his plans to raise finance overseas, Mr Rendon said, 'we've found the oil, we have the reserves and the production capability and Colombia's good history of always honouring its debts. Now we must learn to sell ourselves'. He said the most critical issue was the construction of new pipelines. Most of those in place at present are joint ventures between Ecopetrol and the oil distribution companies, but according to Mr Rendon: 'Our priority is development of the field so we may be short of funds for pipelines in which case we will encourage the private sector to take a greater stake'. The private sector will also be asked to participate in the construction of several new gas pipelines to exploit reserves doubled by the new finds to between 7,000bn and 8,000bn cubic metres.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE SPARKS IN REP'S 'ORINOCO!' SPUTTER, FAIL TO IGNITE A FIRE  </P> <P> In "Orinoco!" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre, Mexican playwright Emilio  Carballido strands showgirls Fifi and Mina on a deserted boat careening down  the Orinoco River, and sets them to thinking about where they are going,  whether they will ever get there -- and if they really want to.  </P> <P> This constant wondering recalls Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" (now  playing at the Old Globe Theatre), in which the characters use their wait to  question the nature of reality and their role in it.  </P> <P> Like "Godot," "Orinoco!" is more than the story of its characters. It questions  the future of Latin America itself. Where is it headed? Has the pilot  figuratively left the ship, as he literally has in "Orinoco!"? Can this  struggling part of the world, like these down-on-their-luck performers, take  control of its own destiny?  </P> <P> As such, "Orinoco!" is a thoughtful addition to the bilingual Latino play  series that the Rep started with "I Don't Have to Show You No Stinkin' Badges"  two years ago and "Burning Patience" last year. ("Orinoco!" will be presented  in Spanish on July 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 29).  </P> <P> But, despite its humor, spunk and richness of philosophical allusion, it is by  far the least dramatic of the three. The pleasures of this two-woman play come  in fits and starts, and director Jorge Huerta never quite coaxes the parts into  a rhythm that flows.  </P> <P> Still, some of the moments are well worth waiting for. There is an anecdote  about flax blossoms, for example, that seems a poetic crystallization of the  eternal dialogue between the two halves of human nature -- the one that sees  the darkness foreshadowed in our final end, and the one that sees through the  veil of our end, the light of our beginnings.  </P> <P> Fifi, the showgirl who believes in the indomitability of life, tells the story  of the blossoms, which fight against despair when the scissors cut them down by  saying, "The best is yet to come."  </P> <P> Sure enough, the flax is woven into cloth that again seems doomed by the  scissors ("Just like life," Mina says dolefully), and then finds itself  transformed into beautiful linen shirts, then paper, then sparks that fly to  the heavens.  </P> <P> The challenge of two-person plays lies in whether the differences between the  two spark change or simply cancel each other out.  </P> <P> As touching as Ivonne Coll often is as the mournful Mina, she does not bring  enough life to a role whose whole purpose seems to be to throw cold water on  Fifi's dreams. The tempo sags to a stop when Jeannette Mirabal, as the brightly  festooned Fifi, dashes off stage to check on a prospective lover or the  temperature of the waiting champagne.  </P> <P> What we see when Fifi leaves is a burned-out Mina just about to sputter out.  What is missing are the glowing coals of Mina's former fire that Fifi is trying  to fan into a flame again.  </P> <P> D. Martyn Bookwalter's set, a curving ship, looks better than it plays. The  women don't seem to have room to do much more than steer the wheel or dance on  deck. It should be interesting to see how the set works when it's used again  for "Thin Air," the world premiere of the Lynne Alvarez play that moves into  the same design and space Aug. 8-27.  </P> <P> Peter Nordyke's spare lighting fails to suggest the colors of the brilliant  natural beauty that brings such joy to the women as they describe the sunrise.  The resulting starkness of the surroundings sadly parallels the starkness of  the drama on stage. Pretty as the sparks in "Orinoco!" are, they just don't add  up to a fire.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'ORINOCO!'  </P> <P> By Emilio Carballido. Translation by Margaret Sayers Peden.

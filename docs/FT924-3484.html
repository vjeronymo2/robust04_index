			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japan revises offer to open service industries JAPAN IS due today to present trading partners in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks with a revised offer to open up more than 100 service industries to greater foreign competition. Japanese officials said the move was an attempt to speed the time-consuming country-by-country negotiations on liberalising individual service sectors. The substance, if not the legal drafting, of each country's initial market-opening commitments on services must be completed by the end of this year if the target set for concluding the six-year-old Round is to be met. An agreed schedule of commitments is a condition for joining the proposed General Agreement on Trade in Services, which will extend fair trade rules to services for the first time. Some 60 countries (the European Community counting as one), accounting for more than 90 per cent of cross-border services trade, have made offers. But Japan's latest is the first to take the form of a draft schedule of commitments. Under pressure from trading partners, Japan has improved its original offer made early this year. In particular, it has dropped two of the six areas initially proposed for exemption from Most-Favoured-Nation treatment. Of the four that remain, the only one expected to come under challenge is that relating to legal consultancy services provided by foreign lawyers.</p>

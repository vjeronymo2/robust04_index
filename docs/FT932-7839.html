			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: St Petersburg Philharmonic - Concert The death of Tybalt is one of the most dramatic sections of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet, but this performance was determined to outdo any other. As the mortal blows struck, the conductor Mariss Jansons leapt in the air, slashing at each chord with vicious stabs of his baton, driving the music brutally, violently, decisively, to its grim and noisy conclusion. By the end Tybalt was well and truly dead. That was the spine-tingling end to the first half of the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra's concert on Wednesday. It was the orchestra's only appearance in London on this tour and so there should not have been any empty seats - certainly not the rows of vacant places visible upstairs at the Barbican. Surely the message has got round that this is still a marvellous orchestra and Jansons a conductor unrivalled today for sheer excitement? Any implication that their performances together are merely over-dramatised must quickly be put to rest. The Prokofiev was high on adrenalin, as was Rakhmaninov's Second Symphony after the interval, but half the intensity comes from the scrupulous way in which Jansons has rehearsed the orchestra, so that every note, every dot and dash of the score is in the right place. (I do not refer here to the cuts in the symphony's finale, where many pages were missing completely.) The ensemble was exact. The inner ear of the orchestra balances the music superbly. Yet for much of the evening the playing sounded mushy. Why? Part of the reason will probably have been the unusual layout of the instruments, which put first violins and basses (top and bottom of the aural spectrum) on the left, middle strings and brass together on the right - an arrangement which clearly did not work. The rest, I fear, was down to the Barbican's acoustics, which not for the first time scuppered a visiting orchestra's best efforts. It was very noticeable that nothing sounded better than the opening of the slow movement, where the exemplary solo clarinet was accompanied by rustling violas and pizzicato basses. As soon as the rest of the orchestra came in, clarity and focus of sound were lost as cross-echoes bounced back and forth. For a performance of this symphony that had passion, lack of indulgence, an absolute grip on the music from first to last, it would be difficult to improve upon this conductor and the St Petersburg Philharmonic. If only the swashbuckling Jansons could have slayed the Barbican acoustics while he was about it.</p>

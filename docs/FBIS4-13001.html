			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Suspicious Conduct of the Russians Will </F> Prove Costly for Armenia"]    [Text] With the experts group's conclusion of its work and  the Foreign Ministry's dissemination of its official statement  on the downing of the Iranian cargo plane by Armenian  antiaircraft missiles, the technical aspects of the incident are  clearer. At first glance, it appears that due to laxity on the  part of the navigation facilities in the region, especially the  Yerevan facility, and the lack of serious and responsible  support for the aircraft resulted in it deviating from its  course into the war zone, where it ultimately was downed by the  Armenians.    In any case, Armenia is responsible for this incident  because  the Georgian air control facility reported that it had safely  guided the aircraft into Armenian airspace, so whatever occurred  thereafter was the responsibility of Armenia as the host country.    There are certain other clues that point to a second  possibility--that is, that the downing of the plane was not an  accident but a preplanned plot. If this hypothesis is assumed  to be correct, we have to consider who stood to gain from such  an incident.    It appears that the Armenians do not stand to gain, for this  would only result in straining relations with the Islamic  Republic of Iran and generate mistrust between the two  neighbors. Therefore, such an act would not seem to be to  Armenia's benefit. On the other hand, even though Azerbaijan  stands to benefit from any worsening of relations between Iran  and Armenia, in this particular case it could not have been able  to interfere as the air corridors are designated by Russia,  Georgia, Iran, and Armenia.    However, for quite some time Russia has considered this area  its domain; and now that these countries have gained  independence Russia's interests lie in the continuation of a  state of instability and insecurity in the region so that it can  use this as a pretext to justify the presence of its forces. On  the other hand, it is possible the Russians refuse to remain  passive while there is a growing trend of friendship and trust  between Iran and regional countries such as Georgia, Azerbaijan,  and Armenia, especially since at the same time these countries'  displeasure with Russia is growing. Perhaps it is within the  framework of these factors that we should view the growing  unrest in that region and the fomenting of crises in order to  erode the trust between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the  rest of the region.    If we view the downing of the Iranian cargo airplane from  this angle, there is much evidence to bolster this theory.  First of all, news reports cite Moscow airport as saying that  the flight route of the Iranian aircraft was suspicious, passing  in the vicinity of the war zone--that is, the corridor  [preceding word in English] over Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and  Iran. The other corridor, which is the safe one and the one  normally used--passing over Russia, Azerbaijan, and the Caspian  Sea--goes over Baku and the Caspian Sea and is far away from the  war zone.    If an airplane were to develop the slightest technical  problem while transiting the Georgia-Armenia corridor it would  stray into the dangerous war zone of Nagorno-Karabakh. Proof of  this is that when this happened to some airplanes earlier,  Russia and Yerevan were able to inform the commander of the  Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh immediately and thus  forestall the downing of those aircraft. In this particular  case, the navigation facility did not act as responsibly as  before and simply let the aircraft remain in this dangerous zone.    The other proof, which is stronger than all the other  evidence, is that less than 24 hours after the incident the  Russians presented a detailed report by their military experts  on the downing, which was carried by ITAR-TASS. This report  attempted to disseminate for the first time at the regional and  international levels a false and baseless rumor that the Iranian  aircraft was on an espionage mission over Nagorno-Karabakh.    From the technical and practical point of view, this rumor  is  quite ridiculous, as the Iranian aircraft was only carrying  family members of high-level Iranian diplomats and of some  military personnel. It had remained on the ground in Moscow for  three days prior to the flight and was directed toward Armenia  by Moscow. What is interesting is that the pilot requested  permission for an emergency landing at an Armenian airport. How  could an airplane that had remained on the ground in Moscow for  three days and later requested permission to land at an Armenian  airport be on an espionage assignment against Armenians?  Therefore, this preliminary report confirms the spuriousness of  this rumor disseminated by the Russians.    In view of the extensive bureaucracy [preceding word in  English] that we know characterizes the Russian system, how did  the Russians obtain an expert analysis of the issue and manage  to fabricate a rumor and even disseminate it so quickly by means  of the ITAR-TASS news agency at the regional and international  levels? All this points a premeditated plan with the specific  objective of undermining trust and generating an atmosphere of  suspicion in the region. It is also possible that this detailed  report by ITAR-TASS had been prepared earlier.    Thus, on the basis of the information gleaned, the relevant  high-level Iranian officials have contacted the Russian  authorities to protest such troublemaking and ask them to deny  the rumor publicly. The Russians expressed regret at the  dissemination of this false rumor at the meeting, but not only  did they not take any steps to issue a public denial, they even  attempted to play up the issue in various ways in the Russian  newspapers. Just yesterday [30 March] another Russian newspaper  fanned this rumor once again. Therefore, the speed with which  the rumor was concocted and disseminated and the Russian  officials' insistence on spreading the rumor confirms the  scenario of a there being a premeditated plot with regard to  this painful incident.    The above points should be taken seriously into account.  Armenia must be vigilant, and regardless of whether it was a  premeditated plot against the Armenian regime or the result of  carelessness on the part of the Armenian system in general the  Armenian government should decide independently as a reliable  neighbor to take responsibility for the incident. In a sincere  and farsighted manner, it should try to pacify this great  neighboring nation [of Iran] and should strive to restore and  consolidate once again the mutual trust between our two nations.  Otherwise, this incident will continue to fester painfully like  a sharp bone protruding from a wound, and will prove costly for  Armenia, all because of its irresponsible neighbor [Russia).</p>

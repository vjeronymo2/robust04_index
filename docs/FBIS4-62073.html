			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuliya Kantor report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Borovoy </F> Wants To Be President"]    [Text] "My name will emerge in the lists of candidates for  the presidency in the upcoming elections because a refusal to  contest them would be immoral," Konstantin Borovoy, leader of  the Economic Freedom Party [EFP], who arrived in St. Petersburg  yesterday, said in a meeting with journalists. The centerpiece  of the visit will be talks about the implementation of the EFP's  project to lift out of the crisis the country's air space  industry, whose main centers are located, in particular, in St.  Petersburg and in northwestern Russia. Regarding the situation  in the country, Konstantin Borovoy described the just signed  agreement on public accord as "the most cynical action  conceivable." The EFP leader, who thinks that currently the  Russian Government is pursuing an anti-market policy, said in  that respect that he would "not join the Chernomyrdin  government" under any circumstances.</p>

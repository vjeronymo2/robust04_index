			<p>Started   <F P=102>   43070038A Tokyo NASDA REPORT in English Summer 1993 p 12 --  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070038A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NASDA REPORT </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO     [Text] Commercial nickel-hydrogen batteries which are  replaceable with nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries have been put  to wide use for personal computers, cordless telephones, etc.  The batteries have an electrode containing hydrogen occulsion  alloy instead of the cadmium electrode of Ni-Cd batteries and  are called Ni-MH (Metal Hydride) batteries. Their internal  reaction is similar to that of the Ni-Cd batteries developed for  space use with one difference. Hydrogen generated when they  charge and discharge is stored as high-pressure gas in Ni-Cd  batteries, but in Ni-MH batteries, the hydrogen is absorbed in  the hydrogen occulsion alloy.    Hydrogen occulsion alloy can absorb a volume of hydrogen  1,000 times its own volume and produce metal hydride. This new  material can release absorbed hydrogen and was developed 20  years ago. Its applications include hydrogen storage and heat  pumps which utilize heat generation and release associated with  hydrogen absorption and release, but its widest application has  been in batteries.    Ni-MH batteries are similar to Ni-Cd batteries and  Ni-H[.sub]2[/] batteries which were previously developed for  space use. Their applicability began being evaluated two years  ago using small commercial batteries. The evaluation results  were very satisfactory, and batteries with characteristics  superior to those of Ni-Cd batteries can be expected.    Full-scale research was started in FY 1992 based on the  above  evaluation results, and 35 AH batteries were trial-produced  utilizing space-use Ni-Cd battery technology. The energy density  of the trial-produced cells was 20 percent better in both weight  and volume than that of Ni-Cd battery cells to be used  Engineering Test Satellite-VI (ETS-VI) and the Advanced Earth  Observing Satellite (ADEOS). Additional scale and weight  reduction can be expected.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-51A>      Trial-Produced Cell </FIG>     It should be possible to produce excellent space-use Ni-MH  batteries by evaluating their characteristics on a long-term  basis and reflecting the results in advanced improvements of  characteristics such as service life extension. Japan is leading  the world in Ni-MH battery technology and will promote advanced  research and development in this area will be promoted by  accumulating experience with these batteries on board small  satellites.</p>

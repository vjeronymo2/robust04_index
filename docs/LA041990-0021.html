			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NECESSITY OF RELIGION;  </P> <P> HIGH COURT SAYS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS A LUXURY -- WRONG  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court's decision Tuesday to strip religious believers whose  practices violate certain general laws of the constitutional protection they  now enjoy is more than a sweeping repudiation of nearly a century of humane and  enlightened legal precedent. It is an affront both to our society's hard-won  pluralism and to the belief in limited government that distinguishes principled  conservatism from mere reaction.  </P> <P> The case at issue -- Employment Division, State of Oregon vs. Smith -- involved  two Indians, members of the Native American Church, who were dismissed from  their jobs as drug counselors in a state program after they admitted eating  peyote during a religious ceremony. The court upheld the dismissal. But rather  than stopping there, the author of the majority opinion, Justice Antonin  Scalia, set down a new standard for application of the First Amendment to  conflicts between religious practice and general laws.  </P> <P> In a line of decisions dating back to the First World War, the court had held  that when such conflicts occur, the individual's right to religious freedom  must prevail unless the state asserts an even more "compelling interest," such  as enforcement of health and safety laws on religious schools. On Tuesday, the  court set that standard aside and ruled that general laws will be presumed  valid even if they seriously infringe on the exercise of religious freedom.  Only those statutes intended to repress a particular creed, the court held, are  prohibited by the First Amendment. The United States, Justice Scalia wrote,  "cannot afford the luxury" of setting laws aside simply because they restrict  religious practices. This new standard, he wrote, "will place at a relative  disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in, but that  unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system  in which each conscience is law."  </P> <P> The Founders, of course, envisioned no such system but one in which the law  made room for the expression of individual conscience, and in which the ability  of the democratic majority to tyrannize the minority was restrained by an  inviolable Bill of Rights, the first of which was freedom of religion. Through  much of our history, much of that charter has remained an ideal rather than a  reality, particularly when it comes to the free exercise of religion. Scalia  himself is the product of a parochial educational system created because  19th-Century public schools subjected the children of Catholic immigrants to  instruction in the majority's Protestant religion. The largely successful  struggle to make liberty of conscience a functional reality rather than a  constitutional ideal is one of the glories of 20th-Century America.  </P> <P> The court's decision to turn its back on such an achievement at precisely the  moment that this nation is attempting to come to terms with unprecedented  ethnic and religious diversity is pure legal adventurism.  </P></p>

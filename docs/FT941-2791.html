			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gains trimmed at close of a nervous session - Market Report Another nervous session in UK equities saw early confidence challenged in the final hour of trading when both government bonds and stock index futures ran into selling pressure. Securities markets accepted with good grace the Bundesbank's decision to keep its key interest rates unchanged, and at first responded well to favourable indications on US inflation from the Philadelphia Reserve Board. But the readiness of investors to sell into a brief advance in gilt-edged securities seemed to disclose underlying nervousness over interest rates. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,255.7 for a gain of 12.8 on the day. The market peaked at Footsie 3,262.9 just before the announcement from the Bundesbank, and came back smartly for a while as it digested the decision of the German central bank to leave both the Lombard and discount rates unchanged - as well as giving no information on the next repo tender. Few analysts had counted seriously on any reduction in German discount rate, while any change in the Lombard rate would have been of largely cosmetic significance. Consequently, share prices soon steadied in London and began to move higher again as Wall Street responded favourably to the news from the Philadelphia Reserve Board. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost its early gain, however, to show little change from overnight when London closed down for the day. More importantly, UK bonds turned down and quickly showed that they still have the power to upset the stock market. Traders stressed that the pressures associated with the expiry this morning of the FT-SE 100 Index March contract were affecting share prices last night. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, unaffected by expiry considerations, slipped 3.8 to 3,886.6. Seaq volume remained fairly high, at 659.4m shares; on Wednesday, 625.5m shares were traded through the Seaq electronic network, returning a retail, or customer, value of Pounds 1.46bn. Company news continued to provide many individual features but gave less guide to the market as a whole. Reuters, the global business information group, improved on the news that it has revised its Globex contract with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. But the early gain in the shares was later reduced. The Footsie was helped by firmness in the pharmaceuticals, as well as by indications of a strengthening market for oil shares. Good trading volumes in equities continued to indicate that the institutions are not net sellers of UK shares but are busy reshuffling portfolios in response to the sharp rise in yields in the bond markets. Dividend-yielding stocks found buyers again, with Schroders, the London merchant bank, again providing a good lead for the financial sectors. With the Bundesbank now unlikely to make any definitive move on interest rates for a month, attention is expected to refocus on the US Federal Reserve, which is still expected to tighten credit policy. UK equities have shown this week that they are still highly vulnerable to moves in the London bond markets. However, the stock market is expected to be preoccupied today with the effects of the futures settlements on both sides of the Atlantic. In London, there were signs that futures traders appeared unwilling to extend positions into the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index.</p>

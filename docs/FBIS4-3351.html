			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Zengrong (6735 1073 2837): "Forecast of Trends in </F> Major Materials Supply and Demand in 1994"]    [Text] China's quick economic growth rate and speedy  development during 1992 ushered in a full boom in the markets  for the means of production and prices have since been rising  since then at a dazzling speed. In the first half of 1993, the  total supply and demand of most materials were roughly in  balance and a relatively high growth in total sales could still  be maintained. There were three major characteristics in the  price changes: First, prices increased monthly, peaking in  June. Second, the prices of capital goods [tou zi xing wu zi  2121 6327 7352 3670 6327] rocketed, representing 90 percent of  the total price increases. Third, the prices of seven major  categories of materials (excepting chemicals) rose by varying  degrees. Since July, when the State's macroeconomic regulatory  measures were introduced, the shortages of materials have been  alleviated and prices have fallen slightly and tended to be  stable.    What changes will there be in the supply and demand of  materials in 1994? What will the trends be? The following are  our views:  <H5>  I. The General Situation of Materials Supply and Demand in </H5> 1994    First, total demand will not decrease.    1. The macroeconomic regulation and control this time is a  structural readjustment and a change in the investment direction  and flow volume of capital, not total retrenchment. Therefore,  the ultimate demand of the means of production will not  decrease. It is only a question of time difference.    2. In 1994, the total demand will grow on the basis of 1993  and the investment scale will not be smaller than in 1993,  coupled with such factors as the undampened investment incentive  of the localities and the belated effects of macroeconomic  regulation and control. Thus, the demand will not decrease  considerably in 1994.    3. The infrastructural projects initiated in 1993 constitute  a very big demand market and will play an important part in the  total demand for materials in 1994.    Second, the prices of the means of production will tend to  be  stable or on the rise.    1. The push from costs keeps the means of production prices  high. The continuously increasing costs and lowering profits of  productive enterprises prevent product prices from being lowered  and this, in turn, keeps the prices of the means of production  from plummeting.    2. Prices are influenced by the regulation and control of  the state's macroeconomic policy. The fact that one-third of  the coal output under unified distribution has had price  controls lifted, that the iron and steel industry has resolved  the question of "market price and fixed price," and that oil,  electricity, and transportation industries have cut rising  costs, coupled with the cancellation of the state's mandatory  distribution plans for eight types of materials and the removal  of all their price controls, will have an influence on the  prices of the means of production.    3. The fact that the state is importing large quantities of  materials from abroad will cause the prices of some means of  production to stabilize and pick up.    Third, communications and transportation and capital input  are major factors affecting the materials supply-demand balance.    Communications and transportation are not developing very  quickly at the present time so that ships are too plentiful,  ports are inadequate, and traffic congestion has obviously  increased. Railway freight transportation in general can only  meet less than 70 percent of the total need and in some places,  only 40 percent or so. It is also worrying that ports are  seriously inadequate for sea transportation. The transportation  capacity is so low that it will not improve in the near future  and will probably get worse, directly affecting the materials  balance across the country which, in turn, will cause price  fluctuations everywhere.    Despite the fact that China can maintain a strong national  economy and has a large demand for the means of production,  serious fund shortages will weaken the purchasing, selling, and  stocking power of enterprises. China is not only short of  renminbi but also of foreign currencies. First, since imported  goods have doubly increased, the foreign exchange needed has  increased and there are difficulties in pooling foreign  exchange. Second, since the foreign exchange supply-demand gap  has widened, coupled with the role of the market, the renminbi  exchange rates will probably fall and, since the prices of major  raw materials on the international market have risen because  China bought large quantities of them in the earlier period, the  operational risks have increased. Therefore, although a general  balance between the supply and demand of materials has been  reached, the foundation for the balance is very weak and is  restricted by the transportation "bottlenecks" and by the  pooling of funds.  <H5>  II. Predictions For Major Materials in 1994 </H5>   First, there will be coal supply shortages and coal prices  will increase. Affected by the changing prices of coal and  transportation, and by the cancellation of the preferential  policy for market coal, coal prices will rise considerably and  the difference between the planned price and outside-the-plan  price will continue to narrow. Owing to the inadequate  transportation capacity, the difference between coal prices in  northern and southern China will become more obvious and coal  prices in coastal areas will rise gradually and in a staircase  shape. There are two reasons for this:    1. The year 1993 was crucial for the coal industry in  curbing losses and this implies that coal prices have entered  the stage of substantive increase and that it is an inevitable  trend that costs will push up coal prices in eastern and  southern coastal areas.    2. The fact that the state will cut back on credit will  probably make coal-producing enterprises quicken the recovery of  money from sales. The inadequate railway transportation  capacity will probably lead to coal shortages and an increase in  coal prices.    Second, there will be a basic balance in the supply and  demand of steel products.    Affected by the investment scale and retrenchment, the  rising  demand for steel products will be weakened. In addition to  selling large quantities of hoarded resources, prices will tend  to be stable and slightly lower and the decrease in the prices  of construction materials will be comparatively obvious. Due to  the sudden heating of the machine tools market, steel products  for production use tend to be in short supply and market  supplies of silicon steel and bearing steel are also in short  supply. Their supplies will continue to be inadequate in 1994  and steel products for production use are expected to rise  considerably with each tonne fluctuating between 3,000 and 3,500  yuan. The entire price situation is that steel prices are lower  in coastal areas and southern China than in inland areas and  northern China.    Third, there is a shortage of timber resources and prices  are  consistently high.    In 1993, the total timber output was planned at 56.34  million  cubic meters but the total demand grew by 23 percent. In the  long term, whether domestic or international timber resources,  they are inadequate. Moreover, hoping to reduce losses, timber  distribution departments in all localities have sold most of  their stock at reduced prices with the result that stock has  decreased by 20.1 percent, making it more difficult to fill the  timber-shortages gap in 1994. In the meantime, affected by  world timber shortage and the frantic increases in prices,  timber prices in 1994 are expected to be consistently high.    Fourth, cement demand will slightly decrease and the price  differences between regions are obvious.    Because fixed assets investments are being reduced and real  estate development is being slowed down, cement demand and  supply tends to be stable and prices are decreasing. However,  since the state has delegated the power of fixing cement prices  to productive enterprises in eastern China, northeastern China,  and Hunan, coupled with the shortages of high-grade and  special-grade cement in the cement markets and with the drive  from the construction projects already launched, supplies will  tend to be short in the second half of 1994 and prices will  gradually rise.    Fifth, nonferrous metals are regulated by the market and  their supply and demand are stable.    Since the Shanghai Metal Exchange was established, the  nonferrous metals market is already linked to the international  market and has been developing well on a daily basis. In  addition to meeting market demand, nonferrous metal resources  also play a role in guiding and stabilizing market prices. In  1994, affected by fund shortages and exchange rates, the  domestic nonferrous metals market will not fluctuate very much  as a result of the resources shortages and market prices will  fall steadily.    Sixth, petroleum products will rise steadily.    From 1994 onward, the state will only use fuels under the  plan in key industries such as the defense industry, fertilizer  production, and electricity generation, while oil for other  sectors will basically have price controls lifted. In addition,  the increased output of Middle East oil and Iraq's restoration  of oil exports, strike a balance between oil supply and demand  on the international market and oil prices are decreasinging.  This is favorable for China to import oil to make up for the  shortage of local resources caused by the inadequate  transportation capacity. Moreover, affected by the  international market, oil prices on China's market will also  begin to fall. Therefore, supply and demand in 1994 will be  stable in the domestic oil products market and their prices will  fluctuate by a small margin. Gasoline prices will remain at the  1993 level but diesel oil prices will increase due to inadequate  supplies as the state increases agricultural investment.    Seventh, chemical raw materials will be less in demand.    Since there is a certain degree of inertia in the growth of  the speedily growing light industry, the following trends will  appear in the chemical products market in 1994:    1. The supply of chemical products made from grain will  become inadequate. The supply-demand contradictions in such  chemical products as alcohol glacial acetic acid and acetone  will be salient and their prices will be consistently high.    2. The shortage of titanium white powder will affect the  entire paint industry.    3. Various types of rubber will continue to be in great  demand, especially synthetic rubber.    4. Some products made from calcium carbide will be in great  demand.    5. The short supply of methanol and methylamine will be  alleviated.    6. The supply of pure benzene, toluene, and dimethylbenzene  will be obviously short in some southern areas, while their  shortages in other areas will tend not to be alleviated.    7. The market prices of raw materials for plastic production  such as high-pressure polyethylene, low-pressure polyethylene,  and polypropylene will tend to be lower.    8. Demand in the auto market will be stable while the  contradictions in its product mix will be salient.    Since the second half of 1993, the cutback on purchases,  retrenchment, and funds shortages have checked the excessive  expansion of the auto market. In 1994, supply will be slightly  greater than demand in the auto market but it will generally  tend to develop steadily, competition will be intensified, and  the contradictions in the product mix will be very salient. The  heavy truck market will be promising, medium-sized trucks will  probably sell fairly well, sedan sales will be both gratifying  and worrying, deluxe imported sedans will sell comparatively  well, the prices of medium- and low-grade trucks will tend to be  stable, and some low-grade trucks will be overstocked.</p>

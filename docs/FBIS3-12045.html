			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the review of the 29 March issue of GRANMA] </F>   [Excerpt] Good morning to all our listeners. On its front  page, GRANMA carries remarks by Pedro Ross Leal, who says the  response to the Parliaments in the Workplace assemblies cannot  be just explanations but must be solutions. These assemblies sum  up the workers' political line and the spirit that must be  implemented, said Ross Leal at the end of the provincial  assessment of the recommendations that will be submitted to the  National Assembly [of the People's Government] by the workers  movement.    The national committee of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC]  will meet this afternoon to analyze the ensemble of proposals  made by Cuban workers throughout the country.    Another GRANMA article reports that the Republic of Cuba  will  decorate a group of outstanding youngsters from throughout the  nation. These young people will receive the Order of Julio  Antonio Mella and the Abel Santamaria and Jose Antonio  Echeverria medals. This activity is part of the homage paid on  the 32d and 33d anniversaries, respectively, of the Union of  Young Communists [UJC] and Jose Marti Pioneers Organization.  This ceremony will be held in San Pedro, Havana Province, the  place where Jose Marti died.    Also, the objective of the Zambian foreign minister's visit  to our country at the invitation of his Cuban counterpart is to  prepare the forthcoming visit to Cuba by Zambia's president and  to develop ties of cooperation between the two countries.

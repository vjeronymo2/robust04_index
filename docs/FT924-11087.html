			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Exports provide slight relief for manufacturers THE Confederation of British Industry's latest survey of Britain's manufacturing sector contains only two optimistic notes on the economy - prospects for exports have improved and inflation remains subdued. All other indicators point to a further slowdown in manufacturing output. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said: 'Manufacturing industry is clearly very depressed and there is little sign of an increase in activity, with conditions remaining difficult both at home and abroad. 'This recession carries greater risks for industry than the 1980/81 recession did,' he added, warning that industry was having to cut costs dangerously 'close to the bone'. The results of the quarterly survey of industrial trends, which covers 1,308 companies employing 2m people, showed a sharp fall in manufacturers' optimism about the general business situation. Manufacturing orders and output also fell in the past four months, making this the eleventh successive quarterly survey to show a fall in production. The results tied in with the gloomy findings of a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce last week, which suggested that business slid into a second leg of recession last month. The good news from the survey was that sterling's depreciation since Black Wednesday, September 16, has boosted manufacturers' hopes for higher exports in the coming year. One third of the manufacturers surveyed said they were now more optimistic about export prospects. But while export sentiment staged its sharpest improvement since July 1987, recent political turmoil, including the upset of Black Wednesday, caused business confidence to weaken severely. Only 12 per cent of businesses were optimistic about the general business situation, against 35 per cent who were gloomy. Manufacturers expect orders and output to continue falling over the next four months in spite of the improvement in export prospects. Although the survey was carried out after the first of two recent cuts in base rates, manufacturers were unconvinced about an economic recovery. Sir David said industry was suffering from an acute lack of confidence and that this justified a further reduction in interest rates. Over the past four months 41 per cent of companies reported that total new orders were down, against only 13 per cent which registered an improvement. Output has also fallen sharply since July, with 35 per cent of companies reporting a fall compared with 10 per cent reporting an increase. Nine out of 10 companies said the lack of orders was the factor most likely to limit output in the next four months, the highest figure for almost 10 years. The outlook for employment was particularly dismal. The number of people employed in manufacturing industry continued to fall in the past four months, at a faster rate than anticipated. The July survey had expected unemployment growth to slow down. The CBI said it now expected manufacturing employment to fall by 25,000 a month at least until the end of the year. Inflationary pressures remain very weak in spite of sterling's devaluation. The survey recorded the highest number of companies reducing domestic prices since the late 1950s. Export prices have also declined in the past four months, with 22 per cent reporting a fall and only 6 per cent an increase. Unit costs fell for the first time since the survey began in June 1958. The survey showed that costs per unit of output had fallen for 22 per cent of companies over the past four months compared with 17 per cent reporting an increase. Only a slight rise in costs is anticipated in the next four months. The survey pointed towards further retrenchment on capital spending. Investment intentions have weakened to their lowest level since July last year and fewer companies are expecting to authorise increased spending on buildings, plant and machinery over the next 12 months. More than half of the companies surveyed cited uncertainty about demand as the factor most likely to limit investment spending and 41 per cent cited inadequate net returns as a constraint. Sir David said that the government needed to initiate a more open discussion of monetary policy. 'We need to have a broadly based discussion about ways in which other institutions might participate in directing monetary policy. The outcome of such discussions could be some form of independent central bank,' he said. The CBI said it did not favour an early return to the European exchange rate mechanism. A survey published yesterday by the Finance and Leasing Association showed that only 29 per cent of its members expected any improvement in business confidence this year, down from 61 per cent three months ago.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Treasury officials to spend two years in private sector THE TREASURY is to make fast-stream officials spend two years in private-sector companies as a condition for promotion to senior levels of the Civil Service. Its policy co-ordinating management board, chaired by Sir Terence Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, decided that civil servants approaching assistant secretary level should leave the Great George Street department in Whitehall for two-year secondments to companies throughout the UK. The development comes as Britain's monetary authorities, the Treasury and the Bank of England, struggle to overcome criticism that they are out of touch with industry. It amounts to an acknowledgement that most Treasury officials have spent their careers within Whitehall and lack experience of the commercial world that depends on their policies. Of the eight most senior Treasury officials, only Sir Nigel Wicks, Sir Alan Hardcastle and Mr Alan Budd have worked in the private sector. The rest have spent their careers either in government or academia. The system of secondments will complement a recent decision that top Treasury officials should spend one day a year visiting UK companies. It should help to shrug off the department's remote image by underscoring its commitment to developing stronger links with business. The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the move. 'The CBI supports the principle of increased contact between Treasury officials and the private sector, believing it will promote greater interchange and understanding of each other's methods and requirements,' it said. The system of secondments will affect about 85 civil servants, the most successful of whom reach assistant secretary level in their mid-thirties. It should cost industry nothing, in that the officials' salaries will continue to be paid by the government. The Treasury yesterday described the innovation as a 'fairly big change. Resources and logistics permitting, it should affect about half our staff.' About half of Treasury officials come to the department with some sort of outside experience already.</p>

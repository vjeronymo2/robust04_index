			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Patrol" newscast] </F>   [Text] Alirio Cifuentes, secretary of the Judicial Branch  Workers Union [STOJ], says that peasants who have loans with the  Penny Foundation [Fundacion del Centavo] will not budge from the  U.S. embassy until their problems are definitively resolved.    [Begin Cifuentes recording] The peasants who arrived from  different communities are still standing across from the U.S.  Embassy building, waiting for an answer from delegates appointed  by the president of the Republic to mediate the conflict. The  meeting is taking place at the Labor Ministry with the  participation of the labor and agriculture ministers, a human  rights ombudsman delegate, and, of course, delegates from the  Penny Foundation, AID, and STOJ.    The worrisome part of this issue is that the U.S. Embassy  has  refused to examine the conflict in a reasonable manner. AID is  part of the United States of America, it is part of the U.S.  Embassy, and if AID donated $11 million to the Penny Foundation  to set the land project in motion, we cannot explain why it is  now claiming that it is not in any way involved in the conflict,  which it says is strictly between the STOJ, peasants, and the  Penny Foundation.    The embassy tells us that if there are any problems we  should  file a lawsuit at the competent courts but our position is that  the funds donated to the Penny Foundation should be supervised  by AID, which is part of the U.S. Embassy.

			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> AIRPORT CHOICE: Portreros Los Pinos, a high plateau in the Cleveland National  Forest near Ortega Highway, will be a coalition group's top recommendation for  a new regional airport, sources say. . . . The site -- one of four to be  offered to the Board of Supervisors soon after the first of the year -- would  be the most accessible to the majority of Orange County residents. The group's  second choice will be South Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. . . . Even an  expanded John Wayne Airport will be seriously overmatched by the air traffic  over Orange County in the 1990s. Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

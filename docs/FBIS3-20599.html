The experts who presented the forum expressed  deep concerns about the current status of Xinjiang's production  of fine wool, which has been in continuous decline in recent  years.    In their introduction, relevant people explained that fine  wool is chiefly used for supplying the raw materials in wool  spinning. In the last two years, lower wool prices plus part of  the wool being kept in storage has dampened the enthusiasm of  local cadres and masses of herdsmen for producing fine wool. But  on the other hand, mutton prices rose repeatedly in 1993.  Because the cost of raising fine wool sheep is a bit higher than  for local wool sheep, there appeared a trend of ignoring fine  wool sheep production, even to the point of not buying male  sheep for stud and rejecting artificial insemination. This  caused a backward trend in varietal improvement while resulting  in a great number of stud male sheep being in stock.    All of the sheep-raising experts making presentations were  deeply upset about fine wool sheep suffering such cold  treatment. Xinjiang has 40 years of history of improving fine  wool sheep varieties, starting in the fifties, and it has  reached today's level only after several generations' of hard  work. Raising fine wool sheep is an industry of excellence in  Xinjiang, and it holds first place nationally, regardless of  whether one speaks of quantity or quality; if we lose this  dominant position, the dominant position of Xinjiang's husbandry  will be lost with it, and the region's wool spinning industry,  with over 100,000 spindles will be in the bad situation of  lacking raw materials.    Research Fellow Yang Erji [2799 1422 3444], formerly  Assistant Director of the Autonomous Region's Institute of  Animal Husbandry, 1422 3444) believes that mutton production and  fine wool sheep production should be given equal attention, with  no partiality to either side. We must not lose confidence  because of the current temporary slump in the wool market, but  must take the long view. The wool spinning industry has  developed very rapidly in China, with the nation having to spend  $600 million importing 150,000 tons of wool. This demonstrates  that it there is not too much, but far from enough. We should  take development of fine wool sheep and protection of our  national wool production as long term and difficult assignments  for China and Xinjiang. Also, when we speak of increasing the  quantity of mutton, doing a good job of raising fine wool sheep  can be an important way of easing the demand for mutton in  Xinjiang.    Of course, future development should pursue the goal of  improving the quality of fine wool, or else a great deal of  foreign wool will come in after we have joined GATT, and  Xinjiang's fine wool will probably be defeated. We especially  should popularize Chinese Meilinu sheep, setting out a goal  higher than the more than one million Meilinu sheep which this  established breeding system attained some time ago. Meanwhile,  we should take full advantage of our natural grasslands for  feed; strengthen feed supplements in winter and spring, taking  crude feed as the major feed, cutting down on the use of fine  feed to reduce feed costs for fine wool sheep. At the same time,  we should grant such favoritism as a husbandry industry  insurance system, a variety of tax rates, etc. Adopting these  protective measures will reverse the declining situation of fine  wool sheep production in Xinjiang in the fastest possible time,  and create a wonderful future for fine wook sheep production.</p>

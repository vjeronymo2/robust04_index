			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK set to take initiative over strengthening force in Bosnia The British government said yesterday it intended to take the initiative in international efforts to provide more troops for the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. In spite of the misgivings of several members of his cabinet, Mr John Major, the prime minister, all but committed Britain to providing extra troops. Mr Major said that Sir David Hannay, Britain's ambassador at the UN, had last night begun a series of meetings in New York with other potential contributors to co-ordinate the effort. Ambassadors of the countries with troops in Bosnia and Croatia, including the UK, France, Canada and Spain, will be at the meetings, along with the US, which has a few troops in Macedonia. General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander of the forces in Bosnia, called last week for an additional 10,000 troops to consolidate the UN's recent successes in establishing truces between Bosnian Serb, Moslem and Croat forces in Sarajevo and other Bosnian areas. In what amounted to a sharp reversal of policy, Mr Major said: 'What we are seeking to do is to try to reinforce the UN's own efforts by promoting a coherent and urgent and positive response to their appeal for more troops.' He indicated that he expected France and the US to be represented at the New York talks, adding: 'I think there are a wide range of countries that may be able to help. We have been in contact with a lot of them.' Senior Whitehall officials said the change of heart had been in response to the rapidly changing situation on the ground in Bosnia. The ceasefire in Sarajevo needed consolidation and the UN wanted to build on its more recent successes in Srebrenica and Tuzla. The officials said that Britain would be able to provide an additional battalion - between 900 and 1,200 soldiers - if its international allies agreed a concerted move to bolster the UN forces. Mr Major accepts that the US administration is unlikely to drop its fierce opposition to the early commitment of US ground troops. But Sir David will be pressing France and Britain's other European partners to increase their effort significantly. The UK's efforts to increase the number of troops in Bosnia coincides with a push by the US to try to involve Serbia in talks between Bosnian Croats, Moslems and Croatian government officials in Vienna. Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to former Yugoslavia, will travel to Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade, the Serbian capital, where he is expected to meet the president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. 'Everybody know that there can be no overall agreement without the Serbs,' a western diplomat close to the Vienna negotiations said yesterday.</p>

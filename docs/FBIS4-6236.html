			<p>BFN     [Text] This news is just in. College students in Seoul and  Kwangju Districts have staged violent anti-U.S. demonstrations,  chanting slogans such as "We hate Patriots!" and "We hate Perry!"    According to Seoul radio reports, on 19 April, the college  students in Seoul and Kwangju waged violent demonstration  struggles, protesting the arrival of Patriot missiles in the  port of Pusan and U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's junket to Seoul.    In Seoul, a group of students, breaking a tight police  cordon, waged a demonstration struggle in front of the U.S.  Embassy in Seoul, chanting anti-U.S. slogans with placards such  as "We hate Patriots!" and "We hate Perry!"    In the meantime, on the morning of 19 April, some 500  members  of the Kwangju Chonnam District General Student Council staged a  protest rally in front of the Kwangju American Cultural Center.  Branding the U.S. defense secretary's junket to Seoul and the  deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea as a criminal act  of increasing the danger of war, the students threw some 200  bottles of paint at the American Cultural Center building.    The puppet clique, perplexed by the students' strong  protests, mobilized numerous combat policemen to brutally  suppress the student demonstrators. However, the demonstrators  did not yield to this and continued their struggle, chanting  slogans calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist  aggression forces.</p>

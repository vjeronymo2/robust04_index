			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Part-time jobs have profound implications Sir, We were interested in your report, 'Job creation rate disappoints government' (March 24). In it, the Employment Department states that: part-time jobs are not all low paid; to dismiss the growth in part-time employment is an insult to an important part of the workforce; and a robust approach is needed to counter the bad employment picture that some critics might portray. We form a group that is concerned about the growth in part-time employment. While we are not opposed to part-time work and do not assume that any part-time post can be changed into a full-time job, we are concerned by the well documented fact that part-time jobs are low paid when contrasted with full-time employment. We are also concerned about the increasingly limited earnings opportunities for households without a current wage earner and the public expenditure implications of the move to part-time working. During a recent study into pay in former wages council industries, we came across a set of 91 retail vacancies with one employer. All the jobs were part-time and the average working week was 11.36 hours. Average weekly income was Pounds 39.05, with only four jobs paying above the national insurance threshold. We calculated that the total tax and national insurance paid on the 91 part-time jobs, by employer and employee, would be Pounds 1,470 a year. If the jobs were full-time the 28 equivalent posts would yield Pounds 41,918. This highlights the fiscal implications of the increase in part-time working. Between March and September 1993, there was a fall of 113,000 in full-time jobs and a rise of 210,000 in part-time jobs in the UK. This represented an increase of 97,000 jobs, but a decrease, on our calculations, of about 27,000 full-time equivalent posts. If this trend continues, by the year 2003 nearly three out of 10 men and 45 per cent of all employees will be working part-time. This has profound implications. We do not devalue part-time work. We do not believe part-time workers should be treated less favourably in law than full-time staff; neither did we argue in favour of wages council abolition on the grounds that a high proportion of the workers covered were second earners, mainly working part-time. We would, however, like to see a more mature debate about employment issues. Jonathan Fry, Low Pay Network, c/o 102 Commercial Street, Batley WF17 5DP</p>

From examining feces it was learned that 35 percent  of the population had liver flukes. In Roi Et Province alone it  was found that 42.61 percent had liver flukes in 1988. In that  same year more than 500 people in Roi Et died from liver flukes  -- they generally had liver cancer caused by liver flukes. The  report also stated that those who died from this disease were of  working age, and so this was a great loss for the economy and  the society.    An important cause of this disease was the preference for  raw  food, especially raw fish, of the people of the Northeast. In  addition they did not have sufficient toilets to break the cycle  of the disease.    Therefore to correct these problems they sought to change  the  preference for raw food and to have toilets for every house. Roi  Et Province officials began this effort in earnest in 1984.  Initially the approach was to cope with the disease; they set up  teams to check for and treat the disease in the province. Then  in 1989 they changed their approach and attacked the disease  with the GTZ [expansion unknown] program of the German  government, which worked with the Department of Communicable  Disease Control of the Ministry of Public Health and with Roi Et  Province. But these efforts could only reach half the area and  only 600,000 people. The rest was handled by various district  hospitals.    In 1992 Roi Et Province employed a more concentrated  strategy. It attacked the problem of liver flukes using three  activities: 1. checking for and treating the disease -- public  health officials were trained to find the disease and mobile  units were set up to go to the villages; 2. efforts were made to  set up water toilets -- the goal was 100 percent; 3. efforts  were made to change behavior with emphasis on changing the habit  of eating raw fish. Continuous efforts were made in the  Northeast to stop the eating of raw fish from 1989 to 1990. The  role of popular organizations was encouraged with the effort to  set up "villages free of liver flukes".    The results of these persistent efforts were demonstrated in  1992 when the incidence of the disease, which had been as high  as 42.61 percent, was reduced to only 15.37 percent. The  percentage with toilets had risen to 92.21 percent, and in many  districts 100 percent of the houses had such toilets. There were  1,373 villages which were free of liver flukes.    Just when victory over this disease seemed close, Roi Et  Province mobilized its forces steadfastly again in 1993. It  trained public health officials at the subdistrict level to be  able to examine everyone for the disease. This time they  conducted examinations and provided care in every subdistrict  and village, and were able to make another 783 villages free of  the disease. Two feces examinations were given, which provided  reliable results for the statistical reports. In addition an  "assembly of those free of liver flukes" was organized to  provide more strength for the battle.    Roi Et Province used village level communicators such as  artists and singers to provide health education to the various  villages. This was considered very effective.    The examinations and care reached 74.79 percent of the  people  in 1993, and incidence of the disease was found to be only 8.13  percent. There were villages which could be announced free of  this disease and in which 100 percent of the houses had toilets.  Roi Et Province officials asked the Area 7 Office of  Communicable Disease Control in Ubon Ratchathani to cooperate by  sending experts to assess the results and determine the  incidence and severity of the disease, as well as the knowledge,  intentions and behavior of the people using the Cluster Sampling  Technique in 30 locations during June 1993. It was found that  the incidence of the disease was only 10 percent, which was not  felt to be a public health problem.    After the successful completion of this survey, province  officials held a celebration on 21 September with fish as food  for the project to control liver flukes at the Roi Et Province  Public Health Office.    It was felt that Roi Et Province had controlled liver flukes  such that the disease was stage one. This fulfilled the initial  goal which was to be able to announce that it was a province  without a liver fluke problem. But they would have to continue  the battle to stop the people of Roi Et from eating raw fish  completely and to wipe out liver flukes 100 percent. No one but  the people of Roi Et could make this dream come true.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> LADY IN WAITING: What's so special about Minnie Jiang, a waitress at Mandarin  Place in Lake Forest? . . . "I always smile.  </P> <P> I always remember the customers' names and the kind of wine they like to drink  and if they like their food spicy or not. It makes them feel like home. That's  all." . . . That was special enough to earn her American Express' Server of the  Year award and the $10,000 that comes with it. She'll celebrate by taking the  restaurant staff to brunch so someone else can do the work. James S. Granelli  and Lanie Jones  </P></p>

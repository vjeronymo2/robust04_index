			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Political Notebook: The case for an imaginative Budget If Mr Kenneth Clarke is to be believed we are in for a dull Budget. No net reduction in the tax burden, no onslaught against the welfare state, no radical reshaping of the tax and benefits system. The stable state economics now in fashion at 11 Downing Street do not make for political excitement. Of course it will not be quite as bad as that. Mr Clarke will not be able to resist the odd theatrical flourish. Keen as he is to don the mantle of fiscal rectitude the chancellor is an accomplished politician. The Tory back benches must be given something to cheer. The commentators must be offered one of those intricate Treasury wheezes which will allow them to pronounce on the day that he has produced a 'clever package'. No tax cuts overall does not preclude substantial amounts of cash being shuffled around. Mr Clarke must ensure also that the future holds more promise than the present, that virtue will have its reward in a pre-election tax bribe. Abstract concepts like permanently low inflation and steady growth do not win elections. Economic security is important. But the voters want to feel good as well as secure. That means rising disposable incomes. The outlook for the public sector borrowing requirement is more promising than the chancellor admits. It may still be about Pounds 30bn this year and is likely to remain above Pounds 20bn in 1995-96. But beyond that ministers expect a much sharper fall towards balance. Just in time for a spring 1997 election. Public spending will play a critical role. Pre-election tax cuts will depend on firm spending restraint in the two next years. The reins, of course, will be relaxed in the immediate approach to the election. They always are. But that makes it more, not less important, to hold the line now. By all accounts the meetings of EDX, the cabinet committee charged with delivering the spending totals, have been unspectacular affairs. There have been some amusing moments. One came when Mr Michael Portillo explained with a perfectly straight face that he had not been 'serious' when he demanded as chief secretary to the Treasury a 60 per cent cut in a large chunk of the employment budget. There has been pain for other spending ministers. The road-building budget has been a particular target. Other departments with big capital spending allocations, health among them, have been told the private finance initiative provides scope for a smaller contribution from the taxpayer. In parallel the Treasury is adopting its familiar and irrational 'equality of misery' approach, which says that every department must deliver savings whatever the respective size of, or demands on, services. Notwithstanding the draconian cuts in its own manpower, the Treasury's fundamental spending reviews have stalled in the mud of consolidationism. The defence budget is off-limits and Mr John Major has decreed that the government must stick to its pledge to increase real spending on health. The social security budget should deliver big savings as a result of lower inflation and falling unemployment. There will be a squeeze also on housing benefit and, perhaps, on income support for mortgage interest payments. But Mr Jonathan Aitken, the new chief secretary, has discovered that further significant structural changes will have to await a fifth Tory election victory. It is scarcely surprising that he is talking already about introducing technical changes in the way the spending round is conducted. The net result of all this should be cuts in spending targets broadly in line with the better inflation and growth outlook. Such 'automatic' savings should add up to more than Pounds 3bn next year. But the most interesting aspect of the Budget may be the least obviously spectacular - the extent to which Mr Clarke improves incentives at the bottom end of the income scale. Finding routes back into employment for the nation's underclass is not the stuff of tabloid headlines. It is one of the more serious economic and political issues of the 1990s. Next Monday the Labour party will provide some of its answers with the publication of the report by its Social Justice Commission. It will suggest a range of measures - costly at first but self-financing in the longer term  -to break the dependency culture caused by the interaction of the benefits, national insurance and benefits structure. Mr Portillo will counter with details of the tougher test for unemployment benefit which will be applied under the government's new Jobseeker's allowance. But crackdowns on 'scroungers' are not enough. Mr Clarke must show in the Budget a deeper understanding of the poverty and benefit traps which keep the poor dependent on the state, and demonstrate that he is prepared to spend money in the short-term to cure a long-term problem. Fiscal orthodoxy and imagination do not have to be mutually exclusive.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Banker in sell-off row quits - News in brief Mr Marian Rajczyk, head of Poland's Bank Slaski, has resigned in the wake of the bank's controversial privatisation earlier this year. His departure means the bank has a better chance of recovering its valuable broking licence. The Securities Commission revoked the licence last month after the bank had been found to have mismanaged the public offer. It failed to speedily register investors' share certificates except those held by management and employees. The bank staff were thus able to take advantage of a price 13.5 higher than the 500,000 zlotys public offer price when the shares were first listed in January while the 800,000 people who bought shares were unable to trade them. The commission has indicated to the finance ministry which holds 30 per cent of the equity and the Dutch ING bank which bought a 25.9 per cent stake that a change at the top of the bank and thorough reform of the broking operation could see the decision reversed. The Bank Slaski has already sacked a deputy chairman and the head of the broking operation and the Bank's supervisory board meets next week to consider Mr Rajczyk's resignation.</p>

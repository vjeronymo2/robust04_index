General Department of  Taxation (GDT) officials told the weekly Vietnam Investment  Review (VIR) that they were planning to introduce the procedure  to halt income-tax dodging by expatriates.    "Currently, there's no coordination at all and many foreign  businessmen slip through without any tax payment," the GDT's  Truong Chi Trung was quoted as saying. He did not say when the  plan would be put in place. Trung said GDT would also like to  work with banks operating in Vietnam to achieve tighter control  over the repatriation of profits overseas. "So far, we have no  idea who sends what," he told VIR.    Trung said loopholes in tax-collection procedures were  costing Vietnam massive revenue losses. Foreign-invested  enterprises nonetheless paid 5.5 trillion dong (511 million  dollars) in taxes last year, nearly twice as much as in 1992.</p>

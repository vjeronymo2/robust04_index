Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry  Press and Information Department had this to say on this issue:    [Begin Karasin recording] The U.S. President, accompanied by  his spouse, will arrive in Moscow late this evening.    On 13 January, and following the official ceremony of the  Russian Federation president welcoming the U.S. President,  Russian-U.S. talks will take place with only a few officials  present and subsequently more officials will join in.    In the second half of the day it is planned that the U.S.  President will meet Aleksiy, patriarch of Moscow and all the  Russias, in St. Daniil's Monastery. In the evening there will  be a cocktail party for Russian public and business circles.  This will be followed by an unofficial and private dinner given  by Boris Yeltsin.    On 14 January, the second working day of the visit,  following  the wreath-laying ceremony at the Unknown Soldier's Tomb, the  Russian-U.S. talks will continue with delegation members  present. A trilateral meeting is planned between the Russian,  U.S., and Ukrainian leaders. Documents are to be signed, too.    Then joint Russian-U.S. documents will be signed. The  Russian and U.S. Presidents will hold a joint news conference.  In the second half of the day the U.S. President will appear at  the Ostankino TV concert studio, and the Russian Federation  President and Mrs. Yeltsin will then give an official dinner in  honor of the U.S. president and his spouse.    On 15 January, following a meeting between the U.S.  President  and U.S. embassy staff in Moscow, an official ceremony of  farewell will take place in St. George's hall of the Great  Kremlin Palace.    It is expected that the following bilateral documents will  be  signed in the course of the visit: The presidents of both  countries will sign the Moscow Declaration -- the main political  document concerning the results of the summit meeting. It is  expected that joint statements on human rights and on the  problems of nonproliferation will be adopted on behalf of both  presidents.

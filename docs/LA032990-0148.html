			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ROUTE, LONGER HOURS APPROVED FOR SHUTTLE  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council voted Tuesday to begin operating the popular Beeline  shuttles two hours earlier and to expand service into the southern part of the  city.  </P> <P> The expansion must be approved by the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission, but city officials predicted the new southern route could be in  operation by June.  </P> <P> Under the council's proposal, the free shuttle service would begin at 7 a.m.,  instead of 9 a.m. Expanding the hours is expected to cost an additional $8,800  per month. The goal is to serve RTD commuters and motorists who drop their cars  off for servicing before work, city officials said.  </P> <P> The new southern route would begin at the Amtrak station on Cerritos and  Gardena avenues and run north along Central Avenue to Broadway. The shuttle  would travel east on Broadway, south on Brand Boulevard, west on Laurel Street,  south on Central back to the train station. Two shuttles would travel the  20-minute route, separated by 10-minute intervals. The new southern route is  expected to cost $165,000 to start up and operate for the first year.  </P> <P> The southern route is aimed at patrons who visit auto dealers, medical offices,  restaurants and other businesses in that part of the city.  </P></p>

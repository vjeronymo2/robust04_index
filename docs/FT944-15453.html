			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Bonds: World Bank follows EIB with three-year lira offering The World Bank made its debut in the three-year area of the eurolira sector yesterday with a L300bn offering that was targeted mainly at Italian retail investors. Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar sector witnessed further issuance, continuing a trend begun last week. Borrowers also launched offerings into a rising D-Mark sector, boosted by the German general election result. The success of last month's three-year L500bn deal from the European Investment Bank persuaded the World Bank to tap the short end of the lira sector, joint lead manager IMI said. The World Bank usually prefers to borrow funds of a maturity of at least five years, an IMI official said. 'This deal recognises that current demand is at the very short maturities in most currency sectors,' the official said. 'There is a particular shortage of supranational paper.' The bonds, launched with a coupon of 10 5/8 per cent, represent the World Bank's first lira offering since a reverse floating-rate note launched in May, IMI said. France Telecom made its debut in the Canadian dollar sector with a CDollars 125m offering of three-year bonds priced to yield 12 basis points over Canadian government bonds. Lead manager Paribas said the bonds were targeted mainly at retail investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries. Syndicate managers said the bonds were fairly priced. However, some dealers said that the Canadian dollar sector was now becoming congested. The launch follows similar deals last week by the European Investment Bank and Rabobank. 'The EIB deal was a success, largely because there had been very little issuance in Canadian dollars for some time,' said one syndicate manager. 'Then there was Rabobank, and now this deal may just have overdone things.' Also in the Canadian dollar sector, Banque Nationale de Paris launched a CDollars 75m offering of six-year bonds, lead managed by Hambros Bank. Syndicate managers said that the bonds, priced to yield 22 basis points over Canadian government bonds, represented very tight pricing for the six-year area of the yield curve. In the D-Mark sector, the state of Baden-Wurttemberg launched a DM750m offering of 10-year bonds priced to yield 25 basis points over German government bonds. Although there was some interest in the paper from German institutions, most of the bonds were placed with institutions in the Netherlands, the UK, France and east Asia, excluding Japan, joint lead manager Goldman Sachs said. It said many investors were switching out of German government bonds to buy the new issue. 'With state bond issuance falling following privatisation (of state companies), there is clearly room for an alternative to government bonds, and the states are prime candidates with their high implied credit rating and regular funding needs,' said a syndicate official.</p>

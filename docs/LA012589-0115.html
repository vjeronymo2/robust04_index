			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDING CHAMPIONS RETURNING TO L.A. MARATHON  </P> <P> Martin Mondragon and Blanca Jaime of Mexico, the surprise winners of the men's  and women's divisions of the 1988 Los Angeles Marathon, will return to defend  their titles, running in the fourth annual race March 5.  </P> <P> Other elite runners will include Orlando Pizzolato of Italy, a 2-time winner in  New York, and Mark Plaatjes, formerly of South Africa, who was third here last  year.  </P> <P> Marathon officials will announce the elite field, along with the prize money  structure, in a news conference Thursday.  </P> <P> Mondragon, who was overlooked before last year's race, "wants to prove it was  not a fluke," according to his agent, Rich Castro.  </P> <P> In that race, Mondragon took the lead after 20 miles and continued to duel with  Plaatjes for the next 6 miles. He finished strongly, setting a course record of  2 hours 10 minutes 19 seconds. Because Mondragon was not considered a  contender, he was unaware of the $25,000 bonus for the first person to run a  sub-2:10 race.  </P> <P> Castro said that Mondragon's life has changed little after winning $25,000 for  first place and an automobile, which he did not take back to Mexico. Mondragon,  who lives outside Mexico City, was able to quit his job in a print shop and  devote more time to running.  </P> <P> Plaatjes has had an eventful year since running in L.A., his first race since  giving up his South African passport. He and his wife and their two daughters  live in the Chicago area, where Plaatjes is working as a physical therapist. He  is currently applying to medical schools.  </P> <P> Plaatjes has one of the best times in the field, 2.08:52.  </P> <P> The depth of the women's field was dealt a blow Wednesday when Grete Waitz,  9-time winner of the New York Marathon, pulled out because of a stress fracture  in her foot.  </P></p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Canada bites the fiscal bullet: A budget bent on harsh economic restructuring CANADA'S finance minister tabled a budget this week which aims to lay the groundwork for his party's next election campaign but at the same time to take a few steps forward in the painful restructuring of the Canadian economy. Mr Donald Mazankowski, who has a reputation as one of the Progressive Conservative government's shrewdest politicians, announced modest tax cuts for both individuals and companies. As another spur to growth, the withholding tax on dividends paid to foreigners is being halved to 5 per cent. But one of the pillars of Mr Mazankowski's budget package illustrates how Canadians are being led - not always willingly - towards a more hard-nosed existence than the one provided for decades by a pervasive, protective and free-spending government. For the past 47 years, every parent has received a monthly 'family allowance' cheque to help pay child expenses. The government began clawing these back from upper-income households a few years ago. But if the proposals made on Tuesday become law, the cheques themselves will stop arriving at about half a million homes next January. This and some of the budget's other measures fit a pattern of economic restructuring which also includes the negotiation of the 1989 free trade agreement with the US, Ottawa's participation in more recent talks to bring Mexico into the that agreement, and the stern monetary policy which has earned the Bank of Canada the nickname of the Bundesbank of North America. Free trade is forcing Canadian companies and workers to become more competitive or face a mass southbound exodus of jobs. Tight monetary policies have helped bring down Canada's inflation rate to a year-on-year rate of 1.6 per cent in January, the lowest among the Group of Seven industrialised economies. In the budget, tax concessions are balanced by discipline on the spending side. Mr Mazankowski observed at a press conference after his budget speech that people from coast to coast are telling Ottawa that they are 'sick and tired of paying the bills'. 'Government must scale down.' To help pay for the tax breaks, Ottawa plans to cut several hallowed programmes and institutions. Canadian combat troops are being withdrawn from Europe. Subsidies on student loans are to be cut. A total of 46 government agencies are to be either abolished or taken over by other bodies. The risk of Mr Mazankowski being blown off course is substantial. His assumptions of a 4.5 per cent growth rate in 1993 and a decline in interest rates for the next two years are more optimistic than most forecasts. Mr Mazankowski aims to bring the budget deficit down from CDollars 31.4bn (Pounds 15bn) in the year to March 31, to CDollars 27.5bn in 1992/93. He plans to lower the deficit from a peak of 6.7 per cent as a proportion of gross domestic product in 1985 to 1.7 per cent in 1994. But the government has a spotty record in meeting its targets. Just a year ago, it promised a 1992/93 shortfall of only CDollars 24bn. Unlike the US and UK, Canada is proposing a discretionary fiscal tightening, instead of allowing the automatic fiscal stabilisers to work unhindered. The scars of the profligacy of the early 1980s remain. The government has no wish to return to the budgetary difficulties of that time. Nevertheless, the temptation to loosen the purse strings over the next 12 months will be heightened by the approach of the next election, which is likely to be called by mid-1993. It is surely no accident that the proposed reduction in manufacturers' tax rates (from 23 per cent to 21 per cent) will be phased in over the course of a year to January 1994, while the entire cut in the personal surtax (from 5 per cent to 3 per cent) will be in place a full year earlier.</p>

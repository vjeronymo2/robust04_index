			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1100 GMT on 1 January carries a recorded program with  correspondents Aleksey Abakumov and Marina Khomutova;  commentator Sergey Kotenkov; "Vesti" program director Aleksandr  Nekhoroshev, until recently director of the Radio Russia News  Service; and correspondent Andrey Vishnevskiy of Radio Rossii's  "Intercept" service.    Abakumov and Khomutova discuss the usual schedule of  Russia's  Radio News Service, which includes hourly news bulletins and  news and analytical programs every four hours. They note that  the News Service produces around 500 reports on various topics  daily.    Abakumov says: "If one wants to discuss the matter  seriously, then news and programs on the national channel of  Russia's Radio are only the visible part of the iceberg. The  News Service also includes current information on the Nostalgy  musical station of Radio Rossii; Voice of Russia, a radio  station for listeners in neighboring and distant foreign  countries; and the Intercept agency--simply speaking, a service  of radio interception."    Khomutova says they would like to give the listeners a  better  idea of Radio Rossii's studios and editorial offices.    She says: "Let us begin with the `Voice of Russia', since  there is a formal reason for this: This station celebrates its  fifth anniversary of broadcasts 24 hours a day on short wave on  1 January. The majority of the listeners live in the near and  far abroad. They are compatriots who have left their homeland  temporarily or permanently due to different reasons. They also  include those who studied and those who are currently studying  the Russian language."    Abakumov adds: "These call signals were broadcast on the air  for the first time on 1 January 1991. At the time, we took over  from the Russian World Service of International Moscow Radio.  Voice of Russia is the only state radio station in the Russian  Federation currently broadcasting in Russian for audiences  around the world. A total of 10 million listeners in more than  60 countries can receive our programs on short waves."    Abakumov then invites listeners to listen to a report by  special correspondent Valeriy Gorkin. Gorkin says that a friend  of his once said to him that he did not see the fruits of  Gorkin's work, whereas he, as a press correspondent, did see the  results of his work when he saw his name under even a small  article. Gorkin says that, after 25 years of work, he continues  to enjoy listeners' reactions to his work by receiving letters  and telephone calls from many listeners. He thanks the listeners  for their kind words about the Voice of Russia.    Commentator Sergey Kotenkov then views political events that  occurred in Russia in 1993--in particular, the people's behavior  in the parliamentary elections in December.    Khomutova and Abakumov then discuss Radio Rossii's Nostalgy  and report that it is only heard on the FM band in several  Russian cities and is still popular in Russia and in France.  They add that it has been popular for a number of years.    Khomutova introduces Nekhoroshev, until recently director of  the Radio Rossii's News Service and currently the director of  the "Vesti" program. He says that some are jealous of him  moving to television. Khomutova says that his voice has become  well known both to television and radio audiences.    Khomutova then introduces correspondent Andrey Vishnevskiy,  who explains Radio Rossii's Intercept service.    Vishnevskiy says: "Listeners do not know us. We do not come  on the air, with the exception of this brief appearance. We  produce a bulletin that includes the most interesting and  important reports of the world's leading radio stations. The  bulletin consists of up to 20 printed pages daily. Our service,  which has been independent for nearly three years, accepted a  kind offer by Russia's Radio in December and has moved to in the  Yamskoye Pole street.    "We hope that the fact that we have lost independence to a  certain degree will not lead to giving up the main principle of  Intercept, which is well-known to our old subscribers.  Information of the main radio services in the world should be  delivered to them unchanged. Moreover, it is not important  whether it is liked or disliked. Do you want to know what Radio  Liberty, the BBC, `Voice of America' and another dozen foreign  radio stations said a few hours ago? If you do, you should  subscribe to Russia's Radio Intercept bulletins. It is very  easy to do this: Just telephone the number 250-2398."    Khomutova says that Abakumov has been appointed director of  Russia's Radio News Service. Abakumov adds that actually he is  combining his new job with that of being an announcer.  Khomutova asks Abakumov to briefly tell the listeners about the  News Service.    Abakumov says: "News Service means five hours of  broadcasting a day on the national radio channel. It means the  most recent information about events in Russia and neighboring  and distant foreign countries, in the political, economic, and  social spheres, and on culture, sports, and the weather. Let us  say we have quite a few reports by our permanent and free lance  correspondents both in this country and abroad; news of major  news services, our experts, and what we call reliable  sources--leading Russian and foreign agencies and the  hyrdometeorological center."    Abakumov notes that all levels of the society are given a  chance to express their views on the events in the country. All  their interlocutors are always given respectable treatment. He  says that all of what he has said has had some success, but much  must still be done. His dream is to create the best news  service in the world in the Russian language.    Khomutova then says that today is not a day just for  business  but also for leisure. A sample recording of a Nostalgy program  follows.    Khomutova closes by saying it is difficult to tell the  listeners about everything in 20 minutes but hopes that Radio  Rossii has become closer to the listeners and conveys best  wishes from all Radio Rossii's services.</p>

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Books: Drawn to adventure - Fiction THE FIST OF GOD by Frederick Forsyth Bantam Pounds 15.99, 494 pages TO THE WHITE SEA by James Dickey Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 275 pages KOLYMSKY HEIGHTS by Lionel Davidson Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 448 pages The 'Adventure Novel' has been a breed of its own for a century, and should never be underestimated: even today it keeps to its own territory and must not be confused with the 'thriller' or the crime story. Rider Haggard and Erskine Childers did not write thrillers, as their successors will insist. At best, adventure novelists can achieve the peaks of literature; most of them, of course, produce rubbish. Frederick Forsyth made his name for all time with The Day of the Jackal. Before that he had been a struggling journalist. Here he produced a tale of high drama which hinged on the utterly unsuspenseful issue of whether or not General de Gaulle would be assassinated. We all know that De Gaulle survived; astonishingly, Forsyth made us read through the night to discover that we were right. That takes high skill. Since then, Forsyth has produced bestselling 'faction'. He has a formula. He takes a contemporary drama (The Odessa File, The Dogs of War, The Fourth Protocol) and he spins a tale to which he attempts to give credence with a semi-journalistic, authenticating detail. We buy him because we begin to be persuaded that he is telling us the truth behind the headlines. One of these days the ploy will falter. His new one, The Fist of God, takes us closer to that moment. This is the Gulf War; the arms dealer Gerry Bull is murdered; the SAS is launched behind Iraqi lines. Freddie Forsyth's trick is to confuse fact with fiction. Thus, he starts with a ten-page biography of Bull which might have come out of the FT; he paints a professional picture of Operation Storm. And then he cheats - he slips into his account a fictional element (in this case to do with the Supergun): that gives him his novelist's 'plot'. It has become ever clearer over the years that Forsyth has no interest or skill in the essential talent of the novelist - that is, the drama of human relationships - and I rather hope that he, and Len Deighton, will soon feel able to return to straight journalism. And I wonder what Paul Henderson will make of this latest distortion of the Matrix-Churchill story. James Dickey is everything that Forsyth is not. He is a good American poet. He is not at all prolific. He writes a wonderful, taut, elegant prose and talks about physical action with a detail and sympathy that make it, yes, poetry. His 1970 novel Deliverance, which spawned a good film, told of a bunch of buddies whose up-state wilderness trip went badly wrong. To The White Sea, so many years later, is a brilliant and beautiful account of the fate of an American rear-gunner whose plane is brought down over Tokyo in the closing days of the Japanese war and who flees for the far north, to the world of snow and mountain which are his natural homescape from his upbringing in Alaska. It has both the assets and the weaknesses of the 'man-alone' genre. Muldrow is the only figure in the book; everything happens through his narration, which inevitably becomes a limitation for Dickey because he allows himself no interrelationships, no other character, no wider context, in contrast with the achievement of Deliverance. Nevertheless, Dickey's new novel deserves comparison with Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male, and that is, obviously, my great compliment. Lionel Davidson is also gifted and unprolific. Many years ago he wrote brilliant adventure novels like A Long Way to Shiloh and The Night of Wenceslas. Then he slowed down. After a 12-year silence, Kolymsky Heights is just about worth the wait. The scene is Siberia - in enormous detail - and a secret research station where all sorts of dastardly things are being attempted with the genetic breeding of apes. The Canadian-Indian hero, Johnny Porter, who is fortunately a linguist sans pareil, has to be infiltrated into the permafrost. The blurb foolishly quotes Forsyth in comparison. There is no need. Davidson has always been the superior. But, like so many of these adventure novels these days, Kolymsky Heights goes on too long. I cannot be alone in asking these writers to cut short their shuddering, extended climaxes. Go back to Haggard and Stevenson to see how it can be done, with a brief, brisk and very satisfying bang.</p>

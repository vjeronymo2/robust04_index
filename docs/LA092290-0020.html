			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HENKE SHOOTS A 64 TO TAKE A TWO-STROKE LEAD  </P> <P> Nolan Henke sank five consecutive birdies on the way to a seven-under-par 64 in  the second round of the B.C. Open Friday at Endicott, N.Y.  </P> <P> Henke, who was tied with Jim Hallet at 66 after the first round, leads Hallet  by two strokes.  </P> <P> Henke's total of 12-under-par 130 matches the PGA's best 36-hole score of the  season -- by Jose Maria Olazabal at the World Series of Golf and by Peter  Persons at Chattanooga a week later.  </P> <P> Hallet, yet to finish better than fifth in a tournament in three years on the  tour, said he could have done more with his round Friday. "I could have gotten  to 14- or 15-under. I had a lot of birdie putts skim the edge of the cup," he  said.  </P> <P> Doug Tewell shot a 64 and was at 135, five strokes behind Henke. Robert Wrenn  was at 136 after a 68 and five were at 137.  </P> <P> Chip Beck survived Nick Faldo's runaway start and beat the defending champion,  2 and 1, to reach the semifinals of the World Match Play golf championship at  Wentworth in Virginia Water, England.  </P> <P> Beck led by as many as five holes at point after Faldo, the Masters and British  Open champion from Britain, won the first two of 36 holes.  </P> <P> U.S. Open champion Hale Irwin lost, 6 and 4, to Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe, and  Welshman Ian Woosnam beat Northern Ireland's Ronan Rafferty, 5 and 4.  </P> <P> Greg Norman of Australia beat countryman Wayne Grady with a birdie on the  second playoff hole to gain a semifinal berth against McNulty. Beck will play  Woosnam.  </P> <P> Bruce Fleisher and Phillip Hancock started the day with a 7 and 6 victory,  sparking the United States to a 6 1/2-1 1/2 lead over Europe after the first  day of the 1990 PGA Cup Matches at Turtle Point Golf Club in Kiawah Island,  S.C.  </P></p>

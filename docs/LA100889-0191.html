			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACKSTAGE AT FIVE NEW SHOWS;  </P> <P> HOW A STING ALBUM LED HELLMAN TO REVIVAL OF 'THREE PENNY OPERA'  </P> <P> Jerome Hellman, the Academy Award-winning producer of such films as "Coming  Home" and "Midnight Cowboy," traces his new venture as theater producer back to  an evening when he and his wife, photographer Nancy Ellison, were listening to  Sting's album ". . . Nothing Like the Sun." They started talking about what a  terrific Mack the Knife the rock star would make in "Three Penny Opera."  </P> <P> Hellman, 60, had seen the Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill classic a few times in the  '50s and was intrigued enough to pick up the original cast album. "It wasn't a  great recording, but it was enough to get me interested."  </P> <P> He then set about getting the rights, which took several months, and making  sure that his friend and Malibu neighbor Sting would do it. "If Sting said,  'No,' I might have looked elsewhere, but he didn't. He said, 'If you can put it  together, I'm interested.' "  </P> <P> What enticed Sting to do it? "I think Sting made an intelligent assessment of  his own career. He's maturing and I don't think he wants to play to screaming  teen-agers as he gets into his 40s. He's an artist with serious intentions."  </P> <P> Early on, says Hellman, they considered larger venues than a Broadway house,  "but it didn't feel right. And I felt one of the biggest dangers would be to  overproduce it, to turn it into something it shouldn't be. It demands a  closeness with the audience."  </P> <P> Michael Feingold, who adapted "Happy End," "wanted a shot at this, did lyrics  on four numbers and sent them to me on spec. I felt he had a point of view on  the period and passed them on to Sting who liked them. (The show's director)  John Dexter said fine."  </P> <P> Hellman declines revealing the exact size of his show's capitalization. He  carried it himself during the initial stages, he says, then brought in Japanese  publisher and film producer Haruki Kadokawa and theater owner James  Nederlander. "I had my choice of theaters and managements. My terms were clear.  I retained absolute and full control so the director and I could work as I do  on films -- one shared vision without which you're lost."  </P> <P> The next step was its Broadway tryout in Washington, D.C., which ends today.  "Three Penny" opened on Sept. 14 there, and the reviews were terrible.  </P> <P> Washington Post critic David Richards called the production "slow and turgid  stuff . . . The very qualities that made the Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill piece  such a sensation in 1928 -- its bristling humor, its accusatory anger, its  sullen impudence -- remain pretty much locked up inside this lumbering  production."  </P> <P> What was Hellman's reaction? "They were any sane person's reaction -- concern  and  </P> <P> back to work with a vengeance," he said by phone from Washington. "The show  that was reviewed was the sixth time it was performed for an audience and the  sixth time Sting had appeared on any venue in this kind of format. It's the  equivalent of taking your rough cut and having a world premiere of it.  </P> <P> "It was and is a work in progress," continues Hellman. "The jolt of the reviews  made it easier for all of us to become appropriately critical and bear down.  I'm not suggesting that bad reviews feel as good as good reviews, but sometimes  they serve a constructive purpose and this was one of those times."  </P> <P>  "Three Penny Opera" opens at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, 205 W. 46th St., on  Sunday, Nov. 5. Previews begin Oct. 19. Tickets for Tuesday through Saturday  evenings and weekend matinees are $42.50, $50 and $55. Wednesday matinee  tickets are $35, $42.50 and $47.50.  </P> <P> Tyne Daly Sings and One Producer Is Inspired to Bring Back 'Gypsy'  </P> <P> Barry Brown was nestled in his living room overlooking Central Park, idly  switching TV channels, when he came upon Tyne Daly singing on Dolly Parton's  variety show, "Dolly." "I was mesmerized," says producer Brown. "I knew what an  incredible actress she was, but I didn't know she could sing. I turned to a  friend and said, 'I think I just got an idea.' "  </P> <P> Within minutes, Brown had called Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for the  musical "Gypsy." What did Laurents think about putting the Emmy-winning actress  onstage as Mama Rose in a 30th anniversary production of the show?  </P> <P> Laurents suggested that he bring her to New York for an audition so he, "Gypsy"  composer Jule Styne and lyricist Stephen Sondheim could hear her sing. Brown  called Daly's agent to see if the actress was even interested. She was.  Everybody got together several weeks later at the Imperial Theatre, where Daly  sang several of Rose's songs from the show. When she asked if they wanted to  hear another, "Steve turned to Arthur and Jule and asked, 'Do we need to hear  more?' They both said 'No' and Steve said, "Let's get started."  </P> <P> Calling the show "the King Lear of musicals," Brown says director Laurents  insisted that the lead had to play for a lengthy time on the road. Further  encouraged by Daly's star status, Brown and his co-producers preceded the  show's Broadway opening with a six-month, 14-city national tour. The tour,  which included a stop at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in July, sent back  reviews loaded with words like "fabulous," "magnificent" and "astonishing."  </P> <P> The national tour was also quite lucrative and Brown says the production is  already "well on the way to recoupment. If we play to 80% of capacity, we could  pay off in 30 to 35 weeks on Broadway."  </P> <P> When Brown and his late partner Fritz Holt produced "Gypsy" with Angela  Lansbury in London in 1973, says Brown, it cost $275,000 -- including all  airfare and per diems. This production will cost $3 million to mount, he says.  The number is low for Broadway, he says, given that both Laurents and producers  kept costs down. Costumes, he says, could have cost $500,000 to $700,000, but  came in for under $300,000, and sets could have come in for $1 million and came  in for half that.  </P> <P> Brown also has big plans for both Daly and "Gypsy." He hopes the longtime TV  cop will stay with the show through summer 1990, take some time off, then open  that fall in London "where 'Cagney &amp; Lacey' is a big show and she's a  star."  </P> <P> Back at home, Brown wants to do unto "Gypsy" what producer David Merrick did  unto "Hello, Dolly," succeeding Carol Channing with several other stars. Names  that he says have been discussed include, "in alphabetical order," Carol  Burnett, Bette Midler, Liza Minnelli and Bernadette Peters. "All would be good  and each would be very different, not only from each other but from Tyne."  </P> <P>  "Gypsy" opens at the St. James Theatre, 246 W. 44th St., on Nov. 16. Previews  begin Oct. 27. Tickets for Tuesday through Saturday evenings and weekend  matinees are $25, $45, $50. Wednesday matinee tickets are $20, $40 and $45.  </P> <P> It Takes a Lot of Money Just to Open a 'Grand Hotel'  </P> <P> The run-through of Tommy Tune's "Grand Hotel," sans set and costumes, had just  ended when producer Martin Richards leaned over to point out assorted investors  in the small, invited audience. "I never had this luxury with any other  director," he whispers to a reporter. "It's like introducing your child without  having it properly clothed."  </P> <P> The fact the child's there at all is an "incredible feat," Richards adds. "Two  months ago, we decided to do a workshop as a test. After two weeks, Tommy  decided he wanted to do it. No SEC papers had been filed, nothing, but Tommy  felt let's do it -- the energy and excitement had been built up."  </P> <P> Based on the 1929 novel by Vicki Baum, "Grand Hotel" features music by Robert  Wright, lyrics by George Forrest and book by Luther Davis, the same  Tony-winning creative team who brought us "Kismet." Their very different  earlier version, called "At the Grand," starring Paul Muni, played the Los  Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1958, but did not go on to Broadway.  </P> <P> "Grand Hotel" has a completely new look and sound. Richards read the script and  heard several songs from the show last December, and when Tune got involved a  month later, "that was the clincher. I said, 'I loved the material but it  depended on the director -- it had to be done in a contemporary way.' "  </P> <P> Producer Circle put up $300,000 in seed money, financed a workshop at the  Diplomat Hotel last April, and given Tune's enthusiasm, started shopping the  show to theater owners. Richards says they got $1 million from the Jujamcyn  theater chain, owners of the Martin Beck Theatre, where the show opens Nov. 12,  and further commitments from other producers totaling $4,750,000.  </P> <P> Richards still doesn't know how he put the financing together so fast,  especially since everybody was trying to raise money from the same people.  "It's the same group of crazies that really love the theater -- maybe 40, maybe  more," says Richards, a former singer and casting director. "You have to be  very brave to do it. I make movies and have never lost a nickel. I've lost  money in the theater, but I keep doing it because of the live energy."  </P> <P> Richards and his wife, Mary Lea Johnson, have already produced or co-produced  16 other Broadway shows, including Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Crimes  of the Heart" and Tony-winner "La Cage aux Folles." Many of their shows have  been directed by Harold Prince, including such hits as "Sweeney Todd" and "On  the Twentieth Century" and such financial failures as "Grind" and "Rosa."  </P> <P> Richards clearly enjoys working with directors like Prince and Tune, but says  at one point that "the business side stinks. . . . At one time, every show was  seen. Now the superhit makes money and a hit breaks even and the rest go down  the tubes."  </P> <P> Hope is running high on "Grand Hotel." Paramount Pictures came in as a producer  during the Boston run and Richards says the film company has a first refusal on  any future film.  </P> <P> The 1989 "Grand Hotel," which finished its pre-Broadway run last night in  Boston, shares just one song with the 1958 production. This time out, Liliane  Montevecchi plays the Greta Garbo role from the Oscar-winning 1932 film, and  the cast also includes Karen Akers, Timothy Jerome and Jane Krakowski.  </P> <P> But there's still work to do. The Boston Globe's reviewer, Kevin Kelly, called  the show a "sophisticated entertainment with real potential," qualifying his  review with the remark the show needed work before going to Broadway. Tune and  company are indeed "working like crazy," Richards said a few days later by  phone from Boston. "It's been getting better and better."  </P> <P>  "Grand Hotel" opens at the Martin Beck Theatre, 302 W. 45th St. on Nov. 12.  Previews begin Oct. 17. Tickets are $45, $50 and $55 Monday through Saturday  evenings and Saturday matinee. Wednesday matinee tickets are $37.50, $42.50 and  $47.50.  </P> <P> Three Old Friends Decide to Put on a Show: 'City of Angels'  </P> <P> Nick Vanoff is a stage and television producer. He is also a patient man. For  years, he talked with Cy Coleman and Larry Gelbart about one day working  together on a show. He'd known composer Coleman for 35 years and playwright  Gelbart nearly as long.  </P> <P> When Coleman and Gelbart finally finished their new musical comedy thriller  "City of Angels," says Vanoff, "they sent me the book, and I liked it. They  came over to my house (in Los Angeles) and played (the music) for me and my  wife. We both loved what we heard, and I then naively went about doing it."  </P> <P> Vanoff then called Roger Berlind, whose latest musical was "Jerome Robbins'  Broadway," and asked him to get involved. Sitting with Vanoff at a restaurant  near the show's rehearsal hall, Berlind nods in agreement: "I read the book,  heard the score and had the same exact reaction."  </P> <P> It was a go.  </P> <P> With a cost of $4.2 million, the show has a list of producers that also  includes both Jujamcyn Theaters, owner of the 1,250-seat Virginia Theatre where  the show opens Dec. 7, and the Shubert Organization, which Vanoff says is "very  high on the property." Also part of the producing team is Suntory  International, a Japanese firm that co-produced "Jerome Robbins' Broadway."  </P> <P> The show's unusual staging features an amalgam of film and stage techniques. As  Vanoff and Coleman explain it, "City of Angels" is set in the late '40s and  portrays a novelist's trials and tribulations writing a screenplay based on his  detective novel. "One set is the movie he sees in his head as he writes it,"  says Vanoff. "Those scenes are in black and white. The action, which is real  life, takes place in color, as life is."  </P> <P> Gelbart, whose play "Mastergate" opens on Broadway this month, earlier wrote "A  Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and "Sly Fox." Tony winner  Coleman wrote the scores for such shows as "Sweet Charity" and "On the  Twentieth Century." Lyrics are by newcomer David Zippel. Director Michael  Blakemore directed "Noises Off," among other shows.  </P> <P> "City of Angels" opens directly on Broadway. "We feel the book is in very good  shape and we like what we have," says Emmy-winning TV producer Vanoff, who also  produced Jackie Mason's smash hit, "The World According to Me!" "Usually,  you're out of town seeing the book, and we think the book is strong enough. It  is a fairly complicated show to do scenically. So instead of going out of town,  we added extended rehearsals and previews."  </P> <P> Listen to composer Coleman, interviewed later that day after an audition for  his next musical, a show based on the life of Will Rogers. "We're doing  something that's not only a musical, but flashy, new and I hope very welcome on  the Broadway scene," says Coleman of "City of Angels." "It's one of the first  book musicals to come along in a long time."  </P> <P>  "City of Angels" opens at the Virginia Theatre, 245 W. 52nd St., on Dec. 7.  Previews begin Nov. 14. Ticket prices are $40, $45 and $50 Tuesday through  Saturday evenings and weekend matinees. Wednesday matinee tickets are $35, $40  and $45.  </P> <P> Off-Broadway Hit Revival Moves to Not-for-Profit Broadway House  </P> <P> The Broadway season's first hit musical is being produced at Circle in the  Square Theatre, one of Broadway's two not-for-profit houses.  </P> <P> The show is a revival of the Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler musical, "Sweeney  Todd." Director Susan H. Schulman's chamber version of "Sweeney," which packed  the tiny York Theatre off-off-Broadway, was picked up by Circle. The audience  size jumped from 99 to 600 but critics have generally agreed the show didn't  suffer with expansion.  </P> <P> The productions at both the York and Circle are scaled down considerably from  the 1979 Tony-winning version at the 1,900-seat Gershwin (then called the Uris)  Theatre. These simpler productions also take a different perspective on  "Sweeney Todd's" dark tale of a vengeance-seeking barber whose murder victims  are the key ingredient in his downstairs neighbor's best-selling meat pies.  </P> <P> The original production, directed by Harold Prince, had a massive steel set  that used pieces hauled in from a closed New England foundry and created the  dark mood of workers crushed by the Industrial Revolution. The show centered  less on Len Cariou's "demon barber of Fleet Street" than on Angela Lansbury's  pie maker.  </P> <P> In Schulman's vision, the story is more the personal tragedy of a man who  avenges the loss of his wife and child and less the impact of the Industrial  age. Beth Fowler's pie-maker is softer, more sympathetic, and so is Bob  Gunton's Sweeney Todd. "The focus is Sweeney," says Circle in the Square's  producing director Paul Libin, "where it should be. A little part of you is  cheering for Sweeney."  </P> <P> While many regional theaters around the country have regularly featured  crowd-pleasing musicals, Libin says this is just Circle's third musical since  1972. "We've always wanted to do musicals," says Libin, "but one of the reasons  we haven't is that musicals are expensive."  </P> <P> Circle's costs run higher than other not-for-profit theaters, says Libin,  because of its Broadway environment, yet its costs are still considerably below  its larger Broadway neighbors. "Sweeney Todd" is running under $600,000 to  produce at Circle, says Libin. But if the show moved to a commercial Broadway  house, he says "you couldn't do it for less than $5 million." (It cost $1.2  million in 1979.)  </P> <P> While Circle in the Square has 12,000 subscribers, they are apparently a pretty  patient group of people. Ever since George C. Scott suggested in 1982 that they  simply extend his popular run in Noel Coward's "Present Laughter" rather than  move the show to a bigger house, Circle has run shows at this theater without  fixed closing dates. (They also present shows at Circle Downtown and  occasionally elsewhere.) Tina Howe's play, "Coastal Disturbances," played there  just under a year, Libin says.  </P> <P> "We used to have to close down successes and keep failures running," says  Libin. "Our subscribers commit to three plays, and history has proven that  subscribers are happy to wait with their and our success. I pray they'll feel  the same way about 'Sweeney Todd.' "  </P> <P>  "Sweeney Todd" is playing at Circle in the Square Theatre, 235 W. 50th.  Tickets for Friday and Saturday evening performances are $40. Other evening  performances and weekend matinees are $37.50.  </P> <P> BARBARA ISENBERG  </P></p>

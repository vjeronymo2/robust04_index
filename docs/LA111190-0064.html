			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION RESULTS  </P> <P> If the environmental movement is to succeed, it must become a truly bipartisan  cause.  </P> <P> The despicable manner in which Tom Hayden's past was manipulated by the hired  media in order to assault Proposition 128 is unfortunately a political reality.  </P> <P> Speaking as a supporter of the environmental causes that Hayden has espoused, I  would respectfully suggest that his continued public involvement with these  issues is counterproductive. The fight should continue for the survival of the  environment, but not for the political career of one man.  </P> <P> SASHA MATSON  </P> <P> Mar Vista  </P></p>

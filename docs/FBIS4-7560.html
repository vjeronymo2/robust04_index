			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 31 (CTK) -- Representatives of  the "shadow cabinet" of former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar  today criticized what they said was a retreat by the new Slovak  Government from its protectionist policy towards Czech exports.    "I'm surprised at Slovakia's unlimited cooperative approach  towards colleagues from the Czech Republic, because a  cooperative approach in trade relations ought to be mutual,"  former Economics Minister Jan Ducky told a press conference. He  was referring to the recent Czech-Slovak preliminary agreement  on the mutual recognition of certificates for food products and  consumer goods.    Ducky criticized the amended Czech law on value-added tax,  saying that the new calculation of the tax on goods imported  from the Czech Republic would have a more severe effect on  Slovak exports than the Slovak-imposed import surcharge had on  imports from the Czech Republic.    Ducky also said that Slovak food exports to the Czech  Republic were only a fraction of Czech exports to Slovakia and  that the mutual recognition of certificates would harm Slovakia.    Former Vice-Premier Sergej Kozlik said the Meciar government  had succeeded in reducing the deficit on the new clearing  account for trade with the Czech Republic from 127 million ECU  [European Currency Unit] to the present 19 million. Kozlik said  that while Slovakia's deficit on the old account (for payments  before the currency separation on February 8, 1993) amounted to  470 million crowns at the end of February, now it was two  billion crowns.</p>

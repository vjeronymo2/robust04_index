			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The COPIT (Parliamentary Committee for  Technological Innovation) has prepared a report on Italian space  activity, in the year in which the ASI [Italian Space Agency]  commission sanctioned the crisis of the space agency, from the  end of the national programs that should have had successors to  the reshuffling of all of the cards in the major international  programs, from the long-term ESA [European Space Agency] plan to  the space station promoted by the United States for which there  are now also plans for Russian collaboration. The COPIT has  already made interesting contributions to providing information  on national space activities, such as the two conferences that  were organized in January and April this year. It was precisely  the crisis of the ASI, culminating with the formation of the  commission in August, that led the COPIT to start a general  deliberation on Italian space policy, and for this reason it set  up an ad hoc study group, made up of Francesco Mazzucca  (coordinator), Aldo D'Alessio, Michele Nones, and Walter  Pecorella. After a special meeting that brought together the  opinions of authoritative exponents of the scientific community  and the industrial world connected to space, this group  collaborated with other experts and consultants to work out the  proposal that is presented in the document: "The Relaunching of  Space Activity in Italy".    The document starts with a brief description of the origins  of Italian space activities and the criteria on which the ASI  was founded, underlining the critical institutional and  functional aspects that favored, or determined, the crisis. In  consideration of this, it points out that "a change that will  permit the formulation of a new approach is needed" so that the  agency can transform itself "into an efficient management body"  that is able to face the changed conditions both of the  international scene and of national finances. A complete  section of the document, the final section, has been dedicated  to the organizational structure that the ASI should take on.  This is preceded by a section that examines the institutional  set-up. This section is divided into two chapters, one of which  is dedicated to the relationships between the ASI and the  ministry (MURST (Ministry of Universities and Scientific and  Technological Research)] watching over the ASI and the other to  the organs of the ASI.    A complete section of the document (seven chapters) has been  dedicated to the national space plan. When, in the near future,  the period of management by the commission comes to an end, the  summit of the ASI should be nominated, and its first act should  be the preparation of a new national space plan that will be the  supporting axle for the relaunching of Italian space activities.    The fundamental criteria that the COPIT document suggests  for  its formulation include coordination with the public consumers  of space services (a long list of whom are presented), seeking  in particular "a profound harmonization with the lines along  which defense is developing," and the definition, in agreement  with the ministries of finance and the budget, of a suitable  funding policy, specifying the level of resources that is  actually available and "the most suitable policy of  interventions to provide for the characteristics of space  activities."  <H5>  For the New National Space Plan </H5>   The weight that this sector of industry has also developed  in  Italy means that a space policy can no longer simply be  considered to be a research policy, but that it must also be  considered to be an industrial policy. This having been said,  one of the primary roles of the agency must be to give the  national industry the necessary competitiveness on foreign  markets "effecting a close analysis of the costs (industrial  audit), and facilitating and directing the companies toward the  natural economies of scale and dimension that are critical to be  able to play a role not only on protected and captive markets."  It is suggested that the ASI should participate in industrial  activities during the risk stage (also through its own presence  as a minority in ad hoc consortiums) to help the industrial  projects that they have singled out as potentially more  promising as far as commercialization and industrial spin-offs  are concerned, to take off, and then to sell them back when they  have become consolidated.    As far as basic research is concerned, whilst the ASI must  develop its own program in coordination with the activities of  other aerospace research bodies, the main effort would be turned  toward the development of some authentic centers of excellence.  This, in the medium term could lead to the creation of two  centers: one centered around the Turin-Milan area and the  other, into which the CIRA [Italian Aerospace Research Center]  would be integrated, centered in the Rome-Naples area.    "It is no longer possible to have the concept of funding  showering down on projects. Instead it is necessary to  concentrate on activities that are aimed at, and are an organic  part of, the creation of centers of excellence, formative  university processes, or the industrial policy of the ASI."  Preference should be given to research in collaboration with  foreign partners on projects that are funded by several  international bodies, and the programs should be centered on  loads that can be launched using small carriers, to take account  both "of the limited economic undertakings that are sustainable  and the necessity of obtaining concrete results quickly" and "of  the development of a small national launcher."    With respect to this, the document affirms that "the  necessity to autonomously put one's own satellites into orbit  with acceptable costs is obviously the element on which any  space policy hinges" and that in this sector Italy must  "construct its own strategy by taking the experiences of its own  role in European space activities into account."    The brief analysis of the situation and the initiatives that  are under way concludes by upholding that the auspicious  national launcher, that has been improved with respect to the  Scout, should be developed using technologies that have already  been tested in flight, a careful look being given to recurrent  costs, and that as far as the launching stage is concerned "a  range should be chosen that offers stable political conditions,  and that has possibly already been used for commercial launches,  and that is reasonably accessible not only for the operators but  also for the consumers."    As far as the major launching systems are concerned, it is  suggested that Italy's current participation in the European  carrier, Ariane 5, should be confirmed for the successive stage,  for the development stage, and also for its future evolution.    As far as the sectors involved in space activities are  concerned, telecommunications is still the most important market  according to the COPIT document, that dedicates a chapter to it  alone in the part dedicated to a detailed analysis of the  spin-offs of space activities. The part of the document that is  dedicated to the national space plan examines its different  aspects, taking account of the recent technological evolution  and the new services and, in Europe, the situation regarding  norms (deregulation within the EEC), the organization of  industry (European industry is converging to form large  consortiums), and the inadequate resources for research (unequal  competition with respect to the capacities of American and  Japanese industry). Meanwhile the sector dealing with Earth  observation is taking on an ever greater importance, thanks also  to the programming priority given to it by the ESA; also in  Italy there is "a considerable demand for remote sensing from  the public administration" and this, amongst other things,  enhances the prospective success of small satellites that will  exploit the capacity of the future national launcher. This  provides the opportunity to integrate these different  requirements in a national R&amp;D program for remote sensing  from  space "that allows for better qualification of the Italian  effort in space monitoring, concretizing the effort by producing  an application that has a high value for the future of the  environment and for safety; calibrating on one hand the  financial obligation and on the other enhancing existing San  Marco Scout activities to a maximum; enhancing and making the  best use of the resources of numerous aerospace industries in  such a difficult economic moment."    The most controversial field in Europe at the moment is that  of man in space and space transport. It is also the most  susceptible to surprises as far as international collaboration  is concerned at a planetary level. Some key programs for Italy  have come under discussion again, whether this is public  knowledge or not. The COPIT document has taken this fluid  situation into account, suggesting that, as a serious  alternative to Columbus, if this should be at risk, Italy could  think of carrying out studies for the so-called exploration  program (including the permanent station on the moon and a  mission toward Mars) that should consolidate in concrete  obligations for development in the years after 2000.  <H5>  The Spin-offs of Space Activities </H5>   The part that is dedicated to this subject starts with an  analysis of the aspects that are relevant to technological  innovation within the European Community according to the three  foreseeable "scenarios" of evolution. A first return of the  policies of consolidation and the development of space  activities in Italy is considered in connection with the role  that they can play in basic and applied research and in  training, with reference to these scenarios. The main goals of  EC policy for the technologically advanced sectors, including  the various types of services via satellite, are then  summarized. As far as the instruments that EC directives leave  to the national authorities for the safeguarding and development  of the sectors that they consider "sensitive" and/or strategic  are concerned, according to the COPIT document: "Research  activities and services to industry should replace direct help  and incentives. In particular it is necessary to favor forms of  coordination between companies and organizations that are  working in the area of technological research and innovation to  encourage possible synergies between public and private bodies."  The document observes that the importance of the high  technology sectors to the economic and social development of the  country was recognized considerably later than it was by the  main partners both within and outside the Community, and that  delays have also characterized the levels of diffusion and the  functional standards at an infrastructural level, and the  institutional, normative and organizational aspects.    A chapter is dedicated to the role of space activities in  the  national economy, in which, amongst other things, it is revealed  that in Italy levels of spending of around 1 trillion lire a  year are compatible with our participation in the European space  programs. "If the ASI is transformed into an efficient  management body, which is also able to coordinate the efforts of  the numerous aerospace companies, with activities and funding  aimed at the realization of programs in well-defined fields such  as telecommunications and Earth observation, it could help bring  us closer to the general goal of restructuring public spending  so that the efficiency and effectiveness of resources can  counterbalance the mean constraints within which it can be  foreseen that fiscalization will move in the coming years."  Therefore, "whilst an additional funding effort is desirable,  reorganization of the ASI programs is necessary anyway, in order  to obtain an appreciable return on the contributions to the ESA,  forcing a commercial type of fall-out" whilst "the convergence  of civilian and military interest on remote sensing technologies  imposes greater reflection on the subject of the requalification  of military expenditure, given also the changes of goals  following the breakdown of the East Bloc."    Finally, the document analyses the size of the market for  activities that only concern space for the European aerospace  industry, and provides interesting tables that show its  development over the last seven years making comparisons between  the various nations, as well as providing the possibility for  comparisons to be made on a world scale for commercial sectors  (satellites and antennae for users on the ground) and showing  the relative trends of evolution.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |State Budget for Operational Expenses in Billions of Lire                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Year              |ASI Expenditure   |ESA Direct Transf-|  |                  |                  |                  |ers for Investmen-|  |                  |                  |                  |ts                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1985              |-                 |173               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1986              |-                 |215               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1987              |-                 |280               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1988              |147               |245               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1989              |742               |-                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1990              |822               |-                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1991              |700               |-                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1992              |800               |40                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecom sector alert News of the Dollars 22bn merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc sent telecoms shares surging, with US buyers said to be prominent. 'There's a wall of money coming over from the Atlantic,' said one leading telecoms specialist. 'Multi-media is now seen as the place to be, and everyone wants a piece of the action.' There was also speculation that Cable and Wireless is in discussion with the US telecoms giant AT&amp;T over forming a global alliance in business communications. Although rumoured for some time, analysts said that Wednesday's monster deal had given fresh impetus to all speculative tie-ups in the industry. Cable shares jumped 26 to 953p in turnover of 4.1m. Vodafone added 10 1/2 to 551p, BT 6 1/2 to 447p and Securicor 17 to 787p.</p>

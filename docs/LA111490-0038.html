			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOM CLANCY ON U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> Someone has said that there's no one so dangerous as a fanatic misapplying  "principles."  </P> <P> Clancy exemplifies in his own person the title of his novel "Clear and Present  Danger." Reviewing U.S. history, he concludes that "more than anything else,  America is a set of principles . . . the distillation of 10,000 years of human  social evolution." This, after telling us that "The Mexican-American War was  essentially a border dispute; Mexico couldn't even handle the Texans, much less  all of America." Well, there's another border dispute in the Persian Gulf that  may result in a similarly exaggerated outcome. No great power can cast the  first stone against the aggressor. The policeman must be the United Nations.  </P> <P> JOHN H. RANDOLPH, Oxnard  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Minister praises model pay policy Average take-home pay for an unmarried production worker in the UK is higher than in any other European Union country except Luxembourg, Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, said yesterday. In a speech to an International Labour Organisation seminar in London to mark the ILO's 75th anniversary, she said that British labour market policy, stressing flexibility and deregulation, was an example to the world. The 'diabolical trade-off' between good jobs and more jobs, which concerned Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, did not exist in the UK, she said. 'While income differences have widened in the UK, there have been real wage increases for all groups,' she said. 'We are unlike the US in this respect. There, real wages at the lower end have fallen. Adjusted for costs, take-home pay for a British production worker, married with two children, is only fractionally lower than in Germany or Belgium and higher than in France and Italy.' Miss Widdecombe said that a flexible labour market was compatible with employment rights. 'Many employment rights, such as those relating to health and safety, race and sex discrimination, trades' union membership and maternity leave, apply to all employees regardless of hours or work or length of service,' she said. The minister said that more and more European countries, and the European Commission, were coming round to the British view. 'We see something of a sea change in the way the Commission approaches these issues,' she said.</p>

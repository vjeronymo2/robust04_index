			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Kodak launches unit for electronic imaging Mr George Fisher, who took over last December as chairman of Eastman Kodak, the photographic products company, has taken one of his first significant moves to shake up the business - the formation of a new unit to spearhead its involvement in the emerging market for electronic imaging. Mr Fisher, former chief executive of electronics group Motorola, took over at Kodak when shareholder unrest over the company's lacklustre earnings led to the resignation of the chairman, Mr Kaye Whitmore. Kodak said it was forming a separate worldwide unit for digital and applied imaging and was looking outside the company for someone to head the operation. The unit will initially comprise several Kodak businesses - applied imaging, CD imaging, printer products and the company's equipment and software platform centre. Most of Kodak's photographic earnings come from traditional film, which uses a chemical process, the sensitivity to light from silver halide salts. However, Kodak has long feared this business could ultimately be superseded by the rapidly growing market for digital, electronic imaging. The company is a significant force in electronic imaging - for example in its invention with Philips of the Netherlands) of the photo CD system. But critics said that under the previous management they were uncertain how much clout the electronic side carried within the group. Mr Jack Thomas, president of Kodak's imaging group, said 'our traditional businesses will continue to furnish the majority of our earnings for a long time. However, fuelled by digital technology, digital imaging is growing faster than conventional photography'.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Electricity regulator to force reform Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, said yesterday that he would not need to refer the UK's two main generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission providing he could reach agreement with them on plant disposals and prices. He said he had decided to take some action after his inquiry into the generators' margins and costs. He expected to be able to decide by mid-January whether a reference to the commission would be necessary. Prof Littlechild said he had written to the electricity pool, the wholesale market through which power is traded in England and Wales, to urge early examination of several reforms including changes to the pricing mechanisms. Some analysts interpreted his statement as welcome news for National Power and PowerGen, arguing that his choice of words implied that his preference was for avoiding a referral. Others said the regulator and the companies had to overcome considerable obstacles to reach an accommodation. The generators are extremely reluctant to accept either price controls or plant disposals. Yesterday, the regulator said steps needed to be taken to 'ensure that customers are adequately protected in future'. He wanted to open the way for voluntary sale by the generators of some plant, and said he wanted 'assurances on prices for a reasonable period until a more competitive market is achieved'. National Power said it hoped to find a mutually satisfactory way forward with the regulator. PowerGen said it believed a reference to the commission was unnecessary but would face it with confidence. Prof Littlechild's suggested examination of pool price reforms included the possibility of allowing electricity to be traded outside the pool. He also urged consideration of a change in pricing mechanisms so that generators would be paid the price they ask for. At present the pool price is determined by the price of the most expensive plant. He also proposed measures aimed at reducing the cost of administration in the pool price. He wants National Grid to assume responsibility for these services from April. Lex, Page 20</p>

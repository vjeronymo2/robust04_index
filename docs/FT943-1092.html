			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Lloyd's agency seeks listing for dedicated fund Hiscox Group, the Lloyd's agency, is to seek a stock market listing for its 'Dedicated' investment fund, which provides corporate capital exclusively to its four syndicates. The move is designed to pave the way for the eventual creation of an insurance company which would operate within the Lloyd's regulatory framework, signalling a further shift in the character of the insurance market which has traditionally relied on individual Names trading with unlimited liability for their losses. Lloyd's raised corporate capital for the first time last year. More than a dozen listed investment funds now supply some Pounds 800m to syndicates and account for more than 14 per cent of the market's capacity - the amount of premiums it can accept. So far, all listed funds have been investment trusts supporting a range of agencies - and the syndicates they manage - across the insurance market, because stock exchange rules have prevented the listing of single agency or 'dedicated' vehicles on the grounds that they do not have a three-year trading record. Mr Robert Hiscox, chairman of Hiscox and deputy chairman of the market as a whole, indicated a relaxation was in prospect. Mr Hiscox, who helped orchestrate the drive to attract corporate capital last year, said his group will need to provide audited accounts for syndicate years of account which still have to be closed, in line with the market's three-year accounting system.</p>

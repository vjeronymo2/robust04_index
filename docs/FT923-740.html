			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Beijing set to open up industry to foreign investment CHINA is likely to open up almost all industries to foreign investment and scrap administrative restrictions on imports after the Communist party's 14th congress next month, a pro-Beijing daily said yesterday, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. 'The government has developed new thinking in reforms: aside from 'bread and butter', everything could be opened to foreign investment,' Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po newspaper quoted Beijing sources as saying. Senior leaders at the congress will probably allow foreign investors to take part in building airports, railways and roads, said the newspaper, which often acts as a mouthpiece for the Chinese government line. 'The central government will give special support to foreign investors who plan to build major airports in northwestern China,' it quoted authoritative sources as saying. Wen Wei Po said primary industries including crude oil and coal would be opened further to foreign partners. Beijing has pledged to accelerate the pace of economic reforms since senior leader Deng Xiaoping visited China's booming south in February. But the government still restricts the entry of foreign capital into certain industries. China will also open up other markets to foreign goods by easing import regulations in line with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), it said. Administrative intervention to adjust imports will be gradually replaced by measures such as tariffs, exchange rates, interest rates, quotas and import licences, the newspaper said. 'The current administration-based import-control system falls well short of Gatt's requirements and increases trade friction,' the newspaper said. China is seeking to join the world trade body. It is also in dispute with the US, which has threatened punitive sanctions unless Beijing opens its markets wider by October 10 - two days before the party meeting. The report said fledgling car and camera industries would remain protected under a revamped import tariff system.</p>

			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / French left-overs on the block: A privatisation plan designed to deal with unfinished 1980s business The Balladur government yesterday unveiled its privatisation plan, designed to roll back the frontiers of state involvement in the French economy and, just as important, to help finance recovery and the struggle against rising unemployment. The list of 21 companies to be sold off is impressive. Twelve - notably the two big banks, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris; the three insurance companies, UAP, GAN and Assurances Generales de France; and Rhone-Poulenc, Elf-Aquitaine, and Pechiney, in chemicals, oil and metals, respectively - were scheduled for privatisation in 1986 when the conservatives were last in government, and Mr Edouard Balladur was finance minister. Rescheduling them for sale deals with business left unfinished when the stock market crashed in 1987 and the Socialists won victory in 1988. But the 1993 list puts nine new companies on the auction block. Three are what earlier French governments regarded as sacred national institutions - the motor company Renault; Air France, the state's flagship carrier; and Aerospatiale, part maker of the Airbus and France's nuclear missiles. The eventual passage of all these companies into private hands would radically reduce the size of what is still, after Italy, Europe's biggest public sector. The privatisation process would also probably be irreversible by any future socialist government - not only on grounds of cost. At yesterday's cabinet meeting, which approved the draft privatisation bill, President Francois Mitterrand voiced the same 'public interest' reservations he had in 1986 when he temporarily blocked the privatisation decree. This time, the government faces no political problems in getting privatisation through parliament. But Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has no delusions about the scale of the financial challenge ahead. Whereas the last French privatisation drive began in the buoyant environment of the mid-1980s, the new phase is being launched at a far less favourable time, when the French economy is in recession, the Paris stock market is volatile and some of the candidates for sale are under intense financial pressure. The critical question for Mr Alphandery is whether current market conditions will impede his privatisation plans. However unfavourable the timing, the new French government has little option but to proceed. Indeed, as became alarmingly clear this week, getting a large amount of cash from a successful sell-off of state assets is the only way it can both restrain public borrowing and finance economic recovery. In announcing the sale of FFr40bn worth of 'Balladur bonds' - which will pump a total of FFr26bn in new money into unemployment programmes, public works and housing - the government said it still planned to keep the 1993 budget deficit at FFr317bn. This means, as Mr Alphandery spelled out yesterday, that it needs to get the entire FFr40bn equivalent of the special bond issue back this year in privatisation proceeds. The critical question is whether the stock market will be able to absorb the stream of newly privatised French companies. At first glance the omens are bad. The last centre-right government sold off FFr120bn of public sector companies in 29 flotations between spring 1986, when it came to power, and the market crash in October of the following year. The success of those share sales was fuelled both by the dynamism of the Paris stock market and by a keen appetite among international investors for the then-novel French privatisation stocks. Times have changed. The Paris market is in a fragile state. The CAC 40 Index of 40 leading companies was virtually static in 1992 and has mustered only a slight increase from 1,858 at the end of last year to 1,890 yesterday. The French economy which, until recently, was more resilient than its European counterparts, is now technically in recession. The government estimates that gross domestic product will fall by 0.1 per cent this year. Despite this gloomy scenario, international investors have remained relatively positive about French equities. Warburg Securities estimates that although the Paris bourse accounts for 23 per cent of the value of Continental European stock markets, it represents about 26 per cent of a typical Continental portfolio. However, international investors have recently been adding little to their French portfolios because the strong franc makes French shares more expensive. International investors might also be deterred by the French government's efforts to 'protect' the newly privatised companies. Mr Alphandery has revived the noyaux durs concept favoured by the last centre-right government of encouraging long-term investors to take strategic stakes in in former state companies. He has, however, said such shareholder groups will be open to foreign companies, thereby scrapping the 20 per cent ceiling that limited foreign stakes in the previous privatisation round. He has also extended the 'golden share' system, whereby the government can block bids in strategically important groups. Whereas the 1986 'golden share' lasted for five years, its 1993 version will have an indefinite lifespan. This is the government's price for extending privatisation into the defence sector, with Aerospatiale and Thomson, the electronics group, up for eventual sale. 'There is still an appetite for privatisation stocks, as the success of the recent Spanish issues has shown,' said Mr Joe Hall, head of European equities at Warburg. 'But investors are much more discerning about what they will buy now than they were in the mid-1980s. The French government will have to be careful to present the right companies at the right price, unless it is willing to risk selling recovery stocks at a discount.' A number of privatisation candidates fall into the 'recovery' category. The Credit Lyonnais banking group lurched into the red in 1992 and earlier this month warned of difficulties in France this year. UAP and GAN, the insurers, suffered sharp falls in profits last year. The Bull computer group made a loss in 1992, as did Air France. The consensus among observers is that the first candidates for sale will be more robust industrial concerns such as Elf, Rhone-Poulenc and Pechiney. The likeliest financial contenders are AGF, the most resilient of the insurers, and BNP, which is seen as a safer bet in banking than Credit Lyonnais. Both the industrial and the financial groups are keen to see an end to the financial engineering which has sometimes accompanied state ownership: for instance, BNP reluctantly had to take a stake in Air France, and Pechiney had to acquire a stock market quotation for its international operations in order to make foreign acquisitions. The Paris bourse is also hoping for an end to its traditional liquidity problem. Mr Alphandery has already proposed to abolish investment tax on small investments, and yesterday's bill encourages employees to buy shares in their newly privatised companies. His overall goal is to persuade French investors to switch some of the FFr1,200bn now invested in money market funds into equities. It is very doubtful whether this second wave of privatisations will have the same impact on the Paris marketplace as the first wave. The number of individual owners of shares rose from 1.7m in 1986 to 6m two years later. Such an increase would be hard to repeat. But, regardless of what happens on the stock market, yesterday's bill probably marks a turning point in French industrial policy, particularly for those companies, such as Bull or Air France, which may be distant privatisation prospects. In the short and medium term, 'the way will be open for them to seek industrial partners which in many cases are a condition of their survival', Mr Alphandery said. Privatisation is also likely to have a knock-on effect on the 'monopolies' such as France Telecom, Electricite de France and Gaz de France. As monopolies at least at the retail level, these utilities are to stay within the state sector, but the industry ministry plans to introduce competition in some of their activities. Although this privatisation is not as far-reaching as those in the UK under Margaret Thatcher, one day France's utilities might end up in the private sector. Mr Alphandery has said that any company 'in the competitive sector' can be put up for sale.  -------------------------------------------------- COMPANIES ON 1986 PRIVATISATION LIST  -------------------------------------------------- AGF GAN UAP Bull Thomson Banque Hervet Credit Lyonnais Banque Nationale de Paris Pechiney Rhone-Poulenc Elf-Aquitaine Societe Marseillaise de Credit  -------------------------------------------------- 1993 ADDITIONS  -------------------------------------------------- Aerospatiale Air France Caisse Centrale de Reassurance Caisse Centrale de Prevoyance-Assurances Cie Generale Maritime Renault SEITA SNECMA Usinor-Sacilor  --------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Property: Controlled rewards of going Dutch - Rebecca Stephens examines the peculiar nature of investing in the Netherlands ARE property prices determined in the market? Not in the Netherlands. Here the price of tenanted properties, and most properties are tenanted, is calculated using a formula based on the controlled rent: take the net rent for the year, say, Fl 13,000, multiply this by a predetermined net annual return on investment, say 9 per cent, and there you have it - your purchase price at Fl 144,400. Easy. And cheap. For example one actual property in the centre of Rotterdam, a block of three good-sized one and two-bed flats, is Fl 144,400, approximately Pounds 48,000. Why so cheap? Most people rent rather than buy in the Netherlands; and rents are held low  -a three-bedroomed flat, can be rented for as little as Pounds 90 a month. This is in the 'controlled' market, in which rents are set by the government according to a point system, and index-linked. About 80 per cent of all Dutch property falls into this category. The rest - owner-occupied or rented - is in the free market where the rules of supply and demand apply. Only rented properties commanding a monthly rent over a Fl 730 (Pounds 240) threshold fall into this latter category. Of the properties rented, most are owned by institutions - insurance companies, pension funds and so on - that went into construction in a big way around the time of world war two, building row after row of dull, functional apartment blocks for the rental market. Until a few years ago, Dutch institutions investing in property had no choice but to do so within Dutch borders. When this restriction was lifted many off loaded residential property to finance diversification abroad. Whole blocks, even streets of properties are available to the private investor. 'There's a high potential for the individual investor to realise large capital gain on the resale of vacant property,' explains Simon Malster of Osbornes Solicitors. 'But,' he says, wary of the British paranoia of sitting tenants, 'the investment doesn't rely on the expectation of selling vacant-flats. You make money even keeping the tenants.' In his view Rotterdam is the place to be. It is not as pretty as Amsterdam, but there are ambitious plans for its development, property is cheap and rental yields - at about 9 per cent - are high enough to cover a 50 per cent mortgage. He says that as the years pass it grows easier. Rents may have been set decades ago, but when a tenant leave a new controlled rent is determined. This may be 50 per cent to 100 per cent more. Changes of tenant mean net annual yields can be pushed up to 14 or 15 per cent. Even where a tenant remains in occupation the rent is increased, by law, by a minimum of 5.5 per cent a year. Generally the rent pays off a 50 per cent mortgage in seven to ten years. So what is the catch? There could be periods when you are without a tenant and rental income, but this is unlikely in Rotterdam where there is a two-year waiting list. Interest rates might go up, but fixed-rate mortgages are easy to arrange. Rates in the Netherlands are about 10.5 per cent. There is no currency risk since the rental income and mortgage are both in guilders. Only when you repatriate the proceeds is there an exchange rate risk. The investment should be looked at over five years, suggests Malster. The Dutch government recently lowered the ceiling for controlled rents and could cut it further. This, together with rising rents, means that more and more properties will topple into the free market. There is no capital gains tax in the Netherlands for the small investor. Rents, however, will be taxed as income, and if you are resident in the UK you cannot offset interest payable on the mortgage against rental income.

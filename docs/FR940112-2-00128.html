			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A number of member organizations and the Investment Adviser Committee of the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'') represented to the Exchange that many of their customers who have their accounts managed by investment advisers do not want to receive proxy related information and annual reports or vote the proxy. These member organizations have indicated that their customers would rather have the professionals, whom they pay to manage their accounts, represent their interests relative to the companies in which they own stock because the professionals are better qualified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, banks, investment advisers and broker/dealers who are not subject to Exchange rules may receive proxy material and vote proxies on behalf of their customers in accordance with fiduciary obligations set forth by contractual arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments to Exchange Rules 450, 451, 452 and 465 will permit investment advisers who exercise investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract and who have been designated in writing by the beneficial owner, to receive proxy soliciting materials, annual reports and other related material and to vote proxies in lieu of the beneficial owners of securities. The term investment adviser is defiend to include a registered broker-dealer (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a member organization). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change will not diminish a beneficial owner's rights to receive proxy related materials and to vote proxies. Rather, it will give beneficial owners the option to designate their investment adviser as the person to receive such materials and to vote proxies. In addition, it will enable member organizations to comply with customer desires concerning transmission of proxy materials and voting proxies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which requires that the rules of the Exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in general, to protect the investing public, in that it establishes standards for investment advisers to receive proxy and related material and to vote proxies, thereby meeting customer needs while providing appropriate regulatory safeguards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange has neither solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments regarding this proposed rule change. The Exchange has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

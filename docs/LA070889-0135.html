			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL ISSUE OF ORANGE COUNTY LIFE;  </P> <P> NEW PRODUCTS TO AID HOMEOWNERS  </P> <P> What's new on the market?  </P> <P> A wood glue designed especially for darker woods.  </P> <P> Manufacturer's claim: The super-strength polymer glue is formulated to produce  a close match to darker wood, such as mahogany, cherry and cedar. It helps to  eliminate visible seams some yellow wood glues leave behind. It allows for easy  alignment of parts, good penetration of woods and easy cleanup, yet bonds  quickly. It is resistant to lacquers, varnishes, water and heat when dry. It  also resists softening and gumming-up of sandpaper as well as the heat  generated by sanding and cutting. It is water-based, non-sniffable and without  harmful fumes.  </P> <P> A solution that plates and replates pure gold over ordinary metals at home.  </P> <P> Manufacturer's claim: The solution is a bath that contains 24-karat gold in  liquid form and works with the natural electromotive forces within the metals  themselves. It will plate all jewelry and small items -- whether gold, gold  plate, silver, silver plate, nickel, brass, copper or bronze -- quickly and  inexpensively. It adheres evenly to the surface of clean base metals without  forming ridges or lines. Items are placed in a basket with the activator for  only 10 to 15 seconds and then washed in soapy water and buffed with a soft  cloth.  </P> <P> A hand masker-dispenser.  </P> <P> Manufacturer's claim: The dispenser enables professional or amateur painters to  dispense a continuous sheet of masking paper or film in one smooth stroke. It  is lightweight and compact. It places the protecting paper in place on walls,  windows and floors so they are not damaged by paint runs, roller mist or  overspray. It has only two moving parts and does not need lubrication. It comes  with a carrying holster for convenience.  </P> <P> The glue is manufactured by Borden Inc., 180 E. Broad St., Columbus, Ohio  43215; the gold replating solution by Sheffield Plate Polish Co., 1600  Orrington Ave., Evanston, Ill. 60201 and the masking tape dispenser by 3M DOY  Business, Building 223-4S-01, 3M Center, St. Paul, Minn. 55144.  </P></p>

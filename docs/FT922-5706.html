That, however, would have been the wrong conclusion. What the high-jinks marked was not Europe's biggest property development going under, but the formal launching by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa of the Pounds 70m, twin-hulled liner Radisson Diamond just across the Thames. Diamond Cruise's 19,000-tonne ship was of course already afloat, having sailed up from Tilbury overnight for the naming ceremony at Greenwich. The shipowners' president, Christian Aspegren, said he'd chosen the site, with Canary Wharf's tower dominating the background, as the place 'where world time begins and where we are celebrating the beginning of a new time in the world's cruise industry'. 'It is a great privilege to be on this glorious ship,' declared Dame Kiri as she christened each of its hulls with a bottle of champagne - a marked contrast to the bitter cup being drunk over the water.</p>

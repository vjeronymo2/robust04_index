			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 APARTMENT FIRES IN ORANGE INJURE 1, CAUSE HEAVY DAMAGE  </P> <P> Firefighters battled two separate blazes that left one woman critically injured  and caused nearly $200,000 in damage to three apartments Wednesday night,  authorities said.  </P> <P> The fires broke out within an hour and 10 blocks of each other in downtown  Orange and for a time had firefighters fearful that brisk winds would spread  sparks to neighboring wood roofs.  </P> <P> The cause of the fires was under investigation, but Battalion Chief Doug  Flaherty of the Orange Fire Department said they were unrelated.  </P> <P> The first blaze broke out shortly before 9:30 p.m. in a duplex in the 200 block  of Foley Place, according to Fire Capt. Rich Eggers.  </P> <P> A woman inside the duplex, identified as Mona McKay, 69, suffered severe burns  and was rushed to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where she was listed in  critical condition. Several firefighters were treated at the scene for minor  burns, Eggers said.  </P> <P> The fire caused $80,000 to $100,000 in damage to one unit in the two-story  duplex, Eggers said. The second unit was not damaged.  </P> <P> Word came about 10:15 p.m. of the second fire, in a four-unit apartment complex  in the 800 block of North Olive Street, fire officials said.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported from that fire, but two units were demolished and the  remaining two were damaged by smoke. Flaherty said the damage could exceed  $80,000.  </P> <P> The four families displaced by the fire found shelter with friends, according  to Steve Cooper of the American Red Cross.  </P> <P> Many of the firefighters left the Foley Place blaze for the Olive Street fire.  When units first arrived at the second fire, flames and smoke were showing in  the roof, prompting concern that the fire could spread. But firefighters were  able to bring the blaze under control a short time later.  </P></p>

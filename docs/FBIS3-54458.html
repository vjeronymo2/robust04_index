			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Torah Jewry [UTJ] has submitted a motion of  no-confidence in the government due to the desecration and  neglect of the Jewish graves in the cemetery on the Mount of  Olives in Jerusalem. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that  the Knesset will discuss the motion next Monday [31 January].  UTJ says the desecration of Jewish graves in the Mount of  Olives has been going on for a long time despite recurrent  complaints to the police and Police Minister Moshe Shahal's  promise from the Knesset podium to increase security there. UTJ  notes that the grave of Rabbi Yitzhaq Me'ir Levin, a former  minister of social welfare in an Israeli Government, was  vandalized last Saturday.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INS CHIEF RESIGNS; UNDER FIRE IN JUSTICE DEPT. AUDIT  </P> <P> Alan C. Nelson, criticized in a Justice Department audit earlier this year,  resigned under fire today as head of the Immigration and Naturalization  Service, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh announced.  </P> <P> Deputy INS Commissioner James L. Buck was named acting head of the service.  </P> <P> Justice Department spokesman David Runkel declined to say why Nelson was being  replaced before a permanent successor is found.  </P> <P> Department officials have privately expressed dissatisfaction with Nelson, a  holdover from the Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> Gene McNary, the chief executive of St. Louis County, Mo., is expected to be  nominated by President Bush to fill the post.  </P> <P> A Justice Department audit ordered by Thornburgh earlier this year criticized  the accounting, management and administrative practices at INS. It cited  growing backlogs in cases awaiting decisions and the loss by a regional office  of 23,000 citizenship certificates.  </P> <P> Nelson defended the agency, criticizing the audit as "grossly deficient," and  INS officials in Miami said all but 5% of the citizenship certificates in  question had been found.  </P> <P> The audit noted that the agency had spent $1,500 for an oil portrait of Nelson,  and Justice Department officials were privately critical of a videotape tribute  to Nelson that INS produced at taxpayer expense.  </P></p>

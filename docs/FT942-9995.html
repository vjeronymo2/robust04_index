			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Fears over UK inflation dampened enthusiasm in stock index futures, although expiry in traded options led to active trading, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,147, in line with underlying cash. Early buying saw it move slowly forward, with sentiment encouraged by favourable trading in other European markets. However, a cautious Bank of England report on inflation checked a sharp move ahead. The announcement of a reduction in German interest rates led to a flurry of buying activity and June rose to the day's peak of 3,154. But the buying soon faded, leaving the contract to drift lower, as dealers once again focused attention on the prospect of an increase in UK interest rates following the report on inflation. June closed at 3,133, down 11 on its previous close and just ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 3 points. Volume fell to 13,872. The expiry of the May stock options brought a sharp rise in turnover in the traded options. The closing total stood at 55,430 with a mere 9,631 dealt in the FT-SE 100 volume and 3,444 in the Euro FT-SE contract. Among the stock options, bid target Lasmo traded 5,936 and was followed by British Steel at 5,256 contracts. BAT Industries saw business of 3,963 lots and Tesco 2,619.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / The Long View: Too many fish in the fjord A SHARP reminder of the scale of the problems in Britain's financial system came this week when TSB, not one of the UK's very biggest banks, disclosed bad debt provisions of some Pounds 650m. A lot more of the same is inevitable when the main bank reporting season opens next month. How long will the crisis go on? This time last year there were hopes that the worst was over, but it has turned out otherwise. Extravagant booms based on credit, of the kind that we enjoyed between 1986 and 1989, have to be paid for over a lengthy period. There are plenty of international precedents; I was intrigued to receive recently an excellent study of the Norwegian boom and bust by Axel Dammann, a retired Norwegian banker. Perhaps the parallels between Norway, population 4.2m, and the UK should not be drawn too closely. But the Norwegian lending spree and surge of economic growth - mainland GDP increases averaged 4.2 per cent annually for the four-year period beginning 1983 - were very similar in scale to what happened in the UK for four years starting 1986, when economic growth was 3.8 per cent. Broad money growth in Norway reached some 18 per cent a year in 1984 and 1985, just as happened in the UK later in the decade. The gap of roughly three years could provide us with an opportunity to glimpse the UK's future. Again, we have to be careful not to jump to conclusions. At least Britain's banks will not have to bear the burden of a 32,000-ton surplus frozen salmon mountain, as Norway's did, in a particularly bizarre example of overexpansion; they financed far too many fish farms out in the fjords. But two facts stand out. Norway's GDP has remained stuck for five years at around the 1986 level. And in 1991, four years after the main lending boom ended, the major banks all had to be rescued by the government. Lending controls were abolished by the Norwegian government at the beginning of 1984, in pursuit of faster economic growth and lower interest rates. A huge demand for credit both from businesses and from private individuals became apparent. The stock market began to soar and house prices doubled between 1983 and 1987, while debt outstanding to mortgage institutions expanded 2 1/2 times to NKr100bn. An oversupply of commercial office space was developed. Business bankruptcies are now running at three times the level of the early 1980s. It sounds familiar. The economic hangover in Norway has proved to be much longer than anybody expected. Axel Dammann says there are three reasons: a lack of insight into the workings of the monetary side of the economy, an ignorance of the weak financial status of small companies, and inattention to the erosion of the reserves of the banks. Broad money growth has tailed away to an annual 5 or 6 per cent because of the unwillingness of banks to lend (inflation is about 4 per cent). The government and the central bank continue to be puzzled by the sluggishness of the domestic economy, but refuse to pin the blame on weak monetary growth. Elsewhere in Scandinavia similar banking crises have led to recent devaluations but the Norwegians are made of sterner stuff. To complete the parallels with the UK, Norway linked its currency to the Ecu in October 1990, the same month as sterling entered the exchange rate mechanism (although Norway is not a member state of the EC). In quite a lot of important respects the British recession appears to be developing along Norwegian lines. Monetary growth has tumbled to a level - around 5 1/2 per cent over the 12 months to last November on the M4 measure  -which is causing concern among monetary economists. The economy is much more sluggish than the Treasury computer says it should be. What lessons can we draw? Well, there should be much less talk about a hypothetical recovery in consumer confidence, and much more analysis of asset prices, loan security and the burden of debt at a period of high real interest rates. It is important to sustain confidence in the banking system, but it would be shortsighted to do so in a way which led to real problems being ignored. The deadly arithmetic of compound interest penetrates the whole problem. If interest cannot be paid, then it will not do any good to wait until next year because the problem can only get worse. In the past, inflation or a new credit-based recovery of asset prices have tended to bail out the banks and the troubled borrowers, but this cannot be expected to happen under a monetary regime ultimately controlled by the Bundesbank. The message from Norway is that asset prices, once overinflated by a lending boom, can drift back downwards year after year and eventually the banks will suffocate under the weight of their accumulating bad debts. You have to wonder whether the banks should really be paying out unchanged dividends, as TSB did this week, or should be preserving their dwindling capital with much greater care. Perhaps the government, which would have to foot the bill for rescuing any British banks, might start thinking about that. But the question of how the banks can best weather the current storm is only one point at issue. Beyond that, the question raised by what happened both in Norway and the UK in the 1980s is how on earth the banks can be prevented from causing a similar mess all over again should they be given half a chance. Competition must be encouraged, but not to the point where floods of money are distorting whole sectors of the economy. The property bubble will surely not recur for at least another decade, but the next boom might be in, say, small business lending, with government encouragement. Ultimately there must be the presence of a strong monetary authority, able to assess broad risks and control the pace of credit growth across the economy; it must be immune from temporary political pressures, however beguiling - such as to help first-time house buyers. The banks themselves, though, always seem irresistably inclined to swim with the flood tide, even when it is carrying them towards the rocks.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Finnish party tells PM to explore EC membership FINLAND'S prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, and his cabinet colleagues from the Centre party have been given full power by their divided party MPs to 'examine the conditions for Finland's eventual membership' of the European Community. The final decision on whether to apply to join the EC is still expected to be made next month by the centre-right coalition government. However, unless he can carry a majority of his party with him, Mr Aho will be unable to agree to an application. So far, he has not indicated what he wants to do although he is believed to be sympathetic to joining. Both the Conservatives, who are the Centre's main coalition partner, and the main opposition Social Democrats have come out strongly in support of an EC application by Finland. Some in the Centre party want to make any entry application conditional on Brussels treating Finland as a special case in sensitive areas like farm support. Other party leaders argue the EC will not accept such an approach. In the end, whether Finland joins the EC will be determined by a national referendum.</p>

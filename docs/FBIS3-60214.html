			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cali Cartel Laundered Narcodollars"] </F>   [Text] Rome, 19 Jan (ANSA) -- Florence Chief Prosecutor  Pierluigi Vigna, outlining the Unigold operation today,  complained that "once again we have had no notification from the  banks" involved in that operation to launder an estimated 100  million dollars a month by purchasing 1,000 kg of gold.    The banks used in the recycling scheme included Monte dei  Paschi di Siena, Banca Commerciale Italiana and the Banca  Populare dell'Etruria e del Lazio.    Vigna said his office was notifying Bank of Italy about the  financial institutes failure to report bank operations over 20  million lire. "Under present rules, only administrative  sanctions can be applied against banks that don't comply, but  that needs to be changed," Vigna said.    "A traffic on a scale and of a nature such as to risk  throwing out of kilter the mechanisms of the gold market in  Italy and, indeed, throughout the world," was how expert Adriano  Pansa described the laundry set up by the Cali cartel and the  Arezzo gold traders.    Revealing that investigators had uncovered details on just  three single operations totalling 300 million dollars, Pansa  pointed out that the money-washers were not overconcerned about  making a profit, since their main objective was simply to change  the drug revenue into cash, and thus often sold their gold below  the going rate.    He expressed the view that the apparent lack of Sicilian  Mafia involvement did not mean Cosa Nostra had not also been  using the laundry, since the mob has made a point of delegating  recycling to so-called "white-collar" teams, especially since  the massive Green Ice narco-traffic bust 18 months ago.    Six of the eight arrests in Italy, including Delgado (37),  were made at or near the northeastern city of Vicenza, home of  an alleged Italian ringleader, jewelry trader Rino Perozzo, and  also home to the twice-yearly Vicenza Gold trade fair (reputedly  the world's most important jewelry event), which has just opened.    The others arrested at Vicenza or nearby Bassano del Grappa  were Carlo Fabbroni (35), Fabrizio Meotti (47), Luciano Pataro  (43), and Nicola Pirro (25). Pataro's brother was arrested in  Arezzo. Of the four arrests in Panama, two were a well-known  pair of brothers--only the surname, Schwartz, was released  here--who have reportedly held a monopoly in gold trading since  the time of felled dictator Roberto Noriega.    The operation began last June when the US Drug Enforcement  Administration notified Italian authorities of a payment of  150,000 dollars from a US bank. Investigators traced the money  back to three Arezzo companies: Aurea Trading International,  Italian representative for the US Universe Gold Enterprise (both  owned by the Pataro brothers); Simar Joyeros Mayoristas, with an  office in Arezzo headed by Meotti and another in Panama run by  the Schwartz brothers; and Eurocatene, headed by Fabbroni.    These three companies held the bank accounts into which the  narcodollars were sent to be used to buy up gold on the Italian  market. The gold was then sent to be sold in Panama, after  which the clean dollars returned to the drug-traffickers.</p>

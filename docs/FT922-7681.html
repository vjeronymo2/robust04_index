			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: 'Renata' in recital GALINA Gorchakova is the young Russian soprano who had a triumph as Renata, the possessed heroine of Prokofiev's Fiery Angel, at a Prom last year, and again last month at Covent Garden, and on Thursday gave a recital on the South Bank. More precisely she is 28, West Siberian and at least as much a mezzo as a soprano: her gorgeous middle register, broad and liquid, stretches up toward Wagnerian heights, but also down to a pungently precise chest-voice. One of these days, she may have to choose; there are too few operatic roles that exploit a range like hers, and too many of the other ones trade upon a specialised vocal compass. In the Purcell Room, where she sang Rakhmaninov (mostly standards) and Tchaikovsky (mostly standards too), her top voice tended toward shrillness - but there anybody's would, at that volume. 'The higher, the louder' seemed to be her maxim. Gorchakova has next to no recital-experience, one gathers, since her enormous operatic potential was recognised and seized upon so early. I regret having missed her Renata at the Royal Opera, which must have exercised her powers to the best possible advantage. In her mere songs with piano (Iain Burnside, expert but over-insistent), Miss Gorchakova was unstinting of voice and conventionally sincere in feeling. Rakhmaninov and Tchaikovsky alike were enacted in tasteful dramatic tones and dignified operatic gestures. Those had to do duty for the missing nuances which should have brought the songs to sharper individual life. All of it was honest (and loud), but most of it was expressively bland. Nonetheless, the evergreen 'None but the lonely heart' sat beautifully on her best register; and by and large, the voice itself was such a free, opulent pleasure that one could only sit back and enjoy. Still, it would be exciting some day to hear her exploring songs in subtler detail - less like an all-purpose diva, more like a committed interpreter.</p>

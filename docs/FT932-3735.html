			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: DTI launches investigation into Alpine The Department of Trade and Industry has launched an investigation into the affairs of Alpine (Double Glazing), which ceased trading at the end of May. The inquiry follows several approaches to the DTI from former employees over the last six months. The DTI is investigating under section 447 of the Companies Act 1985. This authorises an officer of the department to require a company, or its present or former employees to produce documents and provide explanations. The DTI would also have powers to extend the investigation to a body, which, although incorporated outside Britain, has been carrying on business in the UK. Based on its findings the DTI would decide whether to launch a full investigation. Alpine was put into administrative receivership last week. A creditors' meeting to vote on liquidation is to be held on Tuesday in London.</p>

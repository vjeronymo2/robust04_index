			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: UCLA FILM ARCHIVES OFFERS GLIMPSE OF COLOMBIAN CINEMA  </P> <P> "Colombian Film Today: From Magic to Realism," composed of a dozen films that  the UCLA Film Archive is presenting in Melnitz Theater today through May 15,  introduces a national cinema all but unknown in the United States.  </P> <P> By chance, the three films available for preview focus on men who may not be  what they seem. The first of the three to screen (on Tuesday), Mario Ribero's  "Ambassador From India" (1986), is an amusing, lighthearted comedy loosely  inspired by Gogol's "Inspector General." Hugo Gomez stars as an amiable  ne'er-do-well who passes himself off as none other than India's ambassador to  Colombia traveling incognito. Arriving by bus at a small Colombian town, Gomez  finds himself treated with such pomp and ceremony that even the British royals  or Donald Trump would find it excessive. Indeed, Gomez, who is a sly comedian,  finds himself caught up in a nonstop succession of entertainments as tedious  and pretentious as those Imelda Marcos used to stage. As funny and likable as  "Ambassador From India" is, it is somewhat meandering, and its satire is broad  and affectionate rather than sharp and reflective.  </P> <P> You may at first feel that Francisco Norden's relentlessly somber 1984 "A Man  of Principle" (Saturday) requires considerable familiarity with Colombian  political history. While that certainly wouldn't hurt, the film soon becomes a  clear-cut study of a rigid family man (Frank Ramirez) who, while struggling to  keep his position on the lower rungs of the middle-class, emerges as an  iron-willed political terrorist. The film, set in the late '40s, is doggedly  austere and tedious.  </P> <P> Genuinely unpredictable, Pepe Sanchez's seemingly artless 1985 "Little San  Antonio" (Sunday) is set at the turn-of-the-century. A handsome, impoverished  country youth (Carlos Jaramillo) charms a succession of women, first in his  home village and later in town, into backing his education at a seminary, where  he is to study for the priesthood. Sanchez evokes with both humor and  compassion a time when ladies of refinement but straitened circumstances had  little recourse but to take in boarders and spend their days in tedious daily  religious rituals and considerable indolence -- a perfect atmosphere for the  repression of sexuality. Never mind that "Little San Antonio" is marred by a  truly terrible jangly score -- it is the rare film in which a protracted  buildup ends with a dynamite payoff.  </P> <P> For show times and full schedule: (213) 206-FILM, (213) 206-8013.  </P> <P> A fresh print of Stanley Donen's glorious 1957 "Funny Face" closes AFI Film  Fest Thursday and then opens a one-week revival at the AMC Century 14. Fred  Astaire stars as a Richard Avedon-ish fashion photographer and Audrey Hepburn  is a mousy Greenwich Village bluestocking transformed into a radiant model.  Featuring Gershwin standards, "Funny Face" is even more enjoyable than when it  was new; they don't make witty, high-style sophisticated romantic musicals like  this anymore.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a Norma Shearer retrospective gets underway at LACMA Friday at 1  p.m. and again at 8 p.m. with "Marie Antoinette" (1938), a landmark costume  pictures in which Shearer nevertheless gives a remarkably shaded portrayal of a  frustrated, frivolous but finally gallant and brave queen.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 857-6010.  </P></p>

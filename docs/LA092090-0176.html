			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCKEON MAY NOT LAST WEEK WITH PADRES  </P> <P> The Padre ownership group has decided to fire Jack McKeon, vice president of  baseball operations, sources said Wednesday, but it is waiting to find a  replacement before the decision is announced.  </P> <P> Padre Chairman Tom Werner, reached at his Los Angeles office, said: "It's  inappropriate to comment at this time.  </P> <P> I'm sorry, that's all I can say."  </P> <P> McKeon, who has been with the Padres since July, 1980, said: "I haven't heard a  word, but they have the prerogative to do what they want. I don't have anything  to be ashamed of."  </P> <P> McKeon, who has one year left on his contract that will pay him $400,000, is  scheduled to meet Werner on Friday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Although  the meeting was scheduled a month ago, sources close to McKeon said that he  plans to address his status.  </P> <P> It's unknown who the Padres plan to hire for McKeon's position. They have  interviewed Gordon Ash, Toronto Blue Jay assistant general manager, and are  believed to have interviewed Roger Jonegewaard, the Seattle Mariners' vice  president for scouting and development. Sources say the Padres hope to  interview Larry Himes, who will leave as the Chicago White Sox general manager  at the end of the season.  </P> <P> The Padres also have asked for permission from the Minnesota Twins to interview  General Manager Andy MacPhail, but MacPhail turned down the request.  </P></p>

The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the initiation of this investigation on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 2, 1993 (58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993), the following events have occurred:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 27, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination in this case ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  USITC Publication 2714, December, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 14, 1994, we issued the antidumping questionnaire to Hornos Electricos de Venezuela, S.A. (Hevensa), which accounted for at least sixty percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. On January 20, 1994, representatives of the Department of Commerce (the Department) met with Hevensa officials in Venezuela to provide further explanation of the antidumping questionnaire and to answer outstanding technical and procedural questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Responses to the questionnaire were received on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 14, 1994, and March 1, 1994. On March 10, 1994, petitioners in this investigation, Elkem Metals Company and the Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers, Local 3&hyph;639, submitted comments regarding deficiencies in Hevensa's questionnaire responses. A supplemental questionnaire was issued to Hevensa on March 25, 1994. Hevensa submitted responses to this questionnaire on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 19, 1994, and May 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 15, 1994, petitioner submitted an allegation that Hevensa had sales below the cost of production (COP) in the home market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the request of petitioners, on March 30, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determination until no later than June 10, 1994 (59 FR 16177, April 6, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 9, 1994, based on petitioner's March 15, 1994 allegation, the Department initiated an investigation of sales below COP in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision memorandum from Richard Moreland to Barbara Stafford, dated May 9, 1994). We issued a COP questionnaire on May 9, 1994. However, because Hevensa's COP response is not due until June 22, 1994, this information could not be considered for the preliminary determination. It will be considered for the final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners and Hevensa submitted comments regarding certain issues throughout May and June, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Postponement of Final Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 27, 1994, Hevensa requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation, the Department postpone its final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary determination. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary determination is affirmative, and no compelling reasons for denial exist, we are postponing the final determination until the 135th day after the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight not less than 4% iron, more than 30% manganese, more than 8% silicon and not more than 3% phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also be classifiable under HTS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation (POI) is June 1, 1993, through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / US sets Bosnian Serbs deadline on peace plan: Clinton threatens to seek lifting of arms embargo President Bill Clinton yesterday set a deadline of October 15 for Bosnian Serb acceptance of an international peace plan or the US would urge the United Nations Security Council to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. The administration's purpose appears more aimed at heading off congressional moves to force the president into a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo than to put extra pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. The president's proposal in a letter to Congress came just before the US Senate was due to consider a separate proposal to order Mr Clinton to lift US participation in the embargo by November 15. 'If by October 15 the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the Contact Group's proposal of July 6, 1994, it would be my intention to introduce formally and support a resolution at the UN Security Council to terminate the arms embargo,' Mr Clinton wrote to Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the armed services committee. The Bosnian Serbs have refused to accept a peace map drawn up by the so-called Contact Group, consisting of the US, the UK, France, Germany and Russia, which has led the negotiations. The map roughly divides Bosnia-Hercegovina into equal shares between the Serbs and a Croat-Moslem federation. Meanwhile, Russia yesterday called for the lifting of the economic embargo on Serbia, which has cut links with the Bosnian Serbs. A foreign ministry spokesman said the sanctions are now 'illogical and counterproductive', as Serbia appears to have kept its word on the blockade. The president's letter to Senator Nunn states bluntly US concerns about the impact of unilateral action to lift the arms embargo, according to extracts made available to the Washington Post. It states that US relations with its allies would be 'seriously strained', co-operation with Russia put in jeopardy and the likelihood of US military involvement 'increased, not decreased'. The lightly armed but increasingly assertive Bosnian army, which would profit most from access to western heavy weapons, yesterday continued to make advances against Bosnian Serb troops. Increased movement of Bosnian government troops around Sarajevo are an increasing concern for UN forces. 'All this is worrying because any increase in the number of troops can tip the balance in the area of Sarajevo and Visoko (north-west of the capital),' a UN spokesman said. However, around Sarajevo, fighting had reportedly tapered off a day after the UN threatened both sides with Nato air strikes for violating the heavy weapon exclusion zone. The first threat of air strikes directed at the Bosnians had come as the Bosnian army appeared increasingly keen to launch a fresh military campaign to take strategic roads from the Bosnian Serb forces.</p>

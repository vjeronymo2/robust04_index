			<p>BFN     [Text] A youth from al-Zahiriyah was injured tonight by  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire as he was hurling stones at  soldiers south of Hebron. He sustained moderate injuries and  was treated at a nearby Army clinic and then transferred to the  hospital.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that in the Jabalyah  refugee camp, a 10-year-old child was slightly wounded by rubber  bullets as he and his friends were hurling stones at IDF  soldiers around midday today. He was transferred to a hospital  in Gaza.    A Molotov cocktail was thrown at No. 25 bus on the Neve  Ya'aqov-French Hill road tonight. No one was hurt and no damage  was caused.</p>

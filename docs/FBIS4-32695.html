			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "vg": "Talks With the Hungarian Civic Party Can </F> Begin; Miklos Duray and Vojtech Bugar Signed Coalition Agreement  Between Coexistence and the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement"]    [Text] Bratislava--Miklos Duray, chairman of the  Coexistence movement, and Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], signed a  coalition agreement yesterday. As Miklos Duray stated at a  subsequent briefing, the aim of the coalition agreement is the  formation of a political alliance that will be able, in a  political struggle, to develop the law-governed state and  strengthen democratic forces. The coalition partners agreed on  close postelection cooperation in and outside parliament, as  well as on the establishment of joint committees for the  coordination of policies in the spheres of self-administration,  economy, and education. According to Vojtech Bugar, the  agreement is a preparation for postelection scenarios and is  designed to meet the expectations of Hungarian voters. The  agreement is subject to ratification by the supreme bodies of  both political entities. Both chairmen stressed that the  political part of the agreement would be published in full,  while the publication of its other parts, as well as the number  of parliamentary clubs, will still be subject to talks.    As the MKDH chairman went on to say, the agreement provides  for the possibility of another partner entering this coalition;  talks on the possibility of expanding the coalition with the  Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] opened yesterday. In the event of  agreement with MOS, a new coalition agreement will be signed,  which will also contain a section anchoring "very close  cooperation. Such cooperation is necessary because we know  that, during the two years of the Hungarian coalition's  existence, there have been various attempts to break it up," the  MKDH chairman added.    Responding to the demand of MOS Chairman L. Nagy for a  25-percent representation of his party on the common slate of  candidates, as this corresponds to the number of "Hungarian"  votes MOS won in the last elections, Vojtech Bugar said that  proceeding from the results of two years ago was unthinkable.  Miklos Duray even qualified this condition as ridiculous.</p>

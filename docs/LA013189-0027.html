			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS OF THE MIND  </P> <P> Labyrinths of Reason: Paradox, Puzzles and the Frailty of Knowledge by William  Poundstone (Doubleday: $18.95; 274 pages)  </P> <P> I wish I knew why I continue to be fascinated by philosophy, particularly in  questions of knowledge, such as: How do we know what we know? When is something  proved? Are there limits to what we can know? What are they?  </P> <P> Like many philosophical questions, these matters have been thought about for  millennia, and, sadly, we are no closer to the answers today than the ancient  Greeks were.  </P> <P> One intriguing question is why we think about these things at all. What quirk  of mind brings us back to these same puzzling and insoluble dilemmas that are  largely irrelevant to everyday life? Why all the razzmatazz?  </P> <P> After all, there are no philosophers on the freeway. No one thinks twice about  whether the cars are really there or what the consequences of hitting one will  be. Faith in our senses guides us through most things we do. Why not carry it  into all realms and stop worrying about how we can be sure and related  conundrums?  </P> <P> No harm if you do, but in the 20th Century, the questions themselves have been  sharpened, and the ambiguity of the answers is also more clearly understood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Things We'll Never Know  </P> <P> "We don't see everything, not even everything implicit in our experience,"  William Poundstone concludes at one point in "Labyrinths of Reason," his  exceptionally good, crystal-clear survey of the limits of knowledge. "There are  things going on out there that we will never appreciate."  </P> <P> Starting with simple paradoxes and puzzles, Poundstone shows how the  ambiguities and unanswerable questions of reason do not simply go away if you  ignore them. Swept under the rug, they accumulate there until they are a  noticeable bulge, affecting questions about the nature of meaning and mind  itself.  </P> <P> Can you think of a common English word that begins and ends with the letters  UND?  </P> <P> How do you go about looking for an answer? You could try the brute-force  method, starting with undAund, undBund, through undZund, then on to undAAund,  undABund, through undZZund. But you will be at it a very long time.  </P> <P> Many people hit on the right word without too much thought, certainly not by  the brute-force approach. How do they do it? No one knows.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Thinking of Nothing  </P> <P> Where is mind, anyway? It's in the brain presumably, but where? Poundstone asks  whether the circuits of a pocket calculator have any awareness that they are  doing arithmetic. Not that we can tell. But we certainly have awareness that we  are doing arithmetic, or reading the newspaper or thinking about whatever it is  that we are thinking about. Question: Could we be aware that we are thinking  about nothing? Probably not. The awareness itself would be the thinking.  </P> <P> But how do we know, Poundstone asks, that we are really experiencing all that  we think we are experiencing? How do we know that our brains are not simply  stuck in laboratory vats filled with nutrients and attached to electrodes that  scientists stimulate to create the sensations we experience? We don't know, and  we can't know, though it seems unlikely.  </P> <P> This "brains in vats" riddle is the starting point for Poundstone's book, which  then proceeds through paradoxes of induction and deduction, ambiguity and  certainty, to show that there are inherent, inviolable limits of knowledge.  Along the way, Poundstone discusses many famous paradoxes, such as the paradox  of the unexpected hanging, the prisoner's dilemma and Newcomb's paradox, with  many variations and twists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Classic Paradox  </P> <P> The unexpected hanging goes like this: a convicted man is sentenced to be  hanged at dawn in the coming week, but the judge tells him that he will not  know beforehand which day he will die. The prisoner is delighted. He reasons  that the judge's sentence cannot be carried out:  </P> <P> He cannot be executed on Saturday (the last day of the week), because once he  made it past Friday morning, he'd know for sure that the execution would be  Saturday, and that would violate the judge's rule. He would know beforehand  which day he was going to die. So Saturday is out.  </P> <P> Working backwards, that means he cannot be executed on Friday, either. Once he  survived through Thursday morning, and knowing that he couldn't be hanged on  Saturday, he would know for sure that he was to be hanged on Friday. That, too,  violates the judge's order.  </P> <P> By the same reasoning, he can't be hanged on Thursday, Wednesday or any other  day.  </P> <P> So the prisoner sleeps soundly. Until Tuesday morning, when the executioner  arrives and the prisoner is hanged. Despite the prisoner's airtight reasoning,  the sentence was carried out, and the judge's order was obeyed. The prisoner  didn't know beforehand what day he was going to be hanged.  </P> <P> </P> <P> For Non-Philosophers  </P> <P> Poundstone deftly discusses these matters and many, many more in an extremely  lucid way. He is not the first writer to tackle these subjects for  non-specialized readers, but he does it very well. If you have had trouble  reading Douglas Hofstadter or Raymond Smullyan but are interested in these  things nonetheless, Poundstone may be your man. His book is easier -- but no  less deep -- than others on similar topics.  </P> <P> "In few other fields is it possible for the interested non-expert to sample so  much of the true flavor of the field and have fun doing it," Poundstone writes.  His book demonstrates the truth of the statement.  </P> <P> Oh, the common word that begins and ends with UND. Try underground.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER NIGHTMARE FOR HAITI  </P> <P> Haiti's military president, Gen. Prosper Avril, seems to be getting the message  that other nations won't stand for his government's crackdown against political  opponents. He's already promised to lift a 30-day state of siege just a week  after imposing it.  </P> <P> But it'll take more than that to persuade Haitians that Avril's not just  another dictator on the make.  </P> <P> Avril says that he acted to maintain order after a powerful military officer  was assassinated, but the reaction was out of proportion. Dozens of moderate  political leaders were arrested, some held in prison without charges and others  exiled from the country. They include the man who wrote Haiti's new  constitution after former dictator Jean Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier was ousted  in February, 1986. Others Avril exiled included two potential presidential  candidates in the Haitian election slated for October -- which could be the  first legitimate vote since Duvalier fled.  </P> <P> Avril insists that the election will go on, but his crackdown looks  suspiciously like an attempt to disrupt pre-electoral activities just as the  opposition is getting itself organized. It has also fed a growing fear that  Avril, who loyally served Duvalier, either wants the old regime to return or  would like to install himself as a new dictator.  </P> <P> That's why the United States is warning Avril that aid will be cut off unless  civil liberties are restored -- and why France, Haiti's other major aid  provider, has cut off aid. This is the tough but correct stance to take, and it  should be maintained until every opposition leader is either out of detention  or allowed back into the country to resume the work of turning Haiti into a  real democracy.  </P></p>

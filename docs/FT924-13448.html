			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Call for reform of intangibles reporting COMPANIES should include both purchased and internally created intangible assets on their balance sheets, according to a study sponsored by the Accounting Standards Board and the research board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Intangible assets are non-physical assets such as brand names which a growing number of companies are showing in their accounts with little guidance on their treatment. The Manchester University study will intensify the debate over whether intangibles should be recognised. It says intangibles should be included provided the existence and amount can be justified. It also wants greater disclosure of the nature of valuations. Goodwill and other intangibles. Research Board, ICAEW, PO Box 433, Moorgate Place, London EC2P 2BJ. Pounds 10.

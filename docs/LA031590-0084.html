			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Davis Out of Hospital: Sammy Davis Jr. is at home in Beverly Hills after being  released Tuesday from Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he underwent several weeks  of chemotherapy for a recurrence of throat cancer. A spokeswoman says Davis,  64, will concentrate on resting and building his strength. He was first  diagnosed as having carcinoma of the throat last September and was forced to  drop out of a concert tour with Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra so he could  undergo radiation treatment.

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / EOC says women overlooked by Tecs TRAINING and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales are abandoning training programmes for women returning to work after bringing up their families, an investigation by the Equal Opportunities Commission has found. It said the setting up of the employer-led Tecs to deliver government-funded training schemes had not made a 'jot of difference' to the take-up of training opportunities between men and women. A squeeze on budgets, as well as the nature of contracts between Tecs and the government, meant that priority was being given to schemes for young people and the long-term unemployed adults, said the commission. It said: 'As a result, programmes and initiatives for labour market returners were being severely curtailed - a short-term policy which could well prove short-sighted.' Women returners were now 'a constant and vital component of the workforce.' The formal investigation by the commission - the results of which have been submitted to Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary - also discovered a lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation of schemes by Tecs. The commission said the councils were mostly 'either unable or unwilling' to provide figures on how many women were provided with training places. It is recommending to Mrs Shephard that Tecs should be obliged to carry out monitoring as part of their contracts. Some Tecs with large ethnic minorities had initiated valuable schemes to help women in those communities. The publicly-funded vocational training system in England and Wales.

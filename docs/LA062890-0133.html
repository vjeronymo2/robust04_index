			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> ACTION ON RESERVOIR STUDIED  </P> <P> The City Council will consider legal action to stop the Metropolitan Water  District of Southern California from reopening Garvey Reservoir until an  environmental impact report on the structure is completed.  </P> <P> The 35-year-old reservoir was shut down in November after leaks from its  foundation flooded about a dozen homes on Fulton Avenue.  </P> <P> The water district has proposed a $20-million to $25-million repair plan that  includes sealing two cracks, lining the reservoir with concrete and asphalt,  installing a drainage system, and digging more wells to detect further leaks.  </P> <P> Monday night, Councilman Samuel Kiang asked the city attorney to discuss the  council's legal options "as soon as possible." Also, Councilwoman Marie T.  Purvis suggested writing to cities that use MWD water, including El Monte,  South El Monte and Montebello, to call their attention to Monterey Park's  concerns.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with press secretary to Zambian </F> president, Richard Sakala, by reporter Steyn de Preuter on the  "PM News Wrap" program -- recorded]    [Text] Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has named two  new cabinet ministers to replace those who resigned last week.  Allegations of drug smuggling have rocked Chiluba's cabinet in  recent weeks and cast doubt on the future of his government.  Chiluba spokesman Richard Sakala says the reshuffle cannot be  interpreted as an admission of guilt.    [Begin recording] [Sakala] He has made the reshuffle to  replace ministers who had resigned, in particular, there were  three ministers ... [changes thought] two ministers who have  resigned -- the minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Vernon Mwaanga,  and Princess Nakatindi. These were two cabinet ministers. Mr.  Mwaanga, as I said was Foreign Affairs, and Princess Nakatindi  was Community Development and Social Welfare. Now these two  resigned in order to give government an opportunity to  investigate allegations that have been made in the media and by  some people, that they were involved in drug trafficking. They  felt that an investigation could not be carried out effectively  if they remained in office and, as a matter of principle, they  decided to step down to allow for an investigation.    [De Preuter] Now how are you going to ensure that the  investigations into these allegations will not be a cover-up?    [Sakala] Yes absolutely, the investigations will be done. We  have, what we call the DEC, the Drug Enforcement Commission,  which is a body that deals with nothing but investigations and  prosecutions in the cases of drugs, and these matters have been  referred to them and they will undertake an investigation, and  obviously, at the end of it all they will produce a report for  everybody to see.    [De Preuter] The Zambian people appeared to have lost faith  in the Chiluba government as far as corruption and drug  trafficking is concerned. What are you going to do to restore  that confidence?    [Sakala] I don't know the basis of that conclusion, because  yesterday at the press conference it was made very clear -- in  fact the president did produce a report of investigations that  have been undertaken into issues of corruption where ministers  are involved. All the cases involving about five ministers, who  are alleged to be involved in corruption, were fully  investigated by the anti- corruption commission and where  necessary steps were taken. The director of public prosecution  was advised to consider prosecution, and where he felt it fit,  he would prosecute. There is not a single minister who has been  prosecuted for corruption because there has been no such  corruption proved against them. [end recording]</p>

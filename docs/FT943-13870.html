			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Iraq offers olive branch to Arab neighbours: Saddam tries to mend fences with 'rulers who misbehaved towards us' in Gulf war Iraq yesterday offered 'peace and security' to neighbouring regimes which had 'misbehaved' towards Baghdad, in a speech by President Saddam Hussein apparently aimed at Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt. Mr Saddam's remarks, in a televised address on the 26th anniversary of his ruling Baath party's ascent to power, are among the most direct since the Gulf war, aimed at mending relations with Arab states which opposed Iraq during the conflict. Without naming any countries, Mr Saddam said he was offering peace to all neighbours, including 'rulers who misbehaved towards us'. Mr Saddam's speech is a further attempt to rehabilitate Iraq both among its neighbours and in the west, though it contained characteristically belligerent proclamations that Iraq remained unweakened and unbowed by its post-Gulf war isolation. 'It has become known to everybody', said Mr Saddam, 'that we fear no one but the Almighty.' The apparently placatory remarks, however, follow concerted lobbying by Iraq for the lifting of the four-year-old sanctions against Baghdad, which have increased in intensity as economic conditions in the country have continued to deteriorate. The United Nations sanctions committee meets today to review the embargo against Iraq, and diplomats and UN officials expect the restrictions to be kept in place. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, has been in New York lobbying Security Council members for the past week, arguing that Iraq has now fulfilled Gulf war ceasefire resolutions calling for the destruction and monitoring of its weapons of mass destruction. However, the UN special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction says it has not yet completed installation of its monitoring regimes for biological, chemical, ballistic and nuclear weapons. These, officials say, should be in place by September and would require at least six months' testing before the commission could conclude that Iraq was meeting the terms of the monitoring regime. But diplomats in New York add that Iraq could effect a substantial improvement in the Security Council's attitude towards Baghdad if Mr Saddam's regime were to make a public and unequivocal commitment to the recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and to its newly UN-defined borders  something at which yesterday's remarks perhaps hinted. 'If they came forward and did this, there would be an immediate effect,' said one UN official.</p>

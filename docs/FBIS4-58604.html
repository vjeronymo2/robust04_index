			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled announcement] </F>   [Text] Dear listeners, we have received the following:    The House of Representatives held a session this morning  under its Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar to  discuss the latest military developments in the country. The  House called on all the masses of the Yemeni people to stand by  Constitutional legitimacy and rally around the legitimate  political leadership under brother Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and  supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The House also called on  all officers, noncommissioned officers, and personnel of the  Armed and Security Forces in the Republic of Yemen to rally  around the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces and not to obey  orders unless they are issued by the supreme commander of the  Armed Forces.    The House also decided to withdraw confidence in the  secessionist elements in the leadership of the [Yemeni]  Socialist Party [YSP] for their persistent wrongdoing which  reached the extent of raiding the capital Sanaa and the two  cities of Ta'izz and al-Hudaydah with aircraft and frightening  the inhabitants and disturbing sleeping children. The House of  Representatives also ratified the declaration of a state of  emergency and authorized the political leadership to issue the  necessary decisions to deal with the situation through which the  country is passing. The people's deputies also decided to keep  the House in open session.    The House has earlier reviewed and ratified the minutes of  its previous session.</p>

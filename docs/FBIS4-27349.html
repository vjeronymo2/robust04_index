			<p>CSO     [Text] The study work on a "green GDP" [gross domestic  product] indicating the monetary cost to the environment such as  destruction of the environment or loss of resources is having  rough sailing. Three ministries and agencies, the Environment  Agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries,  and the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], have been doing joint  research in a three-year program since fiscal 1992, but they are  still no further than "the study stage" (EPA). The prospects are  that preparation of a specific proposal will be slipped to next  fiscal year or thereafter. The main cause is that many elements  must be considered in the worsening of the environment such as  atmosphere, water quality, and soil, and the calculation has  become complicated. Also in the background is the fact that  attention has been diverted to economic growth with the  prolonged sluggish economy, and concern about environment issues  is waning.    The green GDP also is called the "environment economic  calculation" and it reckons the monetary cost of environmental  pollution or the extent of environmental destruction and the  outlay it will require to preserve the environment. This is  checked against the GDP proper as the cost to the environment  and the aim is to see the relationship between economic growth  and preservation of the environment.    The reason the study work has not progressed is due to the  many items comprising the green GDP.    For example, if there were tropical rain forests where the  chief problem was felling of forests, the cost to the  environment would be easily calculated. However, the economy of  an advanced nation like Japan embraces many problems linked to  worsening of the environment such as various kinds of pollution,  waste materials, fluorocarbon gas exhaust, or reduction of  resources, and it is difficult to see or determine what the cost  is. The progress of technology also has been swift on  reutilization of resources and pollution prevention, and is  making it difficult to decide on the scope of calculations.</p>

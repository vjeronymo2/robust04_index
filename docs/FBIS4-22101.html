			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 24, (IRNA) -- National security  director general at the Information Ministry, Musavi-Nejad said  in an interview here today that the terrorist who shot and  wounded the Mashhad Friday prayer leader had links with the  "Munafiqeen (Hypcrites) Khalq Outfit" (MKO).    He identified the attacker as Ali Houri nick-named "Popi"  from the Haft Tappeh region of Khuzestan in southwest Iran.    Houri after his failed assassination bid against  Hojatoleslam  Mohammad Abaei-Khorasani just after the latter had finished his  Friday prayer sermons, tried to shoot himself to escape the fury  of the worshippers.    Musavi-Nejad said the attacker who underwent surgery at Imam  Redha (AS) hospital had shot himself with the idea of committing  suicide.    Hoj. Abaei-Khorasani who was struck by two bullets on the  back of his shoulder, is recovering at Qaem hospital where he  was operated upon after the attack. A third bullet fired by the  attacker missed the prayer leader and injured a theology student.    The Information Ministry official asked to comment on the  motives of the attack, said the MKO because of its nature will  not abandon its terrorism. Moreover, he said, it has reached a  deadlock in Iraq.    Musavi-Nejad recalled that at the outbreak of the Iraqi war  (1980-88), the MKO shouted slogans against Saddam Husayn but  soon, however, it became attached to Saddam Husayn.    He said that during the past two years the MKO had conducted  blasts along the Iran-Iraq border in the name of the masses. He  said the MKO selected young persons in the country with promises  and encouraged them to carry out terrorist operations.    Musavi said those that cooperate with MKO will be considered  as being against the security of the country and will be  prosecuted.    Regarding the reason why the MKO is looking for people  inside  the country for terrorist operations he said there were many  reasons.    "One of those reasons is, the MKO wants to propagate that it  has cells inside the country, whereas it is not so. The second  reason is, the people deceived by the MKO are without previous  records and if they did anything the MKO can deny their  terrorist acts," he said.    The third reason is that the group has been under pressure  since its flight from the country and considers this a way for  its presence.    The fourth reason, added Musavi-Nejad, such people are  considered to be forces at no cost, and the MKO without  incurring any expenditure exploits them.    He said the grouplet is not even willing to pay for the  costs  of exit from Iran of its people and they steal the jewelery of  their mothers or borrow from friends to go abroad.    These measures of the MKO, he said, are exactly the  expectation of Iraq which has always planned subversive  operations in the Islamic Republic.    About the writer of the past regime, Saeedi Sirjani, and his  fate, the Information Ministry official said, Sirjani was  arrested along with an accomplice named Mohammad Sadeq Saeed,  with the nickname Niaz Kermani, for involvement in a drug ring  and for acts against public decency, and both of them have  confessed of their acts.    The two principel accused persons, he said, have been  interrogated by the ministers of information for cooperation  with Savak and for involvement in it.    He said both Saeedi and Niaz Kermani had connections with  Savak, the Shah's notorious secret service, after the triumph of  the Islamic revolution    Musavi-Nejae said the two have already confessed to such  charges as drug trafficking, making and possessing alcoholic  beverages, sodomy, conncections with a group of savak-related  army officers that were involved with the Nowzheh State coup,  and receipt of [word indistinct] amount of foreign exchanges  from anti- revolutionary elements in the United States and  Europe.    He said investigations are under way in that connection.</p>

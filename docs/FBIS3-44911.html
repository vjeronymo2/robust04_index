			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter" by Bei Yue (0554 4766) ] </F>   [Text] New York, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--U.S.  industrial and commercial sectors voiced their dissatisfaction  with the decision to cut quotas unilaterally for Chinese textile  products, believing that the unilateral U.S. move would cause  tremendous damage to American consumers and the worry that China  will retaliate.    (Richard Blake), business service director of the U.S.-China  Trade Commission, believes that the decision will increase  tension between the two countries and that there is nothing good  about the decision for U.S.-China trade and economic ties. He  worries that the unilateral U.S. decision could cost China over  $1 billion in economic losses; that American agriculture,  especially the cotton export trade, would be the first to feel  the impact by becoming a target of Chinese retaliation; and that  U.S. high technology might not escape unharmed.    Chinese textile products and garments are very cheap in the  U.S. market and are much welcomed by American consumers. U.S.  statistics show that last year China exported its quota of $4.6  billion of garments and textile products to the United States.  Tens of thousands of American consumers will be hurt if the  United States reduces the Chinese textiles quota. (Rece  Marlin), chairman of the National Federation of American Retail  Industry, stated the federation would urge the U.S. Government  to solve the problem by negotiating with China and he hoped that  this move was only a negotiating tactic.    (Laura Jones), executive chairman of the American Textile  and  Garments Import Association, expressed anger at the U.S.  Government's trade sanctions and threats, seeing this punitive  move against China as a means to placate the American textile  industry and their supporters in Congress. Jones worried that  China might adopt corresponding retaliatory action.    Mr. Wu Zheng, vice president of the newly founded U.S.-China  General Chamber of Commerce, expressed regret at the decision,  saying that the U.S. decision would affect both U.S.-China trade  and Hong Kong. He believes that the decision exposes the rise  of trade protectionism and that the American textile industry is  a "sunset" industry which is incapable of competing with the  East. Trade expansion between the United States and China  benefits both parties and is the current trend. Both sides  should replace confrontation with talks in order to settle  differences over textile trade.    This move by Washington has had a great impact on  businessmen  of Chinese nationality, who play an important role in Sino-U.S.  textile trade. Peng Choutian, secretary of the American Chinese  Importer and Exporter Association, said: "The quota is  insufficient as it is, and is more so now with the drastic cut."</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / EC settles for support role in next stage of Arab-Israeli talks THE European Community has restrained its ambition to test its new-found confidence in foreign policy on the issue of Arab-Israeli peace talks. After meeting Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, in Luxembourg late on Wednesday, EC foreign ministers settled - at least temporarily  - for an undefined 'association' with the process. They went into the meeting determined to secure full 'co-sponsorship' of Washington's regional formula, with a seat at the table alongside the US and the Soviet Union. What Wednesday's talks - the third high-level US-EC encounter in the past week - made clear was that the peace process was not sufficiently advanced or secure enough for Washington to override Israeli objections to closer European involvement. This was not a climb-down, officials from the pragmatic Luxembourg presidency of the EC underlined, but an act of prudence. Mr Baker had made clear, to his EC colleagues and publicly, that he wanted Europe aboard. But Israel, which has accepted in principle the US plan for face-to-face talks with the Arabs, remains wary of the EC because of the Community's long-standing call for a UN-sponsored peace conference which would include the Palestinians. Mr Baker said after the meeting that his primary objective was 'to establish a process that has some reasonable chance of success and of being begun in the first place'. But he added that 'we have made it very clear to Israel that Europe can contribute to this process and should be involved'. The added value the EC believes it can provide is twofold. It can provide 'something of an umbrella', as one EC diplomat expressed it, for Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. They are insisting on a UN-backed conference centred on the 'land-for-peace' formula contained in Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, requiring Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for a settlement. 'If you have four permanent members of the Security Council present,' said one diplomat, 'the substance of what took place at the regional conference would be under these resolutions'. Second, and longer term, the EC believes it has a significant contribution to make to economic development in the region. The EC is in no sense relinquishing its aim to raise its political involvement to the level of its economic commitment. But having provided leadership sufficient to jolt the US into action on providing aid plus security to the Kurds, it is confident and prudent enough to let the US set the pace on regional peace. As one senior EC diplomat remarked, 'the US is the only player that can make progress now'.</p>

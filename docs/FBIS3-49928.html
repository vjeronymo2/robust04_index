This stand will be set forth  tomorrow by President Zhelev to Ambassador Madeleine Albright,  special envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton.    At Dr. Zhelev's invitation, the meeting was attended by  Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov, Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of  General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, Interior  Minister Viktor Mikhaylov, Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the  National Assembly Committee on National Security, and Yunal  Lyutfi, who is chairing the national security on foreign policy  [as received].    At the meeting it was decided that President Zhelev will  sign  the documents on behalf of Bulgaria, Prime Minister Berov told  the press. When it meets on Monday [17 January], the cabinet  will discuss this decision and will form a working group to  draft a proposal for Bulgaria's participation in Partnership for  Peace and the actual contractual arrangement.    "We had no differences at all and concurred on the  conclusion  that Bulgaria meets the political requirements to join  Partnership for Peace and must not lose momentum because this is  a way to prove our earnest intentions of integrating into the  Euro-Atlantic security architecture," Mr. Slatinski told the  press.    On December 21, 1993 the National Assembly voted a  declaration on relations between Bulgaria and NATO. The MP's  [members of parliament] declared themselves in favour of making  use of the opportunities for cooperation with the North Atlantic  Alliance.    On January 11, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry declared  Bulgaria's intention of joining the Partnership for Peace  Initiative.    The government Press Office today denied an allegation of  Mr.  Asparukh Panov MP of the Union of Democratic Forces that the  cabinet failed to take appropriate action for the circulation of  the National Assembly declaration on the country's relations  with NATO.    "I was not exactly surprised to learn about yet another  slanderous story in the Bulgarian press about our diplomatic  activities in Brussels," Mrs. Lea Koen, Bulgaria's ambassador in  the Belgian capital, said on Radio Free Europe today. She was  reacting to allegations of the KONTINENT daily that she delayed  the circulation of the National Assembly declaration on  Bulgaria's relations with NATO by mailing it instead of handing  it personally to the leaders of the Alliance. According to Mrs.  Koen, "certain people in the Foreign Ministry have made a  practice of laying the blame at the wrong door."</p>

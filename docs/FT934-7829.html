			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting and rising output behind earnings surge at Lonrho SA COST CUTTING and increased output helped boost income after tax at Lonrho South Africa's platinum interests by more than 100 per cent in the year to end-September, from R27.8m to R56m (Pounds 8.75m). However, the fall in the price of rhodium, by 44 per cent from the 1992 average, hit cash flow so borrowings increased by R80.4m to R807.9m. Lonrho SA said that production of refined platinum group metals rose by 27.8 per cent to more than 938,000 troy ounces. Unit costs, from mining through to production of metals in matte, fell by 8.2 per cent to R19,807 a kilo, excluding a one-off cost of redundancies, and by 7.3 per cent to R19,990 including this cost. Turnover at the division, which takes in Eastern Platinum in Bophuthatswana and Western Platinum in the Transvaal plus Western's refinery near Johannesburg, rose by 10 per cent from R830.2m to R913.7m. Net income, after an extraordinary item of R91.66m (R11m) associated with a reduction in deferred tax liability following a lowering of the tax rate, was R147.7m (R38.9m). Lonrho said capital expenditure, excluding interest capitalised, was R100m and would be about the same this year.</p>

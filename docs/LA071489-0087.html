			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BIRDIE ON LAST HOLE GIVES KING LEAD IN WOMEN'S OPEN  </P> <P> Betsy King, the hottest golfer on the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. tour, shot  a four-under-par 67 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead over Marie-Laure de  Lorenzi-Taya in the first round of the $450,000 U.S. Women's Open golf  championship at Lake Orion, Mich.  </P> <P> King, who leads the LPGA money list with $423,794 and has won four tournaments  this year, rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt from above the hole on the huge 18th  green of the Old Course at Indianwood Golf and Country Club.  </P> <P> De Lorenzi-Taya, 28, a native of France who lives in Barcelona, Spain, also  birdied the final hole, making an eight-footer from below the hole on the  22,000-square foot green.  </P> <P> Jane Geddes, who won the Open in 1986, was the only other golfer in the field  of 156 to break par. Geddes, playing in the morning before a stiff afternoon  wind came up, shot a 70.  </P> <P> De Lorenzi-Taya, who qualified for the U.S. Women's Amateur three times, is  playing in the United States as a professional for only the third time and is  making her Open debut.  </P> <P> Defending champion Liselotte Neumann of Sweden, one of more than a dozen  golfers at par, sprayed the ball both right and left but made up for it by  putting only 25 times.  </P> <P> Two golfers bidding for their first Open victory -- Nancy Lopez and Patty  Sheehan -- shot a 73 and a 74, respectively.  </P> <P> Hal Sutton, trying to regain the form that brought him seven victories in his  first five years on the PGA Tour, shot a seven-under-par 64 that tied him with  Tim Simpson for the first-round lead in the Anheuser-Busch tournament at  Williamsburg, Va.  </P> <P> Sutton, who hasn't won since 1986, and Simpson, who has led this tournament  three times but has never won, were one shot off the course record at the  6,776-yard Kingsmill Golf Club.  </P> <P> Sutton, who played in the morning, and Simpson, who began his round in the  early afternoon, shared a one-shot advantage over Tim Norris, Chris Perry and  Mike Hulbert.  </P> <P> Another stroke back were Fuzzy Zoeller and Australian Ian Baker-Finch.  </P> <P> Naomichi (Joe) Ozaki birdied the last hole and tied Ian Woosnam for the  second-round lead in the Scottish Open at Gleneagles, Scotland.  </P> <P> Ozaki, 33, winner of three tournaments in Japan earlier this year, did not make  a bogey in a four-under-par 67 and completed 36 holes in 135. Woosnam, the  first-round leader at 65, could do no better than a 70 that dropped him into a  tie.  </P> <P> A stroke back was Sandy Lyle, the former British Open and Masters champion, who  shot a 66.  </P></p>

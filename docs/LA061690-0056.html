			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARSAW PACT FAILS TO FIND AGREEMENT ON REFORMS;  </P> <P> ALLIANCE: ENDING TWO DAYS OF TALKS, MEMBERS CONCLUDE THAT THERE ARE 'REAL  POSSIBILITIES' THAT BOTH NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT WILL BECOME  'NON-CONFRONTATIONAL.'  </P> <P> With faith among Eastern Europe's newborn democracies clearly faltering, Warsaw  Pact defense ministers wrapped up a crucial meeting on the alliance's future  Friday with no specific outline for expected reforms.  </P> <P> Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, meanwhile, asserted that the Warsaw  Pact cannot dissolve or loosen the ties binding its seven member-states in the  face of NATO's "military might."  </P> <P> The Warsaw Pact declared last week following a meeting in Moscow that it would  convert from its Kremlin-dominated structure to a political alliance of  sovereign, equal states.  </P> <P> Meeting in the town of Strausberg, 20 miles east of Berlin, the ministers ended  two days of talks about the alliance's future, which has been cast into doubt  by signs that Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland wish to leave.  </P> <P> A working paper on transforming the pact is expected to be ready by October,  and the ministers indicated that they would probably meet in a special session  at a later date. They said discussions this time touched on basic changes, the  withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe, and reductions in arms and  troops.  </P> <P> The ministers "exchanged views on developments in the European strategic  situation and made an assessment of 35 years of Warsaw Pact activities," the  statement said.  </P> <P> That included openly discussing controversial military actions by the Pact,  such as the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary and the 1968 invasion of  Czechoslovakia, for the first time.  </P> <P> Czechoslovak Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek said, "The countries which were  involved in the 1968 invasion have apologized."  </P> <P> The question of East Germany's military status, if discussed, was not commented  on publicly by the ministers in their statement.  </P> <P> The four victorious allies of World War II -- the United States, the Soviet  Union, France and Britain -- continue to negotiate the issue as German  unification looms, with the West insisting that a united Germany be a  full-fledged member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Moscow  steadfastly resisting the demand. The West German and Soviet foreign ministers  plan to resume talks on German unification Monday in Muenster, West Germany.  </P> <P> The East German defense and disarmament minister, Rainer Eppelmann, called both  alliances "relics of the Cold War."  </P> <P> Eppelmann also urged slower German unification, saying September, 1992, would  be a "realistic date" that would allow time to create a bloc-free European  security system.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, he said, must not be "left standing at the door" of a united  Europe.  </P> <P> "If the security aspects of a united Germany and a united Europe could take  effect on the same day, we could save all this talk about interim solutions --  who should belong to what alliance," Eppelmann said.  </P> <P> The two Germanys already have agreed to merge their social, economic and  monetary systems July 2, and all-German elections could take place as early as  December.  </P> <P> In their closing statement, the defense ministers said there are "real  possibilities" that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact will become  "non-confrontational . . . and will be able to make a positive contribution to  the development of pan-European security structures."  </P> <P> At the same time, they pledged that Pact members will "continue to be led in  their military policies by the defensive doctrine."  </P> <P> That stance was echoed by Yazov, who told Tass that NATO remains a threat.  </P> <P> "We have no right to shut our eyes to the fact that NATO still exists and  maintains all the attributes of its military might," the Soviet defense  minister said.  </P> <P> "Moreover, the provision of NATO armies with the newest armaments is being  speeded up and its combat might is being built up," Yazov said.  </P> <P> "Under these conditions, we cannot slacken our ties of alliance," he said.  </P></p>

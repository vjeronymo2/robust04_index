"Your Name is Unknown, Your Feat is Immortal" are the words  inscribed on the red-and-black granite of the tomb. To the  strains of sad music the president laid the wreath at the tomb  and stood at attention as the ban played the national anthems of  the United States and Russia.    The U.S. President was accompanied by Russian Minister of  Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Ambassador to the United  States Vladimir Lukin and members of the Russian and American  delegations.</p>

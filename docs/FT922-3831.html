			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / R&amp;D spending rises at most companies MOST British companies increased spending on research and development last year in spite of the recession, according to government figures. The second annual R&amp;D survey from the Department of Trade and Industry says the 10 biggest spenders devoted Pounds 3.9bn to R&amp;D last year - 4.3 per cent more than in 1990 - while their profits fell 17.1 per cent to Pounds 15.8bn. The top dozen companies - those which spend more than Pounds 100m a year on R&amp;D - account for about half of corporate R&amp;D spending. The figures indicate that companies spend less than half the amount per employee on R&amp;D than companies in the US and Germany. ICI maintained its position as the UK's biggest spender on R&amp;D, with Pounds 596m, up 1 per cent from 1990. Siebe, the engineering group that has grown into one of the world's leading controls manufacturers, is the fastest rising star of the DTI top 20. Its R&amp;D spending rose 66 per cent to Pounds 78m last year. Glaxo moved up from fourth into second place, with a rise of 19 per cent to Pounds 475m, ahead of Shell, GEC, SmithKline Beecham and Unilever. The two large oil companies, Shell and BP, stand out for having cut their R&amp;D spending. The fall at Shell was only marginal but BP (in seventh place) cut spending by a significant 6 per cent to Pounds 308m. The pharmaceutical companies emerge from the DTI scoreboard as by far the largest R&amp;D spenders per employee and as a percentage of sales. Glaxo devoted 14 per cent of turnover to R&amp;D and spent Pounds 13,330 per employee. British Aerospace lifted its spending by 11 per cent to Pounds 263m in spite of falling into loss for the year. BAe's R&amp;D rose from 1.5 per cent of sales in 1990 to 2.5 per cent last year. At 11th-ranked Rolls-Royce, on the other hand, R&amp;D fell 9 per cent to Pounds 216m. The two acquisitive industrial conglomerates, BTR and Hanson, do not come out of the survey well. BTR (ranked number 21) cut spending by 7 per cent to Pounds 55m and Hanson (number 28) was unchanged at Pounds 34m. BTR devoted 0.8 per cent of sales to R&amp;D and Hanson only 0.4 per cent. The highest-ranked service companies were BT in ninth place and Reuters in 17th. The scoreboard is compiled for the DTI innovation branch by Company Reporting, an external consultancy, and made possible by changes in accounting rules from 1989 that require companies to disclose R&amp;D spending to shareholders. Those seem to be having an effect: 330 quoted companies reported R&amp;D in their 1991 annual reports, compared with 230 in 1990.</p>

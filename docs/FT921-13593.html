			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: Critics of Russian central bank Sir, Your report, 'Adviser warns of Russian power struggle threat' (January 16), gives 10 paragraphs to Prof Sachs's criticism of the Russian central bank and only one to the Russian central bank's criticism of Prof Sachs. In effect, it takes sides with Prof Sachs and Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister, in their struggle against the central bank and its chairman, Mr Georgy Matiukhin. May I make two comments? First, I believe Mr Matiukhin to be a man of complete integrity, a rare commodity among Russia's ruling classes. Second, the Russian central bank has some valid arguments in its defence. It is no good just reducing the issue of currency when there is no effective circulation, no mechanism to ensure that notes return to banks or enterprises. Though it is admittedly inflationary, if the growth of the money supply ceased, some workers would not be paid at all. A foreign adviser should offer advice in private; Prof Sachs's use of western publicity to wage an internal war and defend his own privileged position is an unwarranted interference in Russia's affairs.

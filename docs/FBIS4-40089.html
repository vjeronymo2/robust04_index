			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev received  Vladimir Shumeyko, the chairman of the Federation Council, who  is in Sofia now. ITAR-TASS reports that the sides discussed a  wide range of issues regarding bilateral relations and topical  international problems. Russian-Bulgarian relations should be  developed harmoniously and to mutual benefit, the leader of the  Russian delegation stressed. Incidentally, Vladimir Shumeyko  noted that during the meetings held in the Bulgarian capital,  some matters arose on which the sides need to clarify each  others positions, in particular, the NATO program Partnership  for Peace. But, according to Shumeyko, disputes are of an  economic rather than political nature.    During the conversation Vladimir Shumeyko conveyed to the  Bulgarian president cordial greetings from Boris Yeltsin.</p>

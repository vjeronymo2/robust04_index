			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / IoD seeks job cuts in public sector THE GOVERNMENT should cut public-sector employment by 2 per cent next year - equivalent to 50,000 jobs - and 5 per cent by 1995-96 to bring its budget deficit under control, the Institute of Directors said yesterday. In an attempt to influence the debate that has split the Tories in the run-up to the November Budget, the institute is backing spending cuts rather than tax increases. Its document calls for spending cuts of Pounds 20bn a year by 1995-96. In a supporting paper, the institute argues that a thorough review of government spending could save Pounds 100bn a year by 2018-19. Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director, criticised the government for not tackling the growing gap between higher government spending and depressed tax revenues. The public sector borrowing requirement is expected to reach Pounds 50bn in the current financial year, 8 per cent of gross domestic product. The government's March Budget foresaw a deficit of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1997-98. The institute identifies specific areas for savings: Market testing, competitive tendering and privatisation would cut public-sector employment. Individuals who can afford to should pay for services such as health care. Universal benefits such as child benefit should be abolished, while spending on invalidity and housing benefits should be cut. Subsidies to industry should be abolished, including EC food subsidies. Government holdings of land should be sold off. Public spending: a programme for action. IoD, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5ED. Pounds 10.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "Salons and Jeans"] </F>   [Text] "How to live with the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL], our coalition partner, and how to get rid of the snouts  of the `liberals'"--these topics were discussed during the 23  April session by the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic  [SdRP].    The delegates declared their loyalty to the PSL members, and  they expect the PSL to respond in kind.  <H5>  We Demand Loyalty </H5>   "Waldemar Pawlak wants deputy prime ministers to execute the  government's policies, not to cocreate them. He regards the  Council of Ministers' Economic Committee as a forum for  discussion, the decisions of which can be changed without  reason," Sejm Deputy Marek Borowski, former deputy prime  minister and finance minister, fulminated during the SdRP  session. "One must define with precision who is responsible for  what in this government. This is not a coalition but a case of  PSL domination."    Borowski added that the "hesitant" PSL is also to blame for  Lech Walesa's successes in his little games with the government.  He also admonished his colleagues from the Sejm deputies club  for creating a "joyous legislative legacy" and for lack of  discipline during votes. This time, Borowski said, the  disciplined PSL should be an example to follow.    "The SdRP, while expressing its respect for agreements that  have been signed and loyalty and understanding vis-a-vis the  coalition partner, expects the same from the partner," the  convention's resolution reads.  <H5>  Rakowski's Attack </H5>   Journalists expected fights between the party "liberals" and  "social democrats." They were hoping for a Kwasniewski-Rakowski  polemic exchange, especially given Rakowski's article published  in POLITYKA, in which he mercilessly attacked the SdRP leader  and party policies. Rakowski wrote that "social democrats are  wearing liberals' pants" and that they want "capitalism with a  human face." Rakowski's suspicion is that some SdRP leaders  would prefer to be supported by entrepreneurs than by workers.  He expressed his indignation at "social democrats' active  participation in the building of capitalism in Poland"--he means  Privatization Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek--and at the "we want to  be in NATO" demands. Rakowski accuses the leaders of having  abandoned the "It doesn't have to be that way anymore" slogan  after the elections, and he is critical of Kwasniewski for his  confession that he feels closer to the Democratic Union than to  the PSL.    Many other party members have similar views to those of  Rakowski. They call themselves "Millerists" (meaning they are  supporters of Leszek Miller), as opposed to the liberal  "Aleksandrists."    While not making any references to Rakowski's article,  Kwasniewski engaged in polemics with Rakowski and the  "Millerists": "The SdRP must fight for economic development. It  would be a tragedy if left-wing rule were to bring to mind  inflation, economic chaos, and breach of ties to international  institutions." He added that "there are no miracles": there is  no way that promises can be fulfilled all at once--for instance,  elimination of the popiwek [wage-controlling legislation].    Kwasniewski then disappeared along with Rakowski, and, when  he returned, he ostentatiously hugged Rakowski.  <H5>  Social Democrats' Grievances </H5>   Only a few activists took the floor during the exchange  because Kwasniewski made an appeal to his colleagues not to give  journalists a reason to launch an attack on the SdRP.    "We were strengthening party unity at the expense of  program-related debates," Waldemar Czajkowski, a delegate from  Katowice, expressed his regrets. He speculated on the  relationship between the views of some activists--for instance,  on the issue of privatization--and a provision in the party  statute saying that the SdRP is a party of democratic socialism.  By saying this, he was definitely making a reference to  Borowski, who had spoken out some time before that on the need  to speed up privatization.    Ryszard Olow from Suwalki expressed his criticism of  Kwasniewski's apology to the Solidarity groups: "I have no idea  why the apology. Who will apologize to us for the four years,  I'm asking?" He also demanded changes at the local level  because all that has happened so far has been that politicians  from Rozbraty (the SdRP's headquarters) moved to the Sejm  building on Wiejska Street.  <H5>  Unity in a Multitude </H5>   Whereas in the main meeting hall the poor elocution by some  Sejm deputies was debated, and delegates showed each other black  and honey yellow briefcases they were given as gifts (malicious  journalists have calculated the party spent over 60 million  zlotys on the gifts), a livelier debate took place unofficially  over glasses of beer: "Rakowski is right. Some members of the  leadership are closer to salons than to people wearing workmen's  jeans. We must be returning to the period of the Polish  People's Republic. We must defend the people and the  achievements of an economy on the basis of social criteria, and  not just on a free market," one of the delegates told us.    "If it were not for Kwasniewski, we would no longer be here.  We owe our election victory to him," another delegate was  trying to convince me. He added that the SdRP leader is an  efficient politician, a pragmatic person who knows economic  realities and not a populist. He also expressed his praise for  Kwasniewski for, among other things, the party's most recent  success--that is, the announcement of introducing activists from  the Democratic Left Alliance into the "Belweder ministries"  (Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Internal Affairs).    The entire party leadership received a vote of confidence  from the delegates. "This does not prove anything. It has  always been the case here that one complains kind of  unofficially, but when it comes right down to it, everybody  raises his hands anyway," one of the delegates was trying to  convince me.</p>

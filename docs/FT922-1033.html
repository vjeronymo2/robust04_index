			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: BMW has target of 70,000 cars a year at US plant BMW, the German luxury car manufacturer, will invest an initial Dollars 400m at its planned US plant until production starts up in about three years' time, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, the chief executive, said yesterday. At first, output will be small, consisting of cars built mainly from parts imported from Germany. But he said BMW aimed at annual production of up to 70,000 cars a year by the year 2000. He was speaking at a press conference to announce the plant, the first to be set up abroad by a German luxury carmaker. He confirmed that it would be in the Greenville/Spartanburg area of South Carolina, as reported this week. Noting that the US was the world's biggest car market, he said: 'We have to maintain, secure, and build up the position we have achieved in the American market. This is becoming increasingly difficult to do from Germany.' Production costs in the US were about 30 per cent less than in Germany, he said. 'We are too expensive in Germany.' By the end of the century, the plant should employ some 2,000 people, with a similar number working for supplier companies in the area. BMW's decision, which will also make it the only German car company with a US plant after Volkswagen's plant closure there in 1988, comes after a series of setbacks in the US for German manufacturers. Sales of German models have been hit by US recession, fluctuations in the dollar, and the luxury goods tax. Mr von Kuenheim said 84 per cent of the money raised by the US tax was borne by purchasers of German cars. This year, however, with the upturn in the market and new models, German car sales have picked up in the US. BMW reported a 24 per cent rise in the first five months to nearly 25,000 vehicles. Mr Robert Buchelhofer, marketing director, said BMW wanted to add 10,000 cars in the US this year to the 53,300 sold there in 1991 - 16 per cent down on 1990. In 1986, its best year in the US, it sold 97,000 cars. Mr von Kuenheim would not say which models would be built in the South Carolina plant, which will make cars for worldwide export as well as sale in North America. He stressed that the product would be 'a real BMW' and not a pale copy. The new US plant will also be inside the new North American Free Trade Area and thus avoid any possible trade restrictions there.</p>

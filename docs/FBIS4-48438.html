			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairperson of the Zambia Civic Education  Association, Mrs. Lucy Sikwana, said police officers should be  trained on the criminal procedure code to stop the torturing of  suspects. Mrs. Sikwana said the inhuman treatment of suspects  in police cells should not be allowed in a country which  respects human rights. She made the remark at the opening of a  police and community program at the central police station in  Lusaka. The inspector general of police, Francis Ndlovo, said  the police force cannot operate well because it does not receive  adequate funding.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 4 May TASS -- A working meeting of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly on Nagorno-Karabakh held in the  Kyrgyz capital on Wednesday showed positive signs. After three  hours of talks held behind closed doors Deputy Chairman [as  received] of the Azeri Parliament Afiyaddin Dzhalilov answered  journalists' questions.    "It is difficult to say yet whether any document will be  signed during the meeting. A discussion about the withdrawal of  Armenian armed formations from the Azeri territory, return of  refugees and the establishment of a reliable ceasefire is  underway," Dzhalilov said.    Chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly Vladimir  Shumeyko said in a television interview that for the success of  the talks Karabakh should be considered a party involved in the  conflict. Asked about the attitude of the Azeri delegation to  this statement, Dzhalilov pointed out that "we proceed from the  assumption that the conflict has turned into a war and  Azerbaijan and Armenia should settle it by peaceful means. What  is at issue today is that the problem should not be "buried in  sand" since the war is going on on the territory of Azerbaijan.  A million refugees are living in tents. Therefore, common  sense should prevail," Dzhalilov said.</p>

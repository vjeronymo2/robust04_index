			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ALLEGATION DROPPED IN JUVENILE HALL CASE  </P> <P> Civil rights lawyers who are challenging several practices in Juvenile Hall  dropped another of their claims Thursday: the allegation that adolescents are  wrongfully subjected to strip-searches.  </P> <P> Their lawsuit originally had targeted procedures in Juvenile Hall and three  outlying institutions: the Youth Guidance Center in Santa Ana, the Joplin Youth  Center in Trabuco Canyon and the Los Pinos forestry camp in Cleveland National  Forest.  </P> <P> The strip-search allegation was the only one remaining against the three  outlying institutions. The withdrawal of the allegation means that those three  facilities are no longer targets of the case, which is in its fifth week of  trial.  </P> <P> A range of other complaints about the three facilities, including the  censorship of minors' mail and difficulty getting access to lawyers, were  dropped earlier.  </P> <P> The Superior Court trial will now be limited to Juvenile Hall, focusing on such  practices as tying adolescents to metal-frame beds or locking them in padded  rooms when they misbehave. Mark I. Soler, an attorney for San Francisco's Youth  Law Center, said he withdrew the strip-search allegation when it became clear  that Juvenile Court judges often order such searches as a condition of  confinement for teen-agers serving sentences.  </P> <P> Attorney David G. Epstein, who represents the county, saw the dropping of the  allegation as an admission that the plaintiffs would lose on the issue.  </P> <P> "They knew we had about 10 witnesses lined up who would testify that  strip-searches are justified because contraband is often found," he said.

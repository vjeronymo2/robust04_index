			<p>BFN     [Text] Valeriy Astakhov, the president of the Krym  Television and Radio Company, has circulated a statement  entitled: Crimean President's April Fool Joke. It says, in  particular:    On 1 April this year, Mr. Hryshankov, the head of the  Crimean  president's administration, familiarized me with Mr. Meshkov's  decree relieving me of my duties as the president of the Krym TV  and Radio Company, and the decree appointing another person to  this post. The reasons for my dismissal are not substantiated,  while the content of the decree, from the first sentence to the  last, runs counter to the Constitution of the Republic of  Crimea, and the current laws of Ukraine and Crimea. The decree  is unlawful for a number of reasons.    Firstly, according to the provision on the Krym State  Television and Radio Company, its president is appointed by the  Supreme Council of Crimea for a period of five years, following  the nomination of a candidate agreed with the Ukrainian  Television and Radio Company and the Crimean Council of  Ministers.    Secondly, at the time when the decree was signed and until  today, I remain a people's deputy of the republic's Supreme  Council, which is still in office, since the new Supreme Council  of Crimea has not been elected yet. Yuriy Meshkov's decree has  been contested by Mykola Okhamkevych, the president of the  Ukrainian Television and Radio Company.    Therefore, Valeriy Astakhov stresses, I regard the decrees  by  the president of the Republic of Crimea as unlawful and refuse  to comply with them.</p>

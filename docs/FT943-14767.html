			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Tecs 'more keen' to merge with chambers: FT survey of training chiefs finds frustration with Whitehall links Directors of Training and Enterprise Councils have shown a sharp increase in their willingness to merge with chambers of commerce, an annual survey by the Financial Times shows. The survey is the third to canvass the 1,220 board members of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales, which are responsible for delivering the government's main training programmes. The annual conference of Tec directors opened in Birmingham last night and was addressed by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, and Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary. About 47 per cent of directors backed mergers between Tecs and chambers of commerce, with 45 per cent against. In 1992 just 20 per cent supported such a move. The trend is indicative of a greater willingness by Tecs to work with partners, and their growing involvement in providing business help. Several Tecs now have a formal commitment to merging with chambers. But most Tec directors expressed frustration over their lack of independence from the government. A total of 71 one per cent said that they did not believe that Tecs - an experiment in partnership between the government and the private sector - were sufficiently independent of the government. The government is one of the main customers of Tecs and pays them more than Pounds 2bn a year to administer publicly funded training programmes and to foster enterprise. The government has also fostered closer links between Tecs and chambers, particularly through Business Links, the new umbrella bodies for business advice in which Tecs work with agencies including chambers. Tec directors, most of whom come from the private sector, this year expressed even stronger support for the promotion of economic development as their top priority. Support is also growing among trade union and public-sector members. Directors said strategies for economic development took up more time than managing government programmes for the adult unemployed and young people. However, in spite of reforms - such as the new integrated regional offices, which co-ordinate policy at local level for several government departments - 66 per cent of directors said Whitehall was not properly co-ordinating its work with Tecs. The government is still attempting to strike a balance between making Tecs publicly accountable and giving them the freedom they say they need to operate effectively. New three-year licensing agreements to be issued to Tecs meeting tough criteria are to be rolled out over the next few years, and should assuage some frustration. The need for Tecs to be seen as accountable to their wider public is an issue that has been taken up by a number of bodies, including the Confederation of British Industry. A total of 83 per cent said Tecs should be open to public scrutiny, with the private-sector members recording the lowest support for such a policy, at 78 per cent. Asked how this aim could be furthered, directors suggested open annual general meetings, more open days and Tec membership schemes. A few advocated a change in board composition, to include more local authority representatives. One director suggested full public scrutiny of all grants greater than Pounds 50,000. A greater willingness to work with other bodies operating in the fields of enterprise was expressed. FT 1994 Survey of Tecs. Marketing Department, Financial Times, 1 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Campus venture fund unveiled A Pounds 500,000 venture-capital fund to exploit the commercial potential of research carried out at Newcastle University was launched yesterday. The Quantum Fund, which has backing from some of north-east England's biggest companies, is intended as a rolling fund to help regenerate the region's economy. One of the largest British campus-based venture-capital funds, it will provide injections of capital from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 50,000. The fund will be managed by Nuventures, the university's technology transfer company. Mr Robin Mackay, Nuventures business development manager, said: 'The fund is to bridge that gap between innovations which have a good commercial potential but require additional work to get them ready for industry.' Applications to the fund, which will expect a return on its investments, must be related to research at the university. Outside companies wishing to exploit a university-developed product may be eligible for funding, possibly in exchange for a royalty. Investors in Quantum include Northumbrian Water, Northern Electric and 3i.</p>

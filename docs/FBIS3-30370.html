He said that Finland, just as Austria,  Norway, and Sweden, should soon become a member of the European  Union, where it will seek its security guarantees. Finland is  not interested in entering NATO or any other security  structures. It considers the Partnership for Peace, however, a  good initiative for East European countries.

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson recovers to Pounds 0.97m BROWN &amp; JACKSON, the discount retailer which operates the Poundstretcher stores, yesterday reported continued progress in its three-year recovery programme. The group, which has undergone a management shake-up and financial restructuring in the past year and has reverted to a December year-end, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 967,000 on turnover of Pounds 241.9m in the 15 months to December 31. The profit came after a Pounds 981,000 exceptional charge incurred in connection with the financial reconstruction. There were losses per share of 0.3p and a token final dividend of 0.1p is proposed. To provide a basis for comparison the group, which has also adopted the new FRS 3 accounting standard, has produced figures for the 12 months to December 31. In this period there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.63m (Pounds 18.2m loss as restated) after net interest payments of Pounds 3.32m (Pounds 4.72m). Turnover fell to Pounds 167.3m (Pounds 201.9m) with continuing operations accounting for Pounds 165.6m (Pounds 176.9m). Commenting on the results Mr Ian Gray, chief executive, said cash constraints early in the year and the subsequent financial reconstruction made the year particularly difficult. The goal in 1992, which was achieved, was to survive and build a foundation for the future. Sales in the core 230 Poundstretcher stores fell 7 per cent, mainly reflecting the cash constraints until the Pounds 15.6m proceeds of the share placing and open offer were received in June. This depressed both sales volume and gross margins. In the second half the new management team began to implement a series of measures to improve profitability including stock reduction, withdrawing from unprofitable product areas and holding price levels in the 'patchy' market. In the Christmas quarter, which traditionally accounts for most of the profits, sales were 8.3 per cent lower but the gross margin was the same as the previous year. After peaking at Pounds 27m in February last year, the group's highly seasonal borrowings fell to Pounds 3.2m at year-end. Net borrowings of Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 22.5m) represented gearing of 52 (223) per cent. Mr Gray and Mr Bob Ellis, finance director, noted that there had been some limited evidence of economic recovery with Poundstretcher sales running about 5 1/2 per cent ahead of last year. COMMENT After rescuing Brown &amp; Jackson from the brink of receivership the new management is getting back to retailing basics. Management and merchandising systems have been introduced at Poundstretcher for the first time in order to leverage the group's aggregate 1.3m sq ft of retailing space. By the end of July all the stores will have electronic point of sale systems, stores are being refurbished and a new trading strategy is already in place. So far the results are on track and the signs are hopeful, but there is still much to do. Depending on the economy the group may manage little more than to break-even this year, but that would be no mean achievement. The stock has crawled back up to 15 1/2 p from its low of 2 1/2 p at the end of 1991.</p>

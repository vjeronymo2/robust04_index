			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Observer: King Huhne Another rat deserting the sinking ship? Definitely not, says Chris Huhne, 39, The Independent's business editor, who's off to join Robin Monro-Davies's IBCA, the fast-growing European rating agency. Having worked on the The Guardian and The Economist and tried to get into politics - he stood unsuccessfully as an SDP candidate against John Patten - he's going to try his hand at rating sovereign debt. Up to now, IBCA has prospered as a niche rating agency. But Huhne's arrival signals that it wants to compete head on with the big boys - Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. An old pal of Lord Lever - they co-authored Debt and Danger - Huhne is fascinated by emerging markets. So's everybody else these days, but at least he's taken a proper job, unlike most City editors who end up in financial PR.</p>

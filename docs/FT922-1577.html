			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: MEPs and Maastricht Sir, I can assure you that the heading of your report 'Euro-MPs press over Maastricht' (June 18) gave an entirely false impression of our discussions with the prime minister on this subject. Since our view of what should be done following the result of the Danish referendum coincided with that expressed by Mr Major and the foreign secretary, there was nothing to exert pressure about. Clearly a negotiation would be necessary between the Twelve to reach agreement on the terms of any 'solemn declaration' to be attached to the treaty, but it would not involve any actual re-negotiation of the Maastricht Treaty itself. The government has already made a proposal to this effect. Several other possibilities were briefly discussed. Moreover, we were all agreed that it was sensible for the eleven Member States other than Denmark to proceed with ratification of the treaty as soon as practically possible. If the meeting highlighted anything, it was certainly not 'the spread of views across the party', but the unanimous support of the Conservative Euro-MPs for the government's policy on the Maastricht Treaty, and in particular for finding ways of helping Denmark to ratify it. Derek Prag, MEP for Hertfordshire, Pine Hill, 47 New Road, Digswell, Welwyn, Hertfordshire AL6 0AQ</p>

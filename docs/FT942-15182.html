			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cupid plans disposal and restructuring Cupid, the bridalwear group, is selling its lossmaking nursery goods company for Pounds 1 and plans changes to its accounting practices which will result in substantially increased losses for 1993-94. The group also announced a debt-for-equity swap and a heavily discounted Pounds 1.8m rescue rights issue, to be backed by City entrepreneurs Mr Luke Johnson, Mr Hugh Osmond, and Mr Stephen Hargrave. Cupid then plans to change its name to Brackenbridge. The three are investing about Pounds 700,000 for what is expected to be about 25 per cent of the enlarged share capital. The 2-for-3 rights issue has been priced at 3p, against yesterday's close of 21p, up 6p. National Westminster Bank is also swapping Pounds 750,000 of debt into ordinary and preference shares. Mr Johnson and Mr Osmond will be appointed to the board as non-executive directors.</p>

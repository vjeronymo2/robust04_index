			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking Up The Pieces: British exporters take a positive view INTEREST RATE cuts in Europe could speed up economic recovery in Britain. But the benefits of stronger European growth need to be weighed against loss of UK competitiveness in big continental economies such as France, as well as the uncertainty and instability of effectively floating exchange rates. With the scope for exchange rate fluctuations so wide, UK industrialists were yesterday facing the problem they used to face before the European exchange rate mechanism was established: how to assess prospects for the newly liberated currencies. 'I would be surprised to find any UK exporter or importer signing a contract for anything over the next few days,' said Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce. 'They just won't know what it is worth.' Even in the longer term, currency instability could upset business. Said Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at Imperial Chemical Industries: 'It is all very well talking about lower interest rates boosting growth, but currency instability does impact on trade. It is what causes protectionist pressures.' Volatile exchange rates are unlikely, however, to upset the advances exporters have made since sterling was devalued. Britain had a 10-month start over the countries that devalued yesterday and interest rate cuts in Europe - if or when they come - will make it easier for the UK government to cap sterling's rise with further rate cuts of its own, allowing the pound to stay competitive. 'Our exporters have done well in European markets, so stand to do well from European growth,' said Mr Brown. The companies that will suffer most are likely to be those that compete directly with France and are particularly price sensitive, such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Yet, on balance, most economists believe the boost to UK exports from faster growth in Europe will outweigh the loss of competitiveness. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry said: 'If the new ERM arrangements allow France and other European economies to cut interest rates and boost growth, then that would be good news for British business. The chancellor should be ready to cut UK rates if rates fall elsewhere, or if the pound rises sharply.' A possible negative factor for European growth and for UK exports, is that the stronger D-Mark might slow Germany's recovery from recession. 'Germany needs a stronger D-Mark like it needs a hole in the head, and so does Europe,' said Mr Freeman of ICI. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Near term, the stronger D-Mark is likely to deepen the German recession and reduce inflation pressures. Thus, hopes for an early recovery in Germany are even more tenuous than had previously been the case.' Alternatively, the appreciation of the D-Mark versus other ERM currencies strengthens the argument that German interest rates will fall further than expected, paving the way for more aggressive cuts across the rest of Europe. There was a degree of disappointment that plans for monetary union and a single currency have suffered a set-back. Mr Brown said UK industrialists would be disappointed that monetary union was further away, while Mr Freeman said he feared that the problems of the ERM would slow completion of the European single market. The UK's Institute of Directors believes a 'single' currency is off the agenda for the foreseeable future. However, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general, said European finance ministers should 'give urgent consideration to the adoption of a 'common' currency, in parallel with national currencies to restore stability'. Such a common currency could be used by businesses to reduce the cost of cross-border transactions, he said. Economists were reluctant to quantify what the revamped ERM meant for growth in the UK. Most agreed, however, that the net effect, while slim, would at least be positive.</p>

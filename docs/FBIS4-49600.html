			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station report from the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>   [Excerpts] To implement the guidelines of the central  rural work conference, take even better charge of spring  farming, and ensure proper plantation of sufficient early rice,  the provincial party committee and government held another  teleconference this afternoon.    Provincial party committee Secretary Li Zemin delivered an  important speech at the meeting. He said: The party Central  Committee recently issued a series of instructions concerning  the overall situation in safeguarding reform and furthering  stability. The provincial party committee standing committee and  secretaries earnestly studied the instructions during their  administrative meetings. Today's teleconference on early rice  production is a major step in implementing the party Central  Committee's instructions. All party committees and governments  at or above the county level across the province should  earnestly study General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li  Peng's important speeches at the central rural work conference  and, in connection with local realities, put forward ideas for  implementing their instructions in this year's rural work, which  includes stabilizing grain production and promoting all-around  development of the rural economy.    At the teleconference, provincial party committee Deputy  Secretary and Executive Vice Governor Chai Songyue analyzed the  current situation in preparing for and carrying out spring  farming across the province, and gave important instructions on  properly planting sufficient early rice by every possible means  and on strengthening leadership over early rice production. He  said: There are three particular problems in the current  spring-farming preparations and production: 1. There remains a  certain disparity between grain production and fulfillment of  the procurement task; 2. the price of goods, materials, and  electricity for agricultural use have risen too sharply; 3. too  much land has been requisitioned for development and industrial  zones which actually make use of only a small portion. There  are many instances where land is fenced up with no actual  construction being carried out. [passage omitted]    To mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm in grain farming, on  behalf of the provincial party committee and government Chai  Songyue reiterated three policies on grain production and  marketing: 1. To guarantee procurement. Grain departments  should procure in an open manner all early paddy handed in by  the peasants regardless of whether or not it is covered by a  procurement contract and whether or not it is new harvest; that  is to say, they must not refuse the grain or impose a  procurement limit. 2. To guarantee preset prices. They should,  under all circumstances, firmly and fully honor early paddy  procurement prices and extra-price policy already announced by  the provincial government. 3. To guarantee the non-issue of IOU  notes. In procuring grain, grain departments should manage to  pay cash at the time they procure the grain. It is also  necessary to ensure the honoring of all supportive policies  formulated by individual localities. Various localities and  departments must resolutely implement these policies and should  never break their promise and hurt the peasants' enthusiasm.  [passage omitted]</p>

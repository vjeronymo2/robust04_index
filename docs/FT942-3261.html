			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: GM unit turns in record year General Motors New Zealand, a unit of the US carmaker, recorded its best financial result for six years in the 1993 calendar year, reporting an after-tax profit of NZDollars 2.5m (USDollars 1.5m) compared with a loss of NZDollars 800,000 in the previous 12 months, Reuter reports from Wellington. Mr Don Bowden, managing director, said the result reflected for the first time the full impact of cost-reduction initiatives implemented during 1992. Profit before tax was NZDollars 5.8m, a Dollars 7m rise over the previous year. Mr Bowden said: 'It was achieved in a market that offered little in the way of growth and that was marked by fierce competitive activity at the retail end of the business.' He said the result vindicated the company's strategic direction in recent years, with a switch in focus from new vehicle assembly and distribution to sales and marketing.</p>

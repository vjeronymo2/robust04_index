			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Second-half warning as Bangkok Bank rises Bangkok Bank, south-east Asia's biggest bank in asset terms, has reported a 19 per cent rise in net profits for the first half of the year to Bt8.386bn (Dollars 336m), after a 48 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits to Bt4.837bn. The result was generally well received, but analysts warned that the bank's profits in the increasingly competitive banking sector may slow slightly in the second half. They also cautioned that a narrowing differential between lending and borrowing rates - now down to about 1 percentage point - will hit income in the second half. Profits were boosted by accrued interest gains of nearly Bt800m from the Bangkok Expressway, the elevated motorway project for Bangkok financed by Thai and foreign banks. There were also foreign exchange gains of about Bt1.656bn, some Bt1.2bn coming in the second quarter. Jardine Fleming is maintaining its forecast net profits of Bt16.6bn for the year.</p>

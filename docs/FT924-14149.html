			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: Tosca's careful brutality Welsh National Opera's Tosca, directed by Michael Blakemore and conducted by Carlo Rizzi, is the company's second new production of the season. It is a carefully worked, thoughtful staging, well presented musically, and in style and approach light years away from WNO's recent Elektra. The essence of Blakemore's approach to his first opera is faithful historical realism. In one sense it is almost super-real, for Ashley Martin Davis's sets are dominated by vivid, larger-than-life icons. The torso of a gigantic figure of Christ and the hand of a huge Madonna menace the interior of Sant'Andrea della Valle in the first act, in which the Mary Magdalene in Cavaradossi's painting is shown baring her breast. Scarpia's apartment sports a statue of Bacchus, while the battlements of Act 3 are capped by a massive, swooping angel, avenging sword in hand. Menace and oppression are omnipresent in this production, mingled with suffocating religiosity. Violence is ever visible. When a republican sympathiser rises to show the flag during the splendidly staged Te Deum at the end of the first act he is brutally clubbed to the floor; before Cavaradossi can be brought to his execution an earlier victim has to be cut down and stretchered away. Blakemore builds a thoroughly credible vision of despotic rule while sticking closely to the book and never calling for any feeble-minded transpositions of period or place. The approach relies more than usual upon the portrayal of Scarpia - had Peter Sidhom's performance delivered the regulation cardboard villain the whole edifice could have collapsed into grand guignol. But Sidhom gives a wonderfully subtle characterisation, sung and acted with great suavity and intelligence, and only lacking a final ounce of vocal weight. It is easy to believe such a man has the cunning to operate this regime of savage repression and that he might cut a credible figure sexually too; the second act depicts not the usual manoeuvres of a repellent old lecher but something far more ambiguous and disturbing. With a more distinguished Cavaradossi there really would have been a teasing polarity. During the tour of the production there will be two Cavaradossis and no less than four Toscas; Dennis O'Neill should have sung at Saturday's opening but was injured and replaced by Maurizio Saltarin. He made a plausible Italianate sound but hardly began to phrase meaningfully, breaking lines and taking breaths wherever he saw fit and bringing no life to the role whatsoever. His Tosca this time was Suzanne Murphy (the other members of the quartet will be Marion Vernette Moore, Christine Bunning and Anne Heath-Welch). Murphy is a tried and trusted Puccini singer in Wales and utterly dependable here though never vocally thrilling. If her duets with Saltarin barely reached blood heat it was not her fault nor that of Rizzi, who conducted a beautifully buoyant account of the score, full of airy textures and athletic rhythms. The intensity of the drama was never to be doubted.  .TX- Tosca, WNO, New Theatre, Cardiff; touring to Oxford, Bristol, Swansea, Birmingham, Liverpool, Southampton</p>

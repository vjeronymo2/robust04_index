			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Serb forces defy UN in new attack SERB forces yesterday defied the international community by launching an attack in Moslem-held north-western Bosnia just as tough new United Nations sanctions went into force against Belgrade. Fighting also erupted in other parts of former Yugoslavia, one day after Bosnian Serbs refused to accept an international peace plan signed by rival Moslems and Croats. Serb forces attacked a Moslem enclave around the town of Bihac and captured three villages, UN officials said. Serb infantry supported by tanks and artillery crossed into the north of the so-called 'Bihac pocket' in the early hours of yesterday. The Bosnian Serb army dissociated itself from the assault, saying it was the work of paramilitary vigilantes and that it was powerless to stop them. General Lars-Eric Wahlgren, the UN protection force commander in former Yugoslavia, said in Belgrade that he had ordered some 1,900 French UN troops stationed in the Bihac area to use force to protect civilians. 'I have ordered my men to use force if necessary to prevent human rights violations, abusing civilians or taking them hostage, torching or blowing up homes,' he said. A UN spokesman said in Zagreb the Serbs had taken the villages of Bursaci, Gradina and Radici, located 45 km north of Bihac, near Bosnia's border with the Serb-held Krajina region of Croatia. The spokesman said UN military observers around Bihac had noted a build-up of about 1,000 Serb soldiers, but the attack had been carried out by a force of only 150 men and 10 tanks. The attack raised immediate concerns for the humanitarian needs of the 300,000 civilians trapped in the Bihac region who depend heavily on UN aid convoys. Meanwhile, a UN aid convoy was shelled in central Bosnia yesterday and two relief workers, including a Briton, were seriously injured. UN officials said the a 16-truck convoy was returning to the Moslem town of Zenica to collect food for another run to the town of Tuzla, in the north-east, when it came under mortar fire. The new fighting was sure to anger the international community, which started applying sanctions against the Serbian-led rump Yugoslavia yesterday and is considering limited military intervention to halt the year-old civil war. Nato chiefs, meeting in Brussels yesterday, focused on a narrowing set of options ranging from air strikes to the setting up of heavily defended safe havens modelled on the precedent of northern Iraq. The top-level committee meeting was attended by General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff. There was a consensus in Brussels that any bombing of military positions or supply lines would involve some degree of alliance involvement, and it was made clear that Washington would not obtain backing from allies without specific authority from the UN. After the meeting Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, the chairman of Nato's military committee, a top Nato general fiercely criticised the West for failing to lay out what it wanted to achieve in Bosnia and said he opposed military intervention until the wider goals were better defined. 'I'm healthily sceptical ..I'm determined that we will not (take action) without somebody saying at the outset what it is they require us to do,' Mr Vincent said. Nato contingency planning has so far concentrated on formation of a peacekeeping force which would back up the Vance-Owen peace plan if a ceasefire were established. But officials said these plans - calling mainly on US, British, French and Russian troops - had now been 'put on ice'. Mr Vincent's concerns were partially reflected in testimony by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, to a senate panel in Washington yesterday, when he set rigorous criteria for the use of force by the US. He said the use of force had to meet four tests: the goal would have to be stated clearly to the American people; there must be a strong likelihood that use of force could be successful; there must be an exit strategy; and a programme that could sustain the support of the American people.</p>

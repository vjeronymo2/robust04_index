			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME MONEY RESTORED, BUT 2 MENTAL CLINICS WILL CLOSE  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday restored funding to some mental  health facilities but refused to provide enough to prevent the closing Friday  of two clinics and cuts in service at seven others.  </P> <P> The West Valley Mental Health Center in Canoga Park and the Hubert H. Humphrey  Mental Health Center in South-Central Los Angeles will be closed, bringing to  five the number of clinics shut down this year because of a funding shortage.  </P> <P> Before a jammed audience of mental health patients and workers, the board  allocated $4.7 million in local funds to preserve a number of mental health  programs. But supervisors refused to dig deeper into an $11-million property  tax windfall to provide the remaining $3 million needed to stave off the  closing of two county clinics at 5 p.m. Friday and reductions in service at  seven other facilities.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Ed Edelman explained later that he did not seek full funding  because he "did not have the votes and the county has pressing needs in other  areas."  </P> <P> One of the competing demands for money was evident Tuesday, as 807 social  workers -- 63% of those who care for abused and neglected children -- stayed  off the job to protest slow contract negotiations.  </P> <P> The social workers are among 40,000 county workers -- half of the county's work  force -- whose contracts expire at midnight Saturday. The social workers have  threatened to strike next Tuesday if the county does not limit their workload  and pay a 14.5% raise over one year.  </P> <P> The Department of Children's Services was preparing a plan to assign  supervisory personnel to respond to emergencies, such as police reports of  abused or neglected children.  </P> <P> During their discussion of mental health, supervisors complained about spending  local money to bail out what they contend is a state responsibility.  </P> <P> Clinics where services will be reduced are Arcadia, San Antonio in Bell  Gardens, Hollywood, Rio Hondo in Cerritos, San Pedro, South Bay in Hawthorne  and West Central Family in the Crenshaw District.  </P></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A chance to influence the Budget Budgets are not only an occasion for the government to set the outlines of its economic policy; they are also an opportunity to modify the mass of detailed legislation which affects business. Small firms, with their limited financial and managerial resources, are sensitive to this detail and keen to influence its drafting. The organisations representing them have therefore jumped at the opportunity of two Budgets in one year to put their case. At this stage in the UK's halting recovery from recession, the legislation which affects the ability of small firms to raise finance have taken on a particular prominence. With the banks still nursing sizeable losses on their small-business investments and the venture capital industry facing its own cash shortage, alternative sources of finance are important. The main areas of concern for the business lobbyists are: A replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme which will be wound up at the end of this year. For all its limitations, the BES channelled additional equity finance to small businesses and they are keen to find an alternative. As the Confederation of British Industry points out, the tax system treats equity investment in unquoted companies less favourably than other investments. It suggests two alternatives; up-front tax relief for personal income invested in business assets on the lines of relief applied to private pension scheme contributions; or relief on the returns from direct investment in a business in the same way as dividends and capital gains from shares included in a personal equity plan (PEP). These reliefs would only be available on investments in unquoted companies with shareholders' funds of less than Pounds 2m. An alternative suggestion from the British Venture Capital Association is for a broadening of the scope of PEP tax reliefs to include investments in unquoted companies. Since the sums required would be considerably larger than the amounts at present covered by PEP relief, individuals should be eligible for relief on amounts of up to Pounds 50,000 a year. Companies specialising in asset growth and involved in areas such as property and wines would be excluded. The cost of raising equity finance. At present companies may claim tax relief on the costs associated with raising debt finance but not on the costs of issuing equity. Extending relief to equity would be useful for the small company planning a stock market flotation, suggests the City Group for Smaller Companies. Cisco was set up to find a replacement for the Unlisted Securities Market, which is threatened with closure. The idea of relief for the cost of raising equity has also won the support of the Institute of Directors. Capital gains tax. The equalisation of capital gains tax and the top rate of income tax at 40 per cent have given an added importance to a tax which has always loomed large for the entrepreneur. Calls for the complete exemption of capital gains from tax have come from the British Chambers of Commerce, which want a five-year cut-off, and the British Venture Capital Association, which seeks a two-year deadline. The Federation of Small Businesses wants flexibility in the treatment of capital losses and gains while the Institute of Directors wants businesses to be able to carry losses back for three years. Unused exemptions should be eligible to be carried forward without time limit. A further easing of the rollover relief introduced in the March budget is sought by Cisco and the CBI. Cisco wants relief to be extended to gains which are reinvested in small quoted companies (as well as unquoted businesses) while the CBI wants relief extended to capital gains made from any source, provided they are reinvested in unquoted companies. Value added tax. In theory VAT should be a neutral tax for everyone in business until the goods reach the final consumer. In practice, businesses have been hit by the traditional method of settling VAT, requiring the tax to be paid regardless of whether the client has paid his bill. This system penalises the supplier and gives an unfair cash flow advantage to the slow payer, claims the Federation of Small Businesses. The federation and British Chambers of Commerce want an extension of cash accounting, which does not require VAT to be settled until the customer has made payment. Smaller companies may already opt for cash accounting but the federation wants all VAT payments to be made on a cash basis. The chambers want the size of a company eligible to cash account raised from Pounds 350,000 of sales to Pounds 2m. Capital allowances. The era of 100 per cent first-year allowances, abolished by the government in 1984, is now a memory, but some of the lobbyists hope for a return to a more generous regime. Hoping to take advantage of the temporary easing of the allowances regime in 1992, the CBI and the chambers of commerce are calling for further concessions. The CBI wants companies to be able to write off up to Pounds 200,000 of spending on plant and machinery in the first year or 40 per cent of their total spend, whichever is the greater. The chambers want the 40 per cent first-year allowance extended to the hard-hit retailing sector. The size of the Budget deficit means Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has little room for manoeuvre. Small firms believe some concessions are needed if they are to play a full part in the recovery.</p>

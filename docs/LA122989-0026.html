			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> A PREVIEW OF COMING VCR ATTRACTIONS  </P> <P> In the post-Christmas tradition, video companies aren't releasing much of  interest the week after the big holiday. So to keep your spirits up, let's  first consider coming attractions.  </P> <P> In early 1990, you'll be able to rent or buy: "License to Kill" (videocassette,  Jan. 4), "Parenthood" (videocassette and videodisc, Feb. 8), "Batman"  (videodisc, Feb. 8), "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (videocassette and  videodisc, Feb. 1), "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" (videocassette -- which includes  the Roger Rabbit short "Tummy Trouble" -- March 16 and priced at $22.99),  "Lethal Weapon 2" (videocassette and videodisc, Feb. 8), "Do the Right Thing"  (videocassette, Jan. 11).  </P> <P> Also: "New York Stories" (videocassette, Jan. 24), "Pink Cadillac"  (videocassette, Jan. 10), "Turner and Hooch" (videocassette, Jan. 24), "Uncle  Buck" (videocassette Jan. 25, videodisc Feb. 1), "Karate Kid III"  (videocassette, Jan. 24), "The Abyss" (videocassette, March 29), "Wired"  (videocassette, Feb. 8), "The Package" (videocassette and videodisc, Feb. 22)  and several Andy Hardy films (videocassette, Jan. 23).  </P> <P> And now for this week's new videos:  </P> <P> Think what you will of colorization, "The Big Sky" (Turner, $19.98, not MPAA  rated) is one of those old films that practically begs for it. Ted Turner,  naturally, has obliged -- but a black-and-white version is also out. Dudley  Nichols adapted the A. B. Guthrie, Jr. novel about an old-West expedition up  the Missouri, Howard Hawks directed robustly and Kirk Douglas plays the lead  heartily.  </P> <P> The trouble with "Weekend at Bernie's" (IVE, $89.95, R) is that it's not "The  Trouble With Harry." Hitchcock's "Harry" was a frequently delightful attempt at  concocting black humor out of a plot centered around a dead body; "Weekend"  doesn't handle this tricky business nearly as well, but the 1989 comedy,  starring Andrew McCarthy, had its supporters.  </P> <P> Martin Sheen, Tony Musante and Donna Mills made their feature-film debuts in  "The Incident" (CBS/Fox, $59.98), a 1967 drama about two punks who terrorize  passengers on a New York subway.  </P> <P> Malcolm McDowell and Madolyn Smith star in the otherwise obscure 1987 suspense  film "The Caller" (TWE, $89.95, R), a battle of wills between two strangers.  </P> <P> Cheryl Ladd, Stuart Wilson and John Gielgud star in the 1989 made-for-TV drama  "Romance on the Orient Express" (Turner, $69.98).  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> Work off those extra holiday pounds with "The Sports Illustrated Super Shape-Up  Program" (HBO, $19.99 each for three 50-minute tapes) or "Body and Mind" (HBO,  $29.99), a 70-minute "total relaxation and stress-relief program" featuring  Raquel Welch and Dr. Joan Borysenko.

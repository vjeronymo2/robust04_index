The 89-year-old senior leader also indirectly criticised the  Politburo for failing to stop the partial revival of Maoism that  went along with the festivities.    According to Chinese sources, Mr Deng earlier this month  gave  vent to his dissatisfaction over the Mao celebrations while he  was on holiday in Shanghai.    "Who is behind the festivities?" he asked city officials,  referring to the hundreds of Mao-related events held throughout  the country in the run-up to Mao's birthday on December 26.    The sources said Mr Deng made an indirect reference to  "underground general secretary" Deng Liqun, the conservative  elder and former propaganda chief who had orchestrated the  celebrations. The patriarch also expressed dismay at how his  ideological foes had been given almost free rein.    It is understood Mr Deng was aware that the leftists had  used  the commemorative activities to reinstate Maoism and disparage  the past 15 years of reform. Knowing that it would be against  party decorum for him to lay down restrictions on Mao  celebrations Mr Deng left Beijing about December 6 without  issuing instructions on the subject. The only thing he did was  to acquiesce in the suggestion of a member of his personal  office that Deng Liqun, dubbed Little Deng by Western diplomats,  should be told not to make any speeches or to write articles for  the centenary.    An informed source said, however, that the patriarch was  nonetheless shocked by the number and pervasive influence of the  festivities. The source said while Mr Deng's anger was  primarily aimed at Little Deng and his fellow ideologues, he was  unhappy with how the Politburo, including President Jiang Zemin,  had handled the issue.    "Members of the Politburo Standing Committee including Jiang  Zemin, had in early December asked the patriarch at least three  times how they should conduct the celebrations," the source  said. "But Deng refused to say anything." While talking to  local cadres in Shanghai, however, Mr Deng continued to express  his confidence in the "third-generation leadership with comrade  Jiang Zemin as its core". "They have done a good job with the  economy," Mr Deng reportedly said.    Sources in Shanghai said Mr Deng would likely stay in the  area until the Lunar New Year.</p>

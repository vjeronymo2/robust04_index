			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / US rallies support for N Korea accord: Clinton uses Apec to win backing for deal President Bill Clinton is using the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum to drum up support for his deal with North Korea whereby Pyongyang has undertaken to abandon efforts to manufacture and stockpile nuclear weapons. Speaking after meetings with leaders from China, Japan, South Korea and Australia, he said the North Korean accord had been the most important topic of their discussions. All of them had indicated support for the agreement, 'which marks an historic step to freeze, and ultimately to end, the greatest security threat in this region'. An explicit gesture of support for the deal would not only help rebuild the credibility of US foreign policy after the landslide Republican victory in last week's mid-term elections, but would also go some way to distract attention from the persistent intrusion of human rights issues into a summit supposed to be primarily devoted to trade policy. It may also help persuade North Korea to live up to its undertakings. The deal has proved controversial in the west because it will be difficult to police and enforce. It will be five years before North Korea has to disclose to the outside world the extent of its existing ability to make nuclear weapons. Meanwhile Pyongyang is to receive aid to pay for the installation of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.4bn) worth of safer light water reactors. Mr Clinton's discussions yesterday focused particularly on Japan and South Korea, which are to provide most of the finance, but he also secured valuable support from China, one of the few countries with influence in North Korea. China was pleased with the deal and 'will play a positive role in promoting peace and stability in the Korean peninsula', the Foreign Ministry said after Mr Clinton met President Jiang Zemin. The US president also urged South Korea and North Korea, which has reacted coolly to recent overtures on investment from Seoul, to resume bilateral contacts over security and other matters. 'These two countries have some things to resolve between themselves that the rest of us separately cannot do for them,' he said. Specific matters were also raised in yesterday's meeting with President Jiang, including human rights. 'We made it absolutely clear that in order for the US relationship to fully flower, there has to be progress on all fronts,' Mr Clinton said. He offered Mr Jiang a compromise to resolve a contentious arms issue, described by the Americans as a 'potential time bomb' for US/China relations. The proposal would absolve China of penalties if it disclosed sales of M-11 missiles to Pakistan, US officials said. As the issue of East Timor continued to dog the talks, Mr Clinton, asked whether the US had softened its stance on human rights in favour of trade deals, said Washington continued to raise the issue with Indonesia. The US had obtained assurances from Indonesia that the students who had invaded the US embassy compound in Jakarta over the weekend would not face retribution, he added. East Timor remains, however, strongly in the limelight. About 80 East Timorese were arrested after a further student protests in Dili yesterday.</p>

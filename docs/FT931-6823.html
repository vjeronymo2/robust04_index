			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Patten loses support in Hong Kong GOVERNOR Chris Patten's position in Hong Kong weakened perceptibly yesterday when his supporters turned on him for delaying publication of legislation which, if enacted, would make elections in the colony more democratic. The delay has left Mr Patten exposed to the accusation of acquiescing to Beijing's demands for him to abandon his package. Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians accused Britain of selling out Hong Kong in the wake of the decision announced on Thursday. Mr Patten was due to gazette his legislation by the end of this month but drew back in the hope China would agree to talks on Hong Kong's political future. His decision was, however, greeted enthusiastically by Hong Kong's stock market - the Hang Seng Index rose 148.11 points to close at 6,351.99 - and won support from the colony's conservative politicians. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, said the UK had lost the negotiating battle with China before it had begun. He said the people of Hong Kong knew who lost every time Britain and China sat down at the negotiating table. 'Have you ever seen the British winning anything by negotiations with the Chinese government?' he said. The Hong Kong Economic Journal, the colony's leading business newspaper and long-time supporter of Mr Patten, sharply criticised him for deferring publication of the legislation. He was 'naive to the point of folly' in believing that this gesture would help him secure an agreement with Beijing, the paper said. However, Mr Patten's decision won approval from the Co-operative Resources Centre (CRC), a conservative political grouping close to the colony's business community and Beijing. Mrs Selina Chow, a leading CRC member, said it was a 'hopeful sign' that talks might eventuate. Hong Kong's Beijing-controlled press published conflicting reactions to Mr Patten's decision. Ta Kung Pao, which is regarded as the most reliable mouthpiece, published a tough commentary which laid down four conditions for talks which appeared to British diplomats to be designed to prevent dialogue. It said Britain should agree to talks about the 1994-95 elections based on past understandings; it should agree not to publish Mr Patten's bill until agreement was reached; it should include no 'third party,' that is Hong Kong, in the talks; and any agreement reached should be binding and unable to be amended by 'area councils,' that is, the Legislative Council. Wen Wei Po, in a softer commentary, said China had never insisted Britain publicly withdraw Mr Patten's political blueprint. 'The British side can have several ways to abandon the package, such as, putting it aside or treating it as 'invisible' during the talks,' it said.</p>

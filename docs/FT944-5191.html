			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Brussels move set to spark row over EU data protection rules The European Commission is heading for a confrontation this week with member states over plans for EU-wide data protection rules it claims are essential for the development of home banking and other services on Europe's information superhighway. The move by Brussels looks certain to reopen arguments over the willingness of European Union member states to adopt the measures needed to complete the single market. At present, the cross-border provision of financial products such as mortgages and life assurance policies via a computer screen is limited because data protection regimes differ. As a result, member states often fail to exchange essential information because one is not satisfied that sufficient protection exists in another. Brussels' plans for EU-wide rules are due to be announced on Thursday by Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, the commissioner responsible for the single market. He believes that efforts to create an information society in Europe 'will be in jeopardy if there is no co-ordination of rules for the exchange of data'. The business world 'needs legal security to invest. With-out the confidence of its con-sumers in their data, this enormous growth market will not get off the ground,' says Mr Vanni D'Archirafi. However, member states, notably the UK, will argue that the draft laws are heavy-handed and will impose heavy costs on the private sector. Britain is most concerned about plans to extend data protection rules to information stored on paper. Data protection in the UK covers only information stored on computer. It is also opposed to a proposed commission requirement that individuals be told if information they have provided for one purpose is to be passed on to another institution for another pur-pose. Ms Emily Marks of the Confederation of British Industry said it would cost millions just to give consumers access to data stored on paper. But a Brussels official said: 'If you exempt manual data you will create a tendency to circumvent rules by using old techniques. We want to have precisely the opposite effect, of encouraging new techniques.' He also argued that the UK was exaggerating the practical implications of the draft directive. Apart from a 10-year transition period that would be granted for member states to adjust their rules, it would be possible to apply the rules pragmatically. Nordic countries are also worried that the data protection rules could conflict with open access to public documents and rules on freedom of expression.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / MBO thwarted in BAe sale of jet arm BRITISH Aerospace yesterday confirmed the sale of its Corporate Jets business to Raytheon, the US company which makes Beechcraft aircraft, for Pounds 250m after describing a proposed management buy-out as 'unworkable'. Mr Richard Hooke, a former BAe executive in charge of the MBO alternative, said he had been denied the information needed to make a formal bid. 'I would have thought competition would maximise shareholder value,' he said. The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, recently asked Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, to consider the MBO. BAe said it had looked at the MBO alternative 'in as much as it exists' but argued it was 'unfocused and unworkable'. BAe's shares yesterday rose 16p to 355p. Raytheon has entered an agreement for the supply of airframe assemblies from BAe's division, for a minimum of three years from completion. The transaction was structured on the basis that net assets are worth Pounds 194m. Mr Hooke, who was head of business strategy at BAe's Aviation services, said he had been asked to look at the possibility of forming an MBO of the jet business by the group's chief executive, Mr Dick Evans, in June 1992. The group was in discussions at the time with Raytheon, but the talks collapsed in September. BAe then said it had decided to hold on to its jet division. Mr Hooke left BAe at the beginning of the year to work full time on the MBO and after securing financial backing from an investment fund told BAe in March he would make a bid for the jets division in excess of its net assets. But Mr Hooke never made a formal bid because he says information on the business was withheld from the MBO team. BAe, which denies this, yesterday announced that Corporate Jets made an operating profit last year before interest and launch costs of Pounds 6m on sales of Pounds 308m.

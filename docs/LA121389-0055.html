			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: PROMENADE MALL IN WOODLAND HILLS SOLD  </P> <P> The Promenade Mall in Woodland Hills has been sold for an undisclosed price to  a New York investor group.  </P> <P> The 600,000-square-foot mall, which is anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue, Bullocks  Wilshire and Robinson's, was sold by Pan-American Properties to Shopping Center  Associates. Included in the sale were the Laguna Hills Mall in Orange County  and six community shopping centers in California, Arizona and Washington.  </P> <P> Pan-American, which announced in July that it would sell the properties, is a  real estate investment trust owned by pension funds for British coal miners.  Shopping Center Associates includes The O'Connor Group, a property development  and management firm, and The Retail Property Trust, a real estate partnership.  </P> <P> Paul F. Kastner, vice president of marketing for the O'Connor Group, said it  was too early to discuss what changes are planned for the Promenade Mall. But  he said the mall's vacancy rate was too high and "that's something we'll  address very quickly." He declined to specify the vacancy level.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has urged both parties  in the Rwandan conflict to implement an immediate cease-fire and  initiate talks to implement the Arusha Accord, which was  endorsed last year.    President Mwinyi reiterated this advice during separate  talks  at State House in Dar es Salaam today, when he met with  delegations from the Rwandan Government and the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF].    He said the meeting, which Tanzania will be convening in  Arusha on 23 April, seeks to give the warring sides in Rwanda a  chance to end the civil war and to consider ways for immediately  implementing the Arusha Accord.    Speaking to Rwandan Home Affairs Minister Faustin Munyazesa,  who was heading his government's delegation, President Mwinyi  stressed that the delay in the implementation of the Arusha  Peace Accord had led to the eruption of war and slaughter in  Rwanda. He said the only solution was for all the parties to  implement a cease-fire, end the killings, and discuss the  implementation of the Arusha Accord.    President Mwinyi assured the first vice chairman of the RPF,  Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka, that next Saturday's meeting in Arusha  did not aim to begin new talks on a peace agreement, but to  discuss feasible ways of implementing the accord in the context  of the new political situation in Rwanda.    He emphasized that the Rwandan crisis was political, and  hence called for a political, not a military, solution.    Mr. Mazimpaka assured President Mwinyi that the RPF's  objective was to halt the killings so that the Arusha Accord  could be implemented, not to take over power through the barrel  of the gun.</p>

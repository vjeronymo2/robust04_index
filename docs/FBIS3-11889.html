Gallotti insisted  that the STF decision to convert wages into URV's on the 20th of  each month has a constitutional foundation and is strictly under  the jurisdiction of the STF.    "Through the unanimous decision of its members, the STF made  an administrative decision based on the Constitution. This  subject exclusively concerns the STF. The STF chairman does not  want contention with representatives of other government  branches that are just as independent and who ought to seek  harmony and not confrontation, seeking respect for the  constitutional rule of independency and harmony among the  branches. To obey the Constitution is the best way to preserve  the credibility of the institutions," Gallotti said.    Senate President Humberto Lucena (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party -- Paraiba] and Chamber of Deputies  President Inocencio de Oliveira (PFL-PE) [Liberal Front Party --  Pernambuco] could not be found yesterday. Lucena yesterday  accompanied Paraiba Governor Ronaldo Cunha Lima to dedicate  several public works in different municipalities in Campina  Grande region. Inocencio spent the day on his farms in  Pernambuco and Maranhao, transferring cattle from Serra Talhada,  Pernambuco, to the interior of Maranhao.</p>

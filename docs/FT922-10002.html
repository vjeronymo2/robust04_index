			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Taking all the factors into account - In A Nutshell The Association of British Factors &amp; Discounters reported a 12 per cent increase in the volume of client companies' turnover in the first quarter of 1992 compared with the same period of last year. The turnover of association members rose to Pounds 3.75bn from Pounds 3.34bn reflecting both an increase in the number of companies using the services of members and growth in the turnover of existing clients. The association, whose members provide cash to their clients against invoices, said the increase was a sign that small and medium-sized businesses were starting to recover from the recession.</p>

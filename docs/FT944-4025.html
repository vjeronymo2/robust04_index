			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Chechnya talks due on Monday Talks between Russian and Chechen officials are scheduled for Monday at Vladikavkaz, near the border of Chechnya, the breakaway Russian republic. The Russian side, led by Mr Vyachselav Mikhailov, is also to meet representatives of the opposition groups fighting the Chechen rebel regime of General Dzhokar Dudayev. However, in Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin ordered his government to use 'all measures available to the state' to disarm opposing forces in the republic. In Chechnya, the main opposition group, the Provisional Council, said it would put its forces on a war footing from Monday - a move which seemed designed to put pressure on the Russian forces massed on the border to enter Chechnya. At the same time, the reformist groups Yabloko and Russia's Choice appealed to the president not to use force - saying that the move could turn Russia into a police state. 'You would lose the support of millions of Russian citizens who have set as their goal the peaceful democratic development of Russia,' they said.</p>

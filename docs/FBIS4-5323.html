			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, with investment commitments of US$260.8  million [(Singapore dollar] S$406.7 million) to date, is now  Myanmar's [Burma] largest foreign investor overtaking Thailand  and the United States, Myanmar's [Burma] Minister for National  Planning and Economic Development Brigadier-General [BG] David  Abel said yesterday.    Speaking at a seminar here on business opportunities in  Myanmar, he said Singapore's rate of investment was the fastest  growing.    The Republic's investments had already grown from US$45  million in August last year to US$107.6 million as at March 16  this year, according to Myanmar's Foreign Investment Commission.    Singapore also has the most international telephone  connections with Myanmar.    Singaporean investments were mainly in oil and gas, tourism  and hotel and mining.    About 150 representatives of local and international  companies attended the seminar organised by Conference &amp;  Exhibition Management Services, Applied Investments, the  Singapore Manufacturers Association and the Singapore  International Chamber of Commerce.    BG Abel will call on Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow  Tong and Trade Development Board chairman Alan Yeo today before  returning home.    Last year, trade between Singapore and Myanmar increased by  19.4 per cent to [Singapore dollars] $720 million.</p>

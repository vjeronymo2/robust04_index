			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Tractors draw David Brown back The David Brown engineering group has gone back into the tractor business after an absence of more than 15 years. The company is making transaxles - combined axles and transmissions - in a high-technology centre in South Yorkshire. The first phase of the centre, which will officially open next week at Penistone, near Barnsley, is making transaxles for the US, German and Italian tractor markets. David Brown has invested Pounds 6m refurbishing and equipping a derelict factory. Mr Roger Bailey, manufacturing director of David Brown vehicle products, said a Pounds 5m expansion of the site was planned, with up to 160 new jobs in the next two years. The company has started making transaxles for Agco, the US tractor manufacturer. David Brown's design has enabled Agco to increase its tractors' performance from 195hp to 215hp by using high-precision bevelled gears. Mr Bailey said coal-mine closures in the region had ensured a supply of skilled workers who could be retrained for high-precision engineering. The 65 employees have agreed a single-union deal with flexibility to allow unfettered use of the latest production management systems. David Brown, which is based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was originally a private family business famous for its ownership of Aston Martin cars. The company was floated last April.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Karen Topchyan: "A Russian, an American, and a </F> Persian Were Asked.... Diplomats Express Views on Caucasian  Topics"]    [Text] Yerevan -- The ambassadors of Russia, the United  States, and Iran accredited to Yerevan have expressed their  views on events in the Transcaucasus in the parliamentary  newspaper RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA under the headline "Bermuda  Triangle or Scope for Accord?"    Vladimir Stupishin, leader of Russia's diplomatic mission,  states: "All the new foreign countries, and not just the  Transcaucasus, are an area of priority attention for Russia.  The Transcaucasus as a whole, and Armenia in particular, occupy  their own historically determined place in the new community  (CIS), where Russia is not the older brother, let alone the  imperial center, but is a partner on an equal footing and even  an ally in military-political questions. All Russia's actions  and efforts here can only be of a purely peaceful political  nature."    In the opinion of U.S. Ambassador Harry Gilmore, his country  "upholds the independence and territorial integrity of every  Caucasian state. In this regard the United States is opposed to  the influence of any country on another independent country."  While his Iranian counterpart Ahmad Sobhani considers that "It  must be borne in mind that the Caucasus should not become a  platform for launching an attack on others. All countries  should support the independence of the Caucasus and respect the  opinion of the peoples of the region."    Asked how he perceives the resolution of the ethnic and  territorial conflicts in the former Union, the Russian  ambassador replied: "They need to be tackled on the basis of  the generally accepted principles and norms of international law  and, as far as possible, through our own means within the  framework of the CIS mechanism and on a bilateral basis."    Russia is ready to assume "a mediating role." Furthermore,  "practice shows that no one, apart from Russia, is ready today  to shoulder the peacemaking burden in the area of the former  USSR."    For his part, Ambassador Gilmore considers that  confrontation  "must be peacefully resolved by the governments of those states  on the basis of the criteria adopted by the United Nations and  the CSCE and international laws." And the opinion of the  Iranian ambassador in Armenia is that "When disagreements emerge  it is the actual parties who should first and foremost seek way  of conciliation. When conflicts deepen, surrounding countries  are naturally bound to show disquiet. The potential of  mediators should also be taken into account."    The diplomats' answers to a question about Armenia's likely  foreign policy priorities are very interesting. Vladimir  Stupishin: "Objectively, historical development has been such  that Russia and Armenia have many common interests in all  spheres of life concerning the state and the people, and  spiritual kinship, common cultural values, and a joint history  exist between our peoples." Harry Gilmore: "I think that the  three peoples of the Caucasus form a bridge between Europe and  Asia. I personally hope that Armenia's gaze will turn in every  direction." Ahmad Sobhani: "The Caucasus should establish  constructive relations and seek sources of cooperation  everywhere."</p>

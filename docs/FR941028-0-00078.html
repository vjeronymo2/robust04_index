			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, the language contained in OSM's proposed regulation would also encompass the commenters' proposal that a challenger be able to provide proof that an ownership or control link has been severed. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of the proposed regulation, such proof would be included as evidence that the facts relied upon by the regulatory authority to establish ownership or control or a presumption of ownership or control did not or do not exist. Whether such proof is sufficient to support a successful challenge to an ownership or control link will depend upon the facts of each case. OSM must reject the implication of commenters' proposal that the severance of a current ownership or control link to a violator would relieve a person from permit block in all cases. For instance, if a person was an owner or controller of a violator during the period in which the violation was committed, severance of his or her current ownership or control relationship with the company would not relieve him or her of responsibility created through the prior ownership or control link. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM must further reject commenters' proposal to the extent that it would establish a standard which would enable a challenger of an ownership or control link to a violation to challenge the link by proof that he lacked knowledge of the violation; that he did not authorize the activity which led to the violation; or that he did not have direct authority to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. Commenters' proposal must be rejected because it ignores the control which stems from indirect authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM agrees that all of commenters' proposed standards invoke factual matters which may be relevant when a regulatory authority considers an ownership or control link to a violation. As such, proof of each of these matters could be presented within the context of the presentation of facts made under paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26. For instance, proof presented that a person had no knowledge of a violation; that he or she did not actually authorize a violation; or that he or she did not have direct authority for the surface coal mining operation may well reflect on the contours of the person's responsibilities with a presumptively owned or controlled entity. Nevertheless, such facts may also constitute a false shield which has been created to conceal the substantive, indirect control that the person has over a surface coal mining operation. Commenters' proposal is flawed, therefore, because it would enable a challenger to successfully challenge an ownership or control link by simply proving lack of actual knowledge, actual authority, or direct control, without requiring proof that a presumed owner or controller also lacked indirect authority over the surface coal mining operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry commenters further proposed a modification to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26. In OSM's proposal, that paragraph prohibited a challenge as to the existence of the violation within the context of a challenge to an ownership or control link or a challenge to the status of the violation. Commenters proposed changes to allow a challenge as to the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. For the reasons discussed with respect to this issue in the section of this preamble captioned ``Due Process'' and in the previous discussion of changes made to final &sect;773.20, OSM has generally rejected commenters' proposal but has accepted such proposal with respect to the improvident permit issuance process. Also, at the time of permit denial, a permit applicant can appeal any reason for such denial including the existence of a violation assuming that the applicant is not bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination or has not had a prior opportunity to challenge the existence of the violation. Accordingly, OSM has amended paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final rule &sect;773.25 to clarify that a challenge may be made by a permittee acting within the context of the improvident permit issuance process under &sect;&sect;773.20&hyph;773.21. This is in recognition of the more significant interest that a permittee has in a permit compared to the limited interest that an applicant has in a permit application. A permittee's ability to assert such a challenge will be limited, however, if he or she had a prior opportunity to challenge the violation notice and failed to do so in a timely manner or if he or she is bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence of the violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter representing State regulatory authorities indicated concern that paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26 contained legal terms such as ``prima facie determination,'' proof ``by a preponderance of the evidence,'' and ``probative, reliable, and substantial evidence'' without providing definitions of such terms. The commenter indicated that all of these terms have ``particular legal meanings.'' He urged that the proposed regulation be amended to incorporate definitions of such terms, ``consistent with their common legal meanings.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM appreciates the commenter's proposal. OSM disagrees, however, with commenter's view that the cited terms need formal definition in the proposed regulation. As commenter has correctly noted, each of the cited terms has a traditional, common legal meaning. In a proceeding to challenge an ownership or control link or the status of a violation, such terms would have their traditional legal meanings. It is anticipated that such meanings will further evolve on a case by case basis over time. Finally, with respect to the terms ``probative, reliable, and substantial'' as such terms describe evidence, paragraph (c)(2) of proposed &sect;773.26 provides some examples of this type of evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

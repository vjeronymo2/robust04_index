			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> THE PROMISE OF A DREAM, A SHOW OF CONCERN FOR LATINO RESIDENTS;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN: THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE APPEALS TO YOUNG CALIFORNIANS WHO WANT OWN  HOMES.  </P> <P> Dianne Feinstein promised Thursday that if she is elected governor she will  revive the dream of homeownership for young Californians.  </P> <P> She also talked of building whole new towns along a proposed railroad line  through the Central Valley.  </P> <P> Feinstein showed off some of the new housing built in pricey San Francisco for  low-income families and first-time homeowners under programs inaugurated by her  administration as mayor.  </P> <P> "Now it's time to bring that same energy, that same commitment, that same  leadership to the state of California," the Democratic candidate for governor  said in the auditorium at the new Delancey Street housing complex across from  Pier 36 on San Francisco's Embarcadero.  </P> <P> Feinstein then visited the three-bedroom, 1,200-square-foot Parkview Commons  townhouse bought by architect David Rulon for $140,000 even though the unit and  others like it have been appraised for as much as $400,000.  </P> <P> Under her administration, the city and a nonprofit development firm built 114  townhouses that were offered for sale to first-time home buyers making $40,000  or less a year. Rulon was one of 3,271 applicants who entered a lottery to buy  the units, which were priced as low as $99,000.  </P> <P> Until the chance to buy into Parkview came along, Rulon said, he and his wife  had considered moving from the San Francisco Bay Area, perhaps to Seattle.  "This was our one and only opportunity to buy something in the Bay Area," Rulon  told reporters who toured the unit with the candidate and her entourage.  </P> <P> Feinstein said Parkview is just one of a variety of housing concepts that  California needs so that less-affluent residents, seniors and others can afford  to own their own homes.  </P> <P> "It's like a savings account," Feinstein said of home ownership. "There's  nothing better and it's so hard for young families."  </P> <P> Feinstein also said, in response to a question, that while she would propose  some changes in Proposition 13, the property tax-cutting initiative approved in  1978, she would not tamper with the Jarvis-Gann 1% property tax rate limit,  calling it "inviolate."  </P> <P> "People live in a fear that the property taxes, if they can't work, would  become such that they would lose their homes," she said. "I think that's an  extremely emotional issue. That's what brought on Proposition 13 in the first  place. We must protect that rate for residential property taxpayers . . . who  want their homes for their family housing and they deserve to be protected."  </P> <P> Feinstein said California had suffered under eight years of Republican neglect  of the housing issue. She said that only 10% of $600 million worth of  voter-approved housing bonds have been spent.  </P> <P> "It will become an immediate priority of mine to see that those funds are  turned into housing units as quickly as possible," she said.  </P> <P> Feinstein also said that voter approval of highway and rail construction funds  in June offers the opportunity for the sort of innovation she said is needed to  avoid traffic congestion, end long commutes by workers who cannot afford to  live near their workplaces, and to manage California's growth.  </P> <P> "We have a chance to begin that rail spine down California, to begin some new  towns and do it right with jobs close to housing and use some innovative  methodology to build some new homes," she said.  </P> <P> For Feinstein, Wednesday and Thursday provided the most sustained public  campaigning she had done in her home city since her primary election victory  June 5. She hugged old friends and associates arriving at Delancey Street on  one of those sunny, wind-swept days for which the city is famous.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful to be home," she said, and remarked about the smog and traffic  congestion in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> The genesis of Parkview Commons was the San Francisco school board's decision  back in the 1970s to abandon a high school building because of earthquake  hazards. The city put up $2.5 million to lease the site from the school  district for 75 years and paid $1 million to demolish the old school buildings.  The use of tax-exempt bonds financed mortgage funds at fixed below-market  interest rates.  </P> <P> The start-up city funds came from the city's Office of Affordable Housing  Production Program, which received $30 million from downtown office building  developers as part of what Feinstein said was "an obligation to help provide  affordable housing" in the city.  </P> <P> Feinstein said the city built an estimated $500 million worth of affordable  housing under such programs during the first seven years of her administration  or "nearly half of all housing developments in San Francisco during those  years."  </P> <P> "It's innovation that builds housing today," she said.  </P></p>

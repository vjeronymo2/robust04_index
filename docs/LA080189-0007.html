			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. STRATEGY FOR NUCLEAR RESPONSE  </P> <P> Since when does the U.S. Government release its newest SIOPs? This article, and  the accompanying one on "L.A. Area Targets," is nothing more than a cynically  calculated piece of propaganda aimed at eliciting a harsh response from the  Russians (we will sound-mine and overfly their territory with impunity),  increasing war fear among Americans, leading us to accept the nonsense of the  B-2, still another stealth plane, burrowing N-bombs, and who knows what else.  </P> <P> Our military-industrial complex (President Eisenhower's words) is terrified  that we will recognize that piloted penetration bombers are irrelevant in a  ballistic missile nuclear warfare scenario; that its major contractors may have  to learn to live in the civilian economy: that peace may break out. To avoid  this, it is willing to undermine the delicate web of perestroika at the expense  of world peace, and especially of the American taxpayer.  </P> <P> Enough! Let's start by canceling the B-2, for which there is still no mission  that can't be handled better and cheaper by missiles, cruise or ballistic.  </P> <P> CARL G. HOKANSON  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., MEXICO QUASH MONEY-LAUNDERING RING LINKED TO COLOMBIAN DRUG LORDS  </P> <P> A Colombian who allegedly led a ring that laundered as much as $70 million in  drug proceeds and shipped a ton of cocaine to Southern California each month is  in U.S. custody, while 12 people identified as accomplices are being held in  Tijuana.  </P> <P> Luis Fernando Mejia Pelaez, 50, was arrested at a San Diego-area motel last  Thursday. He is charged with 174 counts of making false statements and failure  to file currency transaction reports, assistant U.S. attorney L. J. O'Neale  said Wednesday. Mejia has been a federal fugitive since 1986, when he was  indicted along with eight other people on money-laundering charges, O'Neale  said.  </P> <P> According to Mexican police, Mejia headed an organization that laundered  between $60 million and $70 million a month. The ring allegedly used three auto  dealerships and two currency exchange houses in Mexico to launder money for  Colombian drug lords. Mexican officials said that the ring also used banks in  New York, Miami, Tampa, Fla., and Panama to launder drug proceeds.  </P> <P> The Mexican authorities described the arrests, which they said resulted from a  joint investigation by U.S. and Mexican police, as a major blow to Colombia's  Medellin drug cartel. The 12 people arrested in Tijuana include three women and  three Colombian males.  </P> <P> Mejia is being held without bail in San Diego at the Metropolitan Correctional  Center and has a court appearance scheduled for today.  </P> <P> When arrested, Mejia was carrying a Mexican driver's license with a Tijuana  address and a Colombian passport, O'Neale said. Mejia also had U.S. tourist and  business visas that were issued to him in Bogota.  </P> <P> O'Neale added that Guillermina Watson was named in the same indictment with  Mejia and was convicted in 1987 on 206 counts of currency violations. Watson,  who was an officer at the now-closed Bank of America branch in Coronado, was  sentenced to five years in federal prison and is the only person named in the  indictment who has gone to trial.  </P></p>

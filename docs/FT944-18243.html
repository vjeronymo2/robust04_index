			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (15): New lease of life for the industrial dinosaurs - Martin Dickson finds recent market statistics underline renewed international competitiveness in the US There are few more striking examples of US industry's renewed international competitiveness than its motor companies, which just five years ago were being written off as sclerotic industrial dinosaurs, doomed to cede an ever larger share of the US market to Japanese rivals. Today, Detroit's Big Three manufacturers - General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler - have bounced back, or are in the process of doing so, although fierce competition from Asian and European rivals means they cannot afford any complacency. Recent market statistics underline both this recovery and the see-saw struggle for US market share: In 1993, for the second year in a row, Japan's share of the US car and light truck market fell, to 23.1 per cent from 24.3 per cent in 1992 and 25.7 per cent in 1991. Detroit's share rose from 72.2 per cent to 73.9 per cent. This year, however, both Japanese and European manufacturers have presented a stronger challenge - notably in the car market, where they have clawed back significant market share, although Detroit argues that this is partly because of a shortage of products from the Big Three because of model change-overs. In the first eight months of 1994, Japanese name-plates accounted for 29.8 per cent of the car market, compared to 28.8 per cent in the same period of 1993, and Europe was up from 3.5 per cent to 4.3 per cent, led by a reviving Volkswagen/Audi. Detroit's share slipped from 66.4 per cent to 64.4 per cent. For the car and light truck market as a whole, Detroit held a 73 per cent share, down from 74.1, while Japan was on 23.4 per cent, up from 22.9, and Europe at 2.7, against 2.2 Detroit's financial fortunes have also been helped by the turn in the US economic cycle over the past two years, which has boosted demand for sales and allowed manufacturers to cut back on costly rebates. Vehicle sales dropped sharply in the 1991-92 recession and the car companies fell into heavy losses, with inefficient GM alone losing Dollars 12bn in its North American operations in just two years. But over the past year profits at the Big Three have been rising sharply and the industry is forecasting US car and truck sales in 1994 of 15.3m to 15.5m units, up from 14.2m last year and 12.5m in 1991. But Detroit cannot afford to relax. First, international competition remains intense, and on some measures Detroit still lags behind its Japanese rivals. Second, it remains uncertain just how far the upswing in the US market has to go. Third, the US industry has yet to prove that it will not repeat its past mistake of excessive complacency when the economy is buoyant, leaving it ill-prepared it for the subsequent, inevitable downturn. The Japanese, in particular, are still formidable competitors and their loss of US market share is due in no small measure to the sharp rise in the value of the yen relative to the dollar - a factor which could some day reverse itself. For now, however, a substantial price gap has developed in the US market between Japanese vehicles and similarly equipped US ones. The Japanese are shifting more and more of their production to the US and buying more parts in the country, both to protect themselves against yen exposure and to ameliorate US protectionist sentiments. The trend was underscored in early September when Toyota, the largest Japanese manufacturer and the company feared most by Detroit, said it planned to raise its North American vehicle production by nearly 50 per cent. In July, Honda said it planned to spend Dollars 310m to expand its North American operations. European luxury car manufacturers are also setting up production plants in the US: BMW has built a plant in South Carolina in order to make a sporty new vehicle, both for the US and export markets, while Mercedes is constructing a factory in Alabama to make its entrance into the fast-growing sports utility vehicle sector. Both have been drawn to the US by the size of its market, skills of its labour force and its competitive manufacturing cost structure. Exchange rate movements apart, several factors have helped Detroit claw back market share from foreign rivals. First, it has sharply improved its manufacturing productivity, though here it still lags somewhat behind the North America plants of Japanese companies. There are also substantial efficiency differences between the Big Three. According to a recent report by Harbour &amp; Associates, a Detroit consultancy, Ford's plants are the most productive of the trio, measured by workers per vehicle produced, followed by Chrysler, with General Motors lagging well behind. However, Chrysler more than makes up for the disadvantage with a more efficient vehicle development process. Chrysler completely changed the way it developed vehicles at the start of this decade, setting up 'platform teams' to develop cars. These bring together disciplines such as engineering and design to work simultaneously on a problem, rather than 'throwing it over the wall' from one department to another. Chrysler has also set up close links with suppliers, which are brought early into discussions about new models. Ford and GM's relationships with suppliers are also in a state of flux. GM stirred up intense hostility when Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was appointed worldwide head of purchasing in 1992 and began demanding large price cuts from the group's parts suppliers. He left GM in controversial circumstances to join Volkswagen last year, but the group's relations with suppliers remains fragile. Both Ford and GM are combining their US and European purchasing operations in an attempt to cut costs, a course not open to Chrysler which has virtually no overseas operations. Each of the Big Three is also retreating from the industry's traditional vertical integration, selling off parts operations and redistributing contracts to outside companies with better expertise, fewer distractions and lower labour costs. The US recovery has also been helped by improvements in the past five years in the quality of vehicles emerging from Detroit's plants. On the whole, the quality still lags that of Japanese rivals, but the gap has narrowed to the point where customers are prepared to place more weight on areas where the Big Three do have an edge - in pricing and vehicle design. Detroit, for example, has been ahead of the competition in exploiting a fashion for mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles or people carriers) and four-wheel drive sports utility vehicles. How long will the current US expansion continue? Over the summer a slow-down in sales had some pessimists wondering whether it might already be faltering. But August saw a healthy 10 per cent year on year rise in vehicle sales and most analysts think the upswing could have two to three more years to run.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Stewards shop for new members - A look at union moves to find recruits How do you sell a product to indifferent consumers, via hostile retailers, when you have virtually no marketing experience? That is the problem facing the organisers of trade union recruitment campaigns, trying to sell trade union membership. Effective campaigns are more important than ever for the unions; last year the membership of TUC-affiliated unions fell to 8.2m from a peak of more than 12m in 1980. Membership figures are like sales figures: they represent revenue for unions  -which are also small to medium-sized businesses. As membership falls, the businesses contract, and eventually disappear. TUC unions recruited more than 500,000 new members last year, but the majority of those were new workers in companies that were already organised. The long-term trends working against unionisation, such as the decline of manual work and manufacturing, mean that there are fewer such organised work-places taking on significant numbers of workers. To slow or reverse those trends, unions are forced to reach out to offices and factories that have never been organised. Realising that leafleting non-unionised employees outside their workplaces was not getting very far, some unions, in the early 1980s, began to offer various personal and financial services as inducements. TUC officials say that has helped a little but people join unions 'for the basics', such as better pay, working conditions and job security. Slightly cheaper car insurance is unlikely to lure them on its own. But as people have not been joining in sufficient numbers, even for the basics, unions have been forced to be unconventional. The GPMU print union is breaking with tradition and trying to recruit young people in design and art colleges before they go into the printing industry. And one management union has a policy of offering a bottle of champagne to every member who recruits a new one. The most interesting current recruitment effort is in the growing telecommunications sector where the National Communications Union - the 150,000-strong British Telecom union - must diversify or wither away. The sharp reduction in BT staffing currently underway means that the union will lose about one-quarter of its members in the next two years alone. It is thus tentatively starting recruitment efforts outside BT - primarily in BT's competitor Mercury and in the 159 cable TV franchise holders. The NCU is typical of many British unions, especially those with roots in the public sector, in having virtually no experience of recruitment. It has enjoyed a protected existence with members handed to it on a plate. Now, drawing on the experience of its American sister union and of the British banking union Bifu, it is aiming to recruit 8,000 members outside BT by the end of 1994. It does not sound an ambitious target given how many members the NCU is losing, but the union will have trouble reaching it. Alan Harley, the energetic former BT middle manager who is leading the recruitment drive, admits that Labour's election defeat will make reaching the target more difficult. But he has an annual budget of Pounds 250,000 for at least three years, two people working under him (one concentrating on Mercury, one on cable TV) and seems to have got off to a reasonably good start. The economics look favourable. Every non-BT member recruited pays the union 68p per week of which 50p is pure profit for the union and should mean that recruitment becomes self-financing within three years. The profit margin is high because the non-BT members are not benefiting from the main collective bargaining services provided by the union. But for the same reason, it is difficult to persuade people to join. 'The biggest problem we have in Mercury is persuading people that even without recognition for collective bargaining, it is worth being in a union,' said an NCU Mercury activist on a special weekend course at the union's country retreat in Alvescot near Oxford. In its slick promotional literature - slogan 'big enough to count, small enough to care' - the union argues that it can provide support in disciplinary cases, redundancy, and much beside, without recognition, and claims to have already improved Mercury's health and safety policy. The medium-term aim is 30 per cent membership in the 8,000-strong company. So far the NCU has just over 5 per cent, about 450 members, after meetings for slightly more than half the Mercury offices in the country. Some of the activists, all of whom have been 'outed' to the Mercury management, are fresh to trade unionism but most are old hands. They say that the main recruiting sergeants are job insecurity, the vagueness of disciplinary procedures, and the pay and appraisal system. How do you get the message across? The union targets a Mercury site, writing to every relevant member of staff to inform people of the union's existence, the case for membership, and the date of an informal meeting. This may be accompanied by posters and advertisements in the local media. In Milton Keynes, which has a 1,000-strong Mercury site, and where the union has made one of its biggest pushes, it had advertisements on local radio and in the local press, and an NCU hot air balloon hovering over the town at week-ends. Results have been patchy. In Leeds, where the union had been hoping to do well, it recruited only 18 out of 200 people, while in Southampton it picked up one third of the 60 staff. One cultural problem, say former BT activists, is the much higher proportion of sales staff and lower proportion of technical staff compared with BT. In cable TV, penetration has been lower, with one or two exceptions like Swindon Cable, and the union has scarcely 100 members. The main problem in cable is that the offices are very small and scattered. Partly for that reason it is also targeting the cable employers with a leaflet boasting of the union's political and lobbying influence and stressing that it will not tell companies how to run their business. The theory is that with the union's expertise in employment law, the company is saved the cost of a personnel function. It is a theory that the cable TV companies seem slow to grasp.</p>

He referred to the statement issued  by his government concerning the noncompliance by the United  States with the New York agreement for a global solution of the  nuclear issue.    The document notes that the U.S. attitude has created a  serious situation on the Korean peninsula that can take the  nation to confrontation and war. Taking into account the stand  of the U.S. Administration, Korean officials have decided  unilaterally to cease compliance with the provisions concerning  simultaneous measures; neither will they send a delegation to  the third round of talks with the United States in Geneva.    [Begin Kim Sung-yong recording, in Korean with superimposed  translation into Spanish] As the statement says, we have  fulfilled all our obligations included in the agreement signed  with the United States in New York. But the problem is that the  United States is not fulfilling its task and is putting much  pressure on us. Therefore, we are not sending a delegation to  the third round of talks scheduled for 21 March, and our talks  with South Korea on the exchange of special envoys have also  been suspended. [end recording]    The DPRK and the United States have agreed to fulfill four  simultaneous measures, which are: cancellation of the Team  Spirit-94 joint military maneuvers; resumption of contacts of  experts for the exchange of special envoys between North and  South Korea; inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency intended to provide the continuation of the guarantee;  and, beginning on 21 March, the third round of talks in Geneva.</p>

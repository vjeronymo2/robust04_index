			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Palestinian economic pact ready Palestinian and Israeli economic negotiators yesterday finally completed agreements for implementing their economic protocol that will allow Palestinian agricultural produce to be officially imported into Israel from today for the first time since 1967. Palestinian officials had complained that Israel was dragging its feet in implementing the agreement, signed in Paris three months ago, to put political pressure on the Palestine Liberation Organisation and give it time to take measures to protect Israeli farmers who will be adversely affected by Palestinian competition. Under the protocol, Israel and the PLO agreed to a free movement of agricultural produce except for six goods - poultry, eggs, potatoes, cucumbers, melons and tomatoes - which will be subject to a phased quota over five years. Israel says the delay in implementing the agreement has been the need to agree procedures, license trucks and ensure Palestinian exports were subject to veterinary and plant protection measures, to maintain health standards and prevent the spread of disease. These procedures were finalised yesterday, but Palestinian agricultural negotiators complained Palestinian exporters will be subject to a myriad licenses and inspections. 'We want the trade to be more free,' one Palestinian official said. 'Let Israeli and Palestinian producers compete freely on price and quality. There is still too much bureaucracy.' The two sides also discussed snags in implementing trade, labour, customs and direct taxation provisions of the economic protocol. Implementing the agreement will boost the economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, particularly agriculture, which accounts for 40 per cent of GDP. Before the agreement, Palestinian produce was smuggled into Israel, but only in limited quantities. Yesterday's talks came as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo tried to finalise agreement for the transfer of civilian powers in the West Bank. The two sides are near agreement to transfer authority in five areas - education, health, direct taxation, tourism and social welfare - from the Israeli military-run civil administration to the Palestinian national authority. Once completed, both sides will negotiate a framework for Palestinian elections, due on October 15, and redeployment of Israeli troops out of Palestinian population centres in the West Bank. Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said he expected an agreement on the transfer of powers by next week. But Israeli negotiators said the talks were moving slowly because of concerns over how the Palestinians would pay for the services they are going to take over. An Israeli official said Israel feared a slump in revenues during the transition period, and wanted to ensure enough funds to prevent a decline in services, and social unrest.</p>

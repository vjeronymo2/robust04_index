			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Health targets 'need more work' MORE HARD work will be needed to meet some of the government's Health of the Nation targets, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday. The Health of the Nation strategy is intended to produce measureable improvements in the areas of coronary heart disease and strokes, cancer, mental illness, sexual health and accidents. Mrs Bottomley said that figures for 16 out of 19 targets were moving in the right direction. But this was not the case with obesity, suicide and smoking among young people.</p>

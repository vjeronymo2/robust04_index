			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Crown Communications losses deepen CROWN COMMUNICATIONS, the troubled commercial radio group which owns LBC, has announced that losses are continuing to mount and the company is now seeking to eliminate its problem areas. Crown reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.58m in the six months to March 31. This compared to losses of Pounds 4.68m at the interim stage last time, and losses of Pounds 6.79m in the year to last September. Crown said it is looking for a partner for its stake in RFM, the French radio network. Crown described France as a critical problem. It said RFM's revenue growth had been below expectations and recent audience surveys have shown no improvement. Crown also admitted publicly yesterday for the first time that a preliminary agreement for the sale of three quarters of its 40 per cent stake in Independent Radio News had not been concluded. The company added that discussions on IRN's future were continuing. It is believed however that significant commercial radio groups want to pay a fixed fee for a national news service which could be provided by either Crown, Independent Television News or the Press Association. LBC Radio reduced its operating losses from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 300,000, helped by increased advertising revenue. The other main UK subsidiaries, Business Communications and Independent Radio Sales, were also loss-making. There were exceptional losses of Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 393,000) on the disposal of unspecified investments and terminated contracts. Losses per share totalled 8.3p (7.8p) and again no dividend is being paid. The after-tax loss for the period of Pounds 4.88m will wipe out the proceeds of last October's Pounds 4.5m rights issue.</p>

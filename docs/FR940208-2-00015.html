TGPL intends to use a 75-foot-wide construction right-of-way. About 15 feet of the planned 75-foot width would use existing right-of-way. Consequently, about 60 feet of new clearing would be required in most areas. Following construction, about 35 feet of the construction right-of-way would be allowed to revert to its former land use. In agricultural areas, a 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way is planned in order to segregate topsoil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at road and stream crossings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The EA Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping.'' The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Geology and soils. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vegetation and wildlife. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Endangered and threatened species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Land use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cultural resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Air quality and noise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hazardous waste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Currently Identified Environmental Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the environmental information provided by TGPL. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The loop would cross within 50 feet of 5 residences and a church, and would cross 2 orchards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The pipeline would cross 9 perennial streams, 2 ponds, and 50 wetlands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

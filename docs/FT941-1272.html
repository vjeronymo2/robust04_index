			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Jardine Strategic to delist in Hong Kong at year-end Jardine Strategic, the holding company for many of the Jardine group assets in Hong Kong, yesterday followed Jardine Matheson and said it would cease the trading of its shares at the end of this year. Jardine Strategic, which is 52 per cent owned by Jardine Matheson, holds controlling interests in Dairy Farm, Hongkong Land and Mandarin Oriental. Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, said that with 'change impending in Hong Kong', the company attached great importance to remaining subject 'to a British-based system of securities regulation'. It believes it has achieved this by having the Bermudan government enact laws to bring the company and its subsidiaries under a statutory version of the London takeover code. Jardine does not believe that a level regulatory playing field will prevail in Hong Kong after China resumes sovereignty in 1997. In spite of plans to cease share trading of the group's constituents, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) still claims jurisdiction over the company. The Hong Kong takeovers code is broadly drafted and covers public companies, whether listed or not, which have a large proportion of its shareholders, assets, operations and management in Hong Kong. Jardine has many shareholders in Hong Kong and it is one of the largest non-government employers in the colony. Moreover it derives more than half of its profits from Hong Kong and is operationally controlled from the colony. The SFC's ultimate sanction in Hong Kong is to 'cold shoulder' an individual or company. This means that no financial company would be allowed to act for the company; in addition, the full facilities of Hong Kong's market would be withdrawn. The Jardine group was the object of furious criticism in Hong Kong yesterday for its decision on Wednesday to delist. The 'Princely Hong' was described in the pro-Beijing media as having delivered an 'irresponsible' blow to Hong Kong's status as a financial centre. Many newspapers said that the company had received its come-uppance because the SFC had refused to give it special treatment. As one English-language newspaper noted: 'The bottom line is that Jardines needs Hong Kong more than Hong Kong needs Jardines'. Jardine Matheson's share price fell by HKDollars 1 to Dollars HK48.25 and Hongkong Land's by Dollars HK0.40 to Dollars HK21.40. Overall, the Hang Seng index declined by 1.5 per cent to 9,320.</p>

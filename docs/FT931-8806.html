			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / People: Lloyd brothers divide and rule Lloyds Chemists, Britain's second largest chemists' chain after Boots, has split the role of chairman and chief executive. Allen Lloyd (above left) will remain executive chairman of the highly acquisitive group while his younger brother, Peter Lloyd (above right), who is currently director of retail operations, takes over as chief executive. Separately Sir Eric Pountain, non-executive chairman of Tarmac, the construction group, IMI and James Beattie, was named as Lloyds' third non-executive director. The boardroom changes, which had been foreshadowed in recent comments made by Allen Lloyd, mean that the structure of the board now follows the Cadbury recommendations. Institutional investors are understood to have commented on the desirability of strengthening the board and splitting the chairman and chief executive's roles in the wake of Lloyds Chemists' recent rapid growth. Last March Lloyds overtook its rival Macarthy. Commenting on the changes, Allen Lloyd said: 'After 20 years building the business, I believe now is the appropriate time to strengthen the board and split the roles of chairman and chief executive.' Peter Lloyd joined the group in 1978 as financial controller and was appointed to the board in 1979. For the past two years he has assumed much of the work of chief executive, leaving his brother to concentrate on broad strategic issues. Sir Eric will join Lloyds Chemists' two existing non-executive directors, Tim Brooks and Paul Byrne, on the board and will also be a member of the audit and remuneration committees.</p>

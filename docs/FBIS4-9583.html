			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(r)": "Jozef Moravcik's Government Is Trusted </F> by 54 Percent of Slovak Citizens"]    [Text] Bratislava--The regular monitoring of public opinion  in April 1994, conducted by the Slovak Republic's Statistical  Office, mainly focused on the new Slovak Government headed by  Josef Moravcik. It monitored the expectations of the citizens  regarding the work of the new Cabinet and, at the same time,  paid attention to President Kovac's address to parliament in  March. We present a comparison between the trust of the people  in the former and the current governments.  <H5>  Trust in Meciar's Government in the First 10 Days of March </H5> 1994    A total of 34 percent trusted the government (11 percent  trusted it fully, and 23 percent were inclined to trust it  rather than distrust it).    A total of 55 percent did not trust the government (22  percent were inclined to distrust it rather then trust it, and  33 percent did not trust it at all).    A total of 11 percent did not know.  <H5>  Trust in Moravcik's Government in the First 10 Days of April </H5> 1994    A total of 54 percent trusted the government (22 percent  trusted it fully, and 32 percent were inclined to trust it  rather than distrust it).    A total of 39 percent distrusted the government (22 percent  were inclined to distrust it rather than trust it, and 17  percent did not trust it at all).    A total of 7 percent did not know.    Trust in the current government Cabinet increases with the  level of education (the government is trusted by 70 percent of  people with a university education, 61 percent with a high  school education, 53 percent with vocational training, and 46  percent with only the basic education). Most entrepreneurs and  employees have a favorable opinion of Moravcik's government,  while workers and the unemployed have a less favorable opinion.</p>

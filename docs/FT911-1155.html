			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Poland takes on Swarzedz debt THE SWARZEDZ Furniture Factory, whose shares are to go on sale on May 20 in Poland's next privatisation, has had 66bn zlotys (Dollars 7.1m) worth of bank debt and outstanding payments to the Treasury taken off its books by the government. Swarzedz has also been implementing management advice from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate, which has been responsible for the sale since last summer. This and the debt assumption are some of the novel features in the sale which show that the government has learned from the experience of selling the first five companies last autumn. Then, a failure by private investors to take up the offer in three cases forced the authorities to turn to state sector institutions at the last minute to take up the slack. Now the state still directly or indirectly holds a majority share in both the Tonsil electronics works and the Krosno glass factory. In the latest offer, four state-owned banks, including the new Polish Development Bank, have agreed to underwrite the 1.9m Swarzedz shares expected to go on sale at a price of 50,000 zlotys each. In all, the privatisation sees the sale of 2.5m shares worth 125bn zlotys. Some 100,000 shares have been set aside for former owners whose workshops were nationalised after the Second World War to lay the foundation for the present plant which employs 3,200. Last year, the company exported three-quarters of its output. Export orders were worth USDollars 23m. Some 25bn zlotys of the proceeds from the sale will be ploughed back into Swarzedz rather than being paid into the Treasury, as happened with the entire proceeds of the first five privatisations. A large part of the sale is to be conducted on a first-come, first-served basis which, according to IFC, should cut delays at bank counters which plagued the initial privatisation.</p>

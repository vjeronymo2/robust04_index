			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Observer staff to sue over takeover THE OBSERVER newspaper and the government are being taken to court over the failure to consult workers about the Sunday newspaper's takeover by The Guardian. The GPMU print union, which represents about 35 Observer staff, believes that the takeover could become a test case for the European Community Acquired Rights Directive, which requires worker representatives to be consulted in some mergers. When the directive was translated into domestic law - as the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations - it was stated that only workers in recognised unions need be consulted. That means that in the UK workers who are not in unions or, as at the Observer, are in unions not recognised by the company, are not consulted. The GPMU says the failure to introduce broader consultation procedure is unlawful. The GPMU case against the Observer will also seek more compensation for staff who were not consulted about the merger, some of whom have lost their jobs as a result.</p>

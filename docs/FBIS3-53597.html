This  requires that the world trade system have fair and humanitarian  criteria to guarantee the right of both states and individuals.    The tour by the U.S. commerce secretary to a number of  states  in the region provides evidence of the joint desire to achieve  the expected results concerning the forms of regional trade,  especially since this tour coincided with important meetings in  Geneva and came on the eve of another very important meeting,  expected to be held in Washington in the next few days between  His Majesty King Husayn and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    The visit by the U.S. commerce secretary has raised many  concerns, not only about the future of the regional trade links  in the age of the desired peace, but also about the current  situation in Jordan's only seaport. The partial siege imposed  by the U.S. Navy on al-'Aqabah still stands, making our country  suffer losses which it cannot put up with forever.    The U.S. secretary did well when he showed an understanding  of the Jordanian viewpoint about the losses resulting from the  continued sea siege of al-'Aqabah. It is, however, regrettable  to say that the U.S. commerce secretary is not the first U.S.  official to show such an understanding and to promise, like the  visiting secretary has done, to discuss this issue with the  competent U.S. authorities to ease these unjustified measures,  which have remained unchanged.    In the light of all this, we hope the new promise made by  the  U.S. secretary will mark the end of a series of promises which  do not have any real weight now that the siege on al-'Aqabah has  been going on for more than three years. During this time the  Jordanian national economy has suffered additional losses which  have exacerbated the economic difficulties Jordan has been  facing since the second Gulf war.</p>

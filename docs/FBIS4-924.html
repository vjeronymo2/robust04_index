			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Office of the President of KwaZulu </F> on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 19 April]    [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] Central Committee  decided at a meeting held on Sunday the 17th April 1994 that it  would contest the elections at the national and provincial  levels if amendments to the constitution could be made to secure  the Kingdom of KwaZulu and the future role of His Majesty, the  king of the Zulus as a constitutional monarch.    The decision of the Central Committee was further made  conditional upon the final formulations for provisions for the  existence of the Zulu Kingdom and the role of His Majesty being  agreed to through mediation.    In a series of meetings which took place on Sunday, Monday  and today final agreement was reached securing the Kingdom of  KwaZulu and the role of His Majesty. I therefore am pleased to  announce that the Inkatha Freedom Party will contest elections  at the national and the provincial levels.    The entry of the IFP into national and regional levels will  be made possible by suitable amendments to ballot papers and  there will be certain relaxations to the procedures laid down  for the registration of parties and the publication of electoral  lists. I am pleased to announce that the TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] and the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission] have promised their full co-operation to make the  IFP's entry into elections possible.    The Inkatha Freedom Party has decided to make the kind of  compromises which will make its entry into elections possible in  order to avoid a great deal more bloodshed and carnage which we  have been witness to in recent months.    Only the IFP held firm to principles right until the very  last moment and did everything in its power to eliminate the  very worst elements of the 1993 constitution. The best in the  constitution can be attributed to the IFP's interventions and  the long struggle it waged to ensure that the country benefited  from a constitution which will lay the foundations for a  democratic future.    Central to the IFP's concerns were the need to ensure viable  regional government with the minimum interference by the state.  It is to this end that the IFP finally managed to negotiate a  secure role for His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the  guarantee of the future existence of the Zulu Kingdom.    In securing these things the IFP has guaranteed that  provincialism in the kwaZulu-Natal province will set standards  which other provinces will be encouraged to adopt in their own  search for their provincial constitutional futures.    The IFP had previously succeeded in securing amendments to  the 1993 constitution which will enable provinces to adopt  constitutions of their own choice. The IFP also secured the  right of provinces to adopt constitutions which will not be  confined by the structures laid down for provinces in the 1993  constitution.    The IFP's negotiation victory in securing the role of His  Majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the continued existence  of the Kingdom of kwaZulu is therefore a victory for the  principle of self- determination from which the whole country  will benefit.    I wish to convey my deep gratitude to Professor Washington  Okumu for the role he played in making it possible to reach the  agreement which will result in the IFP entering elections. He  was an additional appointment as adviser to the international  mediating team and remained on in South Africa when the other  mediators left for their various international destinations. It  was his personal intervention which made the final negotiation  breakthrough possible.    When my spirits were down after the international mediation  had been aborted, and I was leaving Johannesburg for Ulundi on  Friday, April 15, I received a message at the airport from  Professor Washington Okumu that he wanted to meet me at the  airport and would be there in 20 minutes.    I have known Professor Okumu for more than 20 years having  met him at a prayer breakfast in Washington and we have kept in  touch on the basis of Christian fellowship.    I waited at Lanseria Airport for as long as I could on the  morning of April 15th for Professor Okumu but as two of my  colleagues had an appointment with His Majesty the king I had to  leave. However, the aircraft has been air-borne for only a few  minutes when I was told there was a problem and we had to turn  back.    Fortunately Professor Okumu was still there and I said that  it was as though God has prevented me from leaving, and I was  there like Jonah brought back. I told Professor Okumu that my  forced return was a God-send.    He insisted that everything should be done to try and see if  lost mediation could be retrieved and that I should do  everything I could to negotiate even at this late hour the IFP's  participation in elections.    I shared with Professor Okumu the IFP's problems--the fact  that the IFP took a decision not to participate because of its  serious concerns regarding His Majesty the king which had not  been met, and that I could not disregard that. If I did so, I  would be committing treason.    Professor Okumu said that everything notwithstanding, he was  going to see Mr Mandela, whom he has known a long time as well  as President de Klerk.    I had hardly arrived back in Ulundi on Friday when Professor  Okumu telephoned and said he had been in touch with the  government who said they were quite prepared to look at the  concerns I expressed. Professor Okumu was very firm and said I  should telephone the state president at 3 o'clock that afternoon.    Before I did so, the state president telephoned and asked me  what it was I wanted to say to him. I said that I gathered from  Professor Okumu that he wanted to talk to me and I gave him the  background. The state president told me that the issue of the  IFP's participation was sympathetically looked at by the  government. They were prepared to look at participation on a  regional level but I told the state president that there was no  way the IFP would participate at regional level only--the IFP  had support all over South Africa. The state president said he  was quite prepared to look at the possibilities.    I said the only way this could be done was if the issue of  His Majesty the king was addressed. The state president said a  special session of Parliament could be called to effect  amendments to the 1993 constitution. I reminded the state  president that His Majesty said he wanted matters dealt with  before elections.    On Saturday Professor Okumu telephoned again. On Sunday we  met in Durban where we both were attending the Jesus rally  organised by Africa Enterprise. Professor Okumu gave me a draft  of a proposed agreement which could be entered into between  myself, the president of the ANC and the South African  Government. The draft incorporated many of the answers to our  needs and I gave my provisional approval to it.    Professor Okumu said he was flying to Cape Town to talk to  Mr  Mandela. I showed the draft to Mr Jacob Zuma and Minister Danie  Schutte who were also at the rally, before I put it before the  Central Committee&amp;because that is the way I exercise my  leadership--referring all crucial matters to the Central  Committee which is the final decision-making body between  general conferences.    By arrangement with the state president I met him in  Pretoria  yesterday the 18th April. I was pleasantly surprised to find  the draft agreement had been shown to Mr Mandela who said he  wanted to study it for clarification.    After further negotiations the draft agreement with the  necessary amendments was accepted by myself, Mr Mandela and Mr  de Klerk.    I wish to pay tribute to Professor Okumu. He is a really  remarkable man who studied under Dr Kissinger at Harvard. I pay  tribute to the shuttle diplomacy he initiated and what has been  achieved through it.    I wish also to pay tribute to both President FW de Klerk and  Mr Mandela for the fact that they were receptive to the  suggestions made to the three of us by Professor Okumu.    I believe that as a result of the signing of this memorandum  of understanding, South Africa may well have been saved from  disastrous consequences of unimaginable proportions and has been  put on a course which I hope will lead to longlasting peace,  democracy and meaningful federalism.</p>

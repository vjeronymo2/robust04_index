			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates steady MONEY market rates held steady during thin trading, with the City's books well balanced and interest diverted by a Pounds 2.75bn auction in the gilts market yesterday. The Bank of England's initial forecast shortage was very low at Pounds 350m and principally made up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing assistance, which was expected to drain Pounds 284m from the system. The forecast was later moved down to Pounds 150m, with the Bank making barely any move to cover it. It bought only Pounds 12m of short-term band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent in the morning. The Bank also provided late assistance of Pounds 40m. Late assistance is often used as a device to control the activities of the commercial banks and can carry a tough interest rate which is never declared. However, the Bank of England indicated that in yesterday's case, as the shortage was so low, it was merely used to bail out banks which had belatedly realised they were short of cash. The City was well balanced for cash yesterday and money rates barely moved. The key three-month rate eased one tick to 10 1/32 per cent, while the overnight rate moved between a low of 9 3/4 to a high of 11 per cent and closed at 10 5/16 . Dealers said the rates were under pressure for technical reasons and could be expected to ease slightly across the board, perhaps to around 9 15/16 per cent by the end of the month after a number of banks, particularly Japanese houses, had paid up their roll-over money. However, they added that any easing was unlikely to signal an imminent cut in interest rates. Prospects of a cut were knocked back after Germany announced a higher than expected money supply growth figure on Tuesday. Short futures held up following Tuesday's slide and the successful auction yesterday morning of Pounds 2.75bn of gilts. The auction was well covered, and September gilt futures were strong after the auction with more than 53,000 lots dealt. The sterling contract for September settlement saw nearly 10,600 lots traded, against Tuesday's 21,623, and it recovered two points to close at 90.18. However, the general mood was summed up by one trader who said: 'It is dullsville out there again.'</p>

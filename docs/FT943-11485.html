			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Futures take fright A further sharp fall in sterling futures, on fears of an interest rate tightening, dominated markets yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. Volumes were very large, with both the September and December Eurosterling contracts trading more than 50,000 lots. December settled 13 basis points down at 93.54, showing that the market is discounting short-term rates of 6.5 per cent by the year-end, compared to 5.25 per cent presently. Most analysts agree that the market is not reflecting economic fundamentals, but investors have been scared into selling by the poor sentiment in the market. The pattern of options activity suggests that many investors sold against their better judgment. Activity on the foreign exchanges was fairly subdued, with the lira still dominating most of the headlines. Worries about the possibility of the government falling saw the currency drop to an 18-month low of L1,011.50 against the D-Mark before recovering to close in London at L1,005. A firmer US Treasury bond market, and short-covering ahead of today's second-quarter GDP figures, and the weekend trade talks with Japan, helped the dollar rise. Yesterday evening it was trading at Y99.50 and DM1.5885. The trade weighted sterling index ended slightly firmer at 78.8, from 78.6, while the D-Mark was fairly steady in Europe. The French franc ignored a cut in the intervention rate to 5 per cent from 5.10 per cent to close at FFr3.415 per D-Mark from FFr3.417. Dealers were mystified by the bearish interest rate sentiment which has seen the December short sterling contract shed 34 basis points in two days without any new information to trade off. Sentiment remained very nervous and the market was awash with rumours. At various times, a gilt-edged market maker, a merchant bank and a clearing bank were all rumoured to be in trouble. The market also seemed unable to shake off the strange tale of the nameless Tory Euro MP alleged, on Wednesday, to have called for higher interest rates. No explanation was offered as to why this should have interested the market, save that it came the day before the monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, described the short sterling move as 'wholly out of line with the likely prospect for interest rates'. He added that only once in the last 18 years had rates been raised in August, and that was in 1987, just ahead of the stock market crash. Commenting on the movements in Eurosterling, Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said: 'A lot of people who were sitting on positions perceived the risk of a rate hike and were forced to liquidate their positions against their better judgment.' Two bits of evidence support this conclusion. First, the large volume in the September contract. Dealers normally trade in the most liquid contract, currently December. The large volumes in September suggest that people were liquidating positions, rather than simply trading. Second, many investors seemed to be buying options to reflect the underlying positions they had been forced out of. Short sterling options activity was very heavy, with most at the strike price of 94.50 and 94.75. This suggests that investors believe the September contract will close considerably higher than the 94.28 where the contract ended yesterday. Mr Phillips said a lot of investors had been looking at the Clarke-George meeting 'for the pre-emptive rate hike that many in the market are now forecasting'. Trade was fairly brisk as many who sold on Wednesday were happy to buy back yesterday at lower prices. The bearish sentiment in the futures market was at odds with developments in the cash market. After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1bn, the Bank of England provided a Pounds 750m round of early assistance at the established rate of 5 5/32 per cent - Pounds 23m outright, and a Pounds 727m repo facility. Mr Philip Shaw, economist at Union Discount, said the combination of an early round of assistance and the repo implied that the Bank 'was trying to be helpful'. He said that the message was of 'unchanged rates for the time being'. He predicted, though, that with renewed speculation about rates, the Bank's early morning operations would be watched more closely in the days ahead. Analysts said the firmer dollar reflected technical rather than fundamental factors. The US currency was trading at DM1.5890 in the New York afternoon, more than two pfennigs up from its European low of DM1.5660. It finished the New York session at Y100.05 and DM1.5915. Mr Steve Barrow, analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said the market seemed still to be taking its lead from the bond market. He said the overall attitude remained bearish, but the short-covering rally suggests some in the market see a greater risk in the short term of a rally rather than a fall.</p>

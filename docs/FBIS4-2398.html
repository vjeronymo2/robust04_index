			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 9 (CNS) -- According to relevant  departments, China will formulate a law to standardize  government purchasing.    Purchasing by government includes the purchasing and leasing  of equipment or projects and various related services by  government organs and their subordinate units as well as by  state-owned enterprises using public funds. There are several  reasons for the legislating of this law. First, the purchasing  of equipment by government with public funds can guarantee the  construction of the state's key projects, make the most  reasonable use of public funds and assure the preservation of  value and increase of state-owned assets. Second, it is aimed  at implementing the socialist market economy and introducing the  competition mechanism into government purchasing in a bid to  raise transparency and practising an open, equal and fair means  of purchasing through public bidding. Third, the invitation of  tenders can put government officials' behaviour under public  supervision to avoid corruption. Fourth, the implementation of  public bidding is beneficial to the orderly development of  internal and international trade, offering opportunities to  domestic and foreign businessmen. Fifth, the practice of public  bidding make possible the keeping of enterprises' behaviour  under legislative control, a move beneficial to enterprise  self-construction. And sixth, the law will have a broad  influence in socialist market legislation and great significance  for the improvement of economic legislation in the country.</p>

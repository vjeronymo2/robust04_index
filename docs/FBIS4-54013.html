			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the </F> Democratic Socialist Party, by an unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN  reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Diet is resuming. What is  your party's basic position?    [Yonezawa] The coalition has turned into a minority  government. We are in a difficult situation. The ruling and  opposition parties may hold differing views on the issues of  economic, administrative, and political reform, but they have a  common understanding that these issues need to be addressed.  Some people are talking about introducing in the Diet of a  motion of no-confidence in the cabinet, but the thinking that  "you must quit because you are a minority" is absurd.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] came up  with the idea of forming the parliamentary group "Kaishin" which  consequently caused the coalition to be driven into a minority.  Don't you feel responsible for it?    [Yonezawa] During the eight-month-long Hosokawa government,  we came to see the importance of all coalition parties being  unified as colleagues in the same coalition. That is how we  came to present the idea. We thought the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] did not object to the idea. Timing, or  maybe the procedure for presenting it, could have been wrong.  Anyway, it is regrettable that the idea caused displeasure. We  thought only simply, "New Party Sakigake [Harbinger], the SDPJ,  and Komeito can join us as they please." We had not anticipated  this reaction.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] We see your party is moving toward  cooperating with the Japan New Party [JNP].    [Yonezawa] It is reported that the voices calling for  dissolution of "Kaishin" are pouring out even in the Japan New  Party. Meanwhile, relations between that party and the DSP are  fairly good. I think it would be good for the two parties to  build trust between them through regular policy discussions and  other events. If it develops into a possibility of forming a  new party, that will have to be dealt with only in a party  congress. So, the relationship can develop into a sort of joint  floor group. All this needs to be discussed further, and I don't  know what will happen. But anyway the JNP is a partner with  which friendly relations will be maintained.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the departure of the SDPJ  from the coalition has resulted in a tripolar political  structure [the political world divided into "Kaishin, the  Liberal Democratic Party, and the SDPJ]. But what do you think  about the liberals in the SDPJ and the DSP?    [Yonezawa] Regarding the political world reorganization,  some people talk about the two-party system, some about a  tripolar system, and some about a multiparty system. That is  something which only the people should decide. But if a  single-seat district electoral system were to be adopted,  normally what would happen is that the politicians choose and  fight for one of two political axes. I wonder if the framework  of the SDPJ and the DSP is sufficient to be one of the two axes.  I can understand the ongoing political current that shows the  people who have opposed the LDP now want to develop into a  policy-oriented force. But I still don't see what kind of  political reorganization the liberals have in their minds or  what policy lines they want to follow.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How does your party plan to deal with the  issues of tax reform and the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear  development program?    [Yonezawa] To fix and retain tax reductions as a permanent  thing and to expand domestic demand in this country can be said  to be our international commitment. If we do not carry out tax  reform, that will impact the world economy adversely, too. On  the other hand, indirect taxes are a kind of costs for  participating in society. Without the indirect taxes, we cannot  make the ends of national treasury meet. As far as the North  Korean question is concerned, the government's responsibility is  to do thorough work on rules and laws. The expression --  legislation for emergencies -- may not be appropriate, but we  need to have discussions completed. I have no choice but to  object to the view that not even discussions are necessary.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your stand on the manner in which  the next election should be conducted?    [Yonezawa] It is only natural that the next general election  should be conducted under the new system. SDPJ Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama suggested holding talks to see whether the  next election should be held under the medium electoral district  system. That is a most conservative view. Holding an election  under the medium electoral system means destroying the political  reform altogether, and the people of the nation will not permit  such a thing to happen. The bill on electoral district zoning  should be discussed without delay. Fighting the next general  election under the small district system -- even if it means  shortening the duration of public announcement -- is the only  way to complete political reform.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the voices of criticism  raised against Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa?    [Yonezawa] I have never felt they were high-handed or pushy.  There may be problems with the mass news media which are playing  up stories on the so-called "Ichi-Ichi duo"?    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] We sometimes see differences of view in  remarks made by DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and you, the secretary  general.    [Yonezawa] The DSP is a party where there are so many views.  If the two people spoke the same words on every issue, I don't  think you would like it at all.</p>

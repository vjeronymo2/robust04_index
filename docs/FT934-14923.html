			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Pirates who walk the plank - Philip Rawstorne reports on the relentless pursuit by companies of brand counterfeiters Nothing demonstrates the value of brands more clearly than the frequency with which they are copied and counterfeited around the world by fly-by-night operators in search of a quick profit. International Distillers and Vintners (IDV), the drinks subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan, has taken action against about 50 brand pirates in its international markets during the past year. There are eight lawsuits under way involving infringements of its Smirnoff vodka brand alone. Guinness's United Distillers, in relentless pursuit of counterfeiters of its Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky, has also stamped on the creators of such copy-cat brands as Johnnie Hawker, Joe Worker and Johnny Black. Hiram Walker, the Allied-Lyons drinks company, has quashed attempts to cash in on the reputation of its Ballantine's Scotch whisky in export markets by brands called Ballentye's and Ballantia. Two court cases are pending involving its brands in the UK. 'A brand is costly to create and establish, but can be very easy and profitable to copy,' says Michael Leathes, legal director of IDV. 'Brands are our most important assets. Through them we communicate the quality of our products to consumers. They represent a huge investment of time, effort and money, that can be diluted, weakened, even destroyed by those who copy them. 'Counterfeits or imitations can be sold cheaper. Their producers do not have to spend on advertising and marketing. Nor do they have to bother about the quality of the drink or the packaging. We have to be rigorous in the protection of our brands against the damage that copies can do to them.' Brand counterfeiting - the creation of facsimiles - is a criminal offence in most countries in which the drinks groups operate, and once the counterfeiters are identified is relatively easy to stop. At the other extreme, agreed settlements can usually be quickly reached on unintentional infringements. Inver House, an independent Scotch whisky distiller, recently changed the name of its Knockdhu malt whisky brand to Cnoc to avoid an identity clash with IDV's Knockando. The main problems arise from imitations which deliberately seek to deceive consumers by suggesting an affinity with a leading brand: using a similar name, or similar designs and colours in their bottles and labels. Smirnoff's imitators, with names such as Smirnovskaya, Romanoff and Selikoff, have appeared in look-alike bottles, with labels featuring the crown, shields and other designs associated with the original. The success of another IDV brand, Bailey's Irish Cream liqueur, has encouraged the illegal production of a host of copies, including Bailes, Teleys and Raylas, all in squat brown bottles with pastoral scenes incorporated into the labels. Rip-off artists have translated Ouzo 12 into Ouzo 21, J &amp; B Scotch into M &amp; B, and Malibu coconut liqueur into Marabou. United Distillers discovered that its Gordon's gin suddenly had a new competitor labelled Garden's gin, and that in some markets its White Horse whisky brand was facing creations called Black Horse and White Housie. Tia Maria, Hiram Walker's coffee liqueur, has been a popular target for imitations. The fakes, disguised by almost identical packaging, have included Zia Marina, Tia Lia and Bella Maria. As a Canadian court recently affirmed, the 'trade dress' of a product is entitled to legal protection. Competitors cannot trade on the distinctive identity of a rival brand. All the leading drinks companies have specialist departments to counter such exploitation. Leathes sums up the general policy for dealing with offenders. 'We stamp on them as hard as we can. Our aim is to hurt those responsible as much as possible. Tough action deters others.' Trademark infringements are civil offences. 'We sue first and talk later,' he says. 'We demand damages to cover loss of profit and reputation.' In Spain last year, a court awarded multi-million dollar damages against the producer of a Bailey's look-alike product. Earlier this year, a Netherlands company was ordered by a St Petersburg court to destroy 100,000 bottles of its Smirnovskaya vodka and pay substantial costs and damages. An Italian producer of 'Gilbert's gin' was forced to change the name and the design of its labels which bore a resemblance to those of Gilbey's gin. Apart from paying costs, it has to obtain IDV's approval for its future labels. It sometimes proves difficult to gather enough evidence to take offenders to court. Rogue drinks producers rarely keep records and often move their activities from one shell company to another. Solving such problems requires a more unconventional approach. Corporate investigation agencies, such as London-based Carratu International, are called in to uncover the people behind the scam. 'Their inquiries often enable us to bring pressure to bear on the offenders in other ways,' says Leathes. 'They may uncover other offences that interest the police or tax authorities, find evidence that enables us to sue personally the directors of a rogue company, perhaps to sequestrate their homes or other property.' Steve Smith, Carratu's managing director, says that protection of brands now accounts for a large part of the agency's work. 'Drinks brands are a popular target now in the Commonwealth of Independent States and other eastern European countries,' he says. 'Imitation products, usually two or three container loads at a time, are being shipped there from the Netherlands and Germany in particular.' But fake products continue to appear in many markets from southern Europe to the Pacific Rim and Latin America. Inadequate legal frameworks in several countries add to the difficulties of enforcing the protection of trademarks. Leathes would like to see the European Community reinforce brand owners' security as the US has done - by making trademark protection an essential part of its trade agreements with other countries.</p>

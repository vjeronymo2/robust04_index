			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--In his interview  with LOS TIEMPOS Quiroga explained that the new strategy which  was presented for the consideration of the international  community in Washington seeks to consolidate two things. First,  balancing alternative development with drug interdiction.  Secondly, beginning in 1994, implementing the "zero option,"  that is, eliminating root and branch all "excess" plantings of  coca leaves.    He said: "What we did during this first phase of the meeting  of the Consultative Group of the World Bank for Bolivia was to  ask for resources to study the feasibility or lack of it of this  alternative."    In referring to the so-called "zero option" the minister  indicated that this alternative has the objectives of completely  eliminating excess plantings of coca leaves, seeking to  industrialize the production areas, and promoting true centers  of social and economic development in the Chapare and Yungas  areas. Furthermore, it has the objective of providing an  opportunity to productive peasant farmers "to choose the best  alternative which suits their interests."    He pointed out: "We brought this kind of proposal to the  international community and we are only waiting for an answer,  which we consider will be positive, to begin studying the ways  and means which could be used for the proper functioning of this  strategy for the integrated development of the Chapare and  Yungas areas."    According to Minister Quiroga, the total cost of the "zero  option" will be about $1.2 billion. It has been provisionally  estimated that its implementation, which is not a short- or  medium-term matter, will take six years after the program is  approved.    He said: "The first stage will cover studies for project  implementation, which will require the expenditure of $100  million to complete. The second phase is closely related to  practical implementation of the program in the producing areas,  with investments in the order of $900 million."    He noted: "This new proposal was developed to deal with  inconsistencies in alternative development programs in the  Chapare area of the Department of Cochabamba and the meager,  positive results from their implementation five years ago."    As an example of the defects in these past programs he  pointed out that in the Ivigarzama area a considerable number of  plantings of coca leaves was eliminated. However, the programs  and strategies of alternative development were not even "30  percent implemented."</p>

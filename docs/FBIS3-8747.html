			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Snezana Beric: "Mandator Will Be Discussed at </F> the Next Meeting of the Parliament"]    [Text] Borovo Selo, 9 Mar -- "I shall try once more to  reach an agreement with both the coalition and other leaders of  the parliamentary parties, in order to find a solution for a new  mandator in the government of the republic of Serbian Krajina  [RSK]. I shall not give up my intention to find a man who is a  successful businessman, capable of organizing things well, who  works 24 hours a day, and to whom the doors of both the FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and the Srpska republic are  wide open.    "I already have an idea who that man could be, but I am not  going to name him, not yet. But the problem is that he will  hardly pass, given such a constellation of forces in the  assembly. At the next meeting of the assembly I shall officially  put him in for the mandator. The coalition in Krajina's assembly  is pushing Milan Babic for the mandator, but he does not meet  any of the criteria for that position, and I shall not accept  that at any price." Milan Martic, president of the RSK, stated  this to POLITIKA yesterday.  <H5>  Subversive Behavior of Coalition </H5>   Yesterday President Martic visited first the community of  Mirkovci and the oil industries of Krajina, and then in Borovo  Selo he held a working meeting with the representatives of the  communities of Slavonia, Baranja, and western Srem, as well as  with the representatives of the Serbian army of Krajina and the  police. As Martic informed us, the collective conclusion made by  all the participants was that local interests must not be placed  ahead of state interests, since Krajina is defended by defending  each of its regions, so it is necessary to make the things work  in such a way that, in the case of aggression in one of  Krajina's regions, the military potentials in other parts are  automatically activated.    "We have to understand that none of the communities is  capable of being a state for itself, and defending itself  alone," Martic says.    The president of Krajina spoke most about the recent events  with regard to the election of the mandator of the Krajina  government, and with regard to trends in the Krajina assembly.  According to Martic, the artificially formed coalition in the  Krajina assembly is doing a great harm to the state, while  certain individuals are trying to get to power because of their  own interests and revanchism toward Serbia, and given such  goals, they want to make a weapon out of the people and use it  against Serbia. "In the Krajina assembly that coalition is  violating the constitutional principles, the assembly's boards  want to exert the pressure on the government, strip it of its  authorizations, and start governing the country by their own  rules. Negative consequences of such a behavior can already be  felt in the defense system as well, since the laws have been  urgently changed following the decisions by those boards,  without asking the government for opinion," Martic claims.    "I am determined to prevent that. I am still making efforts  to find solutions to make the coalition come to its senses, and  to prevent placing the petty partisan and individual interests,  particularly by some individuals from Babic's Serbian Democratic  Party [SDS] of Krajina, ahead of the state interests. None of  them ran in the elections with a platform promising the collapse  of the state. The fact is that they were promising prosperity  and the strengthening of the state, and for that reason the  people voted for them. However, now they are behaving  absolutely subversively.    "If they continue that way, I will have to use my  constitutional and legal authorizations to prevent that.  According to those authorizations I am allowed to dissolve the  assembly in compliance with the requirements of the state of  war. That is the last measure I would want to apply, but if I  were forced to do that, I would do it. Because the way they are  behaving in the assembly surpasses the way in which the Croatian  Democratic Community treated the SDS in former Croatia. The  only goal of theirs is to attain power, and to turn my role into  one matching the role of the queen of England. What they are  doing in the assembly is definitely the subversion of the  state," Martic claims.   <H5>    The Krajina Socialists Have Been Asked for Support </H5>   "Everything that is happening in the Krajina assembly, and  the subversive conduct by the coalition, is orchestrated by  Babic," Martic alleges. The situation will depend on how strong  the other parliamentary parties and independent candidates are  to bring such subversive conduct to an end. Martic met with the  representatives of the Serbian Party of the Socialists of  Krajina, and asked them for help and support.    According to Martic, the following important task is the  strengthening of the legal system. Martic promised that all  those who committed wrongdoings that have weakened the economic  power of the state, as well as other sorts of wrongdoings, will  have to be brought to trial regardless of who they are or what  function they are performing. As he pointed out, police  inspectors and financial police have already started  investigations. Martic maintains that the republic of Serbian  Krajina has actually never seceded from Yugoslavia. "It is our  task to establish everlasting connections with the FRY, and to  join it as a stable state. In order for us to achieve that, the  control of the state and of collective assets must be  intensified.    "In a day or two I will issue a decree, an order on  compulsory work in all the firms in Krajina. We shall introduce  a slight form of centralization, in order to concentrate the  control over all the assets in one place, and to improve the  apportionment of those assets," Martic says.    According to Martic, at today's meeting, and also at a  meeting of the Supreme Defense Council, an agreement on the  Serbian army of Krajina has been reached.    "The burden of war must be equally carried by all of us, and  for that reason we have to put an end to war profiteering.  Therefore we need a higher degree of state control. Because of  my ideas some people say that I want to establish a police-run  state. That is not true. My ideas are only about having a  greater degree of discipline, about having a slight degree of  centralization of assets, and the introduction of discipline at  all levels. Anarchy leads into disaster, and I am not going to  allow that," Martic stresses.</p>

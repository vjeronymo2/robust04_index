			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 15, 4-10 Apr 94] </F>   [Text] According to the State Committee for Nuclear Power  Utilization, in March 1994, Ukraine's five NPP's [nuclear power  plants] operated 14 power generating units (12.8 million kW  aggregate capacity), which generated 7,247.4 MWe [expansion  unknown], or 39.26 per cent of Ukraine's total electricity  generation. The plan was thus fulfilled by 104.9 per cent.    However, technical faults and failures resulted in 113.43  MWe  undergenerated. 885.6 MWe were lost as a result of reducing  capacities' output.    Over the month period, 15 incidents were registered, none of  which, as experts maintain, involved radiation emissions in  excess of acceptable rates.    The Zaporozhye NPP was the main culprit of reduced  generation  (a 673.6 MWe loss) with its 3d and 4th power generating units  undergoing maintenance.    The Khmelnitsky NPP's 1st power generating unit was  undergoing repair, too, same as the Rivne nuke's 1st unit (since  February). The Chernobyl NPP's 3d power generating unit was  stopped on 2 April for repair, which is scheduled to last until  16 April.</p>

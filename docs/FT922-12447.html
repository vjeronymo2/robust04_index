			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Worcester There is something rather curious about Bosch's agreed Pounds 72m takeover of Worcester Group. A historic multiple of 22 might seem generous enough for a maker of central heating boilers. But Worcester is recovering rapidly from recession, and its own brokers expect earnings growth of over 20 per cent this year and over 30 per cent next. The 225p offer is only 20 per cent above the previous market price, which seems a meagre premium given the obvious benefits from putting the UK's and Germany's leading boiler makers together. Even odder is the fact that Worcester's management will be bought out of its 32 per cent holding in four years, at a price up to 75 per cent higher than outside shareholders are being offered. Granted, the price could also be much lower, depending on results. But the outside holders are being paid according to Worcester's past performance. The management will be paid according to the benefits derived from synergies with Bosch. Since Bosch already has control, there seems little to be done about the situation. It leaves a sour taste all the same.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Grigoriy Selyaninov: "The New Turns Out To Be </F> the Old That Has Not Yet Been Forgotten"]    [Text] The priorities in Russia's relations with the CIS  countries become obsolete faster than they are formulated. From  the president's message to parliament one could draw the  conclusion that the integrationalists were gaining the upper  hand in Russia, and the policies of the Burbulis-Gaydar cabinet  were becoming a thing of the past. Then came the Gazprom [Gas  Industry Concern] demarche (KOMMERSANT wrote about it on 3  March), which put both Ukraine and Belarus in an extraordinarily  difficult economic position. Yesterday daily gas deliveries were  already cut in half, and today, despite Kiev's statement of its  willingness to begin payments as of 5 March, Gazprom is  promising to shut the valve altogether. The duality of Russian  positions is also reflected in the epic of the unification of  the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus.    The Russian government's positions are dualistic in terms of  both internal economic policy and the building of an economic  union within the CIS framework. The only common feature appears  to be the fact that one thing is stated while something entirely  different happens in practice. Promises to repay debts to the  budget-financed sector, the military-industrial complex and the  agroindustrial complex are accompanied by a harsh criticism of  the budget, while the Ministry of Finance's version of the  budget is based on extremely strict criteria. Contacts with the  former fraternal republics appear the same way: Viktor  Chernomyrdin holds a semiconspiratorial meeting with his  Belarusian colleague, but after it the pace of Belarus's joining  the Russian monetary system does not speed up in the least. It  turns out that use is being made of the principle: what I say is  entirely different from what I do (what I think remains unknown).    Yet in relations with the CIS and in domestic policy a  unified set of policies needs to be worked out. In light of  recent events, one may assume that the gap between actual policy  and official declarations will be, at the very least, preserved.  This is indirectly confirmed by the sharp increase in the degree  of secrecy with which the Russian departments are concealing  their plans with regard to relations with the CIS.

The contribution that 1994 makes to the  situation may be the very same strategy in camouflaged political  dressing. For all practical purposes, that is the approach that  is defended by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry on Economic  Cooperation With Member-States of the Commonwealth, and the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The industrial lobbies  and, in part, the regional lobbies oppose it. After encountering  nonpayments, they have been putting pressure not on their  partners in the CIS, but primarily on the Russian government,  through whose credits to the debtor countries financing is  opened up for them, too. It is typical that at the beginning of  the year Yuriy Shafranik stated at a meeting of his ministry's  collegium that it was more profitable to export oil to the CIS  than to Western Europe. The Central Bank is also in solidarity  with the industrialists. Gazprom is so far the exception, and  the shut-off of deliveries to Ukraine and Belarus could, in  theory, prompt the industrialists to toughen their positions  vis-a-vis the consumers of their products from the former USSR.    Consequently, Russia will be officially defending the ideas  of continuing economic integration with an emphasis on the  development of supranational structures, while striving to  assume key positions on those agencies. On the other hand, in  bilateral relations--and they are what determine real  relations--Russia will, at the least, hold to its positions of  1993: the preservation of customs duties on energy resources, a  rigid arrangement for granting credits and the repayment of them  (the indexation of credit amounts through the dollar, the  determination of interest rates through the libor [London banks'  short-term interest rate], and the requirement of an insurance  deposit in hard currency), with the right to write off defaulted  debts without requiring acceptance). Possible alternatives to  present transportation routes for Russian export cargo that  would bypass the Commonwealth countries are also being studied.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Per Capita National Income of Individual CIS Countries (As a Percentage of C-|  |IS Average)                                                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CIS                                   |100                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belarus                               |125                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia                                |112.5                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine                               |95.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazakhstan                            |84.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moldova                               |77                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Turkmenistan                          |69                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Uzbekistan                            |64.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Azerbaijan                            |62.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kyrgyzstan                            |59.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armenia                               |50                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tajikistan                            |30                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Volvo sells 4.6% stake in Norwegian oil group Volvo of Sweden yesterday took another step to concentrate on its core motor industry operations when it announced the sale to unnamed international institutions of its 4.6 per cent shareholding in Norway's Saga Petroleum for NKr458m (Dollars 62m). The sale, which brought Volvo a capital gain of SKr350m, follows the disposal last month of the company's 30 per cent voting stake in the investment group Custos for SKr1.74bn. The Custos sale was the first divestment made by Volvo after it pulled out of a plan to merge its car and truck operations with state-owned Renault of France. Since then, Volvo has made clear that it intends to concentrate on strengthening its car and truck divisions, where it will have to bear the heavy costs of new model development alone - at least until it establishes a new partnership with another motor group. But so far Volvo has looked to peripheral holdings to divest and has given no indication that it intends to cut its commitment to its main non-core holdings in BCP, the consumer products group, and Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals group.</p>

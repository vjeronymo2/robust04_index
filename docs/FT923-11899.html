			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UN general says 40,000 troops needed in Sarajevo A UNITED Nations peacemaking force of 40,000 would be needed to be effective in Sarajevo alone, General Lewis MacKenzie, the senior UN soldier in the Bosnian capital said yesterday, Reuter reports. The general, who commands the troops guarding Sarajevo airport and keeping open supply lines, said: 'This is the first time a (UN) peacekeeping force has been deployed when there's no peace to keep.' The UN had never converted a peacekeeping to a peacemaking force. 'You can't move from one to the other - it's absolutely and totally impossible,' he told a news conference broadcast live on Sarajevo radio and television. Yesterday, the UN peacekeepers struggled to maintain an airlift of humanitarian supplies for some 380,000 civilians trapped in Sarajevo. Several cargo planes landed yesterday morning, but UN forces were then forced to suspend flights after several mortar rounds hit the airport. Operations were resumed about 90 minutes later, according to Gen MacKenzie. The general, who hands over his command at the end of the month when French, Ukrainian and Egyptian troops replace his Canadian battalion, said he had been with nine UN missions, but that Sarajevo was 10 times as difficult as the others put together. 'Mortars are set up beside hospitals, artillery beside schools, mortars and other weapons are carried in ambulances - I've never seen the Red Cross abused like that, on both sides . . . when you start to break the international rules of war, its a downward spiral - it doesn't get better, it gets worse.' Gen MacKenzie, who was frequently heckled by his audience of Bosnian journalists, accused both sides of shelling their own people to try to influence events. 'We have evidence that both sides shell themselves in order to create a particular image. I got so frustrated about this a month ago that I said to both sides: 'If you'll stop shelling yourselves, maybe we'll have peace around here.'' The general, who referred to his 'obsession with impartiality', said: 'The citizens of Sarajevo assumed that our arrival would stop the war. People are suffering here, being shelled and killed every day, and a bunch of guys drive into town in white vehicles with blue berets on and they expect the fighting to stop tomorrow. And when the shelling doesn't stop tomorrow because that's not in our mandate, who are they going to blame? They blame us - I understand that.' He said the Serbs surrounding the city 'have a big problem'. If they removed their heavy weapons the Bosnian forces were strong enough to make significant gains against them. 'So what do they do? How do they get out of this? As a soldier I can tell you it's a difficult situation, and I know you hate to hear me say this, but the only way to resolve it is by talking.' Gen MacKenzie said an international commission should be sent to Sarajevo to give an unbiased opinion on events and constitutional and political talks should agree a final settlement. 'My personal opinion is that if discussions do not take place, one side will win and one side will lose and that is a tragic solution.'</p>

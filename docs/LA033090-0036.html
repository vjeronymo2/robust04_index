			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GRADUATION WON'T TAKE BITE OUT OF THE LIONS;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: LOYOLA COACH PAUL WESTHEAD SEES AN 'UPBEAT TEAM WITH LOTS OF  EXPERIENCE' NEXT SEASON, EVEN WITH SEVERAL OF ITS STARS GONE.  </P> <P> Now that the Hank and Bo Show has ended and Jeff Fryer has trained his sights  on the pros, what's in store for the future of Loyola Marymount basketball?  </P> <P> In the three seasons Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Fryer were casting away, the  Lions averaged nearly 23 victories, went to the NCAA Tournament each year and  led the nation in scoring each time. Gathers and Kimble produced back-to-back  individual national scoring titles. Fryer led the nation in three-pointers and  set an NCAA Tournament record in the same category.  </P> <P> The culmination came at the end of this bittersweet season, after Gathers  collapsed in a game and died March 4, when the Lions beat three highly ranked  teams and advanced to the NCAA's final eight. They smashed all NCAA scoring  records while averaging 122.4 points.  </P> <P> With Gathers, the West Coast Conference's career scoring leader, gone, and  Kimble and Fryer graduating, the Lions will miss their combined 87 points per  game.  </P> <P> As one opposing coach plainly put it: "They'll be back breathing the same air  as the rest of us."  </P> <P> But are dark days ahead for the Lions? Don't be so sure.  </P> <P> While there are no players coming back of Gathers' or Kimble's caliber, the  Lions may be better than people think next season.  </P> <P> "It will be an upbeat team, with lots of experience, a substantial amount of  carry-over," Westhead predicted. "We won't be devastated (by the loss of the  seniors). There are some real bright lights. We may not be able to replace the  87 points, but there are guys who will take as many shots."  </P> <P> The core of experienced players is led by guards Tony Walker, Terrell Lowery  and Tom Peabody. Walker, the point guard, and Peabody, the kamikaze swing man  noted for his constant dives and hustle, will be seniors. Lowery, a mercurial  driver who was the team's fourth-best scorer at 14.5 points per game and third  most prolific three-point shooter behind Kimble and Fryer, will be a junior. He  figures to play more as a shooting guard and increase his scoring. The three  combined for nearly 16 assists a game.  </P> <P> Up front, three young players will return: 6-foot-9 Chris Knight and 6-7 John  O'Connell, both sophomores, and 6-8 freshman Chris Scott. Knight stepped into  the starting lineup when Gathers went down before the NCAA Tournament, and  Scott saw considerable playing time in the post-season. Knight tied Gathers for  the team lead in blocked shots with 24.  </P> <P> "So we have the two dimensions -- six or seven guys who are tournament-tested  and the young guys who have shown up lately," Westhead said, "and it wouldn't  be outlandish to think they could evolve into terrific players."  </P> <P> Also in the wings might be the Lions' secret weapon -- 6-8 redshirt forward  Brian McCloskey, an outstanding shooter who also runs the Lions' break well on  the wing. Despite his slender build, he has also been a good rebounder in  practices and scrimmages.  </P> <P> Assistant Coach Jay Hillock said McCloskey "is a very good offensive player.  He's got cute moves; he can create a shot for himself. We'll be counting on him  to contribute heavily."  </P> <P> McCloskey, who transferred from UC Irvine after one season, is the nephew of  former Loyola scoring star Jim McCloskey. He'll have sophomore eligibility.  </P> <P> The biggest question mark for the Lions is the status of 6-7 forward Per  Stumer, a Swedish native who has a year of eligibility left but may not want to  spend another year away from home. At a well-conditioned 210 pounds, he has  been one of Loyola's most solid rebounders the last two seasons, starting both  years, and can shoot the three-pointer.  </P> <P> Stumer also has a commitment to the Swedish national team, which will be trying  next year to qualify for the 1992 Olympics. He managed to play for the Swedish  team several times over the winter without missing any Loyola games.  </P> <P> Stumer sounded uncertain this week. "I definitely want to have that option (to  return). I'm finishing my classes to stay eligible," he said. "I may play pro  in Europe. That would be realistic for me. It's hard for me to say. I don't  know if I want to spend a third year away from home."  </P> <P> The Lions signed three players in the preseason, two guards and a swing man,  and are recruiting a junior college player.  </P> <P> The players who have already signed are 6-6 Ross Richardson, a three-sport  player who had a "solid year" at Central High School in Flint, Mich., according  to Hillock; point guard Greg Evans of Ocean View High, and shooting guard Greg  Holt of West Valley College in Saratoga, Calif., who won most valuable player  honors in two early-season tournaments.  </P> <P> Kimble, potentially a high NBA draft choice, has already signed with an agent.  He said he hopes to be able to play for one of the Los Angeles teams -- Lakers  or Clippers -- but hopes to contribute immediately wherever he ends up.  </P> <P> Fryer will compete in the three-point competition Sunday in Denver as part of  the NCAA Final Four festivities, and will play in the rookie tryout camp in  Portsmouth, Ohio, in April. He hopes to be invited to an NBA camp.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Lions hope to have made some recruiting inroads with their  recent visibility. "The results of what we've done will show next November (in  the early signing period)," Westhead said.  </P> <P> Hillock said: "It's making us think about going after some of the top 100  (prospects) next year" for the first time.  </P> <P> "Ultimately," Westhead noted, "it's the players who decide your future."  </P></p>

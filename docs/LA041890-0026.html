			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCENT THE POSITIVE, NOT NEGATIVE  </P> <P> The Supreme Court has let stand a lower-court ruling that an employer does not  violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act by refusing to hire someone whose accent  "interferes materially" with job performance. That decision, though narrowly  drawn, disturbs many who fear that an employer bent on discrimination will now  seize on a person's accent as an excuse to get around the employment  protections provided by civil-rights laws. That is a legitimate and  understandable apprehension. No less legitimate, though, is the asserted claim  of employer rights that the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld in a  ruling the high court saw no reason to change. The next step -- the next  challenge, really -- is to try to prevent this ruling from becoming a tool to  pry open the door to unfair hiring practices.  </P> <P> The case at issue involved a Filipino American who seemed qualified in every  way for a job with the Department of Motor Vehicles in Honolulu except, in the  opinion of two interviewers, for an accent that would have made him "difficult  to understand over the phone." In the view of the appeals court, a refusal to  hire was justified only because an essential part of the job involved  communicating with the public. Discrimination? In one sense, yes. But illegal  discrimination, under the terms of the Civil Rights Act? No, said the court,  not if an employer made "an honest assessment" that an applicant's oral  communication skills were inadequate to the needs of the job.  </P> <P> That seems a reasonable enough standard to apply. But it's also, inescapably,  an ambiguous one, depending as it does on a personal judgment that can vary  widely from one employer to another, even in the absence of discriminatory  intent. A rule that rests on subjective interpretations does not make for  settled law. It seems clear enough what the appeals court intended. It's also a  good bet that the courts have not seen the last case involving alleged  discrimination based on accent.  </P></p>

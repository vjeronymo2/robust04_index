			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Brain Drain' Continues"] </F>   [Text] Around 100,000 people leave Russia every year.  Russian Federation Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan reported  this to an RIA correspondent. He said that the level of  emigration has doubled as compared with 1989. From what the  minister said, thousands of skilled workers, specialists, and  representatives of creative professions are leaving the country,  which may have a negative effect on its intellectual and labor  potential. "The `brain drain' process from fundamental science,  the defense complex, and sectors which have found themselves in  the most difficult situation in the period of the restructuring  of the economy, is generating particularly great alarm."    At the same time, the minister noted that the influx of  refugees into Russia, which has assumed a "steady and constant  nature," is growing.</p>

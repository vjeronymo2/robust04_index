This rule extends the expiration date for the adult mental disorders listings. We have made no revisions to the medical criteria in the listings; they remain the same as they now appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. This extension will ensure that we continue to have medical evaluation criteria in the listings to adjudicate claims for disability based on mental impairments at step three of our sequential evaluation process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is effective August 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  document_Richard M.

We use the listings to evaluate disability and blindness at the third step of the sequential evaluation process for adults and children under the Social Security and SSI programs. The listings describe impairments considered severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity, or, for a child under age 18 applying for SSI benefits based on disability, from functioning independently, appropriately, and effectively in an age-appropriate manner. We use the criteria in part A mainly to evaluate impairments of adults. We use the criteria in part B first to evaluate impairments of children under age 18. If those criteria do not apply, we may use the criteria in part A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When we published the revised adult mental disorders listings in August 1985, we indicated that medical advances in disability evaluation and treatment and program experience would require that the listings be periodically reviewed and updated. Accordingly, we established a date of August 28, 1988, on which the listings would no longer be effective unless extended by the Secretary or revised and promulgated again. Subsequently, we issued a number of final rules extending the expiration date of the adult mental disorders listings. The last was published on August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44444) and provided that the listings for adult mental disorders would no longer be effective on August 28, 1994. Also, on July 18, 1991, we published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (56 FR 33130) that included proposed revisions to those listings. We will publish any changes to the listings based on that NPRM in a subsequent final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final regulation, we are extending for one year, to August 28, 1995, the date on which the adult mental disorders listings will no longer be effective. We believe that the requirements in these listings are still valid for our program purposes. As noted above, we use the listings at the third step of the sequential evaluation process. Specifically, if we find that an individual has an impairment that meets the statutory duration requirement and also meets or is equivalent in severity to an impairment in the listings, we will find that the individual is disabled without completing the remaining steps of the sequential evaluation process. We do not use the listings to find that an individual is not disabled. Individuals whose impairments do not meet or equal the criteria of the listings receive individualized assessments at the subsequent steps of the sequential evaluation process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy generally follows the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) NPRM and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its regulations. The APA provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists for dispensing with the NPRM and public comment procedures in this case. Good cause exists because this regulation only extends the date on which the adult mental disorders listings will no longer be effective and makes no substantive changes to those listings. The current regulations expressly provide that the listings may be extended by the Secretary, as well as revised and promulgated again. Therefore, opportunity for prior comment is unnecessary, and we are issuing these changes to our regulations as a final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Austrian futures exchange teaches bourse a lesson MIDDLE Europeans like to gamble. That, according to an Austrian banker, is the main explanation for the rapid growth of the Austrian Futures and Options Exchange (OTOB). Opened only 15 months ago, OTOB has become a bigger draw than the Vienna bourse. The contract value of OTOB's stock options is regularly three times as great as the volume of sales in the underlying shares. In other European markets, this relationship tends to be roughly one to one. OTOB is even making a mark in Europe. Last month, volume in its five stock options was greater than the Paris MASIP exchange had on its 15. Options on the shares of Creditanstalt Bankverein, a leading Austrian bank, have become the third most popular bank stock options in Europe, after Union Bank of Switzerland and CS Holding. Developed on a shoestring budget of Sch110m (Dollars 9m), the exchange now finds that it is likely to cover its operating costs in its second year of operation. At first glance, this performance is all the more surprising because Austria's stock market is so unsuccessful. Activity there is so shallow that only 18 shares are traded continuously, and the market's notoriety for insider activity keeps individuals away in droves. Individual investors account for only a tiny proportion of those who regularly trade in shares, preferring, it was long thought, to stuff their savings into the anonymous bank accounts that used to enable them to escape tax. But OTOB has found that most of those few individuals who still trade on the stock exchange are sophisticated investors, and they were quick to take to futures and options. 'We have a good retail base of four or five thousand people who understand markets and like derivatives,' says Mr Christian Imo, chief executive of OTOB. Mr Imo estimates that retail investors provide about one-third of the volume on the exchange, much more than on the Deutsche Termine Borse or on Switzerland's Soffex. The other reasons for the popularity of OTOB, he believes, are its transparency and liquidity. The exchange operates electronically, with market participants able to see on their screens all the bid and offered prices as well as all the transactions as they happen. OTOB is also fairly easy to understand and follow. Its product range is limited to options on five leading shares, options and futures on the ATX index of the 18 continuously traded shares and - the latest product line - futures on a notional 10-year Austrian government bond. The exchange insists on having at least three market makers for each product, and they must provide prices on demand. The success of OTOB has been a lesson to the Vienna bourse, which is now rushing to install its own electronic trading system and to take other steps to improve transparency. In October, insider trading is finally to become a criminal offence. Like other futures and options exchanges, OTOB has its problems, in particular, finding ways to respond to the fast burgeoning competition from over the counter derivative products offered by banks. OTOB, whose options run only to six months, is planning to introduce longer term options in the next few months on the ATX Index and on the Creditanstalt share. It is also working on a future on a Vienna interbank interest rate (Vibor). Another challenge is linking with other futures and options exchanges. OTOB's project with SOFFEX to allow each other's members to trade on both exchanges was scuppered last month when SOFFEX directors disapproved. Mr Imo does not conceal his disappointment, but he believes these links will gradually come, especially as barriers between Austria and the European Community come down.</p>

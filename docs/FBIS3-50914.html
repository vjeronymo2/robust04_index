May this year bring you well-being and  prosperity.    At year's end each of us has an opportunity to think, to be  with our families, and to examine our past, present, and future.  With the internal peace fostered by the Christmas season, which  allows us to reflect -- which I am certain we all did -- I  thought of my almost five years in office and examined where I  came from, where I am, and where I am headed.    As the end of my term approaches, I could not help but  recall  the situation that existed in 1989. We had an armed conflict  that was causing bloodshed throughout the breadth and length of  our country, bringing grief and sorrow to the Salvadoran family.  We were a polarized society and sectors confronted one another.  What is even worse, there was a considerable uprooting of  people. Many Salvadorans had to go abroad in search of peace  and a way to make a living.    We had an economic situation that could have been  characterized as chaotic. During the eighties, which we now  describe as the lost decade, our country gradually sank further  into an economic abyss. The crisis returned us to the levels  that existed in 1960 which, of course, meant higher levels of  unemployment and poverty. El Salvador also had problems abroad  because it was identified by its violence and by bad things, not  as a country that could participate in international meetings or  present itself with dignity and respect. In 1989, my friends,  our country was immersed in desperation.    When I first addressed you on 1 June 1989, I identified two  key issues as the main focuses of my government: The first was  to resolve the armed conflict and the second was to correct the  chaotic economic situation that prevailed. I chose these two  key issues because if we failed to resolve them it would be very  difficult to resolve the country's other problems. Devoting the  entire national budget to a military effort left no resources to  resolve such problems as health, housing, and education.  Likewise, with the economic crisis it was impossible to  generate jobs and resources to invest in social projects. Thus,  it was necessary to emphasize these two issues. It was the only  way to overcome the obstacles that were hindering the solution  of the country's problems. This is why I made this huge effort.    As I recall these past four and a half years, I believe it  would be worth our while to weigh the current situation. At  present, our country is no longer at war. Instead, it is  increasingly consolidating a peace process and has become an  example to the entire world. All of the sectors in our country  understand that the mechanism of dialogue prevents  confrontations and is the best way to resolve our problems.    For the first time in El Salvador's history, all of the  country's many ideological trends will participate in an  election, which means that we are consolidating our democracy.  Also at present, our economy is healthy and stable, which opens  the possibility of investing in that which a government should  invest in: social projects.    Although there are numerous examples, suffice it to say that  already we have tripled the public health budget and doubled the  education budget. In short, we are now able to resolve the  problems that are affecting the Salvadoran people. Within the  framework of a stable economic situation, considerable  confidence has been generated domestically and abroad. This  confidence is fostering investment in our country which, in  turn, generates new sources of employment; and employment is the  best way to pull a person out of extreme poverty.    Internationally, El Salvador is viewed throughout the world  as an example of pacification and democracy. However, beyond  politics or political openness we now also have economic  openness. All of the worldwide financial centers have opened  their doors to El Salvador because they believe in and have  confidence in our country's responsible economic efforts. This  will allow us to rebuild all of the destruction generated by the  armed conflict. Now, every Salvadoran can dream of the future;  now, our children have space to work and grow; now, El Salvador  has a future.    However, looking beyond our accomplishments, we should  consider who is responsible for this very significant change.  There can be no other conclusion but that all of it is thanks  to your support, the support of the entire Salvadoran  population, a people who decided on a peace process to rescue  the nation. We must remember that our country was torn between  a military solution and a political solution. When I took  office, I chose one of these two options: the political  solution. I was certain that it was the only solution that  would be truly lasting and permanent. As of that moment,  differences disappeared and I was able to rely on the Salvadoran  people's support to successfully culminate the negotiations  process which, in 1992, brought us the peace we so desired.    In the area of economics, I remember that once during a  message to the nation I said I had two alternatives with which  to deal with our difficult economic situation. I could either  take the easy way out and continue ruling the country with  methods that would create apparent solutions, or I could make  the responsible decision to execute actions that would attack  the problem at its roots, although I knew this decision implied  high costs and sacrifices. At that time I likened the economy  to a seriously ill patient at death's door, to whom we could  administer morphine to diminish his pain but who would  eventually die. The other alternative was to make the  responsible decision to perform surgery which, although painful  and with a slow recovery, would allow the patient to survive and  regain his health.    It was necessary to make the sacrifice for the sake of a  better future for our country and to ensure the possibility of  having El Salvador prepared to take off economically and  prepared to grow.    My brother Salvadorans, through these thoughts I have  confirmed that you, that all Salvadorans, are unquestionably our  country's greatest wealth, because without your support I would  never have been able to eliminate the obstacles that prevented  us from resolving our problems. I know that we still have  problems, but a country always has them and they must be  resolved. Nevertheless, by eliminating obstacles, our problems  are already being resolved.    We are now in a position to resolve our problems because the  government has more resources and they are no longer devoted to  an armed conflict or demagogic policies, but to those issues to  which the nation's efforts should be directed: the effort to  ensure all Salvadorans' success and to provide them with safety,  education, health, and the necessary opportunities to succeed.    We must make El Salvador a country of opportunities.  Therefore, we must have confidence in our country; we must have  confidence in our peace process; we must have confidence in all  of our democratic institutions, which provide us with freedom.  We must continue to have confidence in our development and in  our progress as a people.    Beloved fellow Salvadorans, we must have confidence in El  Salvador because I am certain that together, all of us together,  we will achieve what we have always desired: an El Salvador with  peace, progress, and freedom. May God bless you all and may He  always bless our beloved El Salvador. Thank you very much and a  very good evening to all.</p>

Even if the work is done by a homeowner, state regulations apply.  </P> <P> Asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral fiber, can cause asbestosis and cancer.

Box 26000, Sacramento, Calif.  95826. A current list of contractors certified by the state to engage in  asbestos-related work can also be requested.  </P></p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Money Markets: Interbank rates ease THIN TRADING, confined mainly to the under one-week range, characterised a dreary day in the UK money markets yesterday. 'The whole thing has just run out of steam,' said one dealer. 'The market is tucked up in bed, waiting for Friday morning.' Interbank rates continued to point to higher base rates after tomorrow's general election, but the pressure for a rise has eased considerably over the past two days. The key three-month interbank rate softened to 10 15/16 - 13/16 per cent from 11-10 15/16 per cent. When a batch of opinion polls put Labour decisively ahead of the Conservatives last week, the three-month rate had shot upwards to a nervous 11 3/16 - 1/16 per cent. At the longer end, the one year rate eased to 11 1/8 -11 per cent from 11 5/16 - 1/16 per cent. The steadier performance of the pound helped to create yesterday's calmer atmosphere. But although the market was less jittery, there was still considerable underlying nervousness about what would happen to sterling if the Labour party were to edge ahead of the Conservatives in the early hours of Friday morning. The June sterling contract opened four basis points firmer at 88.92 and drifted around the 88.90 level in fairly thin trading. It finished at 88.90. Meanwhile, the Bank of England provided the market with relatively cheap money. The Bank initially forecast a shortfall of Pounds 400m, but raised that figure by Pounds 250m just prior to its first round of operations at midday. In the morning round it bought Pounds 460m band-2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The shortage was later trimmed to Pounds 600m. The overnight rate slipped to 8 1/4 -8 per cent, but only another Pounds 54m of band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent changed hands. No late help was required and the overnight rate closed at 8 3/4 - 5/8 per cent. The Federal Reserve refrained from money market operations yesterday. The lack of a draining operation, with Federal Funds softer than the 4 per cent target, was not an indication that the Fed was shifting to an easier policy stance, economists said. Some had expected the open market desk to drain reserves from the banking system, possibly through a two-day matched sale-purchase transaction, in a bid to firm the key Fed Funds rate.</p>

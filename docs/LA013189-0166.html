			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> YEOMAN TO RETIRE, PAPER REPORTS  </P> <P> Former University of Houston football coach Bill Yeoman, who coached the  Cougars to national prominence during his 25 years as coach, is expected to  retire soon from his university fund-raising position, the Houston Chronicle  reported today.  </P> <P> Yeoman has served in the fund-raising post since he retired from football  coaching in 1986.  </P> <P> Yeoman, 61, retired with one of college football's winningest records at  160-108-8. The record was remarkable in that in his last five seasons, UH teams  won only 22 of 56 games.  </P> <P> The West Point graduate and former player invented the Veer offense, a dominant  college offense in the 1970s and early '80s. The Veer still is used widely in  high school football.  </P> <P> In 25 years, Yeoman's teams went to 12 bowl games, including three Cotton Bowls  in UH's first four years in the Southwest Conference in the late 1970s. His  1984 team returned to the Cotton Bowl.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Eleven government  officials have been arrested and sued on charges of taking  bribes while they were assigned to the Taejon Expo organizing  committee between 1991 and 1993, the public prosecution  announced Monday.    Kim Ki-yop, currently working at the Ministry of Trade,  Industry and Energy, received bribes totaling 41 million won  (about 50,000 U.S. dollars) from nine business firms while  serving as sponsor program chief of the Expo organizing  committee, the announcement said.    The prosecution has also obtained arrest warrants for Chon  So-myong, former landscaping section chief of the organizing  committee, and Kim U-hyon, former utilities section chief of the  committee, on the same charges and placed them on a wanted list  as they have disappeared.    In addition, the prosecution found that 26 officials had  taken bribes of up to 7 million won while they were serving on  the organizing committee and referred them to the agencies  currently employing them for disciplinary action.    The officials involved in the Expo bribery cases now work at  10 government ministries and agencies -- the Education,  Construction, Trade, Industry and Energy, Communications,  Government Administration and Culture-sports ministries, the  Economic Planning Board, the Office of Supply, the Korea  Industrial Property Office and Taejon City Hall.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by editorial staff member Hideo Tamura: "Confusion </F> Continues In U.S.-Japan Framework Talks"]    [Text] The U.S.-Japan economic framework talks will reach a  climax at the U.S.-Japan summit conference which is scheduled to  be held on 11 February. Progress, however, has hardly been made  in the ongoing U.S.-Japan negotiations on reduction of the  Japanese current account surplus and on market opening in  individual fields such as automobiles. The U.S. side is  pursuing an excessively utilitarian goal and the Japanese side  lacks a responsible world view.  <H5>  Distrust of the Bureaucratic Structure </H5>   For the United States, the U.S.-Japan economic framework  talks constitute a framework through which the United States  manages its confrontational economic relationship with Japan.  The United States proposes the Japanese current account balance  surplus be reduced by half in proportion to the gross domestic  product. It also proposes introduction of a "market entry  index" for individual markets, which include the market share  for foreign enterprises in such areas as automobiles, auto  parts, insurance, government procurement, and so forth. The  purpose of such a target and of the introduction of indexes is  to clearly elucidate "results." The United States believes that  to bring about results, an automatic mechanism must be created  and the United States must keep continuous surveillance over it.  To maintain this surveillance, the United States believes that  the indexes are necessary.    The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement is a precedent for  the  framework talks. Because the goal of a 20-percent market share  for foreign-manufactured [semiconductors] was achieved through  the administrative guidance of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry (MITI), the United States, both government  and private sectors, praised it, saying: "It is the first case  in which the Japanese side honored a U.S.-Japan agreement."    But Japan today refuses the U.S. demand entirely. MITI puts  forth its position that "the semiconductor agreement was a very  great mistake." One Japanese official spurned a high-ranking  U.S. Government official who proposed establishment of market  shares at the beginning of the framework talks, saying: "As for  myself, your proposal is improper." This attitude has not  changed since then. U.S. Government high-ranking officials, in  turn, have been irritated ever since, saying: "Japanese  officials can not be trusted."    There is also thinking on the U.S. side that the bureaucrats  are interfering, even though Prime Minister Hosokawa advocates  "change" for the Japanese economy.  <H5>  Go Over the Heads of the Bureaucrats, Use Politicians </H5>   An impatient U.S. negotiation team in December met with  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Representative Secretary Ichiro  Ozawa, skipping over the heads of the bureaucrats. They are  leaning toward the use of the directive power of "politics" over  the bureaucrats. This reminds us of a revival of the method used  by former Ambassador Armacost. He was called "Mr. Gaiatsu" by  Kasumigaseki [government office district] because he went over  to Nagata-cho [Tokyo political district] any time an issue arose  and negotiated with influential Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  members.    But a solution is not necessarily found by going over the  "wall" of the Japanese bureaucrats. As for quantitative  indicators, should Japan create bilateral rules at a time when,  as the new round is concluded, the rules are to be strengthened  for multilateral free trade through GATT? As for imports,  should Japan adopt methods of managed trade or conclude an  agreement with the United States on voluntary import expansion,  even as a temporary measure?... Such decisions concern  fundamental issues of international trade policy and are outside  the competence of individual politicians.    Bureaucratic organizations themselves are losing the basis  of  their power for domestic regulation. Just at that time [when  the U.S. representatives were approaching the politicians], at  MITI, [Masahisa] Naito, Industrial Policy Bureau director  general, was driven to resignation. Naito had inherited the  line of former Vice Minister Tanahashi. Tanahashi had expanded  his authority through dealing with LDP legislators who  represented trade and industry interests. The U.S. negotiation  team had scheduled its meeting on that very day with Mr. Naito,  hoping to find a break through for the issue. But the commotion  over his resignation had already started, and the meeting was  canceled.  <H5>  Ambiguous Agreement Possible </H5>   The management of trade which has depended on cooperation  with powerful politicians, and leading industry with a heavy  hand when dealing with U.S.-Japan friction has failed. The  method of guidance such as calling the presidents of the  automobile industry and making them buy U.S. products can not be  carried out without the political back-up which can determine an  industry's gain or loss. The U.S. side is at a loss because of  the politicians' and bureaucrats' confusion.    Still, the framework talks will not break down. This is  because, for high-ranking officials of both the United States  and Japan, "non-agreement" will become proof of a "lack of  ability" and a "lack of power." As for macroeconomic policy,  the U.S. side formerly wanted a "10 trillion yen tax cut," but  now is indicating a compromise of a "total of 10 trillion yen  for a tax cut and public investment." But there is a great  possibility that the vague agreement on quantitative indicators  will accelerate differences of interpretation and intensify  mutual distrust and confrontation.    Japan's continued accumulation of a surplus and refusal to  accept foreign products and capital will disturb the world  economy and accelerate the argument in the United States for  retaliation against Japan. The basic thinking of the United  States, which proposed the framework talks, is that, under such  circumstances, the post-cold war U.S.-Japan relationship in  which concern will be focused on economic interests cannot be  maintained. They one-sidedly seek a change in Japanese policy.  The current confusion stems from the fact that Japanese side  could not indicate a clear counter plan to deal with such  thinking and has merely continued to respond to the other side's  language. What is sought from the Hosokawa government is  finding a stable axis for the U.S.-Japan relationship.</p>

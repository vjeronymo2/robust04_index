			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (3): The whole of Europe and a slice of Africa - Lucy Plaskett describes the remorseless expansion of the international grid for electricity trading Within a decade, Spain could be exchanging electricity with Egypt to the south and Russia to the east, both members of a vast intercontinental power grid. The increasing desire of utilities to trade with each other, coupled with recent political and economic changes, is promoting the rapid growth of interconnections between electricity grids. With the exception of Ireland, which for the time being stands alone, most countries in western Europe belong to one of three interconnected grid systems: the UCPTE system, one of the largest in the world, covering 12 states in continental Europe; the much smaller system of Nordel, covering Norway, Sweden, Finland and the eastern half of Denmark; and the British system, linking England, Wales and Scotland. To the east, the power grids of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union are linked together by the IPS/UPS system. All four evolved as utilities increasingly saw the advantages of cooperating together to improve the efficiency of their individual networks. Within such interconnected grid systems, the transmission networks of member countries are synchronised and work together to keep the overall system at the same steady frequency. This not only helps to promote regular electricity trade between grid members but provides a valuable back-up for utilities when power is lost unexpectedly. For example, if the Spanish grid suffered an unexpected loss of power, endangering frequency levels, electricity would automatically flow from other parts of the UCPTE grid to make up the gap. This reduces the amount of generating capacity that each individual country has to keep in reserve, allowing utilities to reduce their investment costs. The four separate systems are also linked together - Britain with UCPTE via a cable link with France, Nordel with UCPTE via Denmark and with Russia via Finland, and three interconnections along the Austrian and German borders providing a link with eastern Europe. But such links are so-called direct current (DC) lines; while the alternating current (AC) of the synchronised grids allows multi-directional power flows to provide a constant back-up, DC lines are the 'railways' of the system, allowing power to flow in one direction at a time, and only affecting the power grids of the two countries concerned. They can also be switched off if disturbances occur. The main growth in DC lines has been to the north of Europe. Over the past few years, a number of new DC lines have been proposed between the Nordel and UCPTE grids. The most advanced is the 600MW Baltic Cable being built between Sweden and Germany by Swedish utility Vattenfall and Germany's PreussenElektra, due to be completed by the end of this year. East German utility VEAG and eastern Denmark's Elkraft are also linking their two grids via the 600MW Kontek line, due in operation at the end of 1995. Meanwhile, PreussenElektra has also teamed up with Norwegian utility Statkraft to plan the 600MW Viking Cable between Norway and Germany for later in the 1990s. And Norwegian utilities are also considering a DC link to the Netherlands, as well as possible links to the UK. These lines are being built by utilities eager to exploit the difference in price and availability between Sweden and Norway's large amounts of hydropower, and the mainly thermal-based electricity of UCPTE. Different peak demand times also offer trading opportunities. Nordic utilities plan to export hydro electricity to the UCPTE grid during the day when prices are high, and then switch off their hydro plants at night and import thermal power when prices are low. The links will also allow them to import in the event of dry summers. Continental utilities benefit from peak power without having to invest in new plant. Nordel has always exchanged power in this way with thermal-fired plant in Denmark. But such trade has been boosted in recent years by the increasing commercial pressures of the EC internal market, the difficulties of siting new plant, and weak domestic power demand which has forced utilities to look abroad. Utilities are also looking east for trading opportunities. Vattenfall is considering a DC submarine link to Poland, while Finnish utility IVO is doing feasibility studies on a 500MW link to Estonia. PreussenElektra and the Polish grid company are just finishing a study on the feasibility of a 2x2,000MW DC overland line linking Frankfurt to Smolensk in Russia, via Poland and Byelorussia. Together, these three projects could form a 'Baltic ring', offering utilities similar chances to exploit different fuel sources and demand peaks. Political change over the past few years has also raised the possibility of further electricity trade with eastern Europe. But this is more complicated since, as part of their economic integration into western Europe, the countries of central and eastern Europe want to break away from the IPS/UPS system and become part of the UCPTE synchronised network. But before this can happen their grids need to be technically upgraded to meet UCPTE standards. This work is well underway. West German utilities hope to link the east German grid system to UCPTE by 1995. While Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics have formed a union, CENTREL, to look into the technical aspects of joining the UCPTE. According to a report by UNIPEDE, the International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electrical Energy, the four have said that the necessary upgrading will be done by 1997 at the latest, and could be completed as early as next year. Next on the list of future UCPTE members are Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. But this is complicated by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, which has severed the UCPTE link to Greece. Attaching this part of southern Europe will either have to wait for the end of the conflict or will involve upgrading of lines between Hungary and Romania. For the longer term experts are also doing feasibility studies on linking the CIS and Russian grids to the UCPTE, creating one vast synchronous network over the entire European continent. Technically UNIPEDE believes this is possible, concluding 'the size of a system will be governed by geographical, economic, political or even organisational factors, rather than by technical considerations'. But some experts worry that the trading advantages such a huge grid would offer, in terms of different fuels and peak load times, would be more than offset by high transmission costs and a loss of system stability. 'It's a philosophical discussion about where are the limits, who's winning and who's losing,' commented UCPTE secretary Marcel Bial. Expansion plans to the south are also well advanced. Spanish grid company Red Electrica Espanola plans to have an AC line to North Africa by 1996, linking UCPTE countries with the Maghreb grid of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. This is the first step in a wider project to connect the UCPTE grid synchronously with the whole of the Mediterranean basin. And on present plans, this is not far off. According to Mr Teoman Alpturk of the Turkish Electricity Authority, work has already started on a AC line linking Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt, with completion planned by the end of 1996. If Turkey is successful in linking up with the UCPTE grid by the late 1990s, the only weak link in this circuit will be Libya. Feasibility studies are already underway to linkthe Libyan grid to Egypt and Tunisia. Lucy Plaskett is the editor of Financial Times newsletter EC Energy Monthly.</p>

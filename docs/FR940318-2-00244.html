			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Central and South West Corp. (70&hyph;8357) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), 1616 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75202, a registered holding company, has filed a declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSW proposes to issue and sell up to 11 million shares of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, par value $3.50 per share (``Additional Common Stock''), as well as provide net proceeds to it of approximately $300 million, in one or more issues from time-to-time through December 31, 1996. CSW will issue and sell shares of Additional Common Stock under the competitive bidding procedures of Rule 50 of the Act, as modified, by the Commission's Statement of Policy Concerning the Application of Rule 50 under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, dated September 2, 1982 (HCAR No. 22623), or in negotiated sales to underwriters pursuant to an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of Rule 50 under subsection (a)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of December 31, 1983, CSW has common stock equity of $1.849 billion, consolidated total capitalization of $4.108 billion and consolidated short-term debt of $110.3 million. As of December 31, 1993, CSW had common stock equity of $2.930 billion, consolidated short-term debt of $110.3 million. As of December 31, 1993, CSW had common stock equity of $2.930 billion, consolidated total capitalization of $6.042 billion and consolidated short-term debt of $769 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At December 31, 1993, CSW's consolidated capitalization ratios were 48.5% common stock equity; 5.8% preferred stock; and45.7% long-term debt. In order to keep its capital ratios at the appropriate levels to support its growth and to support the credit rating of its subsidiaries' outstanding securities, CSW desires to issue the Additional Common Stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSW intends to apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Additional Common Stock to reduce short-term debt. Although CSW's current intention is to apply all net proceeds to reduce its short-term debt, any proceeds not used for such purposes would be used for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to capital contributions to its subsidiaries, subject to further authorization by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSW will not, however, use such proceeds, or any short-term borrowing availability created by the repayment of short-term debt with such proceeds to acquire the securities of or any interest in (1) any exempt wholesale generators, as such term is defined in section 32(e) of the Act (``EWG'') until such time as such investment shall be approved by order or regulation of the Commission or (2) any foreign utility companies, as such term is defined in section 33(a) of the Act (``FUCO'') until such time as such investment shall be approved by order or regulation of the Commission. Neither CSW nor any of its subsidiaries has an ownership interest in an EWG or FUCO, and neither CSW nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to a service, sales or construction agreement with an EWG or FUCO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSW requests an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of Rule 50 under subsection (a)(5) thereunder, and also requests authority to enter into negotiations with potential underwriters with respect to the timing, pricing and other terms and conditions applicable to the Additional Common Stock, subject to receipt of the order of the Commission requested authorizing the issuance and sale of the Additional Common Stock. It may do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Central Power and Light Co. (70&hyph;8359) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Central Power and Light Company (``Company''), 539 N. Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas, 78401&hyph;2431, an electric utility subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a) 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(c) of the Act of Rules 42 and 50(a)(5) thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Company requests authority to issue and sell in one or more series, through December 31, 1996, up to one million additional shares of its authorized and unissued preferred stock, par value $100 per share (``Additional Preferred Stock'') under the competitive bidding procedures or, in the alternative, in a negotiated underwriting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Company proposes to sell the Additional Preferred Stock as depositary preferred stock if market conditions at the time of issuance and sale are such that preferred stock having an offering price other than $100 per share is likely to have a better market reception than preferred stock having an offering price of $100 per share. In an offering of depositary preferred stock, the Company would issue and sell Additional Preferred Stock to underwriters for deposit with a Depositary. The underwriters would then receive from the Depositary, and deliver to purchasers in a subsequent public offering, receipts (``Depositary Receipts'') evidencing Depositary Preferred Shares, each representing a proportional share of Additional Preferred Stock. Any additional terms of such an arrangement would be established at the time of the proposed issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Company requests the flexibility to set the terms and amount of Additional Preferred Stock to be issued at the time of the issuance of any series thereof. The terms of the Additional Preferred Stock may include provisions for mandatory or optional redemption at various prices and may include various restrictions on optional redemption for a specified number of years. The exact terms of any redemption or refunding restrictions would be determined at or about the time of sale of the Additional Preferred Stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

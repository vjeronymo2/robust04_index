He believes that hunters are unable to identify ducks and that most crippling loss occurs prior to sunrise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested that Michigan be allowed to conduct a teal season in areas where teal concentrate. They proposed limiting the season to no more than 2,000 hunters and believed that hunters' skills at identifying waterfowl are better now than they were during initial evaluations of teal seasons in the 1960's. Four individuals from Michigan supported the proposed September teal season for portions of Michigan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Breeding population information for 1994 and harvest and band-recovery information from the 1993&hyph;94 waterfowl season indicate that a September teal season can be offered to nonproduction States of the Central and Mississippi Flyways in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During their 1993-94 teal seasons, the States of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas in the Central flyway and Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi in the Mississippi Flyway participated in a study that indicated that shooting hours beginning at one-half hour before sunrise during teal seasons have a negligible impact on nontarget duck species in those States. The Service believes the data are sufficient to address its concern about the potential harvest of nontarget species during the presunrise period, and will permit those States that participated in the study to have presunrise shooting hours during the 1994 teal season, without further evaluation. Other States that are permitted a teal season (Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio), but did not participate in the study, must begin shooting hours at sunrise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service recognizes the value of these September teal seasons in providing additional hunting opportunity but remains concerned about the potential impacts of these seasons on non-target species in certain areas. The Service strategy regarding use of teal seasons specifies that teal seasons can be offered only to nonproduction States of the Central and Mississippi Flyways. Because Michigan is considered a production State and was not part of the original, comprehensive evaluation, the Service does not support the requests for a teal season. Although the definitions of production and nonproduction States may need to be reviewed, the Service has stated in the August 23, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 44577) that it prefers a Flyway-wide approach to assess whether expansion of teal seasons to areas beyond those currently allowed is permissible. The Michigan proposal does not meet this criterion. The Service also notes that such expansions would require a reevaluation of the entire teal season, including an analysis of information from areas currently permitted teal seasons as well as areas into which teal seasons might be expanded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> ii. September Duck Seasons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Council Recommendations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Iowa be permitted to hold a portion of their regular duck season in September to increase harvest opportunity on blue-winged teal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several individuals and petitions with 4,697 signatures requested nine additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin. The request notes that the efforts of duck hunters, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited, and various sportsmen's organizations have resulted in record levels of duck production. The additional nine days of duck hunting would make Wisconsin's season equal in length to certain other States in the Mississippi Flyway that are permitted a September teal season. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service previously determined in the ``Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (SEIS 88)'' that the extension of framework dates into September for Iowa's September duck season was a type of special season. The Service further acknowledges that the 1990 assessment of special September teal seasons included data from Iowa's September duck season segments during 1979-87. As such, the effects of Iowa's special seasons were taken into account when determining the appropriateness of September teal seasons as a harvest-management tool. Iowa's data also suggested little impact on other duck species during this season. Therefore, the Service believes that Iowa's September duck season segment, as conducted during 1979-87, is consistent with the Service's policy regarding the use of special seasons. Current status information for the blue-winged teal supports Iowa's request for a September duck season in 1994. The Service stated in SEIS 88 that special seasons should be re-evaluated periodically to assess potential changes in impacts to the waterfowl resource. The Service notes that more than a decade has passed since Iowa conducted its evaluation of this season and requests that Iowa collect information documenting the effect of this season on other duck species in Iowa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the requests for additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin, an important consideration in the establishment of hunting regulations is the distinction between regular hunting seasons and special seasons. Regular seasons are developed by Flyway/management unit, and the same season length, bag limit, etc. are provided for all States in that Flyway/management unit. Special seasons, however, usually involve additional harvest opportunity and are focused on a single species or group of species. Because of this, the use of these seasons is limited to times and areas where the species or group is sufficiently isolated to minimize impacts on other species/groups. This limitation increases the likelihood that in some cases a special season or some compensating increase in other harvest opportunity cannot be available to all States. The September teal season is an example. Wisconsin is one of nine States in the Mississippi and Central Flyways that are not eligible for this special season. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

They believe that season length and bag limits in the Atlantic Flyway should be reduced substantially until more complete information on biology and population status is available. They repeat their concern regarding seasons and limits on sea ducks which are deemed too liberal, considering the quality and quantity of data on population status and trends, and recommend reductions in those regulations. The Humane Society notes that apparently the Pacific Flyway Council has not completed a comparable evaluation of its sea duck harvests and believes such seasons should be closed until necessary data are obtained. Two local organizations from Massachusetts requested a continuation of the 107-day sea duck season, with a 7-bird bag limit to include scoters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service continues to be concerned about the status of sea ducks and the potential impact that increased hunting activity could have on these species. In recognition of the need for additional information on these species, the Service prepared a report (dated June, 1993) on sea duck and merganser hunting seasons, status, and harvests in Alaska and the Pacific Flyway coastal states. This document was prepared for use by the Service and the Pacific Flyway Council in evaluating the effects of seasons on these ducks. There is no special season on sea ducks in the Pacific Flyway; however, Alaska has a sea duck limit that is additional to the limit on other ducks. In the Atlantic Flyway, a report was recently completed (dated April, 1994) and distributed, describing the status of sea ducks in that portion of the continent. Cooperative efforts are ongoing to summarize additional information on sea ducks, however the Service continues to emphasize the importance of completing the sea duck management plan. Furthermore, the Service considers improvements in survey capabilities for these species to be extremely important for future management actions. In 1993, the Service reduced bag limits on scoters from 7 to 4 within an overall 7-bird sea duck limit. The Service will continue to monitor these species and notes that further harvest restrictions may be necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

Also, current special seasons should adhere to present criteria designed by the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council also requested that a 3-year experimental, 10-day September Canada goose season be permitted in the eastern portion of Tennessee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that there be no change in frameworks in the experimental goose zone in Oregon or in the operational status in Washington.

They also indicated that they wish to delay the zone expansion and later season dates until next year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service agrees with the proposed changes to resident Canada goose seasons in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin and the new seasons in Tennessee and West Virginia. All of these proposed changes are considered experimental and subject to evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service notes that all of the seasons proposed in the Mississippi Flyway, except those for Michigan, Minnesota and Tennessee, were not proposed as experimental. The Service remains committed to population-specific management of Canada geese. However, the Service believes that the contribution of different goose populations to the goose harvest during special seasons must be determined experimentally. For this reason, the Service has established criteria for special Canada goose seasons (58 FR 44578&hyph;44579), which clearly state the need for experimental evaluation of new seasons, including extensions of geographic areas or times. Therefore, the Service agrees to the changes proposed by the Mississippi Flyway Council, but on an experimental basis and provided an approved evaluation is conducted as specified in the existing criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

They noted that significant numbers of migrant geese begin arriving in the Upper Peninsula during September 20&hyph;24 in most years. They anticipate that harvest in this region would remain small compared to the rest of the State. They also believe that nearly all Canada geese harvested in this region are of the giant subspecies or the Mississippi Valley Population. Finally, they noted that allowing a September 24 opening would provide equitable hunting opportunity compared to other areas because most geese leave this region by early November. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area of Alaska, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington.

They noted that the Central Flyway Council did not propose any framework changes for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons and asked for clarification of the reasons for this concern, especially since the population remains stable. In this regard, they suggested that the Service provide a harvest objective, rationale and method of evaluation of any harvest reduction proposed. Furthermore, the appropriate level of management should be clearly identified, i.e. population, subpopulation, or subspecies level. Although biologists working in Texas support management at the population or subpopulation level, they indicated that zoning for the hunting of cranes could not be attempted until these issues had been resolved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In 1993, the Central and Pacific Flyways completed a revision of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent Population of sandhill cranes. This revision established a goal of a stable population at levels observed during the 1982&hyph;92 period and removed the harvest threshold (25,000) that had been in place since 1981. The Service believes that future management actions for Mid-Continent cranes should be based on the recognition of biologically discrete subpopulations, which would necessitate the development of certain data collection efforts at the subspecies level.

The Service supports continuation of last year's frameworks but remains extremely concerned about possible increases or shifts in harvest toward the Gulf Coast subpopulation, especially the greater-sandhill-crane component. The Service considers a harvest threshold to be an integral component of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent Population and hopes that the newly-formed crane working group, appointed by the Central Flyway Council, will strongly reconsider the need for a harvest threshold in the development of a harvest strategy for this population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 11.

The Service will work with the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils to review the status of woodcock and cooperatively develop a harvest-management strategy. The Service believes that zoning has the potential to increase the harvest of woodcock.

However, the Service remains concerned about the long-term decline of this population and continues to support restrictive harvest regulations. Again this year, all States having band-tailed pigeon hunting seasons must require band-tailed pigeon hunters to obtain mandatory State permits (or participate in the nationwide Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program) to provide a sampling frame for obtaining more precise estimates of band-tailed pigeon harvest.

In regard to Texas, the Service noted that no other States are allowed to select both 3 zones and 3 splits for any species; in fact, no State other than Texas is allowed to select 3 zones for doves. The Service also expressed concern about the ability to detect and measure possible changes in harvest that may result from those additional splits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Service is concerned about changes in the schedule for inclusion of States in the Harvest Information Program.

However, the Service is of the view that every attempt should be made to give the public the greatest possible opportunity to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the proposed early-season rulemaking was published on July 13, the Service established what it believed was the longest period possible for public comment. In doing this, the Service recognized that, at the close of the comment period, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, the Service is of the opinion that the States would have insufficient time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections to the Service; and to establish and publicize the necessary regulations and procedures that implement their decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Service, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 703&hyph;712), prescribes final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State and Territory conservation agency officials may select hunting season dates and other options.

Focusing on Guangdong's actual conditions, Xie Fei  set out four principles for Guangdong's work from now on. First,  it is necessary to seize the opportunity and deepen reform.  Regarding the series of reforms set out by the central  authorities this year in such domains as finance, taxation,  banking, foreign trade, and enterprises, we must work hard to do  a good job in their implementation, and must build the socialist  market economy mechanism step by step. Second, it is necessary  to seize the chance to expand opening up and to promote reform  with opening up and development, while relying on Guangdong's  advantages to raise the level and expand the scope of opening  up. Third, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to develop  the economy, exert efforts to develop new hi-technology  industry, and three-high agriculture, and also to improve the  managerial level and economic returns. It is particularly  imperative to maintain agricultural stability and development,  and to place it in a conspicuous and important position.  Fourth, it is necessary to augment unity, and to maintain  stability and sobriety, while promptly eradicating factors of  instability so as to ensure the smooth progress of reform,  opening up, and economic development.</p>

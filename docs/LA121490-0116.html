			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> BOHMAN WILL HEAD UNION HIGH BOARD  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach Union High School District board has unanimously elected  trustee Charmayne Bohman as its new president.  </P> <P> Bohman, the board's vice president for the past year, succeeds Linda  Moulton-Patterson, who left the board after being elected last month to the  Huntington Beach City Council.  </P> <P> Bohman, 53, a psychologist and a professor at Cal State Dominguez Hills, was  elected to the board in 1987.  </P> <P> Although the district in recent years has been strapped with budget constraints  and other problems, its trustees typically have quelled any potential turmoil  by working collectively to address those issues, a strategy that Bohman said  will continue in her term.  </P> <P> "Linda and I have been very close while we've been on the board, and we have a  lot of similarities in terms of our direction for the district and (in)  personality," Bohman said Thursday. She added that curriculum reform and  continued anti-gang efforts will be among the board's main concerns in the  coming year.  </P> <P> Trustee Bonnie Castrey, the board's clerk the past year, was promoted Tuesday  to vice president, and member Jerry Sullivan was elected the new clerk.  </P> <P> Trustees are tentatively scheduled to choose a new member to fill  Moulton-Patterson's seat at their Jan. 29 meeting.  </P> <P> Applications for the post will be accepted at the district office at least  through the end of the year, Thomas said.  </P> <P> Any registered voter living within the district boundaries, which includes  Huntington Beach and parts of Fountain Valley and Westminster, may apply for  the board position.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- An anti-U.S.  demonstration was staged in London on March 26 to condemn the  United States for aggravating the situation of the Korean  peninsula.    Taking part in the demonstration were representatives of  some  20 political parties and organizations including the New  Communist Party of Great Britain, the Britannic Communist Party,  the Revolutionary Communist Party of Great Britain  (Marxist-Leninist), the Revolutionary Communist Group of Great  Britain, the British Anti-Imperialist Youth Organization and the  British Organization of Solidarity with the Third World.    They staged a protest in front of the U.S. Embassy for  hours,  strongly urging Washington to stop at once threat to the DPRK  and the "Team Spirit" and all other actions of military  provocation.    The protesters contended that the nuclear issue of the  Korean  peninsula must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks.    Speeches were made by some representatives during the  demonstration.    Hugh Stephens, representative of the Britain-Korea  Friendship  Committee, in his speech called for the formation of a  nonpermanent organization to defend the DPRK, noting that the  prevailing situation was demanding a more organized movement to  defend socialist Korea from the imperialists' moves to provoke  another war.</p>

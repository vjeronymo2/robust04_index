			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / When write is wrong: Louise Kehoe explains why Apple's Newton has disappointed We believe that Newton will be seen as the defining technology of the digital age,' John Sculley, former chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, said last August, as he unveiled the hand-held electronic 'personal digital assistant' shortly before leaving the company. It is an event that Michael Spindler, Sculley's successor as chief executive, would prefer to forget - along with the many other occasions when the 'previous administration' raised expectations of Newton. In particular, he may not like to recall that, according to Sculley, Newton would be the centrepiece of Apple's strategy 'to play a leading role in a Dollars 3.5 trillion market, by the end of the century, for a new class of consumer products' blending computer and communications technologies with entertainment and information services. Far from leading a technology revolution, Newton has achieved mediocre sales and attracted a backlash of ridicule for Apple. Sculley had promised that Newton would 'read' handwritten notes and enable users to send and receive messages. But the software was unreliable and the communications capabilities limited. 'Retail sales of Newton have been disappointing,' Spindler finally acknowledged a week ago. He blamed poor salesmanship, however, rather than Apple technology. In January, Apple said 75,000 Newtons had been shipped. The company refuses to give an update, but estimates put the figure at less than 100,000 - nowhere near the number it hoped to sell. The departure this week of Gaston Bastiaens, head of Apple's Personal Interactive Electronics (PIE) division, which is responsible for Newton, has created uncertainty about the future of Apple's consumer electronics efforts. Bastiaens, who spent more than 20 years at Philips before joining Apple, is 'setting up his own business activities', Apple said. He was not available for comment. The division has been temporarily placed under the control of chief financial officer Joseph Graziano, which indicates that the division's finances are coming under closer scrutiny as Apple struggles to remain profitable. The second quarter results, reported this week, illustrate its problems. While revenues were up 5 per cent on the same quarter last year at Dollars 2.08bn, net profits were down 84 per cent at Dollars 17.4m. Gross margins have fallen from 38.5 per cent of revenues in the second quarter of 1993 to 24 per cent in the latest quarter. The drop reflects the big price cuts Apple made over the past year as it has battled to maintain its share of the personal computer market. New 'Power Macintosh' desktop computers, introduced in March, are selling well and producing higher profit margins, the company said. But two problems remain: the unprofitable PIE and business systems divisions. Apple Business Systems is responsible for Apple's 'server' products, powerful computers linked to PC networks. On Monday, it will introduce a new generation of servers, hoping for a surge of pent-up demand which should make ABS profitable. In the PIE division, by contrast, there is little prospect for a turnround in the short term. With Newton sales 'disappointing', the division's activities may be curtailed. Spindler insists, however, that Newton remains an important part of Apple's strategy. 'Apple will not walk away from Newton,' says Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies International, a market research group, but he believes Apple's mistake was to launch the hand-held computer before the technology was reliable. 'Newton came out a good 12 months before it should have,' he says. Although Apple last month introduced a second version, which corrects some of the original shortcomings, 'first impressions count for a lot'. Pete Snell, marketing manager of MobilSoft, a software company that has developed spreadsheet and calculation programs to run on Newton, says Apple set unrealistic expectations for Newton. 'Apple's vision of Newton as a consumer product was wrong. We think that it has the potential to become a fantastic business productivity tool, but Apple seems to have missed the point from the beginning.' Others criticise Apple for putting too much emphasis on Newton's handwriting recognition. 'They made it the 'silver bullet' of the product, and when it didn't work that threw the whole concept into doubt,' says Glenn Smith, president of Saltire Software, another Newton software developer. While Newton has not set tills ringing in computer stores, Apple claims some success in selling to businesses. Later this year, it is expected to introduce a tablet-sized version aimed at business users. The product could be saved if it is 'repositioned' as a useful, if less exciting, business tool. Yet a fundamental problem remains. Sculley may have overblown the potential of Newton, but he was prescient in statements about the convergence of computer, communications and consumer electronics technologies. With dozens of other companies targeting the emerging market for multimedia communications, such as interactive television, Apple lacks a strategy on how to address these new opportunities. Newton, it is now clear, will not give Apple the leadership role it craves in the emerging digital consumer electronics market.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDING COLLAPSES NEAR WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> A building in the early stages of construction four blocks from the White House  collapsed Monday night. Three construction trailers and a van, parked on the  sidewalk or in the street, tumbled into the excavation site at 14th and H  streets northwest as ground at the site caved in, fire officials said.  </P> <P> They said the apparent cause was vibrations from a faulty transformer, whose  spectacular arcing could be seen for blocks.  </P> <P> The noisy collapse forced workers to evacuate from United Press International  World Headquarters next door and from other nearby office buildings.  </P> <P> There was no immediate word on any injuries. Special teams were called to  descend into the four-story-deep hole on ropes as officials sought to determine  whether the site was vulnerable to further collapse.  </P> <P> Service was suspended on a subway line running past the area, with trains  turning back at nearby stations on either side.  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Stock Exchange approves order matching The London Stock Exchange yesterday cleared the way for a trading system that will automatically match orders to buy and sell shares. Approval for the system, known as Seaquence, had been opposed by some of the exchange's largest members. The system is due to run in parallel with and compete against the existing market-making system. Yesterday's vote by the exchange board reverses a controversial decision last year and authorises funding to build the system. The move is in response to rising competition from new exchanges. The order-matching system will automatically pair buy and sell orders for a share at the same price. Order matching has been used with great success by Nasdaq, the US-based electronic exchange. The move to order matching is likely to anger market-makers, most of whom are among the largest and most wealthy members of the exchange. Market-makers make firm offers to buy and sell shares at a set price in all market conditions and earn profits on the difference. Last June market-makers on the exchange's board had refused to approve plans to replace the ageing Seaq share-dealing system with one which could incorporate order matching. The plan was only approved after the exchange agreed to cut costs and eliminate the order-matching capacity in the new system - a decision reversed yesterday. The exchange said yesterday: 'The exchange is 100 per cent behind a quote-driven (market-making) system'. The exchange's new chairman, Mr John Kemp-Welch, said he had become particularly concerned about a new dealing mechanism, Tradepoint, which will have order matching and market-making capacity, and by threats from venture capitalists to develop a new exchange to handle dealing in small-company shares. Many stock exchange members believe that market-making has failed to produce the necessary liquidity in small-company shares and that only an order-matching system will meet investors' needs. Mr Kemp-Welch said the exchange would not be able to head off the threat of a small-companies' exchange unless it too offered investors an order-matching system. Several weeks ago Mr Michael Lawrence, the newly-appointed chief executive of the exchange, wrote to exchange members saying that if board members failed to approve funds to build order matching into Seaquence now, it would be far more expensive to do so later. Yesterday's approval applied only to building the software for the system. A decision about whether to proceed with plans to build hardware will be made towards the end of next year, the exchange said.</p>

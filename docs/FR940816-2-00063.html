This Forum is convened in follow-up to a previous Forum on this topic July 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the second Forum is to elicit consumer and other public interest perspectives which will be used in NIH's development of policy on the ``reasonable pricing'' clause, which is currently required in its Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) under the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and exclusive commercialization licenses. The Forum Panel members will discuss how best to ensure that the public investment in products developed through licensing NIH technologies is adequately reflected. Discussion will include an analysis of the clause and the Panel will advise on whether the clause has been useful to ensure that the public investment in collaborative research is adequately considered in the subsequent commercial development of technology arising under such research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the conclusion of the Forum, the Panel will develop and transmit its report to the Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH, for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerned organizations and individuals are invited to present their views at the Forum or submit written views of any length to the Panel.

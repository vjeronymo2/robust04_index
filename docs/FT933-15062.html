			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Germany out in front It is tempting to see this week as one of turning points. The main industrial countries made a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation. Frankfurt equities surged 6 per cent on the unlikely-sounding belief that the German economy had both reached its nadir and that the Bundesbank was set to accelerate the pace of interest rate cuts. An end to Europe's high interest regime would indeed be a relief, but there is a risk of excessive expectations both for that and for the Uruguay Round. The thought that the German economy might be on the turn must worry US and UK funds who are underweight in German equities. But, on a market multiple of more than 20 times next year's earnings, shares are not exactly cheap. The Bundesbank might cut rates sharply to help the French franc. Or, as before, it may do just enough to keep France in the ERM. That will not do much for growth in either country. Besides, if European rates do come down, French shares may benefit more than German. Swiss companies would derive a greater earnings boost from any concomitant appreciation of the dollar. The rush of interest in Germany may owe something to the feeling that equity markets elsewhere look unexciting. That consideration may also help keep money flowing into bonds despite the pressure of industrial country budget deficits. As for the Uruguay Round, it will be a long time before last week's breakthrough is translated into non-inflationary growth. That the Round has been saved from collapse removes a downside risk for equities just the same.</p>

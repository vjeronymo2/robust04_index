			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sophie Shihab report: "Francois Mitterrand Pays Homage to </F> Turkmenistan's Regional Policy"]    [Text] Ashgabat -- On Wednesday 27 April, Francois  Mitterrand saluted Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov with the  words: "I wonder if you are not the only country in this region  not to be involved in the wars being waged in this area and  which are not second-rate conflicts but real wars." In this way  he partly replied to the questions raised by his tour of  Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.    One of the French president's aims was to shed some light on  the conflicts in Central Asia at a time when attention is being  focused on Bosnia, and on the Tajik conflict that may lead  Russia to return to its old imperialist policy. That was  certainly one of the reasons why he chose to visit these obscure  Muslim states of the former USSR, going where no Western head of  state had gone before; this is why he mobilized half a dozen  aircraft and almost 400 people for the five-day state visit to  areas with no modern infrastructure and where the heat is  already crushing, especially on the many visits to archeological  sites. It also explains why he has ignored the fact that the  Uzbek and Turkmen presidents, although signatories to the CFCE  accords, have blithely disregarded their provisions relating to  civic freedoms.  <H5>  Internal Weaknesses </H5>   President Mitterrand explained why he did not intend making  demands on these countries which have never known democracy, nor  "make accusations if not everything is done in Turkmenistan in  the same way as it is done in Paris." If he came here despite  everything, it was because he wanted to demonstrate his support  for them, considering it important, for geopolitical reasons,  that their fragile independence be defended. These two new  states, potential targets for Russia's recolonizing ambitions,  still depend on Russia for their security and are forward posts  of the CIS and buffers for the Russian borders against  Afghanistan and Iran.    This perilous location is compounded by considerable  internal  weaknesses. Mr. Mitterrand said in Tashkent that there was the  threat of "religious intolerance" being added to the "harshness  of the times," i.e, the post-Soviet economic crisis that, in the  case of Uzbekistan, is affecting the most densely populated  country of central Asia, whose population grows by 500,000 each  year. There is therefore every risk that sooner or later the  extremists could get a stranglehold if foreign investments are  delayed.    There is also the risk that Uzbek President Islam Karimov  will seek to position himself to an even greater extent as the  leader of a regional power "imposing stability" not just on his  own people, which Mr. Mitterrand welcomed, but also on his  neighbors, all of which have Uzbek minorities. This, the French  president indirectly condemned by praising the opposite stance  adopted the Turkmen neighbors.    Unlike Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan does not participate with  the  Russians in the "collective peace forces" deployed in Tajikstan.  Also unlike Uzbekistan, and Iran and Pakistan, Turkmenistan is  not involved in the inter-Afghan conflicts except as an  attempted mediator. According to a presidential spokesman, the  Turkmen president told Mr. Mitterrand that they were waiting for  a "new man to emerge in the Pashtoon groups, capable of  triggering national reconciliation."  <H5>  Targeting the Insidious Forces </H5>   President Niyazov has good reasons for implementing this  wise  foreign policy. With less than 4 million inhabitants but a vast  area rich in gas reserves and a border of over 1,000 km with  Iran, his country may look easy prey. Mr. Mitterrand told him  on Thursday at the official dinner: "Your independence is  certainly not threatened and the usurpation of power today is  done by more insidious means, without necessarily requiring  recourse to arms." The "insidious" forces he targeted are not so  much the Iranians, neighbors with whom Mr. Niazov claimed he had  no problems, as the Russians, since the only gas pipeline  leaving the Turkmen gas fields crosses through Russian  territory, supplying the insolvent countries of the CIS. Thus,  Mr. Niyazov is a proponent of building a second gas pipeline to  the south, toward the European markets.    Mr. Mitterrand pleased his host by stating on Wednesday that  he did not share Washington's objections at sending the pipeline  through Iran. He also pleased him by promising, as he had also  promised the Uzbek president, that he would soon be sending a  French military mission to look into the possibility of  cooperation in the domain of air traffic control training and  border patrols. These cooperation plans could also be envisaged  within the framework of the NATO Partnership for Peace. With  regard to this, the Turkmen president apparently amazed his  French interlocutors by saying that he had already signed the  framework agreement of the partnership.    Undoubtedly satisfied, on Wednesday the Turkmen president  also agreed to sign an agreement with [French construction  magnate] Martin Bouygues, who traveled in the presidential  plane. This agreement covers the construction of the new  presidential palace in Ashgabat and has been in the making for  over a year. It is worth 400 million French francs, payable in  cash during the construction work.    It is certainly quite legitimate and within the rules for a  presidential visit to open the door for French companies.  However, the Bouygues contract, which is not a priority in a  country whose new currency has plummeted over recent months,  could feed the discontent of the Turkmen people, despite the  pride they might take in seeing their president well-housed.  That was certainly not one of the aims of Francois Mitterrand's  visit.</p>

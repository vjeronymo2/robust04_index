			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Brokers at risk The stock market yesterday was prepared neither for the size of Sedgwick's dividend cut nor for such stark evidence of the damage which economic stagnation on both sides of the Atlantic is doing to international insurance brokers. Investors perhaps have been confused by recent signals from UK insurers that London market rates are hardening, a development which Sedgwick does not deny. What yesterday's 55 per cent fall in its second-quarter profits underlines, though, is that premiums in the important US retail market are tumbling and that rate rises where they do occur elsewhere do not necessarily flow through into increased brokerage income. Apart from a tendency by companies to self-insure in difficult times, the fact is that commercial risks have been shrinking as the value of assets and the size of payrolls and turnover have declined. The issue remains, though, how far the general savaging of broking shares yesterday was justified. Given its similarly large US exposure there may be further nervousness ahead of tomorrow's results from Willis Corroon, whose price yesterday fell a mere 7 per cent against 24 per cent for Sedgwick. The former's dividend may not be in such immediate jeopardy, but the squeeze on dollar earners is painfully evident from Sedgwick's figures. Thanks to accelerating the closure of hedging positions, it has managed to limit the first-half fall in interest and investment income to 10 per cent; with 60 per cent of its cash in dollars the decline is likely to be more than 20 per cent in the second half. Without a strengthening of the dollar the translation rate of US profits will also deteriorate. A halved dividend for the year now seems inescapable, if sustainable. Given the wafer-thin cover of recent years, the question is whether some form of cut was not always inevitable.</p>

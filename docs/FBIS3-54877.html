But Both Count on  Electors' Votes"]    [Text] Filling Ukrainian television airwaves and  newspapers, President Leonid Kravchuk, Parliament Speaker Ivan  Plyushch, and his first deputy Vasyl Durdinets spoke about one  thing -- the need for holding elections for a new Supreme  Council of Ukraine. More explicit was Leonid Kravchuk, who  stated that "agitation against the elections is agitation  against the state." Statements of this sort are quite  explainable for two main reasons. First, today's state leaders  have realized the need for a new additional legitimation of the  old political system of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic  led by party nomenklatura in a new political guise. This  legitimacy can be lent to the present "party of power" only by  new elections in accordance with a formally new election law.  Second, the mentioned law gives the party of power political  and legislative advantages at the time of elections owing to  which each branch of this "party" -- pro-president and  pro-Soviet -- wants to win the elections, eliminate its rivals,  and establish its own vision of development of the state.    Leaders of the opposition came up with a totally different  assessment of the past year and the new one. Vyacheslav  Chornovil, chairman of the People's Rukh of Ukraine, stated that  "despite all the actions of leaders of the state it has not yet  collapsed. Despite the anti-people majority in the  pseudo-parliament, despite the senseless decisions by the Kuchma  government, to say nothing about the despicable  Kravchuk-Zvyagilski government, we are still holding out." In  the opinion of Vyacheslav Chornovil, today too, a majority of  Ukraine's population would vote for independence but not the  sort of independence offered to them by the present leaders of  the country. Vyacheslav Chornovil also said he did not see the  next year as being happy. The Rukh leader once again said that  the election campaign was difficult because, he stated, the  "`party of power' is straining every muscle not to let reformers  come to power once again." According to Vyacheslav Chornovil,  Ukraine's new parliament will hardly be worse than the present  one, and quite probably it is this parliament that will raise  the question of forming a government of reforms. Vyacheslav  Chornovil assessed the chances of creating such a government as  being 50 to 50 percent. "Even if the government jump-starts  reforms, in the new year we will already be able to sense some  of their results like, for example, a sharp decline in the rate  of inflation. Even if there are resolute reforms, stabilization  of the living standard and progressive changes in the economy  are possible only by the end of the year," the Rukh leader  summed up.    Ivan Zayets, chairman of the parliament opposition, has  stated that through the fault of the "party of power" last year  was a "year of deceleration" when the main mistake of an  independent Ukraine revealed itself -- no political reform of  power had been carried out -- which, according to I. Zayets,  halted the processes of the state's organizational development.  "We should implement the second stage of the  national-democratic revolution -- to follow up the declaration  of independence with decommunization and decolonization. The  year 1994 will be crucial. I think we will after all be able to  hold the elections, to pass a new constitution and progressive  laws. Democracy should win out at the elections, and this will  pave the way to reforms. The second half of 1994 will be a time  of genuine reforms which would start the mechanism of  self-regulation of the economy," Ivan Zayets has stated.    Volodymyr Lanovoy, former first vice premier for questions  of  economic reform and now general director of the Center for  Market Reforms, spoke on the same subject in more restrained  terms. He stated that Ukraine needed a government of reformers  that would carry out reforms, and only then "will Ukraine see in  the next New Year with a different mood."</p>

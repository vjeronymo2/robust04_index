			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Lonrho to finance Libyan film about Lockerbie: Caribbean shell company set up for Pounds 633,000 documentary Lonrho and the Libyan government have set up a Caribbean shell company to finance a Pounds 633,000 documentary film about the Lockerbie bombing. The disclosure of the secret partnership between the UK-based conglomerate and Libya in the film project comes just days before tough new United Nations sanctions against the country are due to come into force. These include a freeze on Libyan assets held abroad to in-crease pressure on it to hand over for trial in the west suspects accused of blowing up the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. The deal has prompted a further division between Mr Dieter Bock and his joint Lonrho chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, who is responsible for Lonrho's involvement in the film. Mr Bock is known to be embarrassed by the Libyan connection and wants to minimise business dealings with the state. But Mr Rowland, who is currently abroad and was unavailable for comment yesterday, has accumulated what he believes to be evidence that Libya was not responsible for the bombing and has passed this to UK ministers. The film is being made by Mr Allan Francovich, a producer from the US who has made a number of highly praised documentaries about the US Central Intelligence Agency. It is being funded by Metropole Hotels, which is two thirds owned by Lonrho and one third by the Libyan Arab Finance Company, the main investment vehicle of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. Metropole has set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, called Hemar Enterprises. Hemar hired Mr Francovich as director and producer of a 90 minute television documentary, with a budget of Pounds 632,948. Metropole has deposited Pounds 105,000 of this into Hemar's account at Credit Suisse in Zurich, Switzerland. At a Metropole board meeting in August, members were told that talks had been held between the LAFC and Lonrho directors about the possibility of making a film on 'Libyan issues'. Mr Rowland then suggested that it should be financed by Metropole. One Metropole director, Mr Martin Bolland, said at the meeting that he was concerned at possible adverse publicity for the group. However, Mr Rowland - supported by Mr Smeida El Naili and Mr Mohamed Ali El Huwej, both of the Libyan Arab Finance Company - instructed that Hemar should be set up by Metropole and should have only three directors: himself; Mr Ken Etheridge, the former policeman who is head of security at Lonrho; and Mr El Naili. Mr Francovich said he had complete control of the project and could withdraw if there was any interference from Lonrho or the Libyans. He said he had already found out some 'incredible' details about the background to the bombing and that shooting would start in 'three or four weeks'. He has requested interviews with the alleged Libyan intelligence agents, Mr Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Mr Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, whom the UK and US governments want to try in connection with the bombing. Recently, Mr Rowland said he felt honour bound to work closely with Libya since selling it the Metropole stake for Pounds 177m in 1992.</p>

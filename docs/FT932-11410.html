			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (7): Backlash against traditional parties  -A variety of protest votes in 1991 sent shock waves through Flanders politics POLITICALLY, the last 18 months have been difficult for Flanders. When Belgium went to the polls in November 1991, it was the northern part of the country which suffered most from the backlash against traditional political parties. Vlaams Blok, a right-wing extremist party dedicated to the expulsion of immigrants from Flanders, won 10.4 per cent of the regional vote - 25 per cent in Antwerp - and more seats in the Flemish (and Belgian) parliaments than the moderate Flemish nationalist party, the Volksunie. Each of the dominant parties in Flanders, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, saw support slip by more than 4 per cent. For good measure, an anti-political party headed by maverick millionaire Jean-Pierre Van Rossem, came from nowhere to capture 5.2 per cent of the vote and four seats on the Flemish regional council. The shock result was not confined to the north, but according to the caricature outsiders' view of Belgium (a country split into two or more regions, Yugoslav-style, by absurd linguistic struggles and dangerous extremism) Flanders was the real villain of the piece. But at the same time, Flanders - with its increasing economic strength and historic sense of identity - is well-placed to gain from constitutional reforms edging their way through the Belgian parliament which devolve more powers to the regions. The question for traditional parties is how to take advantage of those reforms without encouraging extreme Flemish nationalism which would further tarnish the region's political reputation, particularly outside Belgium. In opposition, the liberal PVV, headed by neo-Thatcherite Guy Verhofstadt, has taken the most drastic step. In November last year it turned itself into a new party, the VLD (liberal democrats), which is set to become the biggest party in Flanders and Belgium. The PVV was the only traditional party to gain votes in Flanders at the election. Verhofstadt also cannily decided not to participate in the Flemish government coalition, formed in February 1992 out of socialists and Christian Democrats. It turned out to be shrewd move. An opinion poll published at the end of last year in La Libre Belgique, one of Belgium's francophone daily newspapers, indicated that the VLD was the most popular party in Flanders, with a rating of 26.1 per cent, against 22.3 per cent for the CVP. Verhofstadt says he and his liberal colleagues were motivated to form the VLD - a party for the citizen - when they realised that Belgium's traditional ruling parties appeared to be taking little notice of the popular 'protest vote' in the November 1991 poll. 'A million people voted for extremist parties, and anti-political parties, and yet we've only changed the prime minister and the (national) coalition is continuing with the same policy,' he says. The governing coalition in Flanders has taken a different tack. Inspired by Luc Van den Brande, its Christian Democrat leader, the Flemish government published in March a lengthy strategy document, Flanders-Europe 2002. Van den Brande says the Flemish government wanted to encourage the people of Flanders to abandon selfish short-termism and look to the future. Concentrating on seven areas of strategy - from culture and employment through to transport, education and housing - the document is an ambitious attempt to lay out broad policy lines for the next decade. On constitutional reforms, both Verhofstadt and Van den Brande agree that they are only the most recent stage in a longer process which began over 20 years ago. 'This is an important step, and we should try to implement it properly,' says Van den Brande, 'but it isn't the last step.' Flanders has already achieved much autonomy through previous state reforms. The region also has an advantage over its Walloon neighbour in that the Flemish regional council and the Dutch-speaking community council have merged into a single body, the Flemish council. The Flemish government controls environment, housing, and energy policy, industrial economic strategy, public works and transport, as well as education, culture and welfare policy. This year's reform adds agriculture and foreign trade to those powers. It also provides for a directly elected Flemish parliament - in the current system, national deputies also sit in the regional and community councils. If there is a further round of constitutional reforms, most Flemish politicians would like to see greater devolution of financial and fiscal responsibility to Flanders, instead of the region having to rely on donations from the central treasury. Flemings also continually stress the need for a more 'balanced' approach to welfare payments. At the moment social security is still managed by the central state, but the wealthier residents of Flanders claim they are underwriting social security payments to jobless Walloons. It is probably still too soon for the angry political debate to become a serious proposal for reform, but as one Flemish economist points out, the devolution of education policy to the regions was an equally explosive issue in the 1980s, but 'now it's regionalised and everyone is more or less happy with it'. How likely is it, then, that this gradual reform will end in a separatist solution to Belgium's complex political problems, with Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels - which is a region in its own right - going their own way? Politicians from the Socialist, Christian Democrat and Liberal Democrat parties in Flanders are in accord on this point. Most Flemings do not want to cut themselves off from their southern neighbours, say the politicians, but they do want a 'fair, federalist solution,' for practical as much as sentimental reasons, based on dialogue between regions and communities. It sounds like common sense. But in practice, all Belgian politicians like to keep a little separatist rhetoric up their sleeves, just in case dialogue turns into confrontation, as it often has in the past. In addition, neither Flanders nor Wallonia is a static political entity, waiting for reform to happen. Both are hyperactive self-promoters, pinning their hopes on a role for the regions within Europe, rather than clinging on to the apron-strings of Mother Belgium. Mr Van den Brande, for example, has already published a strategy document which lays out a Flemish 'foreign policy', ahead of the latest reforms, which give the regions the ability to sign international treaties in their own policy areas. In this international public relations battle, the success of extremists in the 1991 election was a clear setback for Flanders. Next year's municipal elections in Antwerp and other cities may indicate the extent to which the extremist vote was merely a symptom of wider popular disgruntlement. In the meantime, the more moderate politicians in Flanders can only hope that renewed Flemish pride will manifest itself in an outward-looking, entrepreneurial spirit, rather than in unattractive, inward-looking nationalism.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                Popularity of Flemish political parties (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PARTY                          NOV '91     SEPT '92     DEC '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Liberal democrats (VLD)            19%       22.5%*        26.1 Christian democrats (CVP)         26.9         23.6        22.3 Socialists (SP)                   19.6         17.4        16.3 Vlaams Blok                       10.3         11.9        11.4 Agalev (greens)                    7.8         10.8        10.9 Rossem                             5.1          5.8         5.7 Volksunie                          9.3          6.7         5.4 Others                             2.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *VLD was only formed in November 1992.

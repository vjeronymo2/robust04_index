			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Fiscal 1993 tax revenues are  expected to fall short of the government's estimates, with  declared income tax proceeds posting lower-than-projected  growth, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] said Thursday [2 June].    The ministry reported that cumulative revenues from taxes  levied as of April for fiscal 1993 came to 47,496.83 billion  yen, up a scant 0.8 percent from the year before but lower than  a 2.3 percent growth estimated in the third supplementary budget.    The figures are for taxes in fiscal 1993 that ended on March  31.    The taxes collected as of April 30 came to 87.2 percent of  the 55,650.00 billion yen estimated in the supplementary budget,  the rate being down 1.2 percentage point from a year earlier.    "Attaining the supplementary budget estimates is not easy,"  a  ministry official said, citing the lower-than-expected growth in  declared income tax proceeds.    He said it all depends on corporate and consumption taxes to  be collected in May for the fiscal 1993 book closing in March by  almost all Japanese companies. "We can't give definite  estimates because big fluctuations are expected," he said.    But private think tanks projected an overall revenue  shortfall of some 1 trillion yen for fiscal 1993.    Because of the prolonged economic slump, the government has  already trimmed tax revenue estimates twice in two extra budgets  following the initial 1993 budget.    Cumulative proceeds from declared income tax as of the end  of  April came to 4,573.96 billion yen, up 0.9 percent from the year  before, but sharply lower than the estimated 11.4 percent growth.    Yearly declarations are made by March, and declared income  taxes are levied in April.    "Declared income tax revenues are certain to fall below the  estimates" of 5,302.00 billion yen, the official said.    Overall tax revenues for April alone came to 5,150.68  billion  yen, up 1.7 percent from the year before, the ministry reported.    Income tax revenues in April totaled 3,563.21 billion yen,  up  3.5 percent, with cumulative revenues standing at 22,991.85  billion yen, up 2.1 percent but lower than the previously  estimated 3.9 percent growth.    Declared income tax proceeds in April rose 5.8 percent to  2,299.64 billion yen, and withholding tax revenues fell 0.5  percent to 1,263.57 billion yen.    Corporate tax proceeds in April fell 8.0 percent to 551.23  billion yen, stemming from sluggish earnings by both major and  smaller companies that closed their books in February, the  official said.    As a result, cumulative corporate tax revenues stood at  8,937.71 billion yen, down 10.2 percent, compared with a  projected 1.5 percent decline.    Consumption tax revenues dropped 8.0 percent in April to  427.69 billion yen, with the cumulative amount standing at  3,932.74 billion yen, up 9.1 percent and higher than an  estimated 4.1 percent rise.    As for other major items, the official said there were no  major changes in the tax revenue trends.</p>

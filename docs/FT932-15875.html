			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors 30% lower DAGENHAM Motors Group, the London and south-east main Ford dealer, finished 1992 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.48m, a reduction of 30 per cent on the previous Pounds 2.11m. In November, the group warned that second half profits were likely to fall short of market expectations; in the event they came to Pounds 357,000. The final dividend is held at 4p for an unchanged total of 5.75p, from earnings per share of 5.6p (8.1p). Mr David Philip, chairman, said it was again a difficult year, particularly the last quarter when most manufacturers were discounting heavily. However, improvements in working practices, acquisition of new outlets and weakening of competition enabled the group to lift turnover 23 per cent to Pounds 155.9m. New car sales increased 30 per cent to 7,723 units and used car sales by 22 per cent to 6,290. Mr Philip said profits in the first quarter of the current year were ahead with all nine dealerships profitable. Trading at Brownings Electric and Dagenham Motors Security had been satisfactory.</p>

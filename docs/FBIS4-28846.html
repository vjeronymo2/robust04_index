			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The Military Armistice  Commission (MAC) has suspended foreign tourist trips to the  truce village of Panmunjom, while the South Korean Defense  Ministry is restricting the number of foreigners who visit  underground tunnels near the truce line, tourism sources said  Tuesday.    The moves are apparently related to the rising tension  fueled  by the North Korean nuclear dispute, the sources said.    The MAC recently notified the Korea Travel Bureau, Inc. of  its decision to suspend visits by foreign tourists to Panmunjom  for a week from Monday. The travel company has exclusive rights  to arrange foreign tourists' trips to Panmunjom.    Without citing any reason, the MAC said that such tours  would  be possible again in a week.    With the MAC notification, the travel company has canceled  Panmumjom tours which amount to an average 100 foreign tourists  per day.    A business source said the MAC has often suspended Panmunjom  tours according to conditions at the truce village, such as  military training, and speculated that the abrupt suspension  might not be related to the tension between South and North  Korea.    Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry recently did not approve  parts of applications submitted by travel agencies for  foreigners to tour underground tunnels dug by North Korea at the  truce line, causing the cancellation of these tours.    Another business source said the Defense Ministry had  notified the Korea Association of General Travel Agents that the  number of Korean and foreign tourists recently exceeded the  appropriate number of people to observe the tunnels.</p>

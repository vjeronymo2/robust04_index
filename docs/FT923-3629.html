			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Worries in mortgage market MANY of Sweden's bank customers are worried that the unprecedented increase in the marginal rate - the rate at which the central bank lends to other banks - would be reflected in higher interest rates on home loans and mortgages, Our Foreign Staff writes. Svenska Handelsbanken, one of the biggest commercial banks in Sweden, told customers yesterday that if they wanted to take out new loans, the bank would not be able to provide any indication yet of where the interest rates would be pitched. Some mortgage lenders have already acted on the news and raised mortgage rates. Statshypotek, a mortgage lender, raised its rate from 17.5 per cent on Tuesday to 24 per cent yesterday. Sweden's main savings bank raised rates on personal loans by 2.5 percentage points to 18-20 per cent.</p>

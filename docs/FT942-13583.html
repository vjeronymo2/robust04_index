			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Black Sea fleet talks fail: International News Digest Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on dividing the Black Sea fleet collapsed in acrimony yesterday and the Russian delegation stormed out of the meeting, officials said. The two sides agreed on a formula giving Ukraine just under 20 per cent of 833 ships making up the former Soviet fleet. But each blamed the other for falling out over the issue of where to base the naval forces. Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev refused to sign the document on splitting up vessels and left Sevastopol without telling members of his own delegation of his departure. Russia insisted it wanted full control of Sevastopol, the fleet's current headquarters, and wanted no Ukrainian naval presence in the Crimean peninsula, where the majority ethnic Russian population is seeking closer ties with Moscow. Ukraine's Defence Ministry accused Moscow of 'refusing to use common sense and understand Ukraine's legitimate position'.</p>

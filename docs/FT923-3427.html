			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / De Klerk calls for early summit with Mandela SOUTH Africa's President F W de Klerk yesterday welcomed the decision by Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, to attend an emergency summit on violence. 'What is now of critical importance ..is that we should meet as urgently as possible,' Mr de Klerk said after meeting senior ministers. He said the constitutional development minister, Mr Roelf Meyer, would discuss a time and venue for the meeting with ANC secretary-general Mr Cyril Ramaphosa. Mr Ramaphosa said on Thursday the ANC would refuse to attend such a meeting until the government had taken steps to meet certain conditions. But he left open the possibility of negotiating around the conditions. These included releasing 400 prisoners whom the ANC claims are political prisoners, as well as banning the carrying of dangerous weapons in public and implementing measures to prevent the use of single-sex hostels to launch attacks on surrounding black townships. Yesterday government officials rejected the ANC conditions, but observers nevertheless expected both sides to find a way of allowing the talks to take place. The ANC and the government seem set for a test of wills over these issues, which had been under discussion for some weeks before the Ciskei massacre. The ANC judges that its bargaining position has been strengthened after the events in Ciskei, which have been condemned worldwide, and that it can use this added leverage to force an agreement on the release of political prisoners. The government is hoping to enlist the international community to pressure the ANC into attending the violence summit, without making any further major concessions on the prisoners. Action cannot be delayed indefinitely, however, as the ANC made clear yesterday it would pursue its campaign against anti-ANC homeland leaders by marching next weekend on the capital of the Bophuthatswana black homeland, ruled by President Lucas Mangope, one of the organisation's most bitter rivals. ANC officials said they would adopt a less confrontational strategy than in Ciskei, where 28 people were shot dead by security forces after marchers deviated from their permitted route. But the potential for violent conflict in Bophuthatswana remains high. Meanwhile business welcomed the ANC's decision to attend talks on violence. 'Even a conditional positive response by the ANC alliance to renew high-level negotiations could have an early favourable impact on business confidence,' South African Chamber of Business Director Raymond Parsons said in a statement. The South African Defence Force yesterday said the armed wing of the ANC was plotting to kill Ciskei homeland leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. The ANC denied the allegation, saying the organisation was 'in no way planning to assassinate Gqozo. We reject the charge as false propaganda.' General George Meiring, the South African army chief said the ANC, which formally suspended its armed struggle when it was legalised in February 1990, appeared to be stockpiling arms in the region. The cache included a rocket launcher and Ciskei security force uniforms, he said. 'Since the tragedy (on Monday), Ciskei is experiencing violence on a scale not seen in a long time,' General Meiring said. 'At least 15 houses belonging to members of the Ciskei defence force and police have been burned.'</p>

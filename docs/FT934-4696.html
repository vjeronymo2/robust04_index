			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: US groups in PC/TV link Intel and General Instrument of the US have jointly developed new high-speed communications devices linking personal computers to cable TV networks to provide a broad array of information services. The technology can transform a cable TV network into a data pipeway to the home, delivering information 1,000 times faster than via standard telephone lines, the companies said. The development is the latest evidence of the rapid convergence of computer, communications and consumer electronics technologies. Intel is the world's biggest maker of computer chips and General Instrument is a leading designer of TV set-top devices for cable TV systems. Both companies are also developing technologies that will upgrade television sets so they become terminals for interactive information services but personal computers are more likely to lead the way toward broad use of home information services, the companies said. 'The much touted congruence of high-speed communications and computing will intersect at the PC long before anywhere else,' said Mr Andrew Grove, Intel's chief executive. Approximately 24m US households now own at least one PC, while 60m US homes are linked to cable TV networks. 'This breakthrough could open up a vast new market of home PC-based on-line services that cable system operators could provide with minimal capital investment,' said Mr Daniel F. Akerson, chairman and chief executive of General Instrument. Two leading cable system operators, Comcast and Viacom International, are planning to field-test the technology next year. America On-Line and Prodigy, two leading on-line information service providers, said they would participate in the trials. The Viacom test will take place in Castro Valley, California, where 500 homes will initially be provided with modems to link PCs to on-line information services, on-line games, and software distribution. Details of the Comcast trial were not available. Further blurring the lines between television and computer services, America On-Line said it would also team up with General Instrument to develop services for interactive television in 1994.</p>

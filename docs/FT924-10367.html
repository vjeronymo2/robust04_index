			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Books: In the steps of Daniel Defoe - FT Childrens' Book of the Month THE GREAT ELEPHANT CHASE by Gillian Cross Oxford University Press Pounds 8.95, 193 pages IN SPITE of the fact that there will be more than 6,000 new children's books published in the UK this year, the majority of the authors who write for this audience move about the world incognito. Newspapers seldom single out their books for attention; and the winners of even the most prestigious awards for children's literature are consistently absent from our television screens. Consider the case of Gillian Cross, whose last novel Wolf, a sparely written and compelling psychological thriller for children of 10 and above, was the winner of last year's Carnegie Medal, the most important literary prize for children's books. It was the sixth time that one of her books had been on the short list (of six a la Booker). This suggests that her work is of an unusually high quality; and yet how many people have even heard of her? The psychological thriller has been her hallmark - earlier books have included Roscoe's Leap (1987) and A Map of Nowhere (1988); but she has also written very successfully in other areas too. Chartbreak (1986) was a contemporary love story, set in the world of a punk rock band; The Demon Headmaster (1982) had troubling political overtones. Her new novel, The Great Elephant Chase, is set in America in the middle of the 19th century, and it is a pastiche of sorts, reminiscent of Twain and Melville, a spirited, hectic tale full of frontier spirit and brisk, telling detail. The showman Michael Keenan has devised a sure-fire way of making money fast. With the help of an Indian elephant, itself something of a marvel in that part of the world, he is making his way west through the small towns of Pennsylvania, selling bottles of a 'miracle-working tincture' to incredulous crowds who gather to gawp at his marvellous beast. The trick is simple: Keenan plants a 'crippled girl' in the crowd (in fact, it is his own healthy daughter, Cissie); the elephant seizes her in its trunk to the accompaniment of gasps of horror and amazement, and upends her in the air. When she lands, she is in a faint - or perhaps even dead. Then Keenan steps up with a spoonful of his miraculous cure - and the girl is restored to life. The whole crowd seethes around him, desperate to buy. Unfortunately for Keenan, he is being pursued by the sinister Hannibal Jackson who, suspecting trickery threatens blackmail - unless Keenan will agree to sell the animal. Keenan refuses, of course, and escapes by night. Then disaster strikes. Keenan and Cissie's sister are killed on the railroad; Cissie and the elephant survive. Jackson then re-appears, claiming that Keenan had signed a paper before his death, selling him the beast. Cissie refuses to accept that her father would do such a thing, and she escapes - with Jackson and his fiance in hot pursuit. From this point on, the book turns into a breathless chase west - by land and river; flatboat, coal barge and paddle steamer. Cissie travels with Tad, a young orphan whom her father had hired as an elephant boy, and the twosome sweat it out together on the river like Tom and Huck before him. And throughout the whole of their long, wearying journey, Cissie, ever optimistic, cherishes the childish, magical hope of reaching the woman she writes to every day, the mysterious Ketty who lives somewhere way out west in Nebraska, in a white frame house with a cool, green garden. Daniel Defoe would have found much to admire in this book - the author's careful attention to the fascinating practicalities of survival, for example; and even the way in which the map that serves as the book's frontispiece enables us to trace with our finger the fleeing travellers' long and convoluted journey all the way from the imaginary town of Markle in Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh; and from there down the Ohio river and the Mississippi and the Missouri. The provision of a map is an appetite-whetting device, of course; and it is usually, as in this case, some kind of guarantee that the author has done her homework. And the journey itself, while an arduous physical one, is also a trek from childhood to maturity; from ignorance to self-knowledge. Gillian Cross is an optimist at heart; but it is an optimism purged in the fires of endeavour.</p>

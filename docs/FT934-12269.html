			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Carter Holt in Chile move NEW ZEALAND-based forestry concern Carter Holt Harvey is seeking to convert its 30.5 per cent indirect ownership in Copec, its Chilean forestry and fishing associate, into a direct ownership structure, AP-DJ reports from Wellington. Carter Holt, which is controlled by a joint venture between US-based International Paper and New Zealand-based Brierley Investments, said it had initiated the preliminary legal steps necessary for such a move. The New Zealand company currently holds its Copec stake through a joint venture with Angellini Group of Chile. Copec, formally known as Compania de Petroleos de Chile, is one of Chile's largest industrial companies, with operations in forestry, fishing, energy and retailing. Carter Holt said the current ownership structure for its holding in Copec limits its involvement with the company. The New Zealand company sees various opportunities to add value to Copec, and having a direct stake in the company would allow some of these opportunities to be realised. Carter Holt's stake in Copec is worth around NZDollars 1bn (USDollars 555m) and it wants to manage this investment actively. The group has in the past talked of selling its Chilean investments, but said this is not now being considered. The company declined to say whether it planned to increase its stake in Copec. Copec is 61 per cent-owned by Inversiones y Desarrollo Los Andes, which is in turn 50 per cent owned by Carter Holt and 50 per cent by Angellini, a family-owned Chilean concern.</p>

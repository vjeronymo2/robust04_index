			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs urge increase in UN forces BRITAIN'S INFLUENCE in the world will suffer unless it provides more forces to match the increase in UN peacekeeping operations, the Commons defence committee said yesterday, David White writes. The committee, which has already attacked government plans for cutting army staff levels, said it would expect the Ministry of Defence to show it had sufficient forces to meet peacekeeping commitments. It said the UK had lost an opportunity to make a valuable contribution in Somalia by its unwillingness to send ground troops. The committee recognised that the UK could not join every peacekeeping operation but should participate only where its skills were needed. The MPs warned that British forces could not continue indefinitely supporting humanitarian aid in Bosnia while coming under direct attack. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, last night warned that the former Soviet Union still poses a 'conceivable threat'. Defending Nato, he said it would be 'foolish' to do away with collective defence. Defence Committee Report, UK Peacekeeping and Intervention Forces. HMSO. Pounds 22.80.</p>

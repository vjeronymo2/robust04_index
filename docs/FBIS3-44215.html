			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Over 1,200 Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]  troops, gathered at the United Nations-run assembly point at  Muhia, in Mozambique's central province of Zambezia, have  demanded that UN special representative in the country Aldo  Ajello provide them with better conditions. Ajello visited  Muhia yesterday, accompanied by the Mozambican peace negotiator  in the peace process with Renamo, Armando Guebuza, Renamo's  Foreign Affairs Secretary Jose de Castro, and several Western  diplomats.    Renamo fighters at Muhia complained to journalists about  their food and housing. They claimed that insufficient food had  been sent, and they were fed up with the monotony of a diet  consisting essentially of maize and beans. The UN Operation in  Mozambique denies that there is any food shortage in any of 35  assembly points currently opened.    The food is supplied by the World Food Program [WFP], and  the  daily portion of the Mozambican soldier is higher than in any  other WFP operation anywhere in the world.    Mr. Ajello has been visiting the assembly points to see with  his own eyes the real situation in those accommodation areas.</p>

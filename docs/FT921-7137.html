			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (2): A self-financing trend - Conferences WHEN ELECTRONICS giants Philips, Sony and Matsushita wanted to increase awareness among both hardware manufacturers and software developers about interactive compact discs, they decided collectively to sponsor a conference for the trade to tell all of them about this new consumer product. But, unusually in an industry where corporate hospitality is the name of the game, trade delegates were not given free access by the sponsors. Instead, they had to pay Pounds 395, plus value added tax, to attend the conference and associated exhibition. 'We felt that people who were likely to come to the conference expected to get a lot out of it in such a new and exciting area and so were willing to pay,' explains Ms Vanessa Cotton, managing director of the Event Organisation, which put together this and similar conferences. 'Also, our experience has shown that people tend to value more highly events for which they have to pay and so are more likely to turn up,' she says. The conference, first held in the Royal Lancaster hotel in London two years ago and repeated last year, will this year move to the larger facilities available at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre. The conferences have achieved the sponsors' aims of involving current and potential software developers in the new product and demonstrating that the interactive compact discs work on a single worldwide technical standard. 'This has meant that the target audience has focused on the product and not on the companies,' adds Ms Cotton. The use of a self-financing conference to help reach target audiences by the electronics manufacturers shows that conferences are being regarded as an important part of the marketing mix, even in a recession. Such large-scale corporate conferences are the new focus of the conventions business. 'They have to befirmly targeted at specific groups if they are to prove successful,' says Mr Neil Thomas, managing director of Hawksmere Conferences, a London-based organisation. 'For example, we specialise in a lot of the information type of events dealing with new EC legislation and tax issues which people need to know about,' he adds. Mr Paul Swann, managing director of conference production company Spectrum Communications, agrees. 'Companies are giving more emphasis to setting clear objectives for both individual events and further long-term communication programmes,' he says. 'Moreover, there is an increasing practice of measuring results against those objectives, sometimes taking advantage of independent market research among participants before and after the event.' Yet in spite of the popularity of high-profile corporate conferences, the bulk of the market still consists of relatively small meetings. A survey of over 1,000 companies and conference organisers, carried out by the publishers of the Conference Green and Blue Book guides to conference venues, found that more than two-thirds of all conferences are for between only 11 and 100 participants. Only one in every 10 of the conferences it surveyed were for more than 200 delegates. Another survey, carried out by management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, found that the three main purposes of most UK conferences were for training, small executive meetings and general management get-togethers. Yet in the international conference market, the three key types of conferences were: incentive meetings, trade fairs and product launches and large international conventions. The consultants' survey pointed out, however, that 'production companies consider the number of suitable venues in the UK as very limited and most are already booked ahead, with the result that many launches probably go abroad.' In the UK market, the impact of the recession has been most felt in the length of conferences held and the number of delegates attending. Mr Sean Bodkin, sales and marketing manager at the QE II centre, says that 'some which were traditionally spread over three days are now reduced to a single day.' Mr Swann from Spectrum says that 'while a greater diversity of employees, customers and dealers are participating in conferences, the numbers attending individual events are smaller as organisers take more care to ensure that only those for whom they are relevant are invited.' The consultants' survey, which covered nearly 500 conference organisers and venues, also found, not surprisingly, that there had been 'a significant increase in the cost-consciousness of delegates.' Choosing a conference venue is based less on price, according to the Green and Blue Book survey, than on the right room capacity, geographical location and ease of access. Research carried out by the QE II centre found that catering was also ranked highly when conference facilities were chosen. 'We have therefore put a lot into raising catering standards, working closely with our caterers, Leith's,' says Mr Bodkin. The trend, he reports, is for less alcoholic drink to be consumed at lunches, partly as a result of the recession but also due to growing health consciousness among delegates. A more cogent trend than the amount of drink consumed is the growing sophistication of audio-visual and video equipment and presentations at conferences. Although the slide as a means of visual presentation still dominates, it is now definitely in decline. Better computer graphics, video production and video projection equipment have led to significant improvements in the quality of videos shown at conferences. The major development in this area is high definition television, which gives a quality and picture size closer to conventional films than normal video. At present, however, there is no system firmly established as the industry standard, which makes it very expensive to use in conferences: equipment and production costs are running at about twice those of conventional broadcast quality television.</p>

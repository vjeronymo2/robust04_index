			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Floating in rough water The lady may be old but she certainly has a fertile imagination. Until 3.30pm yesterday it looked as though the Bank of England was in an appalling quandary over the gilt market. It had to decide whether to have an auction this month. To duck out might have seemed an admission of inability to fund at all in such difficult markets. A long-dated issue could have easily flopped. A very short-dated one would have appeared like a commitment to a prompt cut in interest rates. By opting for a floating rate issue instead, the Bank seems to have uncovered a rich new seam of demand. The issue will almost certainly appeal strongly to banks which are facing shortage of loan demand, especially since it requires minimal capital backing under Basle risk ratio rules. Of course, targeting bank investors is only possible because the Treasury is nowadays prepared to count sales of gilts to banks as part of official PSBR funding. Abuse of this relatively new freedom could be seen as a wanton disregard of inflationary risk. Some will doubtless also construe yesterday's move as an admission that fixed-rate yields have troughed. The other interpretation is that a readiness to issue floating rate debt is an indication of the Bank's faith in its ability to curb inflation, for much the same reason that it likes to sell index-linked gilts. This argument only holds good if the authorities are cautious about their recourse to the banks. They need to sell enough floating rate debt to ensure the issue is liquid and to allay fears of over-supply in the fixed-rate market. But funding at floating rates is so easy that it could become a habit. Then discipline over economic policy would disappear.</p>

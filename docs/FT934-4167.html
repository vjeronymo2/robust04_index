			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Books: War with the Cazalets - Fiction CONFUSION by Elizabeth Jane Howard Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 416 pages Confusion is the third volume of a planned quartet of novels chronicling the lives of an upper-middle class English family in the decade after 1937, covering, in fact, the last days of such an idyllically privileged caste. Anyone unfamiliar with plucky Polly Cazalet; her unawakened but newly wed cousin Louise; her Sapphic angel of an aunt Rachel; and all the peripheral Nevilles, Angelas, and Wills who make up the cosily networked family, plus the assorted retainers, would find it hard, and probably unrewarding, to catch up with the clan at this late stage. For the hundreds of thousands who have made the saga such a great publishing event no criticism would deter their appetite for more. The Cazalets are not having an exciting War. It is Elizabeth Jane Howard's great achievement to stress the mundane, petty, tribulations of the early 1940s with meticulous accuracy. Much space is given over to food - meals of corned beef hash and sausage meat rissole; to shopping expeditions for bust bodices at long lost department stores like Pontings and Gaylor and Pope; to tedious train journeys. There are impressively few deaths - matched by births and re-births. It is the limitations of war time, plus the natural restraints on young girls of this class (no university for them), which makes Confusion a more pedestrian read than its predecessors. It is still excellent historical literature but Polly and cousin Cary, obviously Ms Howard's favourite Cazalets, seem stuck in an intellectual and social gridlock. There are signs that the writer is happier with children and emerging teenagers - the verbally direct young Neville is the star turn here - rather than with maturing adolescents. Polly and Cary's arrival in London is as dull for us as it is for them, although Ms Howard gives them an agreeably mysterious male protector in the middle aged Archie Lestrange: what are his intentions? does he have any? This is probably what the War was like for most people - a time of waiting, of tedium, of coping. It is the vignettes that come across most powerfully. Villy Cazalet makes the painful discovery at a misjudged dinner that men want more than romance, while sister-in-law Zoe, returning from a desperate visit to her mother, reveals a ready acceptance of the fact. She is picked up on the train by an American officer, and it is American officers who credibly provide most of the glamour and excitement in the novel. I look forward to the conclusion of the chronicle even though I am as bored with some of the characters, especially the spoilt Angela and the long suffering Hugh, as I expect Ms Howard to be. Sometimes she seems to be writing on auto cue: the most minor character suddenly dies; the love lives of the two heroines are given a predictably mechanical twist. It is as painless as over-hearing a long gossip about vague acquaintances, pleasantly detached from reality and hardly disturbing. But the book ends as the war ends and the action steps up apace. Passions are stirred; boats come in. When the Cazalet Chronicle reaches the television screen, its inevitable transformation, Confusion will hardly merit an episode as we approach the long anticipated resolution.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Only three council budgets capped MR Michael Howard, the environment secretary, yesterday confirmed that just three English councils are to have their budgets limited, or capped, by the government this year. The only county council to be capped is Gloucestershire, in which no party has overall control. The two district councils to be capped are Castle Point (Tory) and Harlow (Labour), both in Essex. At just less than Pounds 18m, Harlow's budget was more than twice what the government thought it should be. The small number of councils to be capped - less than half the number of recent years - is a sign of the government's increasingly tight controls on local spending.</p>

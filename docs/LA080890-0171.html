			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA COUNTY A STEP CLOSER TO GIANTS STADIUM  </P> <P> The San Francisco Giants appeared to move closer to a new home away from chilly  Candlestick Park when three more city councils agreed to put a financing plan  for a new stadium on the November ballot.  </P> <P> Late Tuesday night, the Santa Clara, Los Altos and Mountain View city councils  agreed to let the voters decide whether a tax should be imposed on their  communities to help build a $152.8-million, 45,000-seat stadium on 120 acres  south of San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Santa Clara council voted 5 to 2 after debating the issue until 2:30 a.m.  </P> <P> The Mountain View council voted 6 to 0 to place the tax measure on the ballot  although two council members said they opposed the stadium.  </P> <P> "This is a discretionary use of money," Councilwoman Dena Bonnell said. "But I  feel it's my responsibility to let the voters decide if they want to be taxed.  It's their choice."  </P> <P> In Los Altos, the City Council voted 3 to 1 to place the 1% utility tax measure  on the November ballot.  </P> <P> The Saratoga City Council rejected the proposal by a vote of 4 to 1, while the  Campbell council voted 3 to 1 against the stadium.  </P> <P> The Giants got a big boost Monday when the San Jose City Council voted 8 to 1  to support placing the finance plan on the ballot. The plan calls for San Jose  residents to contribute $7 million annually under the utility tax.  </P> <P> Palo Alto council members Monday night voted 8-0 against the tax. Cupertino  also rejected the idea.  </P> <P> The support of San Jose, by far the largest city in the county, and Santa  Clara, site of the proposed ballpark, are the most crucial for the Giants.  </P> <P> If endorsed by voters, the tax would raise as much as $16 million annually from  participating communities. The proposed agreement stipulates that when bonds  are paid off in 30 years, the utility levy would end.  </P> <P> Stadium backers say that even with some Santa Clara County cities voting  against the tax proposal, the project could still go forward.  </P> <P> According to San Jose officials, tax revenues from San Jose, Santa Clara,  Mountain View, Milpitas, and unincorporated Santa Clara County would provide  more than 80% of the needed stadium financing.  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: MGN stock placed The placing of the 54.8 per cent holding in Mirror Group Newspapers belonging to the late Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies finally went ahead yesterday, after a week of intensive pre-placing by brokers for the companies' administrators. More than 219m shares were placed with a variety of institutions, although the strike price of 170p was a little below that which had been expected. The sale raised Pounds 373m. One dealer involved in the placing reported that there was virtually no stock coming back into the market from the offer and that this had been a main plank in the share price's support yesterday. The stock closed at the 170p strike price, down 7. Media analysts said the stock was unlikely to go very far in the short term as the whole sector fretted over the threat of VAT on newspapers in the November budget, and the impact of the recent price war among the press.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Rabin blames Arafat for delay in troops pull-out Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, expressed growing frustration yesterday with Mr Yassir Arafat, intimating that the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman was to blame for holding up Israel's troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho areas. Mr Rabin said he had just received a faxed message from Mr Arafat which ignored the latest Israeli-PLO formula for Palestinian autonomy. Mr Arafat's response, he said, was 'far from anything that was discussed and agreed' by Israeli and PLO negotiators in Cairo earlier this week. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said on Wednesday that the two sides had reached agreement on key issues including the size of the Jericho area, joint Israeli-PLO border controls, and sole Israeli responsibility for security around the perimeters of the Palestinian autonomous areas. But aides to Mr Arafat - who yesterday returned to his Tunis headquarters after visiting Cairo and Amman - claimed that there was no such joint agreement. The purported text of the deal, as published in the Israeli press on Thursday, was little more than an Israeli position paper, they maintained. Mr Yassir Abed Rabbo, a top adviser to Mr Arafat, described Mr Peres' talk of significant progress as 'complete exaggeration. It is an attempt to bluff.' Such claims, said Mr Rabin yesterday, were 'total nonsense.' Israel had been ready to respect whatever was agreed at the Cairo talks, and he was certainly not prepared to allow the PLO to use the Cairo document as 'a new starting line for negotiations'. While acknowledging that time was limited, Mr Rabin insisted that he would not be forced into signing a flawed agreement. There would be no concessions that departed from the framework of the declaration of principles signed in Washington on September 13. Mr Nabil Sha'ath, a PLO negotiator, said late on Thursday that he and his opposite number, Major-General Amnon Shahak, the Israeli deputy chief of staff, would next week begin intensive talks at the Egyptian beach resort of Taba, to try again to resolve the issues. 'We will just spend the next two weeks working day and night,' he added. But Mr Rabin refused to confirm that new talks were scheduled. Rather, he said, he would decide after the weekend how to proceed. There were no longer any sacred dates by which agreements had to be reached.</p>

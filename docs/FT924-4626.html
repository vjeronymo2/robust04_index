			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (3): Leading questions A BRIEFING FOR LEADERS: COMMUNICATION AS THE ULTIMATE EXERCISE OF POWER by Robert L Dilenschneider Harper Business, Dollars 23.00 IS COMMUNICATION the ultimate exercise of power for leaders and would-be leaders? Churchill roared and Montgomery inspired. Here, communication skills were prerequisites of great leadership. Yet admirable as it seems to elevate mastery of communication as the key to modern leadership, there is surely much more to it. The author of this book at least has a good stab at trying to define these wider attributes. He displays a voracious appetite for dissecting and quoting from countless worthy management articles and books and case studies, all meticulously indexed, and from personal encounters with hundreds of business leaders, many of whom have obviously benefited from his counselling. All this distilled wisdom is well organised under four key headings: leadership raw materials; the communication landscape; the communicator's template; and leadership goals. Modern leadership, he maintains, clearly rests on mastery of communication - 'What you say, where you appear, how you advance your message create a portrait of you and determine how your leadership will be interpreted.' The publisher's blurb leads one to expect at least a few rare insights into the qualities of great leadership sorely needed in many contemporary fields, but the promise is only half fulfilled. The author is at pains to stress integrity and ethical standards, but the best we can find is a useful guide to the development and deployment of communication skills to articulate an organisation's vision, values and goals to both internal and external audiences. All this is practical and helpful stuff which ought to be known and implemented by most business leaders and should be studied by those still in the dark. Some of the advice will be ignored at one's peril even when other major issues, such as surviving in recessionary times or lack of confidence, predominate. The more upbeat message is that 'leadership is a behaviour that can be taught and learned' and that charisma is not a vital attribute - in fact it is dismissed as bunk. Uncharismatic leaders can also be loved by being 'wired into every part of the company'. Many aspiring business leaders and those still mystified by the powers of good communications will find this a useful book.</p>

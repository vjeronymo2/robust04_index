			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow easier on bond yields, Nafta worries Wall Street RISING BOND yields and concern about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement kept US share prices anchored in negative territory yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.99 at 3,677.52. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.64 at 463.75, while the American SE composite shed 1.78 to 477.82 and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.87 to 772.45. New York SE volume totalled 251m shares. The markets opened the week in an uncertain mood. Although the economic background continues to improve - official data yesterday showed that industrial production rose a stronger than expected 0.8 per cent in October  -investors remain troubled by several factors: rising bond yields, which may be a precursor of higher short-term interest rates; the high valuations of stock prices, which may lead to a substantial correction if investor sentiment suddenly turns negative; and the possibility that congress may reject Nafta tomorrow. The worries about interest rates were at the forefront yesterday because of an early rise in bond yields. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond initially climbed to 6.18 per cent in the wake of the strong industrial production data, before falling back to the opening level. Nafta was also on the minds of investors, who fear that if congress votes against Nafta this week, long-term economic growth, and corporate profits, could suffer. Shares of the major television network companies were all higher on news of a court ruling that will allow networks to own financial stakes in shows produced by outsiders. CBS jumped Dollars 8 1/4 to Dollars 303 1/8 and Cap Cities ABC Dollars 11 5/8 to Dollars 630 3/4 , while General Electric, parent of NBC, firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 94 1/4 . Paramount Communications fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 as investors appeared unimpressed by a sweetened takeover offer from QVC Network. The original agreed offer from Viacom still appears close to success in the bid battle, although a court ruling today on the legality of a special anti-takeover agreement between Paramount and Viacom may alter the final outcome. Viacom shares were down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 53 1/8 and QVC up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 51 3/4 . Telefonos de Mexico, the biggest 'Nafta-play' in the market, fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 3/8 in volume of 4.6m shares on fears that the trade pact will collapse. UAL dropped Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 142 5/8 after broking house Bear Stearns downgraded the airline's stock. Canada IN contrast to Mexico, Toronto stocks closed sharply lower as profit-taking and worries over the outcome of tomorrow's Nafta vote in the US braked the TSE's recent upward charge. The TSE 300 index fell 21 points to 4,281.8 in trade of 76.8m shares valued at CDollars 741m. Falls led rises by 475 to 331.</p>

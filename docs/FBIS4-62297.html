			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Over 100,000 Signatures Were </F> Collected in Support of S. Shushkevich"]    [Text] An initiative group supporting Stanislaw Shushkevich  has collected over 100,000 signatures. This was declared by  Henadz Shcharbinin, chief of the group for collecting  signatures, at a news conference on 13 May. The 100,000th  signature was placed by Belarusian National Bank Chairman  Stanislaw Bahdankevich. Hence, the initiative group for support  of S. Shushkevich has cleared the hurdle set by the law on  presidential elections. According to Aleh Trusaw, chairman of  the Belarusian Social Democratic Association, specific  difficulties have arisen recently when signature lists had to be  registered at the executive committees: Most of these  administration bodies worked according to their usual schedule  -- with a break for lunch -- making it very inconvenient for  collectors of signatures who had to leave work to register the  signature lists. In Byalynichi, Stolbtsy, for example, officers  of executive councils would unexpectedly leave their offices.  Collection of signatures was impeded in various ways: There  were cases where authorities broke up picket lines of collectors  of signatures in Minsk and Gomel. Usually collectors were not  allowed to enter garrisons. The initiative group reported all  these facts to the Central Election Commission for Presidential  Elections.    Henadz Shcharbinin added that already a few days before 15  May, regional election commissions began checking petitions  supporting Kebich. When they discovered violations of  legislation, they corrected petitions according to the law.  Henadz Shcharbinin demonstrated some petitions in support of  Kebich, on which one person signed for several people, which is  a serious violation of the law on elections.</p>

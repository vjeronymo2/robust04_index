			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Carried along by a delightful Dream - Theatre IN GOOD Shakespeare, the end of the play is the end of expectation. From the opening line, A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, carries an excitement through to a perfect close. The Crucible Company has fashioned a simple, delightful production of Shakespeare's most fantastical play, apt preparation for Peter Pan in December, and a fine 21st birthday present for the Crucible. The production gives Shakespeare played straight, without connivance or distortion. The cumulative effects emerge subtly. The action accrues the energies released at the end, when the actors appear in civvies, dissolving the theatrical illusion even while inviting the audience, in song, to 'bless this place.' The design (by Kendra Ullyart) suits the Crucible's deep three-sided auditorium: an undulating green fronts a classical facade which gives way to a riot of orchids and water lilies beneath an arching bridge, just like Monet's garden at Giverny. The lighting (Geoff Mersereau) at first looked unimaginative, but the forest scenes reveal a green foreground a violet middle-distance and a turquoise backdrop. The acting follows the fine leads of Michael Mueller (Theseus-Oberon) and Alex Kingston (Hippolyta-Titania), the one all chintz and the other all Romany. Both handle the verse with intelligence and tact, implying a stormy, sexy union - 'Ill-met by moonlight, proud Titania' - without obviousness or grossness. Mueller has a working rapport with Clive Kneller's Puck, a ragged-trousered philanthropist who bestows his gifts on the wrong Athenians. In the wood, Titania's fairies are erotic creatures, stalking with naked foot, like women in Thomas Wyatt's verse. They make Bottom's stay there believable. The wood's other inmates, the 'rude mechanicals' present themselves without the usual farce and buffoonery. They elicit the laughter of goodwill rather than the laugh of condescension. Anthony Brown as Bottom finds a gentle amplitude in the Part, all quietness, as if he had listened to Hamlet's advice to the players. He times the lines superbly. Michael Rudman's direction keeps the lightly-cut text humming along. The plot emerges so clearly that new details strike the sense. How about that mysterious woman who never appears? Two of the lovers from Athens are heading for her house when they get lost in the wood. She is Lysander's widow aunt. Lysander should have called ahead, she'd have enjoyed being part of it. A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Crucible Theatre, Sheffield (0742 - 769922) until 24 October</p>

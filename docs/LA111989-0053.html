			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: RUSSIAN JOURNAL BY JOHN STEINBECK PHOTOGRAPHS BY ROBERT  CAPA (PARAGON HOUSE: $10.95)  </P> <P> The first appearance in paper of this travel book, originally published in 1948  by Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck and news photographer Robert Capa.  Both witnessed the destruction that World War II wrought in the western Soviet  Union, and watched the Soviet people begin the daunting task of rebuilding  their shattered country. Perhaps he was inhibited by the language barrier or  the restrictions on his freedom of movement, but Steinbeck's effort to present  a portrait of the Russian people never rises above the superficial. He finds  the "average" citizens friendly, the accommodations abominable, the bureaucracy  comically inept. But he fails to establish the connection between the land and  the people that gives "Travels With Charley" its insightful warmth.  </P></p>

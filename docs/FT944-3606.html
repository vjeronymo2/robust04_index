			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / French internal air routes open France yesterday gave the green light to several airlines, including TAT European Airlines, an affiliate of British Airways, to operate some of the country's most profitable internal air routes. A statement from the transport ministry said that TAT could operate services between Marseilles and Orly airport in southern Paris and from Toulouse to Orly from January next year. AOM, the French domestic airline, has been granted a licence to fly between Marseilles and Orly, while Air Liberte won approval to operate the Toulouse-Orly route. The approval follows a protracted battle between the carriers and the French government, which has resisted the deregulation of domestic routes. An order from the European Commission, however, and a rejection of an appeal from the French government by the European Court of Justice, forced the liberalisation of the routes. The French transport ministry said it was also considering a request by Euralair, the small domestic carrier, to operate the Orly-Toulouse route. According to officials, the airline needs to supply further financial information before approval can be granted.</p>

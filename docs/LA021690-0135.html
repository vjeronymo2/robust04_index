			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A FEW COMPANIES CLEAN UP SUPPLYING OIL CLEANUP GEAR  </P> <P> Phillip Mamatas was awakened at 2:30 a.m. Saturday by an unusual business phone  call. Someone wanted to place an order for 100 rain suits, 100 hard hats, 24  pairs of rubber boots and 20 eyewash bottles -- and they wanted them delivered  to Long Beach on the double.  </P> <P> Despite the odd hour, Mamatas, president of Century Safety Instruments &amp;  Supply Corp. in Orange, was not surprised by the call when he heard who the  customer was. It was Southwest VECO Inc., the Long Beach company hired by  British Petroleum Co. to clean up the huge oil spill off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Since last Friday, when BP asked VECO to help clean up the spill, VECO has  bought $850,000 in supplies and equipment from about two dozen Southern  California companies for use in the beach mop-up operation, said Sharon  Hagelstrom, a VECO spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Century Safety has received a nice chunk of that business -- $71,000 to be  exact -- for a variety of equipment including megaphones and life rings.  </P> <P> While the spill has been a tragedy for the Orange County coastline, a small  bright spot is that it has generated a good deal of business for some Southern  California firms.  </P> <P> The spill "has almost doubled my business for this month," Mamatas said. "But I  didn't want this to happen here or anywhere. I live within a mile of the  beach."  </P> <P> Out of the 23 suppliers hired by VECO, only four were Orange County firms. The  remainder are located in Long Beach or elsewhere in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Bill Cates, VECO's purchasing director, said his firm relied primarily on Los  Angeles County companies that it has done business with in the past.  </P> <P> "We're based in Long Beach, so we do a lot of our business in Long Beach,"  Cates said. "When you call up vendors in the middle of the night, they're going  to expect cash. It's nice if you have established credit with these vendors  already."  </P> <P> Besides hard hats and boots, VECO has purchased a host of other supplies to  clean up the oily mess: 125,000 plastic trash bags, 58,500 absorbent pads,  45,000 rain suits, 13,500 rubber gloves, 240 flashlights, 20 portable light  poles and 16 cellular phones.  </P> <P> In addition to the cost of all that equipment, VECO is spending about $200,000  per day to pay the cleanup crews, Hagelstrom said. VECO was also the prime  contractor for last year's disastrous Exxon-Valdez oil spill clean-up in  Alaska.  </P> <P> Since Monday morning, suppliers have been flooding VECO with phone calls to  offer their services -- and leaving phone numbers where they can be reached at  night, Cates said.  </P> <P> Mamatas and Century Safety's general manager, Mike Luzzi, said they took turns  delivering the supplies to the shoreline clean-up site from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.  last Wednesday.  </P> <P> Luzzi said VECO uses inexpensive vinyl and rubber rain gear to protect the  cleanup crews from toxic oil.  </P> <P> "That's an intelligent and cost-effective way of doing things," he said.  </P> <P> While VECO has been ordering more equipment each day, VECO says the bulk of  supplies have already been purchased.  </P> <P> For Century Safety, the spill clearly has been a windfall. The company has  already supplied more than 8,700 rain suits, 4,000 goggles, 1,000 hard hats and  2,000 pairs of gloves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT IT TAKES TO TACKLE A SPILL  </P> <P> Item: Quantity  </P> <P> Trash bags: 125,000  </P> <P> Absorbent pads: 58,500  </P> <P> Rain suits: 45,000  </P> <P> Boom (in feet): 20,000  </P> <P> Rubber gloves: 13,500  </P> <P> Boots: 4,400  </P> <P> Goggles: 2,000  </P> <P> Hard hats: 1,500  </P> <P> Rakes: 725  </P> <P> Shovels: 400  </P> <P> Flashlights: 240  </P> <P> First aid kits: 60  </P> <P> Water coolers: 60  </P> <P> Light standards: 20  </P> <P> Cellular phones: 16  </P> <P> Cars: 16  </P> <P> Pickup trucks: 6  </P> <P> Vans: 6  </P> <P> Front-end loaders: 5  </P> <P> Security guards: 4  </P> <P> Passenger buses: 3  </P> <P> Farm tractor-trailer: 2  </P> <P> Small boat &amp; trailer: 1  </P> <P> Generator: 1  </P> <P> Source: VECO Inc.  </P></p>

The test will be made on 100,000 volunteers younger than  six.  The test possibly will concentrate in La Pampa, the province in  which the disease has caused more deaths so far. The tests will  begin in a few days after the arrival of the vaccine shipments  from Cuba. The vaccines already have been approved in other  countries like Chile.    Moises Spitz, director of the Malbran Institute, which is in  charge of making the tests, told CLARIN: "Blood samples will be  taken first from those who will be vaccinated, who will be  children younger than six for the most part, who are the most  badly affected group. There are more doubts about the efficiency  of the vaccine at this age. Youths up to 14 years old also will  be vaccinated." [passage omitted]</p>

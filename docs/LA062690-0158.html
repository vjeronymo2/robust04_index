			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAELI GROUP SAYS POLICE BEAT JAILED PALESTINE YOUTHS  </P> <P> An Israeli human rights group said today that Palestinian youths held by police  for alleged security offenses were housed in overcrowded cells and subjected to  routine violence.  </P> <P> B'Tselem, an independent human rights monitoring group, said it found "serious  flaws in every aspect of the manner in which the Israeli police handle the  detention and interrogation of Palestinian minors."  </P> <P> The report focused on overcrowding in the Russian Compound police station in  the center of Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Representatives of the International Assn. for the Rights of the Child visited  the Russian Compound in March and found 39 youths in a cell with 12 beds.  </P> <P> "Almost every minor we interviewed testified that he had been beaten, usually  severely -- slaps, punches, kicks, hair-pulling, blows with clubs and iron bars  -- and pushed to the wall and to the floor," the report said.  </P></p>

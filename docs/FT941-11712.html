			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Insurer to drop bar to union recognition MSF, the white-collar technical union, has secured a new recognition and representation agreement for its 500 members working for Zurich Insurance in the UK. This follows the union's five-month campaign against the Swiss-owned company. Zurich de-recognised the union last January after acquiring Municipal Mutual Insurance. Details of the deal will be announced today. MSF believes it has regained partial recognition partly because of pressure from 83 local authorities which protested to Zurich. Adverse publicity is understood to have caused acute embarrassment to the head office in Switzerland. The new agreement gives MSF representatives seats on the company's consultative staff council. Union officials will have the right to represent members. There has not been a full restoration of the union's position in the company. Just over a week ago Mr Denis White, the company's chief executive in the UK, made clear his dislike for having any trade unionism among its Zurich employees. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association said yesterday that it gained 4,100 members last year.</p>

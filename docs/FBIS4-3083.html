			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "Why Is </F> the Fourth Plenary Session So Slow in Coming?"]    [Text] The Convocation of the Fourth Plenary Session  Is Postponed    In this year's March issue, CHENG MING reported that "the  Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee would  be held in March." The situation has now changed and the  session has been postponed and will not be opened in the near  future.    On 8 March, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee  held  a joint meeting of secretaries of various central departments  and commissions, and of party committees of various provinces,  municipalities, and regions. The meeting was chaired by Ding  Guangen and Hu Jintao, who, on behalf of the Political Bureau  and the Secretariat, announced the decision to postpone the  convocation of the fourth plenary session.    Hu Jintao discussed the reasons for postponing the  convocation of the fourth plenary session and about the Central  Committee's policy for work in future. Hu Jintao said that the  convocation of the session had been postponed after taking the  following six issues into consideration:  <H5>  Hu Jintao on Six Major Issues Causing the Postponement of </H5> the Session    1. The CPC Central Committee, the State Council, the  National People's Congress Standing Committee, various central  departments, ministries, commissions, and offices, and various  provinces, municipalities, and regions should have an identical  appraisal of the current political, economic, and social  situation. (This implies there is not yet any identical  appraisal.)    2. The anticipated goal of anticorruption work, the central  task put forward by the Central Committee, has not yet been  attained and the situation is grim.    3. The pressure of inflation -- the focus of society -- is  intensifying and the central authorities and various localities  have published or are to publish controversial or different  views on measures and policies for reform.    4. Some time is still needed for various central  departments, ministries, commissions, offices, and localities to  thoroughly understand the resolutions and guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.    5. There is a gap in the knowledge and understanding of the  establishment and development of the socialist market economy  between various central departments, ministries, commissions,  offices, and localities. Subjective and objective obstacles  still exist in the course of implementation and promotion.    6. There are no concrete measures for overcoming,  correcting, and resolving the mountain-stronghold mentality,  selfish departmentalism, and anarchy in localities and  departments. As a result, central policies and measures cannot  be comprehensively and correctly implemented in good time.    Hu Jintao said that the Central Committee holds that the  fourth session of the party is to solve some practical problems,  to discuss and adopt some necessary resolutions, policies,  principles, and measures, and to sum up matters which the last  plenary session of the Central Committee wanted to resolve or  implement, and make those matters clear to the whole party and  all the people of the whole country and that the session should  not become a mere formality.  <H5>  Ding Guangen: Central Policies and Principles Are Damaged </H5>   Ding Guangen said at the meeting that a major question is  how  various central departments, ministries, commissions, offices,  party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and  regions, and leadership of governments should comprehensively  and thoroughly understand and grasp central guidelines for work  and how they should conscientiously maintain a high degree of  unity with the central authorities. We must take a stand on  party character, the state's cause, and the people's interests  and conscientiously safeguard the authority of the Central  Committee and the State Council. This is a reliable guarantee  and foundation ensuring the victory of our cause and our advance  toward the new era. It cannot be denied that because of the  expansion of individualism, the mountain-stronghold mentality,  and anarchy in the leadership of some localities, the  implementation of central policies and principles has been  damaged. This has resulted in mistakes in work, it has  objectively brought instability into society, has interfered and  affected to varying degrees the work of the central authorities  with construction as the core and progress in reform and  opening, and has given rise to perplexities and pressure in the  formulation of policies by the central authorities.  <H5>  Jiang Zemin: Localities Should Maintain a High Degree of </H5> Unity With the Central Authorities    When the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference National Committee were in  session, Jiang Zemin and other members of the Political Bureau  and its Standing Committee separately talked with the number one  and number two men of various provinces, municipalities, and  regions and stressed that various localities should keep in  closer touch with the central authorities, let the central  authorities know better what they are doing, have a thorough  understanding of the guidelines of the central authorities, and  maintain a high degree of unity with the central authorities.  Jiang Zemin and Wen Jiabao told leading party and government  officials of Sichuan at a meeting on 10 March: The most  important thing at present is for various localities to have a  thorough understanding of the guidelines of the central  authorities and by no means should each go his own way making  the central authorities a mere figurehead. Jiang Zemin told  leading party and government officials of Shanghai Municipality  and Jiangsu Province: From now on, officials of the central  authorities should meet officials of various localities more  often, keep in closer touch with various localities, let various  localities know what the central authorities are doing, and hold  more small meetings with localities. We can go to various  localities to meet local officials or ask them to come to  Beijing for the meetings. This can solve problems faster and  more effectively.    This shows that the CPC Central Committee is no longer able  to command localities and localities simply do not listen to the  central authorities. It is already difficult to implement and  carry out central guidelines, principles, or policies, and there  are numerous contradictions between the central authorities and  localities. Things are like this even when the chief architect  is still living. We can imagine how the relations between the  CPC Central Committee and various dukes or princes will become  once the chief architect has gone to join the premier.</p>

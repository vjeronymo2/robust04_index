			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEFEAT OF SCHOOL BOND MAY STALL CSUSM PLANS  </P> <P> In one week, Cal State San Marcos moved a step closer to overcoming one  obstacle to opening its new campus on time, only to ram headlong into another.  </P> <P> On Friday, the university received notice that, after 10 weeks of construction  delays, a new contractor had been found to resume work on the first phase of  its campus, scheduled to open in August, 1992.  </P> <P> But, even if the campus is able to make up the lost time -- which is doubtful  -- the rejection of a $450-million higher-education construction bond by state  voters Tuesday might leave the buildings unfurnished, and the opening delayed.  </P> <P> The Legislature already has approved $37 million to build the first phase of  the campus, but the fledgling university was counting on $10 million from  Proposition 143 for its furniture and library.  </P> <P> Ellis McCune, chancellor of the 20-campus California State University system,  said the San Marcos opening might have to be delayed.  </P> <P> The defeat of Proposition 143 "may slow things down in San Marcos," McCune  said.  </P> <P> Because it is the newest state university established, Cal State San Marcos  will be one of the first to feel the pinch. But McCune and University of  California official William B. Baker said the failure of Proposition 143 will  hurt universities statewide, deferring expansion of existing four-year state  universities and community college campuses and delaying the opening of new  colleges.  </P> <P> Despite the pessimistic outlook of state officials, Cal State San Marcos  president Bill Stacy voiced hope Friday that he could get his campus open on  time by going to the state Legislature for needed funds.  </P> <P> "The campus construction continues, and we just need to begin the search for  alternative funding," Stacy said. "There may be time between now and then to  make a second pass at asking legislative leaders, the chancellor and the  governor-elect on how we might finance it.  </P> <P> "It is devastating if there are no alternative sources, but I am not resigned  to saying that there aren't any."  </P> <P> The bond measure would have given the university $2.4 million for the second  half of the university's core library building and the books and materials to  fill it, with the balance going toward carpeting and furnishing the first  academic buildings and drawing up the plans for the second part of campus  construction.  </P> <P> The San Marcos campus had just begun to recover from a 10-week delay of campus  construction with the announcement Friday that a new general contractor,  Lusardi Construction, had been hired to replace financially plagued Louetto  Construction.  </P> <P> Construction, however, will not resume until either C. W. Poss, a grading  subcontractor, has been paid the more than $1.5 million it is owed for work  already done, or another grading subcontractor is hired, according to  construction officials.  </P> <P> The delays jeopardize the August, 1992 target date for the campus' opening and  might set it back by a semester, although the campus also had hopes of making  up the lost time.  </P> <P> Lusardi officials said that they will be on site beginning next week, and that  new estimates for cost and date of completion will be drawn up within the next  two weeks.  </P> <P> "This is typical of a situation like this where a contractor enters a project  midstream. It is necessary for us to acquaint ourselves with what has yet to be  done," said Kenneth Lounsbery, vice president and general counsel of San  Marcos-based Lusardi.  </P> <P> At least construction on the San Marcos campus is going forward. Statewide  university officials were wondering this week whether any other plans to build  and expand state colleges and universities would be as lucky.  </P> <P> Voter rejection of Proposition 143 means that students will be tightly squeezed  into existing colleges and universities, and that planned new campuses probably  will be delayed, officials of all three segments of California higher education  said Friday.  </P> <P> "This puts a dark cloud over a year of planning and leaves many necessary  projects in jeopardy," said Chancellor McCune of the California State  University system. "It is a tragedy for higher education."  </P> <P> In addition to delaying Cal State San Marcos, McCune said, plans for off-campus  centers in Contra Costa and Ventura counties will be delayed.  </P> <P> "We've just got to face up to the reality that we might not be able to grow,"  said Baker, vice president for budget and university relations at the  University of California.  </P> <P> UC plans considerable expansion at its Davis, Riverside, San Diego and Santa  Cruz campuses, as well as a new San Joaquin Valley campus, but Baker said the  failure of Proposition 143 "gives us cause for concern . . . that we're going  to have enough revenue to even stay where we are," much less open a 10th  campus.  </P> <P> The higher education proposal was defeated by 51.3% to 48.7%, the first time a  college and university bond issue has failed since 1968, when student protests  were rocking many campuses.  </P> <P> The measure won in only nine of California's 58 counties. "I was really  surprised by that," Baker said.  </P> <P> It was defeated in every San Joaquin Valley county, even though UC is planning  to open its first campus in that part of the state by the end of this decade.  The proposition also lost heavily in Riverside County, where there has been a  UC campus for many years.  </P> <P> The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, meeting at  Hartnell College in Salinas Friday, established a Commission for Innovation to  study new ways to provide instruction without building new facilities.  </P> <P> The commission will study the possibility of offering community college courses  through telecommunications to students at home and in the workplace, said Ann  Reed, spokeswoman for the 107-campus two-year college system.  </P> <P> "It can't be business as usual," Reed said.  </P> <P> Although higher education officials were generally dismayed by Tuesday's  result, they saw a few silver linings among the clouds.  </P> <P> "I really don't think this was an anti-higher education vote," like 1968, said  William L. Storey, an assistant director of the California Postsecondary  Education Commission. "People were concerned about the economy and war in the  Middle East. In times like these, people tend to be cautious about spending  money."  </P> <P> Others said voters were rebelling against the long ballot in general,  especially the more than $5 billion in proposed bond measures, and not against  California's public colleges and universities.  </P> <P> "If this is just a one-year aberration, it's not too significant," UC's Baker  said, "but if this turns out to be the beginning of a three-, four- or  five-year dry well on capital spending, then we've got real trouble."  </P> <P> If UC cannot expand on existing campuses, especially at Davis and Riverside,  "that certainly will slow down plans for a 10th campus," Baker said.  </P> <P> The current timetable calls for the UC Board of Regents to narrow the choices  for a new campus in the Fresno area to two or three sites next March and to  make a final decision a year later. But Baker said the process might be  delayed.  </P> <P> CSU Chancellor McCune said the construction priority list will be adjusted to  give preference to projects that increase student capacity, with many other  projects dropping to the bottom of the list or falling off altogether.  </P> <P> Coming on top of a $100-million cut in the CSU operating budget, these  construction cuts make this "the worst year yet, and next year looks like it  could be even worse," the chancellor added.  </P> <P> The bond issue failure compounds a serious crowding problem at many community  colleges throughout the state.  </P> <P> A study completed in September found that 28 new campus sites will be needed in  the next 14 years to accommodate expected enrollment. If bond measures continue  to fail, the money to build these facilities will not be there.  </P> <P> Larry Serot, acting vice chancellor for business services in the Los Angeles  Community College District, said Tuesday's vote cost the district $1 million to  equip a new technical education building at Southwest College, another $1  million to renovate the main academic building at Southwest and a third $1  million for equipment in a new vocational education building at East Los  Angeles College.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE ARREST OWNERS OF PACOIMA SALVAGE YARD  </P> <P> Two men arrested at a Pacoima auto parts yard on suspicion of possession of  stolen property were identified as the owners of the business, Los Angeles  police said Thursday.  </P> <P> Vyacheslav Gorin, 31, and Lonya Palatnik, 35, both of West Hollywood, were  arrested Wednesday afternoon at All-In-One Auto Dismantlers in the 12200 block  of Montague Street, police said. Detective Mike Miller said investigators  suspect that stolen cars were sold to the owners who then "chopped" them into  parts to be sold.  </P> <P> The arrests came after detectives on a routine inspection found what they  called a "chop shop" where stolen cars are stripped and the pieces sold as  parts. Gorin and Palatnik were booked at the Foothill Division Jail but were  later released on $5,000 bail each, police said.  </P> <P> Miller said a task force of auto theft investigators Wednesday began what will  be a routine program of spot-checking salvage yards for stolen cars and parts.  All-In-One was the third yard checked that day and detectives found parts from  seven stolen cars at the yard, Miller said.  </P> <P> Among the stolen parts were parts of a 1985 Honda Prelude that had been stolen  four days earlier from Montebello, Miller said. Only the seats, engine,  transmission, bumper and steering wheel were found, he said.  </P> <P> Miller said the parts were determined stolen by serial numbers but one bumper  at the yard still had a license plate attached that belonged to a car that had  been reported stolen.  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Strong recovery for full year at NZ forester FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand forestry and energy group, reports profits after abnormal items of NZDollars 381.8m (USDollars 213.3m) for the year ended June, against a loss of NZDollars 157.5m last time. The recovery reflects a turnround in abnormal items, to a surplus of NZDollars 15.5m after a debit of NZDollars 472.8m a year ago. The company plans a free issue of Fletcher Challenge Forest shares to shareholders. These will reflect the value of the company's New Zealand and Chilean forests, but not its pulp and paper industries. About 50 per cent of the value of these assets would be reflected in the new shares.</p>

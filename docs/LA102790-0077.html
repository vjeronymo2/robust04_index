			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASEBERE DISPLAY A LACK OF FEELING  </P> <P> James Casebere is one of a generation of photographers whose work eschews fact  for fiction.  </P> <P> Sculptors and dramatists as much as photo-technicians, these artists apparently  have been influenced more by the narratives of film and television than still  photography. The larger-than-life glossies of one-shot dramas by Casebere,  Cindy Sherman, Nic Nicosia, Laurie Simmons and a slew of other artists in their  mid-to-late 30s and early 40s first came to light during the early 1980s. And  after their first big splash in museum shows and national magazines, their  works have had varying degrees of critical success.  </P> <P> Among these artists, the New York-based Casebere, 37, is one of the least  interesting. Virtually a one-note purist, Casebere has created colorless,  unpeopled images of dramatic settings that are badly in need of something to  say. A selection of Casebere's photographs made since 1985 opened this week at  the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego, along with a room-sized  sculptural installation. The show continues through Dec. 9.  </P> <P> It is not the black-and-white medium that makes these pictures so monochrome.  It is the repetitive theme of desolation. Alone, the images seem pristine,  simple, perhaps even evocative. Grouped together they are simply empty.  </P> <P> With the massive wood sculpture "Tree  </P> <P> Trunk with Broken Bungalow and Shotgun Houses," 1988, as its centerpiece, this  show evidently is an attempt to highlight the artist's move from behind the  camera lens into the realm of three-dimensional staging. All of Casebere's work  involves sculpture; for the photos, he crafted elaborate landscapes with  houses, trees, fences and more. He also made still lifes with bowls, boards and  artificial plants -- all of which show up in the photos in the same shade of  gray.  </P> <P> The construction of the objects in the photographs -- their smooth surfaces and  unadorned shapes -- suggest the careful craftsmanship of a potter or toy maker.  Often, they are quite beautiful.  </P> <P> What is surprising, then, is the rough-hewn nature of the actual  three-dimensional work that so dominates this show. It was designed by Casebere  as an extension of his photographic images, but was constructed by carpenters  for a show two years ago at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Big,  bulky and boring, it lacks even the minimal mystery and controlled drama of the  photos.  </P> <P> An image of the calm after a storm, the wreckage after a hurricane, the 13  1/2-foot-high sculpture is a pile of stuff scrunched together, including a  house, boat, wagon wheel, surf board, and some surveillance cameras. Its  holocaust theme, however, tends to explain the meaning behind some of the other  works here. Dark and dramatically lit in the photos and in the gallery,  Casebere appears to be suggesting that all of his works represent the aftermath  of something utterly horrible.  </P> <P> Just what that event was, however, is never made concrete in any way. Casebere  depends far too much upon our imaginations. The work lacks all sense of  humanity, so its hard to care what happened. The objects have no character or  peculiarities, so they can't be identified with an individual owner, even an  anonymous one.  </P> <P> On every level, these works make it hard to care about them. It is hollow  drama, art without heart.  </P></p>

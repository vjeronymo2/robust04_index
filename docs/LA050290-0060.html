			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> REP. PANETTA CRITICIZES EMERGENCY AGENCY AS SLOW TO ACT IN QUAKE  </P> <P> Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) Tuesday criticized the performance of  the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Loma Prieta earthquake last  fall, citing excessive bureaucracy that resulted in a "circle of frustration"  for victims.  </P> <P> Other witnesses before a House subcommittee echoed his views, including those  making similar complaints about FEMA's performance during Hurricane Hugo.  </P> <P> "In many instances I felt that I had to exert great pressure on these officials  to have them provide services that should have been provided without my  intervention," Panetta told a House Public Works and Transportation  subcommittee that is investigating FEMA's ability to cope with major disasters.  </P> <P> "In my district, it took weeks and months before some of the needed assistance  reached the victims," he said.  </P> <P> FEMA officials said that the agency's top official for disaster response, Grant  Peterson, is scheduled to testify before the subcommittee today. He would not  discuss the criticism of the agency before his appearance, they said.  </P> <P> Panetta said that FEMA's earthquake assistance efforts were marred by poor  coordination and unnecessary complexity. As a result, he said, people were  shuffled from agency to agency and victims waited longer to receive assistance.  </P> <P> "Many of my constituents asked me why Ft. Ord, located in Monterey, could not  provide some of the tents, blankets, generators and other necessary and vital  supplies that were desperately needed," Panetta said.  </P></p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / One in four Irish voters undecided in poll on Maastricht ONE in four voters in today's Irish referendum on the Maastricht treaty is still undecided, according to a public opinion poll published yesterday. The poll, published in the Irish Times, showed that although declared 'yes' voters outnumber 'no' voters by 49 per cent to 28 per cent, more than half of those polled believe the government has handled its pro-Maastricht campaign badly. Even Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said only that he was 'cautiously encouraged' by the results of the poll. Campaign managers for the 'yes' vote yesterday complained that some priests are campaigning against the treaty, in spite of a decision by Catholic bishops to keep the Church neutral. The decision by 2.5m Irish voters will not be available until Ireland's principal returning officer makes a declaration around noon tomorrow. The result will have a profound impact on the future economic and political course of the European Community. If the Irish follow the Danes and vote 'no', there seems little doubt that the treaty, which establishes the legal framework for the creation of a common currency and common citizenship for some 340m people, will have to be scrapped. If they vote 'yes', there are hopes that the remaining 10 EC states will ratify the treaty. As in Denmark, the opinion polls showed a significantly greater proportion of women than men were undecided. And considerably fewer women (44 per cent) than men (55 per cent) said they would vote 'yes'. Both feminists and anti-abortion groups have been campaigning actively for a 'no' vote and should the treaty be defeated in spite of the poll predictions, women's votes will clearly have been an important factor. A large sector of the 'no' camp has run a clever campaign, championing liberal causes such as the environment, neutrality, job promotion and women's rights. It has argued that ratification of Maastricht will have adverse effects in all these areas. In addition many of those who voted positively in previous referendums on European issues, such as the one in 1987 which approved the Single European Act, may find themselves divided between an economic decision on the one hand, and a moral one on the other due to the complication of the abortion issue. The overall weakness of the 'yes' campaign, in contrast to the vitality of its opponents, together with the continuing large number of floating voters have thus created considerable uncertainty over the outcome. Mr Michael Gallagher, a political science lecturer at Trinity College in Dublin, said: 'I have no doubt the polls have been done as accurately and as professionally as in the past, but no one is too confident in them now since the recent experiences of Denmark and the UK (election).'

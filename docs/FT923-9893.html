			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Thai military leaders demoted for their part in May shootings MR Anand Panyarachun, the Thai prime minister, demoted the country's senior military commanders at the weekend for their part in the killing of at least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators shot by troops on the streets of Bangkok in May. The long-awaited announcement followed a series of moves by Mr Anand and his cabinet to reduce military influence in politics and business, and fulfils Mr Anand's promise to deal politely but firmly with the generals who have held sway in Thailand for the past 60 years. Over the past few months, the military establishment's powers have been challenged and eroded by the middle class citizens of Bangkok at the forefront of the May demonstrations and who have backed Mr Anand's political and economic reforms. But recalcitrant generals can still call on the support of shadowy rightwing organisations and powerful provincial politicians. Only the most optimistic commentators are ruling out the possibility of future military intervention in politics. Mr Anand demoted Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme commander and head of the air force, to the meaningless post of 'inspector general', while Gen Issarapong Noonpakdee, the army chief, became a deputy permanent secretary for defence affairs. Gen Chainarong Noonpakdee, Gen Issarapong's cousin and the commander responsible for dispersing demonstrators in May, was appointed head of the Institute of Army Academics. The new army chief is Gen Wimol Wongwanich, who is regarded as a tactful and competent soldier. Air Chief Marshal Gun Pimarnthip, the new air force commander, said he would try to steer officers along professional lines 'and would not allow them to become political or business soldiers'. Opponents of the military welcomed the demotions, and the Confederation for Democracy praised Mr Anand for what it called his 'political courage'. However, the general in charge of the junta which ran the country after last year's coup d'etat was quoted by the Thai press as saying that the changes were 'too drastic'. An unrepentant Gen Sunthorn Komsompong also said it was unfair to blame only the military for the May killings. 'What about the people who instigated the riot?' he asked at a ceremony for his 61st birthday. Mr Anand, a businessman and former diplomat appointed interim prime minister by the King after the May shootings and the resignation of the previous premier, is running the country until new elections in September. He made the announcement after receiving a report on the events of May from the defence ministry. The timing of the demotions means that the former military commanders will have no say in the annual October reshuffle of senior officers, will play no important part in the celebrations of the Queen of Thailand's birthday, and will not be able to register as election candidates because the deadline has passed.</p>

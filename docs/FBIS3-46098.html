According to Zhu Zupu, deputy secretary-general of the  municipal government, deputies to the city's people's congress  put forward an average of more than two proposals a day last  year. All the proposals, tackling issues ranging from official  corruption, city planning to pornography, were adopted.    Ten proposals which are beyond the powers of the  municipality  have been submitted to the State Council, he revealed.    Zhu, speaking following the closing of the Eighth Session of  the Standing Committee of the 10th Municipal People's Congress  Friday [14 January], cited the example of the ban on  firecrackers by the city government at the call of more than 40  people's deputies.    The city also waged an anti-porn campaign in the publication  industry after adopting a proposal from Wang Li and 13 other  deputies, Zhu said.    The deputies also voiced their demands for a bigger  education  budget and better living conditions for teachers. The city  boosted educational expenditure by over one-fifth over the  previous year in 1993. The latest official figures show that  teachers received the third-largest increase in income last  year, following rises for policemen and enterprise workers.    It was a deputy's proposal that spurred the city government  to set up Beijing's first international futures trading company.  Another proposal resulted in the establishment of two large  wholesale book markets.    The Municipal People's Congress is a medium-level  legislature  of the country's people's congress system. The present congress  was elected in 1993 and will remain in office for five years.    Feedback from the deputies shows that most of them are  satisfied with the way their proposals have been handled.</p>

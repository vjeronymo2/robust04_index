			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The future coalition government [between the Social  Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR, and the National Romanian  Unity Party, PUNR] will not survive more than three months,  emphasized Corneliu Coposu, National Peasant  Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] chairman, during today's  weekly news conference. Coposu based his assertion on the fact  that the participation of the PUNR in the new government will  ensure the country neither stability at home nor credibility  abroad. The PNTCD chairman also stressed the fact that, judging  from the information he holds, the West considers the PUNR to be  an expression of extremism that exceeds even that of the Greater  Romania Party [PRM]. In the same context, Coposu assessed that  the new government formula will lead to restoration and the  blocking of reform.    PNTCD Spokesman Radu Vasile assessed that a situation will  be  created that everyone thought had been brought to an end in 1989.    Talking about the rejection of the opposition's offer to  assume the responsibility of governing, the PNTCD leaders  considered it natural that the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM]  and the PRM will also be included in the executive, as those  parties support the current government, our correspondent Elena  Perdichi reports.</p>

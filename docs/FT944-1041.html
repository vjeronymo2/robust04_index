			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Italy The Milan equity market's recovery this week appears perverse. Collapsing governments normally engender the sort of instability disliked by investors. But Mr Berlusconi's coalition has been so disastrous that any prospect of change is being viewed as positive. The government's initial inability to govern could have been excused by inexperience. But it became increasingly apparent the three coalition parties were incompatible. The coalition's collapse would therefore eradicate instability. Foreign investors, heartened by political developments, have driven the market's 7.5 per cent rise in the past week. They believe Italian equities represent good value. After all, the market has fallen 18 per cent over the last quarter and the lira is at an all time low against the D-Mark. They also stress the strength of the economy and corporate earnings growth. And they argue further devaluations of the lira can be offset by picking industrial stocks generating a high proportion of profits outside Italy. Such arguments carry weight. However, investors should not overlook the political dangers. Attempts to form a government led by a non-partisan prime minister will be long and complicated. Elections during the first half of next year are probably inevitable. Italian equity markets will retain their traditional volatility.</p>

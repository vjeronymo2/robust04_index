			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Commission squares its US deal with CAP - A Brussels report that seeks to demonstrate their compatibility RAY MacSHARRY, the rumbustious EC farm commissioner, asserts flatly that the US-EC deal on food export subsidies is compatible with the Community's reform of its Common Agricultural Policy. That compatibility is the crux of the compromise which negotiators hope will pave the way for a world trade agreement in the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - and thanks to the publication of detailed figures in Brussels yesterday, it is possible to assess Mr MacSharry's argument and the strength of potential objections from France. In 10 pages crammed with statistics and EC jargon, the Commission sets out Mr MacSharry's case. Its technical merits were accepted during a meeting of the full Commission on Wednesday after objections by Ms Christiane Scrivener of France. The US-EC deal is based on two commitments: the reduction of direct export subsidies by 36 per cent from the average outlay in the period 1986-90; and the reduction of subsidised volume by 21 per cent over the same period. Whether this is compatible with CAP reform turns on whether one accepts assumptions about future production, prices and consumption in a six-year period, starting June 1994. By far the most sensitive area concerns the exportable surplus of cereals. France claims that CAP production cuts will be deeper than foreseen if export volume restraint exceeds 18 per cent. France argues that any figure higher than 18 per cent is unacceptable. It also argues that the deal does not take into account technological advances which will result in higher yields in spite of land 'set aside' under the CAP reform. The draft EC-US agreement lays down that the volume of cereals that can be exported with export subsidies will be 23,410,000 tonnes at the end of six years, according to the report. Also, food aid will be at least 2.5m, it says. The crucial question is about likely future production. A worst-case scenario is that yield would increase 1 per cent a year, with a starting point of 5 tonnes a hectare; this would mean 176.8m tonnes by the end of the century. But the report argues that internal EC consumption should increase because falling cereal prices will mean the replacement of substitutes such as soya cakes by cereals. Cereals demand should also increase because of a foreseeable rise in the production and consumption of white meat such as pork and poultry. This in turn means an expected rise in internal consumption of 12m tonnes by 1999/2000. Yet even this assumption of future prices and production is a bit of a gamble, as the report suggests. 'The most likely outcome is that the exportable surplus will remain within the limits authorised in the draft agreement and be compatible with CAP reform.' On dairy products, the Commission paper argues there is no problem with butter and skim milk powder: the volumes corresponding to a reduction of 21 per cent in export subsidies are 'above the exportable surplus' foreseen at the end of the six-year period. However, because of commitments to 'minimum access' for cheese imports and required cuts in subsidised exports, between 3m and 3.5m tonnes of milk equivalents need to be dealt with. Settling this depends on consumption of cheese increasing by 1-2 per cent, and persuading Spain and Italy to cut milk production by 2m tonnes. The other serious problem lies in the beef sector. Because member states watered down CAP reform proposals for cutting beef production last May, the exportable surplus at the end of six years is likely to be above the authorised export volume (817,000 tonnes) by between 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes. Already, there are some 1m tonnes of stocks. The Commission paper argues that the problem of stocks should be dealt with. But it recognises that extra EC money will be needed, possibly in incentives to discourage production. It concludes, rather weakly, that 'a combination of the application of these CAP reform measures will enable the EC to meet the commitments laid down in the draft agreement.' But as Mr MacSharry said yesterday, the attraction of the deal is threefold: compensation to farmers under CAP reform will continue under the terms agreed; a 'peace clause' with the US provides security; and a favourable agreement on oil-seeds has prevented a damaging trade war with the US.</p>

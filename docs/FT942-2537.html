			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Every year as summer begins, the number of deals by directors tails off. Thus, it is unusual to note a steady number buying at present. Seven members of the board at Life Sciences International, a maker of scientific and hospital equipment, took the opportunity offered by a dip in the share price to buy stock at 117p. The largest single purchase was by Sir Christopher Bland, previously the chairman of London Weekend Television, who bought 1m to more than double his holding. Halkin Holdings used to be known as Hoskins Breweries. Over the past year it has had a complete change of management, and its share price has begun to perform better. Directors bought last summer at 55p and have been back in the market again. Chairman Howard Hodgson and Bruce McGuire acquired 50,000 each at around 62p. Dewhirst Group, a clothing and toiletries company, featured in this column when vice-chairman James Dewhirst bought stock in May. The share price has moved very little since then and another two directors have taken the opportunity to get into the market. Chairman Timothy Dewhirst and Robin Horsell, an executive director, bought 120,000 and 19,960 respectively at 123p. Timothy Dewhirst now holds more than 4.9m while Horsell's holding is more than 850,000. Quicks Group, a motor distributor, has enjoyed steady price increases over the past two years. In the summer of 1992 Alexander Murray, the chief executive, and managing director, and Frederick Royle bought stock around 110p. Timothy Franey, a non-executive director, has taken the opportunity to sell some stock - initially at 185p last September and latterly at 190p. He remains the single largest shareholder on the board with 4.6 per cent of the stock.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                No of Company                 Sector        Shares      Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Claremont Gmnts         Text           5,000         17         1 Cornwell Parker 'A'     HGod          45,000         71         1 Courtaulds              Chem          20,000        102         1 GR Holdings             L&amp;HI         454,500        291         3 Macfarlane Group        PP&amp;P           7,400         17         1 Mayflower Corp          EngV         216,792        124         1* Morland &amp; Co.

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Recovery looks elusive for Norway's banks - The crisis which has engulfed the sector shows few signs of ending The crisis which has engulfed Norway's commercial banks for the past five years shows few signs of abating. The sector's annual profits reporting season, which begins today with Den norske Bank's results, will carry a familiar tale - record write-offs and high non-performing loans which could force fresh government rescue efforts. Few analysts see any hope for recovery for between four and five years and it is not difficult find those who believe the fall-out from the crisis will last the decade. The cost of the excessive expansion of the 1980s, which accompanied deregulation of the country's banking system, is non-performing loans estimated at NKr20bn (Dollars 2.8bn) and write-offs to date of NKr60bn on the banks' property holdings. Mr Finn Hvistendahl and Mr Borger Lenth, chief executives respectively of Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, Norway's two biggest banks, believe further firm action is needed to reverse the trend. They are reorganising their corporate structures to separate the negative effects of non-performing loans and falling property values from healthy parts of their businesses. However, the state has already ruled out the possibility of taking on these bad loans. A senior executive at a leading US bank which provides funding to DnB and Christiania said he did not expect recovery by either of the banks until the end of the 1990s. The Norwegian Banks Association, representing the commercial banks, increased its forecast of members' 1992 composite losses from NKr3bn to between NKr4bn and NKr5bn and warned that some banks might also need state cash this year. Norwegian state cash transfers to support the banks from collapse have totalled more than NKr20bn in the last five years. The banks' own insurance fund has also been emptied by injections of NKr7.4bn into the sector, of which NKr7.2bn has been written off as losses. Last November, the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund agreed to pump NKr5bn into DnB, Christiania and Fokus Bank, the third biggest commercial bank. The association says combined credit losses last year probably fell to between NKr8bn and NKr9n from 1991's record NKr15bn. The one bright spot is that the banks will show slightly improved operating results for 1992 but they seem set in the medium-term to remain saddled with non-performing assets until allowed to hive them off into separate entities to stop the drain on operating income. The association estimates that property acquired by the banks last year due to defaults had a value of NKr7bn, representing a loss of income of NKr3bn. At the nine-month mark DnB posted a net loss of NKr2.46bn and credit losses of NKr3.29bn, while Christiania's net loss was NKr785m with credit losses of NKr1.86bn. Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, Norway's finance minister, says he is open to proposals from individual banks for restructuring which could allow the establishment of subsidiaries into which non-performing loans could be off-loaded. DnB is considering establishing a holding company structure under which a so-called 'good bank', comprising its healthy operations, would be established. A 'project bank' would be created to hold non-performing loans, high-risk loans and property acquired by the bank which served as collateral for loans which became non-performing. DnB has about NKr10bn in non-performing loans, acquired property valued at NKr3bn and NKr3bn in property it owns. Together, the three portfolios accounted for about 10 per cent of its assets at the end of 1992. Christiania is considering a similar move and has already begun an internal reorganisation. 'We have to try to clear out the attic in a way in which we can make sufficient write-downs on bad loans so that we can wind them up either through refinancing or recapitalising the companies which are having problems servicing loans,' Mr Lenth said recently. He insists Christiania's problems are no longer of an operational nature. 'As long as we can carry the costs of our non-performing loans, our first priority will be to recover as much as possible from such loans,' he says. But Norway's corporate sector is plagued by an inability to raise equity capital in a market which has been downtrodden by several years' weakness in the domestic economy and poor export earnings caused by feeble international economic growth. Mr Hvistendahl, Mr Lenth and the finance minister are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the development of Norway's economy in 1993, but not one of the three is willing to predict when the banks can be reprivatised. Christiania is fully state-owned and with last year's rescue action, the state owns more than 70 per cent of DnB's share capital. 'It is inconceivable to my mind that we could have private capital flowing into the banks in the near future. Not before a period of stable income could we think of going to the stock market to raise capital,' Mr Lenth believes.</p>

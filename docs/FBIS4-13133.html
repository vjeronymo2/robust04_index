			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>   [Text] An authoritative Jordanian source has said his  country does not believe there is any justification for Israel's  accusations of Amman's alleged support for Hamas' activities on  its territory. The source explained that the Hamas  representatives are Jordanian nationals and enjoy freedom of  speech. Consequently, their statements are within the framework  of this freedom of speech. The source also explained that Hamas  operations are planned and carried out by the leadership of this  movement in the occupied territories and not by its political  representatives in Jordan.    After mentioning that the activities of the Hamas  representatives are confined to only the political dimension and  do not violate regulations and laws, the source emphasized that  compelling them to leave the Kingdom is in violation of the  Constitution.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had said that Israel  cannot tolerate the Hamas Movement, the declared enemy of the  peace process, enjoying a safe haven in Jordan.</p>

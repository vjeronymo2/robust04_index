			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The Ministerial  Council of the European Union (E.U.) on Monday appealed for a  ceasefire in and around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The E.U. condemns the Bosnian Serbs' continuing attacks on  Gorazde, assessing this as a U.N. Security Council resolution  violation, and urges an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in  Gorazde and around it, a statement released by the council said,  and that Serb forces which are threatening the security of  Gorazde withdraw. This will enable the deployment of U.N.  troops in the town itself between the two warring sides, said  the statement.    The Bosnian Serb authorities reported on Monday that Serb  forces would remain outside the 3-km zone on the left bank of  the Drina near Gorazde and were willing to agree to the  immediate deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops  there.    Bosnian Serb military sources have said that Moslem forces  on  the front around Gorazde renewed attacks on Serb positions early  on Monday morning, firing from mortars placed in the center of  the town, and heavy machine-guns located in the high-rise  residence of the UNPROFOR.    Bosnian Serb Assembly President Momilo Krajisnik on Monday  denied claims that Serb forces were shelling Gorazde and trying  to take the town, underscoring that the Serb side had ceased all  military activities around Gorazde.    Gorazde was to have been demilitarized long ago as a U.N.  designated "safe haven," but, instead of demilitarization, more  than 10,000 Moslem troops concentrated in this enclave and  launched a heavy offensive on Serb territories in late March.  The Bosnian Serb army strongly answered the attacks.    The Ministerial Council statement set out that a ceasefire  agreement on Gorazde should be closely followed by a general  ceasefire agreement for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would  again be an opening to talks on a political solution.    The E.U. calls on all those nations which promised  additional  forces to secure their arrival in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as  possible.    The E.U. ministers also called on greater diplomatic efforts  by the international community, including the U.N., E.U., U.S.  and Russia, to step up diplomatic actions to secure the  convergence of their initiatives and lead as soon as possible to  talks between the three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina --  Moslems, Serbs and Croats.    The statement said that all captured U.N. staff should be  released immediately, and that unlimited and unhindered freedom  of movement should be enabled in agreement with U.N.  resolutions. Humanitarian efforts and free passage through Serb  territory for humanitarian convoys for Gorazde and elswehere in  Bosnia-Herzegovina must be renewed, it was underscored. The  Bosnian Serb authorities said on Monday that they would  guarantee freedom of movement to all humanitarian workers in its  entire territory and police units will escort all convoys for  their security.    The E.U. called on all its members who are also members of  the U.N. Security Council, to support the adoption, without  delay, of a resolution in support of the listed objectives.</p>

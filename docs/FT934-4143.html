			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / US deal may lead to Gatt accord: Compromise on phasing in subsidy cuts could help France to end world trade crisis A US compromise on the controversial Blair House accord limiting Europe's exports of subsidised farm goods has paved the way for an agreement expected today with the European Union on trade reform. The agreement will put pressure on France to accept the accord, finally bringing to a head the political crisis in Paris over the world trade talks. Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, will this morning hold a special cabinet meeting to decide France's position on the draft General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is expected to be presented to EU ministers later in the day. The US compromise on Blair House allows for a more gentle phasing in of the timetable for cutting subsidised EU farm exports by 21 per cent over six years. In what is likely to be seen as a significant climbdown, the US has agreed to exempt the existing EU grain mountain of about 25m tonnes. The US concessions will allow Europe to export an additional 8m tonnes of grain a year. France, Europe's largest farm exporter, will be the main beneficiary of the switch. After being briefed in Paris yesterday by Sir Leon Brittan, the chief European negotiator and EU trade commissioner, and Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, Mr Balladur still warned against 'the excessive optimism which has reigned in recent days and hours'. Progress had been made, but problems remained for France in the agricultural and audiovisual sectors, his spokesman said. The agreement was endorsed in principle in Brussels last week by Sir Leon and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Mr Kantor will return to Brussels today after weekend consultations in Washington with President Bill Clinton. Sir Leon's meeting with Mr Balladur, aimed at clearing the way for a deal to be announced, followed the commissioner's talks on Friday with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The impression that France's political crisis over Gatt was finally coming to a head was reinforced by Mr Balladur's decision to call in the presidents of the National Assembly and the Senate for consultations last night. The prime minister is expected to put any draft Gatt agreement for approval before the French parliament, probably at the start of next week. Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, took a tough line in radio and television interviews last night, saying that he would want concessions on tariffs, the agricultural and audiovisual sectors, and agreement on a stronger future world trade organisation, before he could give France's approval to any Gatt package in Brussels today. Mr Juppe is also secretary-general of Mr Balladur's own RPR Gaullist party, which is the closest politically to the French farm lobby. But Mr Gerard Longuet, France's more pro-Gatt trade and industry minister, earlier suggested that France was ready for compromise in the key area of agriculture. European negotiators expect to pay a price elsewhere in the Uruguay round for winning concessions from the US on Blair House. They are expected to reveal this week that tariffs protecting wood and paper products will be cut to zero, while tariffs protecting semiconductors and non-ferrous metals will also be pared back. Part of the price may be concessions to the US on access to Europe's film and television market, where France has fought for protection on cultural grounds.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / New deal to balance calls on aid Richer governments responsible for most of the flow of official aid to poorer countries yesterday came out with a new formula to balance traditional needs of the third world and newer aid demands from eastern Europe. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's development assistance committee said it was putting eight of the poorest Caucasian and central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union on its designated list of countries receiving official development aid. This would count towards the OECD governments' pledge to try to raise their aid budgets to 0.7 per cent of their national output. By contrast, the committee has decided to put central European countries, the Baltic states, Russia, and some relatively richer ex-Soviet republics such as Belarus and Ukraine on a separate list with some Gulf oil states which no longer count formally as official-aid recipients. Assistance to these countries would not count towards meeting the UN-approved 0.7 per cent target for OECD members' aid budgets. This compromise is a response to the worries of third world clients that aid flows will now be diverted to eastern Europe. So far, OECD officials said, there has been no diversion. Concessional official aid to the former Soviet bloc has been running at Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.3bn) a year since 1991, while soft-term official aid to the third world has stayed at around Dollars 60bn. Nor are central Europe, Russia, or western ex-Soviet republics likely to be penalised by the new categorisation, officials claimed.</p>

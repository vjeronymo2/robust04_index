			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Italians pick former communist A BROAD cross-party coalition yesterday elected Mr Giorgio Napolitano, a veteran former communist and member of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), as Speaker of Italy's chamber of deputies. Mr Napolitano, 66, was proposed by the PDS and backed by the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans and Social Democrats. The same alliance - without the Republicans - led to the election on May 25 of Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the then-Speaker, as Italy's ninth president. Despite misgivings and internal divisions, Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, has thus twice in recent days led his party into alliances with his former opponents, the Christian Democrats, or rivals, the Socialists. He has said this does not commit the PDS, the second largest party in parliament, with 16 per cent of the vote, to form part of the next government; but it has set a precedent. Another sign of change in the political scene has been a statement by President Scalfaro that he would like the next prime minister to form a cabinet of his own choosing and not depend upon the traditional dictates of the party bosses. With a new Speaker, the formal process of consultations to form a new government can now begin. The election of a PDS Speaker was seen, in part, as a trade-off for supporting Mr Scalfaro's election to the presidency. Mr Napolitano had been proposed two months ago for the job, when parliament first convened after the April 5 general elections; but the Christian Democrats pressed for one of their own in the form of Mr Scalfaro. Neither the Christian Democrats nor the Socialists backed the PDS's first candidate, Prof Stefano Rodota, the party's president and former visiting law fellow at All Souls, Oxford. The Socialists, in particular, view him too much of an internal PDS choice. Prof Rodota was forced to withdraw after four rounds of abortive voting, and yesterday resigned as party president. The party's decision to drop his candidature has provoked criticism of Mr Occhetto's leadership by those who regard him as over-anxious to do a deal with the Christian Democrats and Socialists.</p>

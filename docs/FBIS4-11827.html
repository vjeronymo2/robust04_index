			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, March 31 (AFP) -- A powerful bomb exploded at  a bank in the Egyptian capital on Thursday [31 March], damaging  the building and nearby cars, but causing no casualties, police  said.    Witnesses had earlier said several passers-by were lightly  injured by the blast, which blew out the building's windows.    The outlawed Islamic militant group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah  [Islamic Group] later said it had placed a time bomb under a  parked car which exploded outside the branch of the Egyptian  Trade Development Bank.    The booby-trapped car and four others parked nearby were  destroyed when they caught fire.    The al-Jama'ah said in a statement sent to AFP that the  attack had been carried out "in revenge for the torture and  humiliations inflicted on Islamic detainees."    It was the first bomb explosion at a bank during opening  hours, despite a series of such bombings in recent months.    The al-Jama'ah, which has been waging a two-year violent  campaign against the secular government of President Husni  Mubarak, previously claimed responsibility for about 10 bombings  this month.    The statement warned that more attacks would follow to  avenge  human rights violations in Egypt's prisons, which it alleged had  "increased in recent days."    It also repeated accusations that banks were involved in  usury by charging interest, which is outlawed by the Koran.</p>

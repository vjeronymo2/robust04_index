			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Accounting rules 'will have legal status' THE NEW accounting standards being developed by the Accounting Standards Board have the force of law, according to a decision to be published by the board this week. The decision - a legal opinion by Ms Mary Arden, a senior barrister specialising in commercial matters who was recently appointed a judge - marks the first time the power of accounting standards-setters has been explicitly granted legal standing in the UK. The standards being issued by both the board and its 'urgent issues' task force are likely to be recognised by the courts as authoritative, she says. The application of accounting standards has until now been unclear because they have rarely been tested in the courts. The board's predecessor, the Accounting Standards Committee, was dissolved in 1990 because companies rejected its authority and refused to abide by its rules, the statements of standard accounting practice. Ms Arden's opinion was written in April and is to be included in a chapter of the board's statement of principles, the framework on which it is building a wide range of new and controversial standards. She says a new section, Number 256, inserted into the 1985 Companies Act, gives authority to accounting standards-setting bodies, which have been recognised in the 1989 Companies Act. The acts reinforce the principle that accounts should give 'a true and fair view' of a company's state of affairs. Ms Arden emphasises that the true and fair principle is a 'dynamic concept . . . subject to continuous rebirth' but says the courts will interpret it using evidence of the practices and views of accountants. This increasingly means considering the rules laid down by the Accounting Standards Board, she says. It reflects the fact that, unlike its predecessor, the board's membership and funding are drawn from the government and companies, as well as from the accountancy profession. Ms Arden cites the board's official foreword to accounting standards, which claims that standards are drafted after extensive investigation and consultation. Even though the urgent issues task force - which acts quickly to fill gaps in standards - is not recognised in law, she argues that it will also be held in considerable standing by the courts. Ms Arden cites in support of her opinion the one accounting standards case tested in court. That was the 1987 Lloyd Cheyham v Littlejohn case, in which the judge ruled standards of the Accounting Standards Committee were 'very strong evidence as to what is the proper standard which should be adopted'. Ms Arden's opinion is the first published decision on accounting standards since one she wrote with Mr Leonard Hoffman - also now a judge - in 1984.</p>

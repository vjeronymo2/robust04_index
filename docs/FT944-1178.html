			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved ahead strongly for the third session in a row, but trading volume was less than half of Monday's depressed levels, writes Jeffrey Brown. At the close of pit trading the FT-SE 100 March contract was at 3,085, up 23 for a three-day advance of 92 points. The premium to the cash market was 26 points, or three points above fair value. Activity was neglible, however. Many traders have already closed their books for the year and those that continue to sit by the telephone report a dismal lack of business. The March contract traded at a substantial premium to the cash market all day, occasionally moving out to a premium of 35 points. But even under these conditions arbitrage business was modest at best. Just 3,999 lots had been traded by the official 4.10pm close, down from 9,216 on Monday and in contrast to the 15,000 at which most dealers reckon that the market starts to pay its way. In these conditions the strong gains achieved by the March contract are impossible to interpret, said traders. Option volume remained dull, 29,443 contracts comparing with 26,292 on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for 10,600 lots. Drugs group Wellcome was the most active stock option, clocking up 3,658 lots.</p>

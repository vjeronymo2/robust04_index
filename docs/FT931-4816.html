			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): NTT surge helps Nikkei rise 5% to three-month high SHARE prices climbed 5.1 per cent to a three-month high as public funds stepped up support to prevent a market slide after the arrest of Mr Shin Kanemaru, former king-maker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was announced last weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 868.77 stronger at 17,686.47, the first time it has closed above 17,500 since December 25 last year. The index opened at the day's low of 16,855.62 and rose as high as 17,727.30. Volume totalled 550m shares, the heaviest since last September. Advances overwhelmed declines by 1,035 to 60, with 55 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks jumped 52.29 to 1,320.90 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed 1.74 up at 1,055.35. Buying by public funds triggered a rally in the futures market, prompting arbitrage purchases and a rush of short-covering. Traders said the approval of the fiscal 1993 budget in the House of Representatives last weekend, paving the way for the government to draw up an additional economic stimulus package, also improved sentiment. 'We could be seeing a new trading range for the market,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y75,000, or 10.6 per cent, at Y780,000. The issue had risen by 28.5 per cent over the previous eight trading days on speculation that the next fiscal stimulus package will focus on measures to upgrade the country's telecommunications infrastructure. Officials at the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications are also likely to approve a rate increase for city calls later this year. Traders noted heavy trading by speculative dealers yesterday, but said a sustained rise above the Y800,000 level would be unlikely. Companies expected to benefit from a boost in telecommunications-linked spending gained ground. NEC appreciated Y50 to Y711 and Fujikura, a cable concern, Y15 to Y610. Other export-oriented high-technology issues were higher on the stronger dollar against the yen. Pioneer added Y170 at Y2,150 and TDK Y190 at Y3,210. Aids-related stocks advanced on reports that Nippon Zeon and Ube Industries were co-developing an anti-Aids drug. Nippon Zeon rose Y42 to Y572 and Ube Y42 to Y360. Green Cross, a speculative favourite, climbed Y40 to Y1,250. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 643.43 at 18,484.28 in volume of 132.8m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, firmed Y280 to Y9,880. Roundup MANY OF the Pacific Rim markets displayed an easier trend. HONG KONG took time to consolidate after last week's rise, but the market remained underpinned by hopes that China and Britain will soon re-open talks on the colony's future. The Hang Seng index shed 20.65 to finish at 6,482.16 and turnover dipped from HKDollars 4.69bn to HKDollars 3.3bn. Blue chips were mostly lower, with utilities losing the most. However, HSBC rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 69 on expectations of good annual results being reported next week. AUSTRALIA continued to be unsettled by Labor's gains in the latest opinion polls and shares closed firmer but off their highs. The All Ordinaries index finished 3.5 up at 1,617.1, after peaking at 1,620.3. Turnover was a light 111.2m shares worth ADollars 189m, with overnight trades of 3.4m News Corp shares and 2m Kolback shares contributing to the volume. News Corp added 7 cents at ADollars 7.22 and Kolback put on 4 cents at 37 cents. SINGAPORE was dominated by speculative Malaysian shares traded over the counter and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 3.67 higher at 1,661.04. The first day of options trading made a slow start, with most investors, unfamiliar with the new trading instrument, said to be reluctant to test it. TAIWAN saw some early institutional demand for industrial stocks but the mood turned negative as heavy profit-taking began among financial issues. The weighted index finished 122.07, or 2.6 per cent, lower at 4,601.58 in active turnover of TDollars 74.7bn. KUALA LUMPUR saw some speculative buying but blue chips remained under pressure. Falls in leading component stocks dragged the composite index down 0.41 to 637.93. SEOUL reversed nine consecutive days of declines and the composite index rebounded 19.69 to 625.62.</p>

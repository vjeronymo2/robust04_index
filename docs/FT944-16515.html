			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Manufacturers push up their ability to compete British manufacturers have become much more competitive over the past year, recording a substantial rise in productivity and a fall in unit labour costs. Figures from the Department of Employment, published yesterday, showed that manufacturing output per head in the three months to August was 5.3 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993. Over the same period, manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output fell by 0.8 per cent. The fall occurred because output was growing faster than average earnings. Three-monthly figures smooth out volatile movements and slightly flatter the August performance. In August alone, output per head grew 4.9 per cent compared with the year before, while unit wage costs fell 0.3 per cent. Nevertheless, the Treasury welcomed the figures as showing that British industry was improving its ability to compete. The underlying rate of growth of average earnings stayed at 3.75 per cent in the year to August. Apart from March and May, when it edged up to 4 per cent, the annual growth rate of average earnings has been steady at 3.75 per cent throughout 1994. Within the earnings figures, however, there was a small rise in the production and manufacturing sectors. In both sectors, July's underlying annual growth rate was revised upwards from 4 per cent to 4.25 per cent, a figure which was maintained in August. In the services sector, the annual rate of underlying earnings growth was unchanged at 3.5 per cent in August. The underlying monthly figures for average earnings level out temporary factors such as industrial disputes. The seasonally adjusted annual earnings rate in August was 3.7 per cent, down from 3.8 per cent in July. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Average earnings growth has remained below 4.5 per cent for 19 months, the longest run of low earnings growth in the last 30 years.'</p>

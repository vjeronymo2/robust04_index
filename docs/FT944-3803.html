			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / EU hunts for business winners The European Commission will this week announce its backing for a Ecu1.2m (Pounds 940,000) project to try to identify Europe's fastest growing companies and the factors behind their success. The Commission, which is providing more than Ecu500,000 for the project, recognises that there is little understanding in Europe of entrepreneur-led companies and that Union policy often appears preoccupied with large industry, despite small businesses' importance as the main generators of jobs throughout the community. If the research successfully identifies rapidly growing companies and highlights their pre-occupations, it could lead to the establishment of a permanent body in Brussels representing their interests, the project co-ordinators say. Researchers, led by accountants Ernst &amp; Young, will scour the Union and Efta countries for the 500 most rapidly growing companies that are prepared to say how they achieved their growth. About 50 companies will be featured at an international conference in late 1995 where the initial findings will be presented.</p>

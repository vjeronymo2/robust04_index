			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP WRIGGLES ON HOOK OF INSINCERE CONVICTIONS;  </P> <P> ABORTION: THERE WAS NO TREND SET IN TUESDAY'S ELECTIONS, BUT THE RESULTS WERE  ENOUGH TO FLUSH THE OPPORTUNISTS OUT OF A DECADE OF DECEPTION.  </P> <P> Time crawls when you are not having any fun at all, so for Democrats it must  seem a century rather than a mere decade since Ted Kennedy launched his first  and last presidential campaign (Nov. 7, 1979). Ten years to the day later,  Democrats had fun in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia.  </P> <P> On any given Election Day, the party that does best talks about national trends  and the other party says, plaintively, "All politics are local." In the  aftermath of Tuesday's results, Republicans are sounding plaintive, although  they have a small slice of a point.  </P> <P> The fact that New York will have yet another Democratic mayor is not momentous  news, even if he is black. Virginia's new Democratic governor, who is black,  will replace a popular Democrat who in turn replaced a popular Democrat. In New  Jersey, people are probably more intensely interested in the issue of  auto-insurance rates than anything else.  </P> <P> Still, the Republican Party is suffering a severe case of hamhandedness,  beginning with its Maximum Leader. In September in New Jersey, President Bush  said that the gubernatorial election there was a referendum of the national  party's values. The Republican candidate, Jim Courter, caught the spirit: "If  you liked Michael Dukakis, you'll love Jim Florio." Florio beat Courter with  61% of the vote.  </P> <P> Republicans had won five victories in New Jersey in the 1980s -- Reagan carried  it twice, Bush once, and Tom Kean twice won the governorship. How important was  the abortion issue there and in Virginia?  </P> <P> There is ample evidence that most Americans spend most waking hours thinking  about sex. But abortion? Most voters will not pull the voting lever for or  against a candidate solely because of his position on that issue. But it can  change the way voters think about an entire party. It may make the Republican  Party look cynical and frivolous.  </P> <P> Abortion is one of the relatively few issues on which the parties are explicit  and diametrically opposed. Democrats are for abortion as a fundamental  constitutional right. The last three Republican platforms have called not  merely for overturning the 1973 Supreme Court ruling -- not merely for  restoring the abortion issue to the political arena -- but for a constitutional  amendment to outlaw abortion. Probably 80% of the electorate opposes the  Republican view.  </P> <P> Courter's campaign collapsed early when he was unprepared to comment  intelligently on last summer's Supreme Court ruling that expanded states'  powers to regulate abortions. Then he waffled about his anti-abortion views,  saying he still held them but would not let his convictions influence public  policy.  </P> <P> The Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, Marshall Coleman, might  have won in a walk instead of losing narrowly to L. Douglas Wilder had he not  been so strongly anti-abortion.  </P> <P> So from coast to coast, Republicans are tinkering with what they smilingly call  their convictions. They are seeking graceful, or at any rate the least  disgraceful, ways to say, "Er . . . um . . . well . . . on the other hand . . .  that stuff we said about abortion being the murder of 'pre-born babies'? We  never meant it." That will be the first truthful thing many of them have said  on the subject for years. This party-wide exercise in, shall we say,  clarification will require presidential leadership.  </P> <P> This decade dawned with candidate Bush unburdening himself on the subject in  the pages of Rolling Stone (March, 1980). There he said of the court's 1973  decision: "I happen to think it was right." He happened to think that saying so  would help him politically. It did not then, but it may now. So look for yet  another U-turn, like the one he took in late summer, 1980, to get from  pandering to Rolling Stone readers to running with Reagan.  </P> <P> The Republican Party prospered in the 1980s because it was accorded --  sometimes grudgingly -- the respect that comes to institutions that have moral  gravity. It had a seriousness that seemed admirable even to many people who  were skeptical about its wisdom. Now, as the party begins the entertaining  spectacle of wriggling off the hook on which it has impaled itself, it is in  danger of sounding simply silly.  </P> <P> Today the President, hero of last month's successful struggle to prevent public  aid from reaching impoverished victims of rape and incest, sounds somehow  softer. The day after his election, he said he would never, ever, change his  position. But what is it this week? "I just come down more on the side of the  life." Wriggle, wriggle.  </P> <P> We who opposed the 1973 ruling when we read it rather than when we read polls  about it have always seen the synthetic nature of much Republican opposition to  it. Now everyone will see the insincerity as the political bill comes due for a  decade of opportunism.  </P> <P> More and more Republicans are going to say, " 'Murder'? No, actually we meant  'mistake.' " And "Outlaw abortion? Where did that cockamamie idea come from?"  More and more voters will say, "Be serious. No, come to think about, don't. We  like you better the way you are."  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (3): Too many choices - Short-haul jets are worst hit THE REGIONAL and commuter aircraft industry is undergoing a significant shake-up. Of all commercial aircraft markets, it has been one of the worst hit by the recession, the slowdown in air travel, and the financial troubles of smaller airlines - the principal customers for regional jets and turbopropeller commuter aircraft. The slump has highlighted the fundamental structural problem of the industry. Simply put, it is suffering from over-capacity with too many manufacturers offering too many competing products. For smaller regional jet-makers, the problem has been exacerbated by the presence of the three large commercial aircraft manufacturers at the upper end of the market. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, of the US, offer 100-seat versions of their twin-engine narrow-body aircraft, the 737 and the MD80/90. The European Airbus consortium is now studying the possibility of entering the 120-seater jet market for the first time, by launching a new smaller derivative of its A320 twinjet called the A319. All this has led to an acceleration in efforts to rationalise the regional airliner industry, especially in Europe. Some consolidation has already begun. Bombardier of Canada absorbed Short Brothers of Northern Ireland and, more recently, de Havilland of Canada, after a joint bid for the Canadian group by Aerospatiale, the French aerospace company, and Alenia of Italy, had been blocked by the European Commission. Aerospatiale and Alenia have also pooled their resources to form the ATR regional turbopropeller aircraft consortium. But the current focus is on Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, which finally agreed this summer to a merger with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace arm of Germany's Daimler-Benz group. Dasa will acquire control of Fokker through a 51 per cent stake in a joint holding company to form the basis of a new partnership in the regional airliner sector. Fokker is expected to provide its marketing expertise, and Dasa the necessary financial backing to support future regional airliner programmes. Fokker has been working on plans to develop a smaller 70-seat version of its Fokker 100 jet and eventually a larger 120- to 130-seat derivative. The agreement between Dasa and Fokker is also expected to set the stage for a broad realignment of the European regional aircraft industry. Dasa has had its eyes set on the regional jet business for the past two years, as part of its long-term strategy to re-establish the German aerospace industry in a leading position in commercial aircraft. To this end, it formed last year a partnership with Aerospatiale and Alenia to develop a new family of regional jets as well as to co-ordinate the three companies' products and marketing networks in the commuter and regional aircraft sector. The deal with Fokker, however, has clearly placed a large question mark on the future of the earlier partnership agreed between Dasa, Aerospatiale and Alenia. But the Fokker transaction could ultimately lead to Aerospatiale and Alenia joining the new German-Dutch partnership to form a broader European regional aircraft consortium creating a similar sort of European consortium for regional aircraft as the European Airbus large airliner manufacturing consortium. This is bound to put additional pressure on other manufacturers, especially British Aerospace (BAe), to speed up the search for partners or perhaps consider joining forces with the proposed new European regional aircraft consortium. Tackling the problems of its loss-making regional aircraft activities has become one of the top priorities of BAe's restructuring strategy. The UK group has been attempting to negotiate a partnership with Japanese aerospace companies in its regional aircraft business, and has also been talking to Taiwan Aerospace and other manufacturers. The industry believes BAe could ultimately withdraw from this business. But while the industry is scrambling to restructure itself, it remains confident of the longer-term growth prospects of the commuter and regional jet market. Apart from the sustained requirement for smaller jets and turbopropeller aircraft from developing countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, demand is expected to increase in industrialised countries as the airline industry continues to develop hub and spoke route networks. Airlines will thus require small regional and feeder aircraft operating at high frequency to feed passengers to the major domestic and international routes at their hub airports. Since deregulation 12 years ago, this has been the case in the US, where a few strong carriers now dominate the market, operating dense nationwide networks with frequent services using smaller jets and commuter aircraft. With the European Commission's third stage of airline liberalisation starting next year, large European carriers are expected to intensify efforts to open new hubs in other EC member states. This is likely to provide a strong stimulus for the commuter and regional aircraft market.</p>

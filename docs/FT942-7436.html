			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds fall again as hopes fade of further cuts in rates German government bonds suffered further declines yesterday after figures showed continued rapid growth in the money supply. The June bund future fell 0.30 per cent to 94.38. The money supply numbers fuelled fears that further cuts in official interest rates are unlikely, although a small reduction in the minimum repo rate at the Bundesbank's open-market operation today is expected. 'Today has been a continuation of the sell-off that started on Friday for the overall market and of the shift in the yield curve that started on Thursday afternoon,' after comments by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, said Mr Karl Haeling, head of the futures and options group at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. Mr Tietmeyer's comments were taken to mean that there would be no more official German interest rate cuts in the near future. 'Tietmeyer's comments have triggered a big change in sentiment and investors have sold the short end and bought long because they are expecting a slowing down in the easing process,' Mr Haeling said. Analysts said that there was also some concern about rising commodity prices although the rises were to some extent a bounce-back from very low levels. German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 15.8 per cent in April, up from the 15.4 per cent rise seen in March and still well above the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target range. The bund market took some cheer from the announcement that today's allocation of securities repurchase agreements, or 'repos', by the Bundesbank will be at variable rather than fixed rates. A survey of German money market traders by MMS International forecast a three basis point drop in the lowest accepted repo rate to 5.20 per cent from last week's 5.23 per cent. UK government bonds also fell back ahead of today's convertible gilt auction as the market tracked developments in bunds. Today's auction of the new 7.0 per cent 1997 gilt, convertible into 9.0 per cent 2012 bonds, has not attracted a great deal of interest so far, analysts said, mainly because of the difficulty of pricing the first convertible gilt to be issued since 1987. Analysts said that it was valued at around 100 13/16 in 'when issued' trading yesterday. A bid-to-cover ratio of about two is expected. In late trading, the UK long gilt future was down almost  29/32 points at 104 9/16 . French bonds caught up with Monday's losses in the German market, causing the notional government bond future to fall 1.12 points from Friday to 120.46. As expected, the French central bank left its key intervention rate unchanged at 5.40 per cent and traders are watching the German repo allocation for further clues on the direction of interest rates. However, most were betting on only a modest drop in the repo rate, offering France little scope for further easing. Japanese government bond futures rose, supported by the successful auction of the new 3.9 per cent 10-year bonds. The bid-to-cover ratio of 2.32 reflected healthy demand, especially from retail investors attracted by the issue price below par, a trader said. The average issue price was 99.44. The September JGB futures contract rose 0.27 points to 112.80 in Tokyo and climbed to 112.91 in London. US Treasury bonds improved yesterday but prices receded from their session highs after an afternoon auction of two-year notes failed to generate much enthusiasm. Late in the session, the 30-year government bond was  11/32 higher at 86 9/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.396 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 1/4 , yielding 5.897 per cent. Although the trading week had begun with a big sell-off, the market found room for optimism early in the session. Monday's downturn mostly reflected a sharp rise in commodity prices. Yesterday, the market was relieved as the Commodity Research Bureau index declined, largely because the outlook for grain harvests had deteriorated. Concerns over the dollar also eased as news that Washington and Tokyo would resume framework talks on trade helped the US currency gain ground against the yen. The market also rose amid confidence over the prospects for a successful Treasury auction of two-year notes later in the day. The last government auction had been a big let-down, and fears of a repeat performance sent a shiver through the market on Monday. In the event, the Dollars 17bn issue was awarded at a slightly higher yield than expected. The mild disappointment raised fresh concerns about today's Dollars 11bn sale of five-year notes, which are usually more difficult to digest than the shorter-term paper. As a result, the solid gains struck early in the session were eroded in the final hours of trading.</p>

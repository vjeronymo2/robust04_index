Minister Israel Vargas said the Brazilian Space Agency,  which  is civilian run, will by-pass the developed countries' boycott  against Brazil on the transfer of sensitive technology. He  commented: "Our program is for strictly peaceful purposes."    The minister believes the new service will enable Brazil to  enter the low altitude communications satellite market. He  said: "One of the agency's main tasks is a review of the entire  Brazilian space program."    The Science and Technology Ministry has important space  cooperation agreements with China and is looking into the  possibility of a partnership with Argentina.</p>

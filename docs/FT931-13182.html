			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Calpers names groups that perform poorly THE California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the largest institutional investors in the US with Dollars 71m in investment funds, has released the names of 12 companies it is targeting in an increasingly aggressive shareholder's rights campaign. Calpers said it had held, or was seeking, meetings with representatives of the 12 companies among the fund's worst market performers. Mr Dale Hanson, Calpers' chief executive, said the fund began its 1993 shareholder advocacy programme last September. But until now, it had not named the companies from which it was seeking changes in governance. Seven companies have reached deals with Calpers. These are: Boise Cascade, Champion International, MacFrugals Bargain Closeouts, Polaroid, Sears, Time Warner, and Westinghouse. Talks are continuing with Advanced Micro Devices, Chrysler, IBM, Pennzoil and Sizzler.</p>

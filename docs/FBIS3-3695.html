			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Mark What Tibet NPC Deputies Say on Human </F> Rights"]    [Text] Fifteen deputies from Tibet attending the Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] met  Chinese and foreign reporters a few days ago and answered their  questions on Tibet's human rights and other issues of common  concern.    Some of these deputies come from top levels of the  autonomous  region while others are from the basic levels; some are of serf  origin and some are living Buddhas from the monasteries. They  used facts to explain that the Tibetans are living in peace and  tranquility and genuinely enjoy human rights and to refute the  lies spread by certain "guardians of human rights" on Tibet's  human rights.    More than 40 years ago Tibet was like a state in the  extremely backward Middle Ages and one of the regions in the  world where human rights violation were very serious. Following  the democratic reform and abolition of the extremely decadent  and dark feudal serf system, the millions of serfs and slaves  stood up. They were no longer the property of the serf owners  who could be traded, transferred, exchanged, and used as payment  of debt or who were subjected to the savage actions of eye  gouging and cutting off of tongues, hands, and legs. Since  then, they have enjoyed basic human rights and have become  masters of their own affairs. Earthshaking changes have taken  place in Tibet after more than 40 years of construction. The  situation in Tibet is now characterized by political stability,  economic development, social progress, national concord, and  peace and tranquility. After giving an account of Tibet's rapid  development in recent years, Re Di, who is responsible for the  Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, said: "With a brand  new outlook, Tibet now stands firm on the roof of the world."    Who says that human rights are being encroached upon in  Tibet? These facts precisely prove that the Chinese Government  most respects human rights in Tibet and that the Tibetan people  have gained human rights to the greatest extent. This forms a  sharp contrast to racial discrimination which still prevails in  the United States today.    It is the principle of the UN Charter to enhance and  encourage respect for human rights and basic freedom of the  whole of mankind, irrespective of race, sex, language, or  religion. The United States, which talks volubly about human  rights, should have observed this principle. For a long time,  however, the laws in some southern states in the United States  still regard certain racial discrimination systems as legal,  such as schools which separate whites from other races, laws  which oppose marriages between white and black, and different  public utilities for whites and blacks. This makes it easy to  understand why the United States has still not ratified  implementation of the "Convention on Preventing and Punishing  Genocide," "International Convention on Banning and Punishing  the Crime of Apartheid," "International Convention on Abolishing  All Forms of Racial Discrimination," and other international  human rights treaties.    There is no doubt that the people in Tibet have gained a  wide  range of unprecedented human rights. However, there are some  people in the world who say that human rights are being violated  in Tibet. These people apply the human rights concept of the  West to view the reality in Tibet or they simply use concocted  or seriously distorted facts to substitute Tibet's reality and  befuddle world opinion. Last May, a Western organization spread  the news that Tibet had arrested more than 100 Tibetans. The  report was a pure fabrication. In fact, only three persons were  tried at that time, of which one was immediately released and  the other two had directly undermined state security. At the  50th meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee held in February  this year, a representative of a nongovernmental organization  went so far as to present a piece of news, which he himself did  not verify, to attack the human rights situation in Tibet. The  so-called list presented by Christopher of 105 "peaceful  dissidents" jailed in Tibet was also fabricated. Re Di told  reporters: According to an investigation, many people on the  list do not even exist. Some of them are living in their own  homes. We do not know where the list came from. What would be  the reaction of Christopher to such an explanation?    The Tibetans, who have personally experienced historic  changes since Tibet's liberation over the past decades, rather  than the people in the West, who are far away from the region  and are ignorant of Tibet, are most qualified to speak on human  rights in Tibet. Some of the 15 Tibetan deputies, who gave an  account of Tibet's human rights to Chinese and foreign reporters  a few days ago, were slaves in the past. They all had records  of their human rights being trampled upon before the democratic  reform and the wide range of human rights enjoyed after the  democratic reform. Their appraisal of Tibet's human rights is  genuine and fair. When a reporter asked about Tibet's human  rights, Ruo Sang, director of a Lhasa neighborhood, said: I am  most qualified to answer the question. We were slaves in the  past without any human rights. Today, we have become masters and  genuinely enjoy human rights.    Even figures from abroad have acknowledged the development  and progress in the region after their trips to Tibet. Those  who were prejudiced toward Tibet in the past have also stated  that it is unfair to view Tibet based on one-sided statements.    Here, we would like to ask: Why are certain Western  countries and organizations always trying to attack human rights  in Tibet, regardless of the facts? Why have they thrown mud at  the Tibetans, who have freed themselves from suffering and who  have become masters of their own affairs, rather than condemning  the darkness, brutality, and cruelty of the serf owners who  deprived the Tibetans of their human rights? Why have they paid  special attention to a handful of splittists while ignoring the  efforts made by the Tibetans to boost construction and develop  the economy? There is only one answer to these questions: They  are making use of human rights in an attempt to support "Tibetan  independence," stirred up by a tiny handful of splittists, and  disrupt China's reunification. As stated by the Tibetan  deputies, such a conspiracy will be resolutely opposed by the  people of the whole country, including the Tibetans.</p>

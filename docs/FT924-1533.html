			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Alcan optimistic on outlook ALCAN Aluminium saw a 'bright mid to long-term future for the aluminium industry.' Mr David Morton, chairman and chief executive of the Canadian group, forecast that demand should grow significantly in 1994-95, adding that it was 'a period when no additional primary capacity would becoming on-stream', AP-DJ reports. Mr Morton said net capital spending in 1993 would again be lower than the USDollars 880m spent in 1991. He added that the level should be 'below Dollars 500m'. The company is expected to end the year with about Dollars 530m in capital spending. Since 1989, Alcan has cut about 8,000 jobs, or 14 per cent of its work force, and has scaled back production costs as well as selling and administrative expenses. Through the first nine months of 1992, the company has cut Dollars 166m in costs, after inflation. Mr Morton said the industry's oversupply was not likely to be remedied in the coming year. There is about a 1.5m metric ton surplus of aluminum, in large part because of production by the former Soviet Union. He added that a 500,000-ton swing in the surplus could cause a 'rocketing' in aluminum prices, which are currently about Dollars 1,200 a metric ton. Such a swing, he pointed out, could come from one or two smelters dropping out, and from a surge in imports by China, which 'is growing like a weed'. Mr Morton said the company would set up an office in Moscow which would be in operation in the next quarter. He said that the new office would help identify and pursue opportunities in metal trading, the sale of smelter technology, possibly joint research and development, and downstream fabrication. But, he went on, 'we are not rushing out there with an open cheque book'.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help BPP to Pounds 3m FIRST-TIME contributions from acquisitions in its publishing division helped BPP Holdings lift pre-tax profits by 35 per cent, from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.97m, in the first half of 1991. Turnover at the financial training and publishing group rose to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 19m). The publishing side increased profits to Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 191,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 2.67m). Mr Richard Price, chairman, said some Pounds 900,000 of the advance was due to the inclusion of Melrose, which makes video-based training packages, and Letts Educational, a publisher of home-study books for A-level and GCSE exams, though there had also been about Pounds 100,000 of launch write-offs from a series of titles on financial risk management. Mr Price said the parts of BPP's training and publishing businesses which led to the taking of exams had remained 'fairly robust,' but activities not leading to exams had seen a fall-off in discretionary spending. He also pointed to the 'virtuous circle' whereby 'student-driven' expansion in courses for the Stock Exchange, banking, and all types of accountancy resulted in higher sales of the text books needed for those courses. Profits in professional training grew to Pounds 522,000 (Pounds 492,000) on turnover up Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 5.4m. The language training side - of which two thirds is overseas - increased profits from Pounds 439,000 - depleted by the Gulf war - to Pounds 620,000 on reduced turnover of Pounds 9.03m (Pounds 9.36m). Linguarama needed 'a real improvement in business confidence' to fulfil its potential. 'Softer recruitment' last September in the five independent sixth-form colleges, or crammers, owned by MPW resulted in lower profits of Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 642,000) in the academic education division. Earnings were 7.2p (6.4p) and the interim dividend 2.7p (2.4p). The group has no borrowings.</p>

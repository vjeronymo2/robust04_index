			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Countries in crisis such as Iran,  Iraq, Syria, and Libya are trying to build up their arms  stockpiles with nuclear, biological, and chemical [NBC] weapons  by the extensive use of agents. Information from the German  Office for the Protection of the Constitution obtained by the  Cologne EXPRESS newspaper (Sunday [19 June] edition) reveals  they are increasingly trying to obtain "sensitive" goods  necessary for the production of NBC weapons.    The documents say that employees of the former Soviet KGB  secret service have expanded the range of their spying  activities in Germany. The goal is not to acquire know-how but  to exert direct influence on firms and associations. Eastern  secret services have also increased their activity through  former Stasi agents who have not yet been detected.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> POLICE CAPTURE MAN AFTER 20-MINUTE CHASE  </P> <P> A man who allegedly exposed himself to women at a Santa Ana intersection was  captured after a 20-minute automobile chase through several cities, police  reported over the weekend.  </P> <P> Mark Jonathon Smith, 30, of Anaheim, was arrested on suspicion of trying to  evade arrest and driving while intoxicated. He was not charged with indecent  exposure because the two women who made the original complaint could not be  located after his arrest, officers said.  </P> <P> Police said the women stopped a patrol officer about 11 p.m. Friday and told  him that a driver near the intersection of 17th Street and Harbor Boulevard had  exposed himself. The driver fled as police tried to stop him, and a chase  ensued, with speeds up to 80 m.p.h., officers said. No one was injured during  the chase, police said.  </P></p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Siemens holed by Nixdorf STIFF PRICE competition and the appreciation of the D-Mark have dashed hopes of improved results this year from Siemens Nixdorf (SNI), the Siemens group's lossmaking computer subsidiary. In spite of successful cost-cutting and a 50 per cent increase in unit sales of hardware, losses in the 12 months to the end of September are expected to match last year's DM513m (Pounds 200m) deficit, Mr Heinrich von Pierer, group chairman, said yesterday. He estimated the combined effects of currency movements and price-cutting would cost SNI DM1bn. Although overall group prospects had been revised downwards, the company still expected net profits to match last year's DM1.95bn, said Mr von Pierer. Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, finance director, hinted that the dividend would be held at DM13. Operating results would fall in the full year, and the value of incoming orders would probably drop by around 1 per cent to DM84bn. Group sales, meanwhile would rise by around 4 per cent to DM81bn. Initial forecasts, issued in January, were probably too optimistic, Mr von Pierer admitted. At the start of the year he expected new orders growth of up to 2 per cent and a 7 per cent increase in turnover. Reviewing the first eight months of the financial year, Mr von Pierer said group orders had fallen almost 6 per cent, while turnover had risen 2 per cent. Incoming domestic orders fell 14 per cent, while foreign demand rose 1 per cent. Meanwhile, the workforce had been cut by 3 per cent, or 11,000. More than 2,000 more jobs would go by the end of the financial year, leaving a total workforce of less than 400,000. Rationalisation projects should reduce costs by as much as 30 per cent in the next few years. Mr von Pierer claimed restructuring in semiconductors, another drain on profits, was showing results, bolstered by increased demand for components. The group's drive into south-east Asia was also yielding fruit.</p>

"However, this does not signify an estrangement but is  indicative, rather, of the ongoing drawing of the two countries  closer together at a fundamentally new level and of the  restoration and strengthening of the age-old ties between Russia  and Uzbekistan."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the Russian-Uzbek accords:    "The accords reached in Moscow open up new opportunities for  strengthening the political and economic relations between  Russia and Uzbekistan. At the same time they encourage  cooperation within the commonwealth of independent states".    PRAVDA on the Uzbek president's visit:    "The first official visit by Uzbekistan's head of state went  off successfully. The results of the accords reached by the two  presidents will undoubtedly make themselves felt already in the  coming days".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with  Lieutenant- General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th  Russian Army in the Dniester region.    In response to a question about the future of the 14th Army,  General Lebed said: "As is known, the leadership of the Republic  of Moldova advocates the withdrawal of the army from its  territory, but, to my mind, it is now impossible to withdraw the  army for a variety of reasons, beginning with the fact that the  sanguinary conflict between Moldova and the Dniester region has  not been resolved politically and, accordingly, there are no  guarantees of peace and stability in the region.    "The possibility of a new flare-up of hostilities has not  disappeared. People view the 14th Army as the guarantor of  peace and stability, the guarantor which can prevent war and, if  it is unleashed, stop the bloodshed. Therefore, the army's  withdrawal should be preceded by a rather long, delicate and  wise political process which, unfortunately, has not yet begun".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Bosnian peace process:    "The process of settling the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina  on the principle of a threat of the use of force has reached a  deadlock and leads to nowhere: NATO countries just cannot for  years threaten with air strikes. Neither can the peoples of  Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia to live for years under such a  threat...    "It is important these days, as never before, to prevent the  conflict in Bosnia from growing into a European tragedy and  deprive NATO of the right to determine when bombing and missile  strikes in Bosnia should be carried out.    "It is essential urgently to look for new approaches to and  ideas of a political settlement both in Bosnia and within a  broader context in the Balkans. Such a decision should be taken  at the level of, at least, the U.N. Security Council".    TRUD runs an interview with Professor Aleksandr Livshits,  dr.  of science (economics) and leader of the expert group to the  Russian president.    Livshits, one of the main economic advisers to President  Boris Yeltsin, said in particular that he sees it as the main  task now "to make market reforms less burdensome for society  without slowing down the reform process. The main thing is to  ensure that the price of market reforms is not too great for  society".    PRAVDA frontpages the text of Aleksandr Rutskoy's address to  the people of Russia and to the members of the State Duma under  the headline "There Can Be No Creative Endeavour Without Civil  Peace".    The message says in particular that "in autumn last year all  those, who were in the parliament building and manned the  barricades, discharged their civil and patriotic duty to the  end, upholding nascent parliamentarism, democracy and the  constitution... For my part, I will do everything depending on  me to perpetuate the lucid memory of those who perished..."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the amnesty decision:    "The political amnesty story has once again pointed out the  major flaw in our present-day democracy -- the inadequecy of the  judicial branch of power. Will the judicial branch draw level  with the other branches of power? Stability and accord in  society depend on that in many respect".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an interview with Mikhail  Slinko, investigator of particularly important cases at the  Moscow city prosecutor's office and the leader of a team of  investigators probing charges of corruption brought up against  Aleksandr Rutskoy in August last year.    Slinko said Rutskoy's signature on the documents, which were  submitted to the investigators and which testified against the  former vice-president, was forged.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA comments on a joint statement issued by  Patriarch Aleksey II of Moscow and all Russia and Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. In the statement the church and  the army expressed readiness to cooperate for the benefit of the  motherland.    The St. Petersburg-based newspaper VESTI reports that a  monument to Finnish prisoners of war has been unveiled at  Gatchina. According to data provided by Russian and Finnish  historians, about 1,000 Finns died at Soviet P.O.W. camps during  the Second World War.    The monument represents a shell-splinter piercing red  granite  symbolising the soldier's heart.</p>

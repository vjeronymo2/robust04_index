			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (9): New roads will await the incomers - Transport: Rhys David sees an opportunity to re-unite the city centre with its waterfront CARDIFF IS a city divided by its main railway line. To the south of the London-Swansea tracks lie the port, and the inner city suburbs, of Splott, Tremorfa, Butetown and Grangetown, which provided the workforce for the docks and the now demolished Guest Keen steelworks. To the north, lie the splendid Edwardian civic centre, and the plusher suburbs of Cyncoed, Llanishen, Rhiwbina, Whitchurch, and Llandaff. The development of Cardiff Bay, an area one sixth the size of the whole city, is creating an opportunity to change this orientation and to re-unite the city centre with its waterfront, creating in the process a substantially larger central urban area. The objective is being achieved through investment totalling more than Pounds 450m in infrastructure, a large proportion of which is accounted for by a new road network. Whereas in London the pace of development in docklands in the 1980s quickly outpaced the introduction of new infrastructure, Cardiff has been able to take advantage of the property market slowdown of the past four years to make sure the roads are put in place ahead of incoming businesses. The main piece of infrastructure is a Pounds 100m new peripheral distributor road, one of the biggest ever urban road projects in Britain. When completed later this decade, it will leave the M4 east of Cardiff looping through the bay, passing underground through a central section, before rejoining the motorway west of the city. The road, the eastern section of which is being built by a joint venture between local builders, DMD, and Italian group Cogefar Impresit, will make southern Cardiff much more accessible, both from outside the city and from its western and eastern suburbs, than has hitherto been the case, at the same time creating a new southern perimeter to the city centre. Other roads between the existing city centre and the bay area have also been built, but a grand new spine route is also being planned, which will have to carry the weight of being both the principal physical and symbolic link between old and new city. At present, the one-mile-long Bute Street - the heart of what used to be known as Tiger Bay - runs south from the main east-west railway line to Pier Head, flanked on one side by a high railway embankment carrying trains from the Cardiff Valleys. Under the proposals put forward by the CBDC, the railway embankment will be removed, and replaced at road level by light railway tracks, with the main road into the bay, a tree-lined avenue, running on either side of the tracks. On the bayside, the avenue will end in a waterfront piazza alongside the proposed new opera house and the new flagship building being created for NCM. At its northern end the avenue will deposit traffic in a new square south of the tracks, from which it will exit into an extension of St Mary Street, one of the city's principal retailing thoroughfares. Around the new square there are plans to develop a total of 1m sq ft of offices, retailing, a hotel and restaurants. Other improvements in the road system around Cardiff may be recommended, as a result of studies carried out by consultants into the impact of the injection into the bay area of the city of an estimated 30,000 new jobs when the scheme is completed. What has already been shown is that there needs to be an increase in public transport to achieve as near as possible a 50/50 per cent split between private and public transport, and a variety of options, including improved bus services and either an upgraded rail, or new light rail, system, are being considered. An extensive network of commuter services - the legacy of the former coal train network which connected the pits with Cardiff docks - fans out from Cardiff's Central and Queen Street stations to the valleys, with one branch travelling along the Bute Street embankment The CBDC has earmarked funds for a possible new light rail system which could work on existing British Rail lines out of the city and possibly run eventually along the city's streets. A joint study has been set up with Nottingham Development Enterprise, which is interested in a similar development, based on a system in use in Karlsruhe in Germany. Uinder this system, vehicles operate on diesel or electric power and lower a guide wheel from their chassis on to a track set in the road for use when operating away from conventional railway lines. The improvements planned in the transport to the area are intended to go at least part of the way to counter the argument that investment in the bay is depriving other parts of south Wales of badly-needed resources, by making it much easier for people living within a 15-20 miles radius of Cardiff to commute to work in the city, while still living in well-established valley communities. Improved links will also make it possible for the tourist attractions which are planned for the area to be reached by the large population within a few hours drive of the city, not just in south Wales but in southern England and the Midlands. Bristol, Avon, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire are all within an hour of Cardiff, while areas as far away as the western fringe of London are not much more than two hours away. Apart from Welsh National Opera, which it is hoped will continue to attract its own faithful clientele when its new building is developed, there will be a range of other attractions in the bay area, which CBDC's chief executive, Michael Boyce, believes can become a Covent Garden-by-the-sea, attracting 2m visitors a year by 2000. These will include, if all goes as planned, a National Science Centre, offering a wide range of hands-on experiences, a National Centre for Sporting Excellence, and in the areas closest to the watefront a network of lanes, passageways and piazzas, for eating, drinking, and buying, - or just strolling and browsing</p>

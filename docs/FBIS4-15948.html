			<p>BFN     [Text] In the first quarter of 1994, industrial production  went down by 24.9 percent in Russia compared to the same period  in 1993 -- the highest index since reforms began. A year ago,  industrial decline stood at 19.3 percent. Russia's State  Statistics Committee told Interfax that the rate of industrial  decline had increased from 23.1 percent to 24.1 percent in  February, and to 27.4 percent in March. In experts' estimate,  volumes of production are being increasingly determined by  demand, not by the availability of resources which was typical  over the previous couple of years.    Production stoppages occurred at almost 5,000 enterprises.  However, whereas at the beginning of last year stoppages were  mostly due to shortages of components, raw materials and fuel,  in the first quarter of 1994 stoppages were caused by the  absence of demand. In the consumer sector, for instance, it is  difficult to sell products because of the population's  re-orientation to imported goods.    The fuel and energy branches have reduced the production of  oil and coal by 9-15 percent (the production of gas remaining  stable), machine-building and light-industry enterprises have  cut down production almost two times, the chemical industry by  25-30 percent, steel industry by 20-25 percent and food industry  by 10-20 percent. In the first quarter of the year, Russia  produced 75.7 Mn [million] tonnes of oil, which is 15 percent  down from the volume produced during the same period last year.</p>

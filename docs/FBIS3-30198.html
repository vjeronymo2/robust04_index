A new multiparty Krajina parliament is supposed  to meet in 10 days. Milan Martic, newly elected RSK president,  held his first news conference today at which, among economic  measures and moves, he also announced the introduction of the  super dinar, because he assessed that a unified monetary policy  in the FRY, the republic of Srpska, and the RSK is the first  step toward the creation of a joint state:    [Correspondent Petko Koprivica] Newly elected RSK President  Milan Martic held his first news conference in Knin today when  he, among other things, repeated that he will remain resolute in  his intention to realize six key points of his electoral  program, which are defense, legal order, the reanimation and  promotion of the economy, the strengthening of diplomatic  activities, and the unification of the Serbian lands into one  state:    [Martic] "I continue to be a common man with a new burden on  my back and with a desire that the program that I have drawn up  succeeds, because if the program succeeds the people have also  succeeded. I think that the program can and must succeed, as  nobody has the right to oppose what constitutes the interest and  the will of this people."    [Koprivica] Let us listen how the RSK President commented on  the beginning of the establishment of relations between Belgrade  and Zagreb, that is to say, how he sees the borders of his  country in the light of the Geneva negotiations:    [Martic] "People can interpret this agreement in Geneva the  way they like. However, it does not significantly change  anything. Not even the signature that Tudjman and President  Milosevic have placed on it brings anything significant. What  it means is only the establishment of peace. However, this  under no circumstances means that Krajina has been returned to  Croatia, as the Croatian politicians have presented this. I am  not surprised that Tudjman is constantly repeating that, by  this, Croatia has in a way been acknowledged within its borders.  This is absolutely not true. The only thing that was signed  was signature for peace, to seek political solutions in peace.    "In any case, we all strive that this actually be the case.  However, we do not renounce anything, and nobody is  contemplating returning the RSK to Croatia. We will negotiate  with Croatia on an equal footing, we will be proportionally  represented in all talks and will negotiate in peace how to live  further as two neighboring countries, but in no way together."    [Koprivica] The RSK President also told journalists that he  would favor that capable and entrepreneurial people, who will be  able to work successfully for the benefit of the Serbian nation,  regardless of their party membership, enter the future  government of this most western Serbian land. Namely, Martic  concluded, nobody, never, under no circumstances can and will  get a mandate to place his personal interests above the national  goals of the Serbian nation.</p>

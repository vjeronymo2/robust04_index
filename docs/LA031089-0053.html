The three-judge panel said  that Michael P. Berry, an unemployed construction worker, may also be tried on  charges of marijuana cultivation and keeping a fighting dog. The boy, James  Soto, of Morgan Hill, was killed June 13, 1987, when he wandered into a side  yard of Berry's home where the tethered dog apparently guarded 243 marijuana  plants.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BINGO BAILOUT PLAN OKD TO PAY CUDAHY SOCIAL AGENCY'S RENT  </P> <P> The Cudahy Redevelopment Agency on Monday approved an out-of-court settlement  with the financially troubled Cudahy Social Service Agency for $40,000 in back  rent that it expects to raise from the proceeds of a bingo game.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the Redevelopment Agency must receive the money by June,  30, 1990, or the Social Service Agency, which distributes food and clothing to  the needy, must move out.  </P> <P> The city cut off funding for the Social Service Agency last September and has  tried since November to evict it from its offices at Elizabeth Street and Otis  Avenue. The agency has paid no rent to the city since July, 1988.  </P> <P> The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, voted 3 to 1 to approve  the agreement. One member, Councilman John Robertson, was absent.  </P> <P> The lone dissenter, Councilman Joe Fregeau, said: "The whole thing sounds  fishy." He would not elaborate.  </P> <P> Joseph D. Castagno, attorney for the Social Service Agency, said its executive  director, James L. Graham, is expected to sign the agreement by Monday.  </P> <P> The agreement relies on Graham's ability to raise the $40,000 from a bingo game  that would be operated by the nonprofit Cudahy Social Service Foundation,  recently formed by John Mgrdichian, a Compton businessman and casino operator.  </P> <P> Mgrdichian owns Murcole, a Compton rubbish firm, and the Hi Desert Casino &amp;  Inn in Adelanto, near Victorville. He also has an interest in the California  Commerce Club, a card club in the city of Commerce.  </P> <P> Cudahy is reviewing Mgrdichian's application for a license to run a 450-seat  bingo parlor that would be built at 4610 Santa Ana St., on property recently  purchased by the Cudahy Social Service Foundation.  </P> <P> Mgrdichian would not predict how much money could be made in such a venture but  said he intends to donate funds to local social service organizations.  </P> <P> According to state law, most proceeds from bingo games must be used for  charitable purposes.  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency and the Social Service Agency were scheduled to go to  Norwalk Superior Court on Aug. 17 to resolve the rent issue, but the city  decided that the dispute had gone on too long and cost too much, Mayor Tom  Thurman said.  </P> <P> "It makes a lot of sense to work out a settlement that both parties can live  with," Thurman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Fees  </P> <P> He said the city was spending between $10,000 and $15,000 in legal fees. The  Downey law firm of Solton, Jacobs, Weiss, Castagno and Sims was representing  Graham of the Social Service Agency for free, Castagno said.  </P> <P> Said Graham: "This whole thing was a political fiasco. It has hurt everybody so  badly."  </P> <P> The agency and the city have been squabbling on a variety of fronts since last  year.  </P> <P> Last September, funding for the nonprofit agency was dropped after city  auditors said it did not have an "adequate financial control system."  </P> <P> The Social Service Agency received more than $130,000 from various government  agencies channeled through the city during fiscal 1986-87. Another $50,000 had  been earmarked for the agency for fiscal 1988-89.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contracts Expired  </P> <P> In October, the city contracted with two other nonprofit agencies to provide  social services to residents. Those contracts expired June 30, and city  officials have not acted to renew them.  </P> <P> Angered by the city's cutoff of funding for the Social Service Agency, some  residents made an unsuccessful attempt to recall Councilmen Robertson and  Joseph Graffio.  </P> <P> Under the Cudahy Social Service Foundation plan's to conduct bingo games to  raise money for the agency, the city could also receive a licensing fee of 1%  of the monthly gross bingo revenues over $5,000.  </P> <P> According to city records, Graham is one of the foundation's seven directors.  Earlier, Graham, Mgrdichian and Councilman Wilfred Colon proposed holding bingo  games in the building the Cudahy Social Service Agency is renting. However, the  proposal stalled when other council members opposed holding bingo games on  city-owned property.  </P> <P> Final approval of Mgrdichian's current bingo application, after a background  check by police and a city review of construction plans, could come within two  weeks, City Manager Gerald Caton said.  </P></p>

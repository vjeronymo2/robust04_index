The Jordanian Government leader is  heading a Jordanian delegation on a visit to South Africa to  reciprocate Mr Botha's visit to the Arab state last year. Mr  al-Lawzi was speaking after a luncheon hosted by Mr Botha.    Mr Botha said the two countries would establish a joint  committee to investigate areas of co-operation in the fields of  agriculture, trade, commerce, mining and culture. Mr Botha said  he had been impressed by Jordan's economic recovery in the  aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War when 300,000 jobless Jordanians  who returned to their homeland had to be accommodated  economically.    Mr al-Lawzi said his government wanted to take the  initiative  in setting up ambassadorial ties with South Africa. One of his  aides said Jordan was looking for a suitable property for its  ambassador who would arrive in South Africa within weeks.</p>

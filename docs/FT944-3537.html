			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Fall in assisted homeless families The number of families accepted as homeless by local authorities has fallen to its lowest level for more than two years, official figures showed yesterday. But the figures coincided with a report that Britain faced 'new youth homelessness crisis' with growing numbers of women and younger people on the streets. Mr David Curry, housing minister, said the new data reflected the success of government measures to increase the supply of affordable housing and to persuade local authorities to move away from using bed and breakfast as temporary accommodation. A survey of those staying at the charity Centrepoint's emergency shelters, however, found the proportion of young women up from 26 per cent to 43 per cent in the past seven years, with a 38 per cent rise in the number of 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds. A survey of 1,500 under-25s at six charity projects shows that 44 per cent were from ethnic minorities. More than four in 10 of the homeless had no income at all, because those aged 16 and 17 cannot claim benefit. The official figures, from the Department of the Environment, put the number of homeless households accepted for rehousing in England in the last quarter at 31,270. In the year ending September 1994 homelessness acceptances were 125,640  - 9 per cent down from the year ending September 1993 and a reduction of 19,440 from the peak annual total of 145,080 for the year ending March 1992.</p>

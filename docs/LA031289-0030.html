			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMALS: PARROT PAIRS  </P> <P> HE WAS A yellow-headed Amazon. She was of mixed background, one of her parents  a yellow-head, the other a red-crowned Amazon. No one knows where she came  from, according to Jeffrey Froke, the man who studied Los Angeles parrots, but  no matter. She grew up and fell in love with her yellow-headed mate, he with  her.  </P> <P> They spent virtually all their time together. When foraging for food, they  always stayed close to each other. At night they slept side by side. They even  flew in close proximity when the flock was traveling. All the other parrots  were equally committed; in fact, a parrot flock is actually a collection of  pairs, not a group of individuals as it is with starlings, say, or shore birds.  </P> <P> But in the matter of communication, they took togetherness to an extreme known  only in Shakespearean plays. All day long, as they went about their business,  they chattered continuously with each other in a pattern known as "antiphonal  duetting." One would begin a call, the other would complete it. When calling  close by, they sounded like one bird. When farther apart, they sounded like one  stereophonic bird. Either way, the technique had the practical function of a  safety check: "I know you're there. You know I'm here," while the flock foraged  in the dense foliage where it's easy to lose sight of one another. This is  standard behavior for Amazons of all kinds.  </P> <P> The couple was never fully accepted by yellow-headed society; they spent their  time on the fringes of the flock. She, using her mimicking skills, adopted the  calls and language of the yellow-headed majority, but when a neighboring flock  of red-crowns flew over, her kindred genes seemed to awaken and she called back  in the speech of her other parent.  </P> <P> Despite the hardships, the pair endured. When last spotted in the West Los  Angeles area, they had been together for at least 20 years.  </P></p>

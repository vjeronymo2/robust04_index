Brother Abu 'Ammar had received the Russian envoy  yesterday evening and during the meeting was handed a message  from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev that stressed  Russia's determination to help with all its resources in the  implementation of the clauses of the UN Security Council  resolution after the Israeli massacre in the holy al-Ibrahimi  mosque in Hebron.    The Russian minister said Russia's stance was to regard this  resolution as of the greatest importance, as well as the need to  ensure international protection for Palestinian citizens in the  occupied territories and Russia's return to participating in  practical measures regarding an international presence in the  occupied territories.    The meeting provided an occasion for President Abu 'Ammar to  brief the Russian envoy on the latest developments in the  situation after the UN resolution.

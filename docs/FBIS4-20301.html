			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Pingshi (7812 1627 4258): "There Can Be No </F> Wavering From `Public Ownership As the Mainstay'"]    [Text] As we implement opening and reform and develop the  socialist market economy, keeping public ownership in its  dominant position is an important component of comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, as well as one of the fundamental spirits of  the 14th National Congress of the CPC. Discussing this topic in  the 14th Party Congress report, comrade Jiang Zeming pointed out  that, "The orientation of economic reform is based on  maintaining public ownership and distribution according to work  as the mainstays; other economic sectors and means of  distribution may supplement these, in order to establish and  perfect the socialism market economy system." He also noted  that, "The socialist market economic structure is combined with  the basic structure of socialism." If public ownership is not  taken as the mainstay, the basic socialist structure will suffer  serious damage, perhaps even a quantitative change. This is  self-evident.    Therefore, in reforming the economic system and developing  the market economy, persistence in taking public ownership as  the dominant sector and nonpublic forms of ownership as  supplements should become a common understanding and unified  guidance for the nation. However, some people believe there  seems to be some incompatibility between insistence on taking  public ownership as the dominant sector and establishing the  market and developing productive forces; so they always advocate  reducing and weakening publicly-owned economy. Not long ago, it  was reported in the newspapers how some economists had met to  discuss the question, "Whether public ownership is the objective  or the means." Some people at the meeting held that we must  correct the "lopsided view that takes public ownership as the  mainstay," that we "must rethink taking public ownership as the  mainstay," and believed that "taking public ownership as the  mainstay need "not necessarily be an absolute numerical quota,  but should be manifested chiefly in quality". After the meeting,  an economist also wrote to advocate that the rate of public  ownership should "not necessarily occupy over 50 percent." For  if so, it will be unfavorable to developing the market economy  and productive forces. Some people even think that it would be  fine if the level of public ownership could be kept at about 20  percent, controlling some key industries and a very few large  enterprises.    Under the precondition of insisting on taking public  ownership as the mainstay, we believe that the crux lies in just  how much should each economic sector occupy, one that demands  continuous study and control. But if we artificially reduce  public ownership to less than 50 percent, in a situation where  the other economic sectors enjoy favorable policies, the  dominant position of public ownership must be weakened, and may  even be hard to maintain. It is surprising, but people who hold  this opinion are forgetting the simple truth that "every mass  must be expressed in a certain quantity." Their motivation  aside, the fact remains that it must weaken and shake the  dominant position of public ownership.    We really should discuss the necessity of insisting on the  dominant position of public ownership under the socialist  system, both theoretically and practically.    First of all, is public ownership or private ownership more  suitable to the need to develop modern socialized productive  forces?    Marx and Engels resolved this question long ago, but since  some people often dispute the point, I must take time to discuss  it again. Marxism tells us that the historical unfolding of the  basic contradictory movement possessed by capitalism's  production has to lead to "incompatibility between socialized  production and capitalist ownership". This contradiction  contains the "seeds of all conflicts" in modern capitalist  society, and "forces the capitalist class to treat productive  forces more like the productive forces of society within all  possible limitations inside the capital relationship."  (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Volume 3 pp 311,  317). To completely resolve this contradiction, "it has to admit  the social nature of modern productive forces, so make  production, occupation, and exchanging patterns appropriate to  the social nature of the productive materials. This can be  accomplished only by the public and direct occupation by society  of the productive forces which have developed to a situation of  being unsuitable to other management than social management."  (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Volume 3 pp  318-319). That is, replacing capitalism with socialism,  replacing the private ownership of capitalism with the public  ownership of socialism. The objective necessity and historical  justification of establishing and developing socialism is rooted  in this. Practices shows that the public ownership of socialism  matches and impels the development of modern socialized  productive forces more than the private ownership of capitalism  does. The former Soviet Union rapidly accomplished national  industrialization in just 10 years; in addition, the great  achievements of modernization construction since the  establishment of new China 40 years ago, and especially in the  past decade, all prove that only the public ownership economic  relationship of socialism is the vital economic system which  suits and impels the development of modern socialized productive  forces. It also should be the scientific belief and practical  principle of all Marxists.    Second, insistence on the dominant position of public  ownership must be in deed as well as word, not merely admitting  orally that "public ownership is in the dominant position,"  while shaking and damaging its dominant position.    China is a socialist country; we must conduct its economic  system with public ownership of the means of production, for  without public ownership, we will be unable to protect the  working class's leadership of the nation (through the Communist  Party of China), since its power to lead will lose its economic  base. So, to adhere to socialist public ownership, we must  consolidate and develop public ownership, and absolutely not  damage it. Now, some people in the backs of their minds  constantly view public ownership as an obstacle to developing  the market economy and productive force, they try everything  they can to weaken and nibble away at public ownership, which  causes considerable loss to state-owned assets. There are  estimates that at present, more than 100 million yuan in  state-owned assets are being lost every day, "changing from  public assets to private." Some cadres and economists believe  that state-owned enterprises are burdensome, basing this view on  such things as low economic efficiency and serious losses  brought on by such things as unfair economic competition, and  try hard to abandon them, urging their number be reduced. The  idea of a so-called reduction in public ownership to less than  50 percent comes from this background. These comrades have not  analyzed the complex reasons for state-owned enterprise losses,  they do not seriously study countermeasures, they make no  attempt change the operational system to create a modernized  system of public ownership of enterprises. Actually, they simply  conclude that the reason why these enterprises suffer loss is  that public ownership itself is no good, concentrating their  hopes and excitement on privately-owned enterprises. So, as such  situations appear, some economists and responsible cadres even  advocate auctioning off State-owned enterprises on a large scale  to display their "ideological liberation" and "bold reforms". In  April of last year, the mayor of a large city publicly announced  that "except for those enterprises which the State must control,  most enterprises can be auctioned off." The director of the  system reform committee in that city said, concerning the  question of auctioning enterprises, "not only enterprises which  suffer losses can be auctioned, but efficient enterprises as  well; not only small enterprises but the larger state-owned  enterprises also." Further, "as long as there are buyers, it  doesn't matter whether they are Chinese businessmen or foreign  businessmen, natural persons or legal persons." This daring to  auction off state-owned enterprises is really wild! Of course,  for that portion of state-owned enterprises which are  inefficient, small scale, and appropriate for distributed  operation, we can change the operational system through leasing,  contracts, and auctions of property rights. But it is really  difficult to agree with those who advocate selling the great  majority of state-owned enterprises, including even the  efficient and large scale ones. We have to ask what right have  they to shake and damage public ownership's dominant position as  they please?    It must be obvious that if we cut the rate of the public  ownership economy to less than 50 percent, the nature of China's  economy will change. Not only will it be impossible to maintain  the dominant position of public ownership, but the socialist  nature of the economy will change as well. If private  enterprises occupy more than half of the gross social assets and  gross social output, that means the majority of social surplus  labor will be occupied by the private sector. In such  circumstances, can we still say the working people have been  liberated from the labor hiring system? Can we still say that  the exploiting class has been wiped out? Can we still talk about  eliminating polarization, and growing prosperous together?  Moreover, if a private ownership economy possesses more than  half of the private assets in the gross social assets, it must  automatically result in division and concentration under the law  of value, which then must produce a privately run enterprise  clique with great economic power. In this situation, what kind  of administrative and legal regulations does the state have  which is strong enough to stop the emergence of an exploitative  class? Can the people's regime remain in the hands of the  people? Obviously, if a socialist nation permits the privately  owned economy to exceed the power of the public ownership  economy, the economic, political, and social consequences  brought on by this will be dreadful to contemplate.    Therefore, adherence to the dominant position of public  ownership both quantitatively and qualitatively is the  economical base and major framework of socialism with Chinese  characteristics. We can say that if public ownership is not in  the dominant position, there can be no socialist market economy,  nor can there be socialism. We should have no wavering and  concessions on this point. All expressions and practices which  will weaken and shake the dominant position of public ownership  must be rejected.    Third, adherence to "taking public ownership as the major  body" while confirming and maintaining the "supplementary"  status of the nonpublic ownership economy are two related  aspects of guaranteeing that our socialist economic structure is  equitable.    For more than a decade, carrying out reform and opening  while  adjusting the economic structure has resulted in considerable  development of the individual economy, the privately-run  economy, and the foreign capital economy, and these have played  a necessary and good "supplementary" role. We can anticipate  that in the distant future, these non-public ownership economies  will have greater development. Based on forecasts by relevant  departments, given the current developmental trends of the  non-public ownership economy, by the year 2000 there will be 25  to 30 million individual industrial and commercial families, and  privately-run enterprises. These will have as many as 50 million  employees, as much as 350 billion yuan in self-owned capital,  and will occupy over 20 percent of the gross industrial output.  Annual retail sales value of social goods will be more than 600  billion yuan, occupying over 30 percent of the gross social  retail sales value. So we can see that in China the  developmental trend of nonpublic ownership is very swift and  strong.    Meanwhile, it is clear that in addition to its positive and  necessary supplementary role, the nonpublic ownership economy  also trends to self-development. Non-public ownership  enterprises, especially a few large-scale privately owned  enterprise groups which grow more mature by the day, are calling  for the maximum possible extension of their economic power. They  are dissatisfied with their "supplementary" status as compared  to public ownership's dominant, and seek to "exceed" that  position; as a theoretical reflection of this economic demand,  some people employ such terms as "diversified economic  structure," "diversified investment," and "diversification of  the main entity of interest" to describe the current situation  of China's economical life. In fact, statements of this sort are  demands that the nonpublic ownership economy have equal status  with the public ownership economy. This is an implied challenge  to public ownership's dominant position. But some of our  economists have rationalized the content of this kind of  "challenge," even advocating 50 percent or more nonpublic  ownership. If the system of nonpublic ownership "exceeds its  position" it will mean that the main body of the public  ownership system will "lose its position." Question: when the  economic power of non-public ownership exceeds over half of the  whole economy, can you still regard it as a "supplement" to the  socialist economy? When the private ownership economy occupies  the greater part of national production and operations, where is  the "major" position of the public ownership economy?    Fourth, public ownership enterprises should play a leading  role in the entire domestic economy in quantity, mass, and  function. The state-owned big and medium-sized enterprises  should control key departments and the advanced, new technical  industry and basic industries, play both an advanced and a  leading role in technical development and applications. They  must have advanced enterprises rules and scientific management,  and they must have higher productivity and good economic  efficiency. The state-owned big or medium sized enterprises  usually have the advantages of large scale, strong capabilities,  advanced facilities and a concentration of talented people, so  they should be capable of fulfilling the role of backbone and  model. Of course this leadership work can be accomplished only  in fair market competition. At present, for reasons which are  very complicated, and due largely to a rigid system and an  unfair competitive economic environment, some state-owned big or  medium-sized enterprises are in difficult straits, with  declining economic efficiency, a talent drain, poor sales, and  shortages of capital. All of these problems can be improved  gradually, but only through accelerated change in the  operational system to create modern, public ownership  enterprises rules and creating a fair competitive environment  which suits the requirements of a market economy. It is only by  carrying out further reform, facing the markets, strengthening  scientific management, and pushing scientific and technical  progress will the public ownership enterprises regain their  youth and vitality.</p>

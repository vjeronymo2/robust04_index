			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Beregovoy admits taking loan MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday admitted receiving a FFr1m (Pounds 120,000) interest-free loan from a businessman later charged with insider dealing. He said he had acted properly. The incident, unearthed by the satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchane, could damage Mr Beregovoy's image in the run-up to the March parliamentary election, though he has acted within the law and limited the impact by openly acknowledging the loan. Mr Beregovoy has built a reputation for integrity. He launched a campaign against political corruption last year, when he tabled an abortive bill to ban business donations to political parties. His own Socialist grouping rebelled against the plans, on the grounds that they would leave the party short of cash, and ensured they were watered down. Mr Beregovoy told Le Canard Enchane he accepted the loan in September 1986 from the late Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat, to go towards the purchase of a flat in Paris. He declared the loan to the tax authorities and repaid it in advance, following Mr Pelat's death in 1989. Mr Pelat, a friend of President Francois Mitterrand, was charged with insider dealing in 1988, after making a profit on buying and selling shares in Triangle Industries before its acquisition by Pechiney, the French state-owned aluminium and packaging group. Mr Pelat died before a trial could be held.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A SCHOOL-BY-SCHOOL REPORT ON FITNESS  </P> <P> Teachers at Garden Grove's Ralston Intermediate School have watched as interest  in sports and physical education programs has declined over the past decade.  Students say television, computer games, music or talking on the telephone are  preferred to the rigors of sports.  </P> <P> That sentiment is echoed in the results of the state's first standardized  physical fitness assessment test: Only 17% of Ralston's seventh-graders passed.  In today's Section U, a special report gives school-by-school fitness scores  for the county's fifth-, seventh- and ninth-graders tested last spring.  </P></p>

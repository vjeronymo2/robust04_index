			<p>BFN     [Text] Some 7,500 youths were registered at police  recruitment centers in the Gaza Strip today. Shlomi Eldar  reports that five such centers were opened today and thousands  have been swarming to them since the early morning hours. The  centers will be open all week, and 4,000 policemen will be  selected. Those selected will undergo training at existing  facilities in the Gaza Strip, including a beach facility which  used to be the Ansar 2 prison camp. To date there are about  2,600 policemen in the Gaza Strip. Tomorrow they will be joined  by about 250 additional policemen from Algeria.    Few are leaving Judaea and Samaria for work within the Green  Line, and a mass demonstration was staged in Janin today against  the continued closure. Many residents paraded the streets,  complaining that the prolonged closure has caused grave economic  distress, and that many are unemployed and have no means of  livelihood. Some of the participants even criticized the PLO  leadership which, so they claim, deals with Gaza and Jericho  only and has abandoned the remaining residents of the  territories.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 29 May adds  that "in a commitment to the Gaza Strip Palestinian police,  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] is trying to stop acts of  revenge and killing against those who collaborate with Israel.  Correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that this commitment was  published in a manifesto disseminated by Hamas in the Gaza  Strip."]</p>

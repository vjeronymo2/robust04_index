			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Rebel becomes a folk hero: The discontent behind a new east German movement MR Peter-Michael Diestel has become an east German folk hero since Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) ousted him as head of the CDU in Brandenburg state. The enigmatic east German politician was catapulted into the vanguard of the still-unnamed east German bipartisan movement, to be launched today, which seeks to tap the widespread discontent in the economically battered region. According to the movement's co-initiator, Mr Gregor Gysi, head of the PDS, the former Communist party, grass-roots committees are to be formed in an attempt to alleviate mass unemployment, de-industrialisation, the destruction of agriculture and the 'humiliation' of east Germans. Among the signers of the founding appeal was Mr Stefan Heym, east Germany's most prominent writer and former dissident. Politicians of the mainstream parties, particularly the CDU, whose popularity has plummeted among easterners, accused the new movement of turning east Germans against west Germans. Mr Diestel claimed it could become the nucleus of a political party. The 40-year-old Mr Diestel was long a thorn in the flesh of the CDU leadership in Bonn for criticising the 'subjugation' of east Germany. The surge in his popularity was nonetheless remarkable, as he was ousted for defending ex-informers of the Stasi security police against 'one-sided' accusations. While Mr Diestel was criticised for his remarks by the Social Democrats (SPD) in Brandenburg, who are coalition partners of the CDU, his expulsion was denounced by Mr Manfred Stolpe, the SPD prime minister of the state, as being typical of west German high-handedness. Nearly three-quarters of east German production workers have lost their jobs since 1990 or are on short-time work. Most are languishing in retraining or job creation programmes which offer them little future. Psychologically, says Mr Heiner Winkler, an east Berlin journalist, 'they are worse off than before'. An entire generation of east Germans above the age of 45 - skilled workers, engineers, academics and officials - has been relegated to the scrap heap. Yet east Germans are reluctant to take to the streets to express their discontent and instead sink deeper into resignation. Mr Diestel's alliance with his fellow lawyer, Mr Gysi, has alarmed both conservatives and social democrats, who have sought to isolate the PDS. Mr Gysi is a brilliant speaker and tactician and in local elections last May the PDS scored a stunning upset by becoming the strongest party in east Berlin's borough legislatures. But Mr Diestel's erratic behaviour during his rapid rise to prominence in post-Communist east Germany gave him a reputation for inscrutability. As interior minister of the last, freely-elected East German government, he antagonised Bonn officials by employing former senior Stasi officers as advisers and arguing against opening Stasi files to the public, saying it would lead to acts of violence within families and between neighbours. But it was Mr Diestel's purchase of a big villa belonging to the Interior Ministry which raised questions about his integrity. He bought it for DM193,000 (Pounds 66,500) in July 1990 when it was estimated to be worth nearly DM1m. The German government is demanding that he return the house, which it claims he bought without the approval of the east German parliament and, in effect, sold to himself. If Mr Diestel succeeds in setting up an east German coalition movement, some east Germans such as Mr Wolfgang Thierse, the astute deputy chairman of the SPD, believe it would backfire by deepening the mistrust between east and west Germans. On one thing, however, all east German politicians are agreed. Unless the voice of east Germans is heard more loudly in Bonn, the danger will grow of the extreme right wing profiting from their frustrations in future elections.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hold steady in hefty turnover ANOTHER large corporate share placing, in the form of a bought deal in the construction and building sector, was comfortably taken yesterday by a UK stock market also tested by a batch of less than favourable trading reports from leading British companies. Equities were held back for most of the session by hints of impending US selling of British Petroleum and of the pharmaceutical stocks. But early dealings on Wall Street saw the Dow 10 points higher, and share prices steadied in London to show very little change on the session. Trading volume remained high but this reflected a combination of tax-related dealing and activity in selected heavyweight blue chip stocks. Dealers maintained that any selling prompted by the Budget measures on Advance Corporation Tax has been completed. SmithKline Beecham yesterday joined the growing list of UK companies to increase dividend payment because of tax measures in the Budget. The day's Seaq total of 833.5m shares was also swollen by a placing of a 29 per cent stake in George Wimpey, the housing and construction group, by way of a bought deal in the market. The deal was regarded as a further sign that there is a ready market among institutions for large lines of good class stocks at close to current market levels. Retail, or customer, business in equities, which had shown signs of flagging, recovered on Tuesday to record a value total of 1.35bn. Equities were unsettled in early deals when Lasmo, the North Sea energy group, announced a savage cut in its dividend payment, apparently taking by surprise recent buyers of the shares. There was little encouragement from the rest of the day's list of corporate trading statements. Figures from Kingfisher, the UK high street retailer, had been largely disclosed at the time of the announcement of the planned merger with Darty of France. At the final reading, the FT-SE Index was a mere 0.5 off at 2,860. The fall of just over 2 per cent since the Budget is much in line with expectations, especially in view of the absence of a base rate cut. Strongly expressed rejections of hopes for another early cut in base rates by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, have been taken to heart in the equity market. Further progress by equities is expected to depend upon a flow of convincing indications that the domestic economy is on the road to recovery. Strategists said that there was a 'much better feeling' in the stock market this week as share prices appeared unaffected by the Budget changes in dividends on overseas earnings of UK companies, by successful placings of blocks of shares and the evident success of the recent rights issues which had overshadowed sentiment previously. Yesterday it was announcedthat the rights from Trafalgar House had received 89 per cent take-up. However, there was some nervousness in the pharmaceutical sector following a further bearish statement from one of the leading names in the US industry. The heavily-weighted drug stocks, which feature in virtually all investment fund portfolios, have shown a somewhat mixed performance since the rest of the London market began to rise in mid-September, when sterling quit the ERM network.</p>

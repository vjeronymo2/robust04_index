			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the Commission made clear in the proposed rule, it will not charge other licensees retroactively for the monetary shortfall produced by the Commission's change in policy on the educational exemption. Therefore, for FY 1993 no licensees will be charged additional fees to compensate for the restored exemption. In addition, because the educational exemption is being restored for FYs 1991&hyph;92, there will be no refunds to power reactor licensees who paid increased annual fees in those years due to the exemption of nonprofit educational institutions (a point also detailed in the proposed rule). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Responses to Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the comment period expired on October 29, 1993, the NRC reviewed all comments received prior to November 13, 1993. The Commission received over 200 comments in response to the proposed rule. Copies of all comment letters received are available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room (``PDR''), 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Most commenters were educational institutions, who argued that their educational and research activities with licensed nuclear materials will have to be severely curtailed or halted altogether if the annual fee exemption is not restored. They claimed that the annual fees would, in many cases, entirely subsume the budget for operation of the research reactor or use of nuclear material. Many commenters also stated that there was no possibility of obtaining more money for their operating budgets, and that the inevitable result of annual fees would therefore be an across-the-board reduction in nuclear-related studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission is aware of the effect annual fees could have on nonprofit educational institutions, not only from their comments but also from its own site visits. The Commission believes that much of the work done by these institutions with nuclear materials, in both nuclear and non-nuclear fields of study, is extremely valuable and should not be impeded or halted due to the new annual fees. Further, for reasons discussed later, subsidies for such activities are both necessary and desirable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of comments received from nonprofit educational institutions stated that their work produced externalized benefits to society, in the words used in the DC Circuit's Allied-Signal decision, ``not captured in tuition or other market prices.'' Among the benefits cited were research in fields such as nuclear safety, neutron activation analysis, neutron radiography, archaeology, art history and biology. Much of this research, some commenters claimed, was basic research done to advance science, not for profit or commercial use (although such an outcome might occur). One commenter noted that it does not accept research grants and contracts without making them public, and publishes virtually all its findings. The commenters asserted that this research, if halted due to new fees, would not likely be duplicated or replaced by the private sector. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with commenters that much of the work done with nuclear materials in academia, if halted, would simply not be continued in the private sector. In particular, the Commission was impressed by the arguments made regarding basic research. The Commission believes that such research, done in the spirit of academic inquiry, is an integral part of the programs run by educational institutions with NRC licenses.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

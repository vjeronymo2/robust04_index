			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shmu'el Hadas, Israeli Ambassador to the </F> Vatican, by Umberto de Giovannangeli; place and date not given:  "Israeli Diplomat Says: `We Will Fight Together Against Racism  and Anti-Semitism'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "This is a message of hope which goes far  beyond the political sphere: In fact, the beginning of full  diplomatic relations between Israel and the Vatican represents a  good antidote against the racist and anti-Semitic intolerance  which is again emerging in Europe." Thus began our interview  with Shmu'el Hadas, the new Israeli ambassador to the Vatican.    [Giovannangeli] What significance does the establishment of  diplomatic relations with the Vatican have for Israel?    [Hadas] The conclusion of a long-drawn, difficult process  which began with the birth of the state of Israel 46 years ago,  as well as the beginning of a new relationship, based on  solidarity and tolerance, between the Catholic and the Jewish  worlds.    [Giovannangeli] Therefore, this agreement does not only have  diplomatic significance.    [Hadas] Unquestionably. The agreement which has been reached  can favor the development of a common initiative against the  reemergence of racism and anti-Semitism. We have now launched a  message of hope, underlying the very meaning of religious faith.  Religions must unite people, not divide them. Israel and the  Vatican did not merely decide to exchange diplomatic  representations. If anything, this step is the logical outcome  of a common process of rethinking many centuries of history  which were often marked by divisions and hate. Today we have  decided to put and end, together, to this sad chapter by going  back to our origins, that is to say, rediscovering that common  heritage of social solidarity and respect for diversity which  lies at the heart of both the Jewish and the Catholic faith.  The greatness of this diplomatic event lies, in the first  place, in its ethical value.    [Giovannangeli] What is your opinion of the self-critical  review currently undertaken by the German Catholic church on the  responsibility incurred by Catholic theology in providing  "religious pretexts" to those who persecuted the Jews?    [Hadas] The document in question represents an important act  of courage which helps restore the historical, albeit bitter,  truth. It has certainly promoted dialogue between Catholics and  Jews, making possible further rapprochement. Admitting one's  share of responsibility for such an enormous tragedy as the  Holocaust is not only a gesture of respect for the millions of  Jews who were exterminated by the Nazis. It is also a moral  lesson offered to younger generations, who must be in the  position to fully understand -- with no "gray areas" -- one of  the most tragic periods in the history of mankind.    [Giovannangeli] In what ways can the understanding between  Israel and the Vatican influence the development of the peace  process in the Middle East?    [Hadas] The exchange of diplomatic representatives must be  seen in the context of the new climate of dialogue which has  come about in the Middle East with the peace agreements signed  between Israel and the PLO. Thanks to his considerable moral  authority, the pope has played and can still play a major role  in permanently establishing peace in this troubled region of the  world, where religions have always carried much weight, and not  always in a positive sense. In the Middle East, hatred has been  nurtured and wars have been fought "in God's name" for far too  long. The "basic agreement" reached between Israel and the  Vatican can help build a culture based on "listening to each  other" among Israelis and Arabs, Jews and Muslims; a culture  centered on man as an entity whose rights are "inviolable,"  independently of individuals' religious faith.    [Giovannangeli] However, Jerusalem is not included in the  agreement. In your opinion, when will it finally become  possible to tackle the question of the "holy city's" status?    [Hadas] Israel and the PLO have shown great political wisdom  by deciding to postpone a rather difficult debate -- considering  what Jerusalem means to everyone concerned -- until a second  stage in the negotiations. A gradual approach has proven the  best means of enabling a first agreement to be reached. This  also applies to relations between Israel and the Vatican. As  far as we are concerned, we will do everything in our power to  ensure complete freedom of worship in a city which is sacred to  Jews, Catholics, and Muslims alike. Jerusalem's historical,  spiritual, and archaeological value belongs to everybody. As  such, it must be safeguarded. Ensuring that the city's holy  places can be "enjoyed" by everybody is a first, important step  toward subsequently discussing the town's status.</p>

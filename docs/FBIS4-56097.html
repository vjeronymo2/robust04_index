			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: Regular Shift at Border Watchtowers"] </F>   [Text] There is no place for distress after the rumors of  the alleged concentration of military forces from the Serbian  side on the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM]-Serbian border, the competent Macedonian  sources quoted by Makpres claim.    After warnings by the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] units  stationed in the Republic of Macedonia, that an increased  movement of military units is noticed on the other side of the  Macedonian-Serbian border, the sources, which asked to remain  anonymous, said that the fact of the matter is a regular filling  of the border watchtowers with additional reserve soldiers.  According to the new organization of the military in rump  Yugoslavia, which now massively and actively includes reserve  officers, the border units are made up of regular and reserve  soldiers.    "The increased movement of soldiers along the border objects  is owed to the regular replacement of the reserve soldiers," the  sources claim, adding that "it is in no way a case of some  unusual concentration of armed forces due to military exercises  or maneuvers."</p>

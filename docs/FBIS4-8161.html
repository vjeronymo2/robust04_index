			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "Are We Releasing a Genie from </F> the Bottle?"]    [Text] The Security and Information Service [BIS] is  operating according to bill No. 527 of 1992. This bill,  however, was valid only until the end of 1993. A new bill,  properly drafted and permanently valid, was expected to be  passed by the end of 1993. However, it was not drafted by that  date. To make it possible for BIS to operate even after this  date, parliament at the very last moment extended the validity  of the temporary bill until 31 July 1994. Recently, the  government handed over to parliament a draft in which it  proposed the principles of the bill. Some of its contents,  however, are very questionable.    For instance, if BIS decides to use intelligence-gathering  technology against a constitutional official, then, according to  the draft, this information must be indicated in the request  handed over to the judge who approves the utilization of this  technology. This means that only the judge has to be informed  about the possible BIS eavesdropping on a constitutional  official, and no one else--that is, neither the president, the  prime minister, the chairman of parliament, nor the chairman of  the senate (if the senate is established at all in the Czech  Republic). It ensues that the government, particularly its  prime minister, have waived their legal right to be informed  about eavesdropping on constitutional officials. Vaclav Klaus  has thus gotten rid of his responsibility. It is as if the  prime minister told the secret service: "I do not want to know  anything. It is your business if you want to eavesdrop on a  constitutional official."    The prime minister's reluctance to deal with problems that  smack of troubles has certainly affected this decision. Had we  not often heard Klaus call for civic responsibility the  situation would be less absurd. Like that, responsibility for  eavesdropping on constitutional officials falls only on the  judge who has approved it and the BIS director who proposed it.  No one else has to be informed about it and bear responsibility  for possible illegal utilization of intelligence technology. In  other words, if the BIS director believes that, for example, the  Democratic Union (replace this name with any other name, if  applicable) is an extremist organization (or is conducting  activity that could be used as a token justification for  eavesdropping) and finds a judge who is of the same opinion,  there is nothing to prevent eavesdropping. The same applies to  the eavesdropping on deputies, ministers, senators, etc. If the  representatives of the Democratic Union or another party find  out and prove that they have been the subjet of [illegal]  eavesdropping, the BIS director and the judge may be dismissed,  but that is all. Neither the government nor any other  politician will be responsible because it knew nothing. The BIS  director did not even have the obligation to inform them.    In a similar way, this also applies to surveillance, where  only the decision of the BIS director or a designated department  chief is required. If the BIS director (or a subordinate to  whom he has delegated this power) decides, for whatever reason,  to carry out surveillance on a constitutional official, he does  not have to have the approval of anyone else, nor does he have  any obligation to inform anyone else--in this case, not even the  judge.    It is impossible to completely rule out the possibility that  the Secret Service apparatus will be used for political  objectives. However, we should make such a possibility as  difficult to materialize as possible and indicate who is  responsible for the abuse of the secret service. Even if it was  true that in countries with a long democratic tradition the  eavesdropping devices have never been misused, the powers  delegated to the BIS director would still be excessive.    The Watergate affair, where eavesdropping on the electoral  staff of the Democrats was conducted with the knowledge of the  then Republican President Richard Nixon at the beginning of the  1970's, shows us that it is important to protect ourselves as  effectively as possible against the misuse of intelligence  technology. Well-drafted laws are part of this protection. If  the Chamber of Deputies approves the bill according to the  government-drafted principles, this law will certainly be  flawed. It would help if the ministers and the deputies  imagined the situation where they themselves could be  eavesdropped upon or targeted for surveillance.</p>

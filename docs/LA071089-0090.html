			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP WEEKEND;  </P> <P> 2 BAR BANDS BRING INTIMATE SUBSTANCE TO IRVINE MEADOWS  </P> <P> Great White and Tesla are basically bar bands with a little extra sparkle that  they parlay into arena-status popularity. When the two rock bands played Irvine  Meadows Amphitheatre on Saturday, they brought an intimate, party-down feel  with them.  </P> <P> The show was sold out, proving that the groups' teen-age audience knows the  difference between substance and empty flash.  </P> <P> The more experienced Great White, which has released three albums on Capitol  and several independent LPs, received first billing. Singer Jack Russell  provided the oomph to the hourlong set with his masculine strutting and  blatantly sexual patter. While the L.A.-based quintet kept the energy fairly  low key by hard-rock standards, the band exuded a warmth that drew in the  enthusiastic crowd.  </P> <P> It was not until the middle of the set, with its cover of Angel City's "Face  the Day" that preceded such older numbers as "Rock Me," that Great White tapped  the combination of smoky sexuality and brute force that is lacking in much of  its current album, "Twice Shy." However, certain new songs -- notably the  lewd-and-rude "Mista Bone" -- have an earthy appeal.  </P> <P> Co-headliner Tesla does not have the most scintillating presence either, but  its musicianship and songwriting skills were solidly entertaining. The bluesy  tunes give this Sacramento band an added edge.  </P> <P> Frank Hannon provided wicked slide work on "No Way Out" from the quintet's  current album, "The Great Radio Controversy." Tesla's other lead guitarist,  Tommy Skeoch, threw some whirling hair and wild solos into the show. The  smooth-moving Jeff Keith has the lanky appeal of a Steven Tyler and slightly  ragged vocals that shine on numbers such as "Hang Tough" and "Little Suzi."  </P> <P> Perpetual openers Kix started the show. With the punch and panache of its hard  rock -- and an electric, irreverent vocalist in Steve Whiteman -- it's a  mystery why this quintet cannot pull itself above third billing.  </P> <P> The same bill was scheduled to play San Diego's Open Air Theatre on Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PEACE ENVOY CAUGHT IN BEIRUT FIRE  </P> <P> The Arab League's Lebanon peace negotiator narrowly escaped shelling that hit  his hotel in a village near Beirut today in the first serious breach of the  fragile two-day cease-fire.  </P> <P> But the brief shelling barrage in hills to the east of Beirut failed to deter  the thousands of citizens streaming back to the war-ravaged capital in holiday  mood.  </P> <P> Arab League peace negotiator Lakhdar Ibrahimi was awakened by the shell blasts  that shook his hotel room in the village of Beit Meri and immediately contacted  officials to stop the firing, security sources reported.  </P> <P> Christian military sources said 120 shells and mortar bombs hit the mountain  villages of Beit Meri, Mansouriyeh and Ain Saadeh. Christian and Muslim sources  each claimed that the other side was responsible for the shelling.  </P></p>

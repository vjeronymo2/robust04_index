			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 20 April]    [Text] The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] has  established a number of counting centres around the country,  each of which so positioned and allocated to count approximately  60,000 papers. Naturally, counting centres serving smaller  rural areas will serve more voting stations than those in  larger, urban areas.    Security--both within and around the counting centres, will  be of prime importance, and access to counting centres will be  restricted--against positive identification--to certain IEC  personnel, IEC monitors, party voting agents, local and  international observers and one candidate from each registered  political party.    On the morning of April 29 (the day after close of  voting)--all "packages"--ballot boxes, parcels and other items  sealed at voting stations--will be delivered to their allocated  counting centres, accompanied in transit by at least two IEC  officials, or one IEC official and an official or international  observer. The additional presence of an IEC monitor where  possible is being encouraged.    The counting officer at the counting centre will, in the  presence of another IEC official and any other interested  parties who have access to the station, inspect the seals on the  packages.    The counting officer will then instruct the two designated  IEC officials to separate the packages into those for provincial  votes, and those for national. These will then be taken to  separate national or provincial "bins" or holding areas for each  voting station, and further separated into the three days of  voting -- April 26,27 and 28.    This procedure will be followed until all of the packages  from all of the voting stations allocated to a counting centre  have been received.    Eighteen reconciliation tables -- nine for provincial votes,  and nine for national votes -- will be positioned in each  counting centre, each group of three tables processing votes for  each of the three voting days in each category. Each of these  tables will have an IEC official assigned to it, and a further  two IEC official will supervise the overall reconciliation  process.    Packages will then be allocated from the bins to available  reconciliation tables, three voting stations at a time (one for  each set of three reconciliation tables). The IEC official at  each table will break the seals on the ballot boxes, and place  the ballot papers on the table before showing any interested  parties that the box is empty. He or she will then count and  record the number of ballot papers on the table, in small  batches of twenty, clipped together in batches of 100 papers.    In any one of the ballot boxes from a particular voting  station will also be the statement prepared by the voting  station presiding officer, detailing the number of votes cast on  a particular voting day at that station.    The IEC station reconciliation supervisor will be called  upon  to check the presiding officer's statement against that of the  IEC counting station officer. If the figures do not agree  (after checking addition calculations on both forms) a recount  will be ordered and undertaken until the total after two  identical and consecutive counts agree with each other.    If this total differs from the presiding officer's statement  by less than 0.5 per cent or one vote -- whichever is the  greater -- the reconciliation will be regarded as being in order.    If the margin is greater than this, the supervisor will  comply with the instructions of the IEC's chief director,  administration.    Any and all irregularities -- no matter how great or small  --  will however be reported to the IEC chief director,  administration, on completion of the counting process.    On completion of the reconciliation, ballot papers will be  returned to ballot boxes, sealed by the counting supervisor,  have the reconciliation statement stuck to the boxes and taken  to a further holding area to await counting.    The counting proper -- by political party -- begins at this  stage. Boxes containing no more than 3,000 papers are delivered  to a counting table, where the allocated IEC official again  checks the seals before breaking these and removing the contents  and proving that the box is empty.    All packets containing ballot papers without the relevant  voting station stamp, those cancelled by the voting station  presiding officer as being marked by mistake or inadvertently  spoiled at the voting station, as well as used and  partially-used ballot books returned by the voting station will  then be placed in one of the ballot boxes, together with the  counting station reconciliation form(s), and sealed under  supervision.    The remaining ballot papers left on the counting table are  then held up -- one at a time -- and shown to the party voting  agents, monitors and observers present. If the mark on the  paper is clearly identifiable as being in support of a certain  party, the official will call out the name of that party, and  hand the paper to one of the five IEC official controlling the  party allocation tables, where piles of votes for each party are  assembled.    If the mark is not clearly identifiable as being in support  of a particular party, it will be put aside and treated as a  disputed ballot paper after processing the other papers in that  batch.    Disputed papers will then again be held up one at a time to  party voting agents, monitors and observers, and the supervisor  will announce his or her decision on whether to accept or reject  each one. In the case of acceptance, the supervisor will give  his or her decision on the party selected.    If this decision is accepted, the supervisor will hand the  paper to one of the five party allocation table officials, who  will add it to the pile for that particular party. If the  supervisor's decision is rejected by party voting agents, the  paper will be marked as "disputed and counted/rejected" on its  reverse and kept separately.    Each of the officials at the party allocation tables will  then count and record the ballots in each of the party piles to  which they have been allocated -- again in small clips of twenty  papers collated into batches of 100 papers.    "Disputed and counted" and "disputed and rejected" papers  will also be counted, clipped and batched as above, and a  separate record kept of these tallies.    Officials at each party allocation tables will them swop  positions under the direction of the supervisor, and the  counting and recording at each table will be repeated. Finally,  the official at the counting table who did not participate in  the previous party allocation counts will again count and record  the results.    This process will be repeated until the results of two  consecutive counts are identical in every respect.    Full results of the count -- including rejected ballots --  are recorded on a batch tally form, and the supervisor will read  out the result and ask any party voting agents present to sign  this form.    Should there be a dispute, and provided the party voting  agent has solid grounds for the dispute, a re-count may be  ordered.    Once the form is signed by the party voting agents, it will  be regarded as being accepted, and no further appeal will be  entertained by the IEC. Copies of the signed batch tally forms  will be available to all party voting agents.    The counting table officials will then assemble the  different  categories of ballots into packets, each of which will be sealed  and returned to empty ballot boxes, together with the batch  tally forms. The ballot boxes are once again sealed and removed  to a holding area.    The counting officer will convey results of the batch tally  forms to the IEC media centre in Johannesburg.    All material pertaining to the count-ballot papers, stubs  unused papers, reports and forms -- will them be assembled in a  holding area at the counting centre. The counting officer will  request that all people other than the required IEC officers  leave the centre, and will secure the centre to his or her  satisfaction until arrangements are made for delivery of the  material to the IEC's chief director, administration.</p>

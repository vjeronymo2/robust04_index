			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Text] In a comfortable air-conditioned meeting room on  the third floor of the Fujian Labour Bureau, labour-dispute  arbitrator Peng Weidong drew on a cigarette, sipped some  Fujianese tea, lay back on a sofa and said: "They say they  respect human rights, I say what they do is exploitation."    "If they are sincere about human rights, then they should  stop exploiting Chinese workers," he added. "They" are the  thousands of foreign entrepreneurs who operate factories in  Fujian to make such goods as running shoes and plastic toys.  Statistics show these businesses -- many of them  medium-to-small Taiwanese companies -- employed more than  400,000 Chinese last year, mostly from other provinces.  Although Fujian is one of the few relatively rich provinces,  labour disputes, particularly those involving foreign  businesses, have surged alarmingly.    In one instance, a female worker in a Taiwanese factory in  Fuzhou was beaten and locked in a cage with two wolfhounds after  she was caught stealing some unused rubber. Fellow workers went  on strike after one of them, who helped the woman escape, was  sacked.    Dangerous work conditions were also common, and some  factories like deathtraps. Last year, 64 textile workers were  burnt to death when fire broke out in a factory at which bosses  had double-locked the doors. Mr Peng described workers in a  Taiwanese factory, mostly young women with little education, who  sat quietly along the production line when he visited. "They  just put their hands in front of us, some without fingers --  they had been chopped off by machines," he said.    Another factory with 400 workers reported 36 industrial  accidents -- some causing permanent injury -- in two years. And  although low wages were often cited as an incentive to invest in  China, some foreigners sought to maximise this advantage. Mr  Peng said he knew of a worker who was paid only 60 yuan (HK$52)  after laboring six months in a factory. Her manager had devised  such exorbitant fees to be paid by workers each month that the  woman was left with barely enough money for her train fare home.    Other factories were run like military camps, said Mr Peng.  Workers had to ask permission to go to toilets and in some  cases, women were not allowed to close toilet doors so they  would not "stay there too long". Working hours were "eternally"  long, Mr Peng said. Sixteen hours a day with overtime pay as low  a 50 fens (half a yuan) an hour had become almost the norm among  joint ventures in Fujian, he said. Mr Peng said such abuses  were limited usually to small and medium-sized factories and  those which had not set up labour unions.    Although Chinese law required all foreign-owned businesses  to  set up such unions, less than a fifth of foreign businesses  operating in Fujian had set up unions by the end of last year,  he said. Labour bureau director Wang Lihong said the Government  was aware of the problems and had already begun provincial  inspections. Section chief Huang Changshun said the inspectors  would examine workers' contracts and police maximum working  hours and the unlawful employment of children in foreign  enterprises. "We can't sacrifice our workers' interests for the  sake of foreign investment," Mr Wang said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Urban, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, under rubric </F> "Military Review": "The Order Is To Cross the Border: Karabakh  Battalions Entered Shaumyanovskiy Rayon and Azerbaijani Aviation  Committed Acts of Retribution in Response"]    [Text] Negotiators at the peace talks change, but the  war goes on. After the unsuccessful winter offensive by  Azerbaijani troops (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA wrote about this on 30  March), a convenient moment seemingly has come again for  beginning a settlement of the conflict.    But official Baku still responded with a "sovereign no" to  the proposal to introduce Russian forces of separation between  the belligerents and to hold talks on the political status of  the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. And the situation  again was reminiscent of a lull before battle, especially as the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic confirms its resolve to force the  enemy to reckon with it by one method--military.    Back at the beginning of last year the Karabakh Defense  Staff  worked out a plan together with the Armenian Main Staff for  establishing so-called security zones around the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Operations to seize Azerbaijani  territories--Kelbadzharskiy, Agdamskiy, Fizulinskiy,  Zangelanskiy and other rayons--were worked out and then carried  out on the basis of this plan. Judging from everything, the  rapid restoration of the status quo at the front after failure  of the Azerbaijani offensive added to Karabakh confidence that  they would win the war. That is how the decision came to create  one more "security zone," this time to the north of Karabakh.    Previously settled basically by Armenians, Shaumyanovskiy  Rayon (renamed Geranboyskiy Rayon by the Azerbaijanis) covers  the path to the strategically important city of Gyandzha. Major  forces, particularly 2nd Army Corps, are stationed here. It is  common knowledge that last year former Corps Commander Colonel  Surret Guseynov used units of this corps to act against then  President Abulfaz Elchibey. A change of power took place in Baku  as a result.    <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-019-19A>      FIGURE </FIG>     There is a large number of refugees in Gyandzha from  Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, which was occupied by Armenian troops in  April of last year. In case combat operations unfold in  Shaumyanovskiy Rayon, the refugees (as also happened last year)  can become that spark from which there will be an outburst of  discontent with Azerbaijani central authorities. There already  are preconditions for this.    In March Karabakh raiding parties consisting of local  Armenians came to within 40-50 km of Gyandzha. The  "reconnaissance in force" was successful then, but according to  reports from Stepanakert, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense  Army now has liberated the villages of Talish in Mardakertskiy  Rayon and Gyuristan in Shaumyanovskiy Rayon. Combat operations  continue in the direction of Shaumyanovsk and the city is  threatened with serious danger.    It was not by chance that Baku called the new Armenian  offensive an attempt to destabilize the situation in the  republic. And now, when Azerbaijani aviation has joined in the  combat operations after almost a year's break, it is clear that  a very important psychological point has been overcome.    During 1992-1993 Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army air  defense weapons shot down over 10 enemy aircraft. There are two  pilots in the Stepanakert prison (one a native of Russia, the  other of Ukraine) who were shot down in the Karabakh sky. There  were private understandings that they would be handed over to  "interested countries" after trial if the bombings did not  continue.    The Azerbaijani Air Force committed an "act of retribution"  against Stepanakert and other cities of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic on 10 April, right after two Karabakh battalions  penetrated into Shaumyanovskiy Rayon. And on 12 April air  strikes were delivered against the Armenian cities of Goris and  Kafan.    Aerial bombings of peaceful communities of course are  incapable of interfering with a continuation of the Karabakh  offensive. The "Armenian occupation corps" (Baku's terminology)  is conducting combat operations basically by small assault teams  difficult to detect from the air. But the fact will remain a  fact: The war has entered a new bloody phase.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lusaka April 17 SAPA -- Angola's rebel UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] movement  has appealed for an end to the war in the country, saying this  would help strengthen continuing peace negotiations between it  and the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]  government, the ZIANA national news agency reported on Sunday  [17 April]. The two sides have been negotiating in the Zambian  capital of Lusaka for five months.    UNITA secretary for information, Jorge Valentim, said  although general principles for a ceasefire had been agreed  upon, the war in Angola continued to escalate. "Nobody is  supporting the war officially. It's against the wishes of  mediators, observers, and the international community,  particularly the United Nations Security Council," said Mr  Valentim.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: CBoT to offer flexible term options contracts THE CHICAGO Board of Trade plans to launch a series of flexible term options on its US government bond and note futures contracts on November 12. The options, which would allow users to tailor strike price, exercise style, and expiration dates to their investment needs, will be the first customised products offered by a futures exchange. The Chicago Board Options Exchange pioneered the flexible options concept last year, successfully applying it to stock index options. The options are meant to compete with over-the-counter swaps markets, where customised interest rate transactions are widely used by banks and corporations. The CBoT's active Treasury bond futures and options pits will provide liquidity for the new instruments, and its Clearinghouse will eliminate the counterparty credit risk common to OTC trades. 'We want to show OTC market users that flexible term Treasury options, combined with the benefits of the world's leading futures exchange, are a superior alternative,' said Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman. Another advantage for institutional users will be a large contract size. The new options will be traded in lots of Dollars 20m, which is 200 times the size of an ordinary bond futures contract at the CBoT. The flexible term options will be offered on US Treasury bond, and five-, 10-, and two-year Treasury note futures contracts.</p>

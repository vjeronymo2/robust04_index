			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col. Gen. Kostyantyn Morozov, military </F> commentator of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA: "Taking a Look at the  `Partnership for Peace.' Appeasement By the Betrayal of  Partnership. Questions of Security, Nuclear Disarmament, and  Relations Between NATO, the U.S., and Ukraine"]    [Text] It seems that, having won the cold war against  communism, the West and its military organization NATO, found  themselves not knowing which way to turn. The question arose:  what next? No matter how hard the provincial diplomacy of the  countries that emerged out of the ruins of the USSR tried to  persuade Western politicians of their peaceloving intentions and  their desire for democratic change and integration, there was no  sign of any significant response from the West. Western  politicians listened to them, reassured them, but did not act  accordingly. The West was perfectly aware that these countries  posed absolutely no threat, that the democratic changes are  being implemented by trained politicians (there is a real  shortage of them in the provinces) [as published], and that  there is no particular advantage to developed from integration  with the hungry.    The West did not envisage (nor did it seek) new formulas for  effective cooperation with a whole host of new states. Things  were more or less clear as far as the countries of the former  Warsaw Pact were concerned. As soon as they emerged from under  the influence of communist ideology, they immediately turned  towards cooperation with the West, including its military  structures.    The countries that formed on the territory of the former  USSR  merited special attention from the West. The presence of nuclear  weapons in Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, Ukraine's singular  position with respect to her attitude towards nuclear  disarmament, Russia's harsh policy of pressure on her former  sister states in the Union directed at creating obstacles on  their road to independence -- all these things prevented the  est, and especially the United States, from formulating a clear  plan for building relations with the new states. It is  preferable to deal with a single partner -- we often heard this  undisguised nostalgia for the past. This makes it easier to  direct one's own policy and to predict that of the other side.  Thus a new center was needed to replace the USSR. Immediately!  It goes without saying that Russia aspired to assume this role.    The West wanted Russia to be its only partner in solving all  the problems that arose with the collapse of the Union.  Consequently, the West did not condemn Russia's policies towards  some of the CIS members. The West needed this CIS that the rest  of us find incomprehensible. It represented for the West that  future center in which Russia would be the leader. And this  leadership was already discernible in the growing ambitions on  the one hand, and the shaping of a policy of relations with the  "older brother" on the other.    All that this center lacked was the necessary level to  control the emergence of problems of an unnecessary partnership  with the countries of Eastern Europe.    In order to involve everyone in a joint effort to achieve  this end, at the end of 1991, the West came up with the idea of  cooperation with NATO. Almost all the countries seized on this  idea. Russia was to be the leader of all those who joined.    A situation was needed that would unite the CIS members more  closely around Russia and force the West to reject the  inopportune demands of Eastern Europe for close cooperation.  There was not enough pressure on the West by the new "center"...  And so they began to organize it.    The first voice to be heard was that of Andrey Kozyrev. The  Russian foreign minister delivered a speech in Stockholm that  shocked all those present. He virtually announced to the world  that Russia wanted to return to the cold war. "Too many  liberties should not be taken with `Great Russia'," stated the  diplomat. "The territory of the former Soviet Union... is a  space on which Russia has to defend its interests will all  available means, including military means!"    The Western delegates were stunned by this sensational  speech. And even though Kozyrev explained later that same day  that he had been joking, they have been repeating this same  "joke" for more than a year now. The old Russian parliament,  which passed a resolution on the status of the Ukrainian city of  Sevastopol, and the new Duma, which has rehabilitated the State  Committee for the State of Emergency and reverted to thoughts of  restoring the empire, are "joking" in this very same vein.  President Yeltsin, who even earlier had recognized the right of  nations to self-determination but not their right to separate  from Russia, condemned the parliament in words, but in reality  he was "joking" as well. And now, having announced that his  foreign policy is based on defending Russians in all the  countries of the world, he is "joking" in the Duma. Just a month  after the Stockholm "joke," in January 1994, Kozyrev himself  announced that Russia would leave its troops on the territory of  neighboring countries: "We should not give up our presence in  these regions, which have belonged to Russia's sphere of  interest for centuries." Kozyrev was "joking" once again, only  more concretely this time, when he advised Western diplomats not  to rush to open their embassies in Kiev because they would soon  have to downgrade them to consular representations.    Jokes are fine, and therefore after some of the explanations  that follow, everything seems to fall into place, but policy is  being shaped. In shaping it, Russia increasingly treats other  countries in a joking manner. That is what Russian President  Boris Yeltsin did when he gave his "O.K" for the entry of Poland  and her Visegrad colleagues (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and  Hungary) into NATO. This time, it was the generals from the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense who  unanimously made excuses in Moscow for the president's joke in  Warsaw. "Expanding NATO membership threatens the security of  Russia" -- such is Russia's current policy on this issue.  Unsurprisingly, it did not incur any resistance from the West,  because the West was waiting for it, and Eastern Europe  understood this.    The West now has to formulate a new policy. It should be  perceived not as a new policy, but as a continuation of earlier  policy which has already been accepted -- that is, within the  framework of military and political cooperation.    The North Atlantic Council on Cooperation [NACC] lasted a  little over two years. It was created on an American initiative  by a decision by the NATO Council on 8 November 1991 and  announced as the Rome Declaration on Peace and Cooperation. The  declaration established new relations with the countries of  Central and Eastern Europe. Instead of opposition  --consultations and cooperation aimed at strengthening the  initiatives of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe.    This initiative for cooperation was immediately accepted by  all the states of the former Warsaw Pact, including the states  of the former USSR. Two conferences of defense ministers of NATO  countries with their partners in cooperation within the  framework of the NACC were held in Brussels (1 April 1992 and 31  March 1993). The first meeting of the session of the military  commission on cooperation was held on 10 April 1992. At this  meeting, the chiefs of the general staffs, representing the same  parties as those taking part in the conference of defense  ministers, planned cooperation among the partners for the coming  year.    I visited Brussels at the end of February. This time,  meeting  with political and military representatives, including NATO  representatives, as well as during my visit to NATO  headquarters, I received no answer to my question regarding what  new mechanisms of cooperation have been established by the  "Partnership for Peace" program that had not been offered by the  NACC initiative. Why was there a need for a new initiative, and  what is the purpose of persuading us that the new program opens  up wide opportunities for cooperation?    There are no answers. There are only strenuous appeals to  embrace the program as a new wise step by President Clinton, his  Administration, and NATO towards peace in Europe.    What is this program in reality? Countries have been given  the opportunity to decide for themselves how close they wish  their relations with NATO to be in the future. This is to be  done by submitting formal requests which will serve as the basis  on which draft agreements between NATO and the partner countries  will be jointly prepared. The framework document grants all who  sign it the same rights as those already established for them by  other documents, which Ukraine and all the other future partners  have already joined. In particular, the new document sets forth  the general commitment "to voluntarily abide by the provisions  of the UN Charter and the principles of the Declaration on Human  Rights." It also contains valuable clauses that hint at security  guarantees for our state: "especially to refrain  [emphasis mine -- K.M.] from the use of force or the threat of  force against the territorial integrity and political  sovereignty of any state, to respect existing borders..." And  more specifically: "...fulfilling the obligations that they  assumed in the field of disarmament..."    This is followed by a statement of the goal of the  partnership, which, in my opinion, had already been made in the  earlier principles of cooperation contained within the framework  of the NACC, and which do not commit anyone to anything.    As to new provisions, it unlikely that Ukraine will take  advantage of them in the near future. Because our country has no  money to maintain a "liason office" at the Brussels headquarters  or to maintain there "personnel, property, and equipment," and  no aid for this is anticipated.    The key principle is set forth as follows: "NATO will  consult [emphasis mine--M.K.] with any active member  of the partnership, if this partner perceives a direct threat to  its territorial integrity, political independence, or security."  That is all. Nothing more.    What is the strategic premise of the new program?    One can arrive at the answer on one's own by simply  reflecting on one thesis that failed to attract sufficient  attention from analysts and the press. Responding to a question  from journalists regarding the objective of the "Partnership for  Peace" program at a press conference in Brussels on 9 January of  this year, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the partnership  "...will give us the best means by which to respond should the  future be threatened." In other words, the goal is not to  strengthen trust between the countries of Europe by expanding  NATO membership through greater cooperation with the partners  within the framework of the NACC, but to respond to crises with  existing forces and political means. As regards the partnership,  it applies to the more powerful, as does peace among them.    It is not difficult to see that what we have here is the  same  division of "spheres of influence," in which there is no room  for cooperation on an equal footing for the partners. There is a  strategic objective, and strategy requires strategic partners.  The partnership for peace is meant for the powerful, and the  powerful know well enough whom and how they should allow or  invite to cooperate with them as their "partners."    The partners have been divided in the same way as  territories. Nonnuclear Ukraine with her hopeless economy and  undefined policy is clearly to be left to her old "master," who,  by restoring ties (the disruption of which, incidentally, is  being lamented in Ukraine for three years now), will provide us  with work and sausage and will defend us from those he deems  necessary.    It is difficult to cooperate with those who have not taken a  clear stand, because it is difficult to predict their policies,  and for that reason (at least for now) there is no reason to  trust them. Because trust means concrete assistance in exchange  for something in the future. And this future (be it socialist or  social-market oriented) cannot be discerned, at any rate in  Ukraine. That is why self-reliance is another goal of this  compromise program. On 10 February 1994, The Washington  Times published an article entitled "Talbott foresees no  change in focus," in which it quotes the deputy secretary of  state: "If... reform in the East falters, if a new threat  arises, NATO will be able to work through the partnership to  protect regional stability through closer ties with the active  participants."    But since it is clear even now that reforms are faltering  (in  Russia, of course, because this has nothing to do with Ukraine  whatsoever), a partnership is possible only between the centers.  The second center (other than the U.S.) was traditionally the  USSR. Now Russia is ambitiously pushing to take its place, and,  appeasing it, the West supports this.    Nothing reflects a country's political intentions better  than  its budget. On 7 February 1994, the Clinton Administration  published details about appropriations for its new policy on  foreign aid...    The Administration will refrain from allocating budget funds  to specific countries. But the review materials of the U.S.  Congress note that an exception is made in the case of Israel,  Egypt, and... Russia.    The apartments of Ukraine's citizens have not grown any  warmer as a result of our nuclear weapons having been pawned for  energy supplies from Russia, but where is that promised  multimillion (to start with, then to be followed by  multibillion) aid that we were to receive from the West?    There are plans to allot 2.8 billion dollars from the U.S.  budget for "building democracy." Of this sum, the former Soviet  republics (which, insultingly, also include Ukraine) are to  receive 900 million dollars, which is approximately half the sum  allocated last year. This reduction is especially interesting in  light of the recent announcements made by the American  administration to the press that it is "doubling" assistance to  Ukraine to 300 million dollars, which amounts to nearly 12  percent of the current 2.8 million [as published]. If this  percentage does not change substantially, Ukrainian democracy in  1995 will receive "all of 100 million dollars in aid." (Footnote  *) (Based on data provided by the Pylyp Orlyk Institute of  Democracy [11 February 1994].) Aid to Central and Eastern Europe  is also being reduced.    The American negotiators who recently succeeded in  persuading  the president of Ukraine of the necessity to deprive Ukraine of  her nuclear weapons were inspired by a secret assessment by U.S.  intelligence that Ukraine will most probably not survive the  next two years as a fully sovereign state. The Ukrainian people  hoped in vain that they could hold on to their nuclear weapons  until they received substantial economic aid and adequate  security guarantees.    The declaration promising the surrender of weapons without  assistance and guarantees was signed by the president of Ukraine  on 14 January of this year, and by 8 February, our foreign  minister signed in Brussels and thereby espoused the  "Partnership for Peace" program, which rids Ukrainians of other  illusions as well.    Thus, Ukraine will be provided with economic assistance and  security guarantees by Russia at Russia's own discretion. We  have thus come full circle. It would be interesting to know what  prognoses and conclusions Ukraine's own intelligence service is  arriving at.    The partners have be betrayed, appeasement continues, but  will there be peace?    The position of the West is understandable, but who will  understand us?    I am astonished by the position of our president, who was  unable to achieve the objective in the negotiations which we had  posed from the very beginning. Now they "report" to us that our  missiles are allegedly in a dangerous condition and that we have  no more time. But just two weeks before the Moscow summit,  Defense Minister Radetskyy assured the citizens of Ukraine in a  television appearance that the opposite was true. In other  words, there was time then.    Ukraine's journey to specifically trilateral talks was a  difficult one --more than a year was spent persuading us that  only with the participation of a third party, and specifically  the U.S., could we be confident that the fulfillment of  obligations assumed by the parties would be monitored. In my  opinion, all three parties to the agreement should have assumed  obligations. Ukraine -- reduces her nuclear weapons and, if it  proves impossible to organize their conversion on her own  territory (the Supreme Council adopts a decision following a  review of government programs), she hands the weapons over to  plants in Russia. Russia --compensates Ukraine for the value of  the materials in the nuclear weapons, including tactical  weapons, and guarantees Ukraine's security for her part (commits  herself to eliminate pressure, blackmail, threats of force, and  territorial claims from her policy towards Ukraine). The U.S.  --promises to monitor the fulfillment by the parties of their  obligations and, by its own policy of relations with Ukraine and  relations with Russia, to promote political relations between  Ukraine and Russia founded on principles of justice and security.    The obligations assumed by the parties should be ratified by  their respective legislative bodies and be subject to  verification by an international commission created by all three  parties. Were this the approach, we in Ukraine would not feel  that we are again being stripped naked and that an attempt is  being made to cheat us. These would be those external political  guarantees, which together with internal political, economic,  and social guarantees, would guarantee our security. This was  something that we (at least I) stated many times at various  talks: "That is how we in Ukraine envisage the guarantees that  we are talking about." I do not know whether the president and  Foreign Minister Zlenko envisage these guarantees in the same  way. It was Zlenko's job to reach the same conclusions, prepare  the data on which the president could form his position, and  plan the negotiations. I know many more intelligent people who  work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but apparently the  minister himself abides strictly by the principle "it is easier  this way."    Or, perhaps, we have no one at all whom we can entrust with  affairs of state, no one on whom the president can rely?    One is seized with sadness upon reaching this conclusion. Is  our own policy being conducted outside the context of world  politics? How many concessions have already been made, and how  many more are being planned... These are the very things that  are reducing Ukraine to a second-rate position in world  politics. These include, first and foremost, hindering the  building of our Armed Forces and the system that will assure  their security, which, coupled with "invisible borders," makes  it impossible to lay the foundation for our own security and our  own military policy -- a situation that puts in question the  independence of our state policy and, therefore, Ukraine's very  statehood. In another sphere -- putting off the implementation  of the principles of a social-market economy helps to maintain  the catastrophic situation in production, and, along with  growing crime, heightens social tensions among the people, who  are being incited in an increasingly organized manner to demand  brotherly ties with our neighbor. Finally, the lack of state  programs for supporting and reviving national culture, science,  health, and sport are destroying all hope of things improving in  the future. But hope dies last.    The people of Ukraine are holding elections specifically for  the purpose of getting a new parliament, which will work in the  interests of the state, of getting a new government, capable of  finally beginning economic reforms, rather than confining itself  to market phraseology, while continuing to work in a  command-administrative system. The people are hoping that at  least their children and grandchildren will have a normal life.    We are for partnership and, unquestionably, also for peace.  But not for a partnership, in which there will be peace only  between the centers, peace attained through the division of  spheres of influence. We do not want to become part of an empire  for the sake of peace only between the West and the empire. We  want peace in our own land as well, peace in our own home. We  want our own partnership with others and not through  intermediaries. And we will have it. If we become a state.</p>

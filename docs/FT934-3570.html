			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Chubb Security advances 37% - Outcome boosted by cost controls and defence of market share Chubb Security, the electronic alarm and locks group, yesterday announced a 37 per cent increase to Pounds 34.2m in pre-tax profits for the six months to October 8. The increase, achieved on turnover up from Pounds 338m to Pounds 355.1m, was due mainly to tight cost controls and success in defending market share since the demerger last year from Racal. Turnover, however, would have been almost flat had it not been for Pounds 9.5m generated by exchange rate movements and changes in accounting policies for currency translation. Beneficial exchange rates also contributed Pounds 1.1m to operating profits, up from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 35.3m. The policy change involves translating turnover and profits from Chubb's extensive overseas operation at an average exchange rate during the half year, rather than by the prevailing rate at the end of the accounting period. Earnings per share rose from 4.75p to 7.08p, and the interim dividend is 2p (1.5p). Mr David Peacock, chief executive, said: 'In spite of the worldwide recession and provided present trading conditions do not worsen, prospects for the full year are expected to be satisfactory.' He also emphasised his determination to press ahead with the second phase of a cost-cutting programme which has already resulted in Pounds 23m in savings since mid-1992. The programme is designed to increase Chubb's operating margins and share of a worldwide market estimated at Pounds 7bn. It has already begun to refocus its operations with cutbacks in administrative staff and increased emphasis on a larger sales force. Cutbacks in administrative staff were largely to blame for Pounds 1.9m in redundancy costs, although this was down sharply on a Pounds 5.7m charge at the half year stage last time. As part of the rationalisation, Chubb said it had introduced 13 new products in the period, with seven more planned before the year end. Most of the new products are aimed at increasing the market share for the group's electronic security division. Turnover in the division increased from Pounds 170.3m to Pounds 178.2m in the half year. Operating profits also increased to Pounds 17.9m, compared with Pounds 14.9m last time. In the physical security division - manufacturing locks, safes and fire extinguishers - turnover rose from Pounds 167.8m to Pounds 176.9m. Operating profits came in at Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 12.1m). Improved cashflow, meanwhile, of Pounds 13.1m turned net debt of Pounds 4.8m at the year end in March into net cash of Pounds 8.3m at the half way stage. See Lex</p>

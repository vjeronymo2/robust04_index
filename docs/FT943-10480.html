			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diplomatic offensive planned to end banana war - The latest Caribbean move in the dispute over EU imports One year after the European Union imposed its new banana import regime, its traditional suppliers are to launch a diplomatic offensive aimed at ending continuing criticism from some EU members and Latin American fruit producers who feel the arrangement is unfair. Caribbean leaders plan to visit Europe later this year to argue for their bananas, and will ask friendly Latin American countries to suggest to others that they moderate their criticism of the import regime. Caribbean leaders meeting in Barbados last month agreed that there was still a threat to the banana regime, and that although some Latin American countries had mended fences with the European Union, the market for fruit from the Caribbean and other members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group was still in danger from continuing attempts to increase the access for cheaper Latin American 'dollar' bananas. The EU import regime, which became effective in July of last year, allows the union's traditional suppliers in the ACP group access for 30 per cent of Europe's demand for bananas. Imports from Latin America are limited and attract import duties. ACP producers, mainly those in the Caribbean, have argued that their industry, on which some national economies depend, would be devastated if they were denied these preferences. Latin American producers, who are more price competitive, have countered that the import regime contravenes the spirit of free trade. The region's fears were fuelled by the recent decision of Germany to approach the European Court for a second time to try to end the EU's banana import quotas. Germany has consistently argued that the system is unfair and discriminates against German importers and consumers. 'Germany, the strongest opponent of the EU's banana import regime within the Union, is now the president of the European Council,' the Caricom leaders noted. The EU's import regime has also been challenged in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with a panel determining that it is discriminatory. The panel's report, however, has not been adopted, and the Caribbean producers are keen that it should not be. The Caribbean leaders' conclusion that there is a need for increased efforts to resolve the matter was influenced by what they saw as 'continuing pressure' by some Latin producers and some 'friendly' countries such as the US, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Australia to have the second panel report adopted. A key part of the planned diplomatic battle is to get these countries to relent in their pressure to have the Gatt panel's findings adopted. The ACP producers will also try to enlist the support of Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela and Nicaragua in persuading other Latin exporters to seek a negotiated solution with the EU. The ACP producers have been buoyed, none the less, by compromises reached between the EU and four Latin American countries - Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela - 'and the confirmation to maintain the overall quota limit and allocations by the EU with reductions of the in-quota duty from Ecu100 (Pounds 78.60) to Ecu75 a tonne and the advanced application from 1994 to 1995,' the Caribbean leaders said after their meeting. In March, Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela accepted the EU's increased quota offer, and agreed to drop their complaint to the Gatt over the import regime. Under the agreement, the EU will increase the annual quota for Latin American bananas from 2m tonnes to 2.1m tonnes this year, and to 2.2m tonnes next year. Costa Rica's quota is 23.4 per cent, Colombia's 21 per cent, Nicaragua's 3 per cent and Venezuela's 2 per cent. Ecuador, Guatemala Honduras and Panama will share 46.3 per cent, with the Dominican Republic getting the remaining 4.3 per cent. The mission led by the prime ministers, which is expected to visit Europe in late September and early October, 'will seek discussions with the states of the Troika (France, Germany and Greece) and the United Kingdom, the president of the Commission and the president of the European parliament,' the Caribbean leaders agreed. One technical issue that the Caribbean leaders will want clarified when they visit Europe is the transfer of quotas among ACP exporters. Countries with higher than normal production have not been able to use the quota for others who may have suffered a shortfall. 'Transferability of quotas has been allowed for the Latin producers and the ACP has had undertakings that this will be done for them,' says an official of the Caribbean Community secretariat. 'We would like to see this implemented.' They will also raise the delicate matter of financial assistance to banana producers affected by the imposition of the EU's import regime. The UK originally objected to this aspect of the plan, which proposes a fund of Ecu60m a year over three years to cover loss of income and to aid agricultural diversification. But it subsequently withdrew its objection.</p>

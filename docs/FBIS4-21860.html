			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mexico City, 3 Apr (DPA) -- The Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] today condemned the  assassination of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of the  Guatemalan Constitutionality Court. The URNG said this  "abominable incident" undermines the human rights agreement  signed with the government.    According to a URNG communique published in Mexico City, the  magistrate's assassination "bluntly reveals the opposition that  exists within government sectors, particularly within the Army,  to the Global Agreement on Human Rights," which was signed in  Mexico City on 29 March. [passage omitted    The URNG also demanded that the security corps and the  Guatemalan Army be purged "of the assassins opposed to peace and  human rights" and deemed that "thorough measures, not just  publicity and cosmetic measures" are needed.    Meanwhile, the guerrillas also called on the United Nations,  the mediator in the peace talks between the government and the  URNG, to send a preparatory mission for the verification of  human rights to Guatemala "without delay" as established in the  agreements signed in Mexico City.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: San Miguel lifted by net capital gains San Miguel, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise, has reported unaudited consolidated net profits for 1993 of 3.9bn pesos (Dollars 139m), an increase of 8 per cent over the previous year. The amount included net capital gains from its sale of 50 per cent holdings in Magnolia Corp, its food subsidiary, to Nestle of Switzerland. Excluding the non-recurring items, consolidated net income fell by 7 per cent to 3.4bn pesos, the company said. Sales volumes improved by 2 per cent. Much of the rise came in the second half and offset first-half declines caused by soft markets owing to typhoons that hit the country. Local sales of beer, San Miguel's main revenue centre, were at a plateau, although the company's international beer operations expanded into China and Indonesia. San Miguel said it was earmarking 10bn pesos this year for expansion and modernisation.</p>

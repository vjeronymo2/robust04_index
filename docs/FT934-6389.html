			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Arts: A high price for Richter's big sound - Concert On Tuesday Sviatoslav Richter played Bach in the Barbican, with Christoph Eschenbach and the English Chamber Orchestra. It was only a pendant to his solo recital in the Festival Hall on Sunday, but a costly one: Pounds 40 for any seat in the stalls or the mid-front circle. First, Eschenbach conducted a reasonably trim, moderately lively account of Bach's Suite in D. Then, after the interval, Richter stalked on to play the D major and G minor 'piano' concerti, the composer's own re-writes of his unimprovable violin concerti in E and in A minor. (The keys had to be lowered because the harpsichords of his day did not reach as far as the violin's top E). Finally the conductor-pianist joined Richter for the C minor, two-keyboard version of a concerto Bach probably wrote for violin and oboe. There were no disturbing signs of over-rehearsal, neither in the Suite nor in the concerted pieces. Anyway, in the concerti Richter's and Eschenbach's big Yamaha grands often rendered the ECO strings all but inaudible - they might have been playing almost anything. Though there are serious arguments for using the modern solo instrument that Bach never knew, the musical imbalance here was discomfiting. Not least because the ECO's continuo players had from the start included a harpsichord, the very instrument for which Bach intended his concerto solos: we could not help but notice how much happier the balance was between him and his string colleagues than between them and the soloist. Watching a brooding, tight-jawed Richter performance (he is 78 this year) is always rather awe-inspiring. Presumably that justified the seat-prices, for there was nothing greatly remarkable in his Bach interpretations. Eschewing the expressive nuances available on the modern piano, he played everything robustly, firmly and cleanly, without any special virtuosity in his solo breaks. It seemed an exercise in heroically selfless restraint; and in the two-keyboard concerto, Eschenbach matched him. We might have been hearing domestic play-throughs - except in the 'Adagio e piano sempre' of the solo concerto in D, where Richter drew out the lyrical line to an elevated height. That was the redeeming passage of an otherwise low-profile concert. I got home in time to watch a beady-eyed BBC-1 programme about overpaid, underskilled conductors, such as record companies nowadays promote far beyond their half-formed merits. It was the most intelligent and usefully mischievous TV study of the real-life classical music business that I have seen, and we watched it free; it was at least twice as interesting as the laid-back, low-cost but pricey Richter exhibition.</p>

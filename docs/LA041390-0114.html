			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEC PROBE ADDS TO LANDMARK LAND CO.'S WOES;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: AN INVESTIGATION INTO ITS ACCOUNTING PRACTICES IS THE GOLF COURSE  DEVELOPER'S LATEST REGULATORY PROBLEM.  </P> <P> The problems are mounting at Landmark Land Co., the nationally recognized golf  course developer whose operations have been hammered by growing losses in  recent months.  </P> <P> The Carmel, Calif.-based firm recently disclosed in public documents that it is  under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for questionable  accounting practices on a land deal last year near Palm Springs.  </P> <P> In connection with the probe, the firm said it may have to postpone taking more  than $24 million in profits on the sale. A deferral would boost Landmark's  losses in 1989 to $61.7 million and wipe out its shareholders equity, the firm  said in its annual 10-K report on file with the SEC.  </P> <P> Landmark's SEC problems are the latest in a series of woes that include major  losses in a savings and loan subsidiary from repossessed mobile homes, real  estate foreclosures and junk bond writeoffs, the firm has disclosed.  </P> <P> The firm also is a victim of last year's thrift bailout law, which in effect  cut off a major source of funding, forcing it to sell or refinance its prime  properties.  </P> <P> Landmark Land owns about two dozen golf courses around the country -- including  Mission Hills, PGA West and La Quinta in the Palm Springs area -- as well as a  savings and loan in New Orleans, known as Oak Tree Savings, that financed  Landmark's extensive development activities.  </P> <P> Landmark also has developed major properties in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Florida,  South Carolina and throughout California. It has major developments under way  in California near Riverside, Sacramento and Redlands.  </P> <P> Landmark is known in sporting circles as one of the nation's premier developers  of high-end golf courses. One of its best-known properties is the Oak Tree Golf  Club near Oklahoma City, where the 1988 PGA golf championship was played.  </P> <P> The company's principal shareholder is Gerald G. Barton, a 58-year-old native  Oklahoman who owns about 29% of Landmark's stock. Another major shareholder is  Olympia &amp; York Developments, the Toronto real estate company, which owns  25%.  </P> <P> The company's stock, traded on the American Stock Exchange, has been extremely  volatile, trading as high as $22.625 and as low as $6 a share in the past year.  Ignored by most financial analysts, the stock closed Thursday at $17.50 a  share, up $2.125. Landmark suspended its dividend last December.  </P> <P> Barton has run Landmark, a one-time sugar company that had major real estate  holdings, for about 20 years, making money by developing golf courses --  surrounded by residential homes -- for a wealthy elite who spend weekends in  tony places such as Palm Springs and Carmel.  </P> <P> "His basic premise was there is an affluent set of people who will pay  astronomical prices for premier golf courses and the houses around them," said  Kenneth D. Campbell, president of Audit Investments, an investment advisory  firm in Montvale, N.J.  </P> <P> The company, however, ran into deep trouble last year after Congress passed  tough bailout legislation for the S&amp;L industry that placed severe  restrictions on thrift investment in real estate developments.  </P> <P> The law shut off Landmark's funding from Oak Tree Savings and is forcing the  thrift to divest itself of more than $1 billion in real estate assets,  according to Landmark Vice President Doug Barton, Gerald Barton's son. The  senior Barton was not available for comment.  </P> <P> The company hopes to sell most of these properties, or restructure their loans,  by the end of 1990, the younger Barton said in a phone interview. Landmark  already has an agreement to sell its luxurious Carmel Valley Ranch Resort to  American International Golf Resorts for $60 million.  </P> <P> Landmark's problems with the SEC arose after it recognized a $24.3-million  profit in 1989 on a vacant piece of land near the PGA West golf course that it  had sold to a real estate syndication company.  </P> <P> Regulators from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, however, objected to  the way the loan was structured, pointing out that the property's down payment  came from Oak Tree Savings. Regulators don't want Landmark to recognize the  full profit until additional payments on the Oak Tree loan are received.  </P> <P> Both Landmark and its outside auditor, Price Waterhouse, have objected to the  OTS interpretation, and it's up to the SEC to decide who is correct, Doug  Barton said. The accounting dispute has also sparked a shareholder lawsuit.  </P> <P> The OTS also wants Landmark to increase its reserves for loan losses by another  $48 million on other development loans, including one on the La Quinta Hotel.  </P></p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Share settlement Neither big investment institutions nor private shareholders have much to fear from the UK stock market's move to 10-day rolling settlement on Monday. The fortnightly account system which ended yesterday often demanded that bargains were settled in less than 10 days. And while investors accustomed to using the whole account as a period of credit will be inconvenienced, that does not seem an unbearable price. The transition should be smooth so long as brokers and shareholders of all sizes have their administration up to scratch. Yet 10-day settlement is not meant to be more than an interim stage. Early next year, the settlement period will be halved. Whether the current paper-based system can be compressed still further without causing disruption is a moot point. Many institutions fear a sharp increase in the number of failed trades and want the same stock borrowing privileges as market-makers enjoy as a safeguard. Life will be harder for private investors. The extended settlement periods now being offered by some private client stockbrokers are helpful. But it is difficult to believe these will endure. Most private investors will find that opening a nominee account and depositing cash with a broker are the only practical answers to five-day settlement. Other than the obvious issue of cost, it would be a shame if nominee accounts spoiled the direct link between companies and small shareholders. One can only hope that market forces will bring about nominee services as slick and efficient as the promised system of settlement.</p>

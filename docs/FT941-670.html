			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Inching forwards The market cuffed Inchcape round the ear like an errant schoolchild yesterday after the trading company handed in some disappointing sums. The 7 per cent fall in Inchcape's shares is yet another illustration of the market's petulance: Coats Viyella, Bowater, and Wellcome have all suffered the same fate after making similarly lukewarm trading comments. Inchcape's chief bugbear is the continuing strength of the yen, which makes life awkward given the heavy reliance on Japanese goods. But the savage downturn in the European car market has also inflicted pain. Inchcape has done well to soften the blow by lifting Toyota car volumes 24 per cent in the UK. Even that success, though, was bought at the expense of higher advertising and promotion costs. It could be argued that both these factors were exceptional and may unwind by the end of the year. But violent currency swings and regional recessions must count as an occupational hazard for an international distribution group. It is a tribute to Inchcape's management skills that a consistent string of good results has masked the unforgiving nature of its basic business. With operating margins of about 4 per cent, Inchcape remains highly vulnerable to disappointment. The inherent volatility suggests Inchcape should trade at a discount to the market rather than the premium it has recently enjoyed. Inchcape's steady growth in China undoubtedly gives the company added long-term investment appeal. But recent austerity measures in mainland China, which have depressed car imports, argue for caution on that front, too.</p>

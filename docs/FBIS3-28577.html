			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  has accepted a compromise to enact by the year-end a bill  designed to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut that is the core of  a 15 trillion yen pump-priming package, party officials said  Tuesday [8 February]. The decision by the largest party in the  ruling coalition paves the way for Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa to announce a fresh tax reform plan, ending a nearly  weeklong dispute over a new indirect tax that almost caused the  breakup of his six-month coalition cabinet.    Five coalition leaders resumed talks at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday  in  a bid to settle the tax dispute.    Hosokawa vowed late Monday night to settle the rift in the  governing coalition over funding details for the tax cut.    On Monday, representatives of the coalition parties agreed  to  implement the 6 trillion yen tax cut independently and establish  a consultative body among coalition parties to decide funding  details within a year, coalition officials said.    Coalition leaders agreed to scrap Hosokawa's original plan  to  replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national  welfare tax" in April 1997.    Officials said the Hosokawa cabinet will unveil the economic  stimulus package Tuesday evening after settling the tax dispute.    The five coalition leaders who resumed the talks were  Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, SDP Secretary General Wataru  Kubo, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, Democratic  Socialist Party Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa, and Hiroyuki  Sonoda, who represents an alliance of Hosokawa's Japan New Party  and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura's Sakigake  (Harbinger).    At an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa  announced the 6 trillion yen tax cut retroactive to January 1  and also proposed imposing the 7 percent welfare tax to offset  resultant revenue shortfalls. But the plan drew strong  criticism from the SDP, which threatened to quit the coalition  unless the new tax was dropped.</p>

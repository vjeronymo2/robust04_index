			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG NEWS IN BASEBALL TRAVELS FAST;  </P> <P> REACTION: EVERYONE GETS THE WORD ABOUT STRAWBERRY'S DEAL WITH DODGERS AND THE  WORD FOR THE MOST PART IS 'WOW.'  </P> <P> Nick Leyva, manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, heard it on the golf course  from his partner, Whitey Herzog.  </P> <P> Joe McIlvaine, San Diego Padre general manager, was awakened by a telephone  call from a reporter.  </P> <P> Bobby Bonilla, Pittsburgh Pirate right fielder, heard the news flash on the  radio.  </P> <P> Three different people, three different teams, three different occupations, but  all in the same league in the same business. And all had the same initial  reaction as Padre Manager Greg Riddoch after learning that the Dodgers had just  signed free-agent outfielder Darryl Strawberry to a five-year,  $20,250,000-contract.  </P> <P> "Those SOBs," Riddoch said. "Can you believe it?  </P> <P> "I was teaching school today when I came in during lunch break, and everyone  starts saying, 'You're in trouble now. You're in big trouble.'  </P> <P> "I said, 'What, what are you talking about.' They said, 'Darryl Strawberry just  signed with the Dodgers.'  </P> <P> "I didn't feel like eating after that. Wow! They already have a good team  anyway, and if they get Orel Hershiser and (Tim) Belcher back, and you throw  Strawberry in the middle of that lineup, oh my gosh . . .  </P> <P> "Who wouldn't be upset?"  </P> <P> Said Roger Craig, manager of the San Francisco Giants: "It was pretty bad news,  let me tell you. When he gets going, and wants to play, he can carry a  ballclub. He's gotten into problems with management, front office, and all  that, but I really can't think of a manager who wouldn't want him."  </P> <P> The signing of Strawberry boggled the baseball industry, with phones ringing  among agents, owners, players, and yes, those managers and general managers in  the National League who now have to find a way to knock off the Dodgers.  </P> <P> "We have enough problems without having that guy in our division," said Bobby  Cox, manager of the Atlanta Braves. "That's a hell of a team, right there.  </P> <P> "I guess the only hope is past history. I remember last year when San Diego got  Joe Carter, everybody picked them to win it, but they didn't even play .500  baseball. So who knows what will happen?"  </P> <P> Still, no one is diminishing the Dodgers' potential.  </P> <P> "What a force they're going to be," Leyva said. "You throw that guy in the  middle of their lineup, and they get the two pitchers back, they could be the  dominant team in the league.  </P> <P> "I kept thinking about that a good team they'll be while I was playing golf,  and then Whitey (Herzog) reminded me, 'Hey, at least you got him out of your  division. Now you only have to face him 12 times instead of 18.'  </P> <P> "I started feeling a whole lot better after that."  </P> <P> Folks in the East Division at least have the consolation of knowing that the  Mets probably won't be a factor for the next couple of years.  </P> <P> "I guarantee you, no one in the Pirate organization is losing any sleep over  this one," Bonilla said. "If he had stayed, I'm sure everyone would have picked  the Mets to win our division. As it is, we might not have to worry about Darryl  until the playoffs."  </P> <P> And who knows, perhaps now that Strawberry is a Dodger, Eric Davis, Cincinnati  Red outfielder, will eventually join him. Strawberry said two years ago that  his ultimate dream was to play in his hometown with Davis, his best friend.  They grew up a couple of blocks from one another in Los Angeles and have the  same agent.  </P> <P> "Now, you know, I can't elaborate on anything like that yet," Davis said.  "Let's just say Darryl's taking the first step to making that dream come true.  Now, if (the Reds) don't sign me to a multiyear contract . . . "  </P></p>

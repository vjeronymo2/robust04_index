			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: University pretenders face squeeze Sir, Your confidence ('University challenge', January 5) that an expanded, better equipped further education service will serve only to produce thousands of qualified entrants for the 'new universities' to choose from is misplaced. Colleges of further and higher education have many advantages. Most staff are as well qualified as their 'new university' counterparts; the colleges are within travelling distance of the customers' homes; they offer academic and vocational qualifications; and at many, a student can start at the lowest level and go through to degree and beyond. Given that the 'boom' in student applications will continue as long as this level of unemployment is with us, the news that numbers going into higher education are to be limited while further education is to be expanded will be the green light for the more forward-looking college managements. Colleges will recruit and hang on to their students and, while the real universities will still attract their share of customers, the squeeze will be on for the pretenders.

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Arts: Outside of Heaven - Theatre Upstairs The most exciting moment of Martin Sadofski's first play is the realisation, at the start of the second act, that his characters are sharing the stage with a real, dead Dobermann. The sleek carcass is used symbolically by Sadofski to underscore his vision of wasted life. It also provides a comic disposal problem, while adding its bit to the pickle in which his characters find themselves: their futile attempts to sink its body lands them with a Pounds 300 fine. Like so much in this play, it is a good idea which is scuppered by a lack of consistency. It is hardly likely that a couple of squatters would have put an identity tag on a dog they had picked up a couple of months previously - and such a literal reading is invited by a staging which constantly moors metaphor to concrete images. It is almost as if the writer and the director, Penny Ciniewicz, are speaking different languages: he talks of fishing and dead dogs, and she provides a rod and a stuffed Dobermann. Their combined efforts give us two childhood friends from Southport and two triangular relationships. In the first act, John - white, neurasthenic and beautifully played by James Kerr - falls in love with a girl who drowns herself after a fling with his best friend, Paul, cocky and black. In the second act, five years later, the tables are turned. Paul (Lennie James), now a tough London nut, loses his girlfriend to a platonic relationship with the smart, sensitive and respectable John. Sadofski offers situations but declines to provide explanations. We are never told why the truculent Lori (Connie Hyde) drowned herself, nor why the lively Paul of the first act should have become an violent emotional cripple of the second. What could be a stylish obliqueness becomes a frustrating failure to follow a line of thought through. The result, theatrically, is that the characters fail to grip or engage: there is no sense that they have something to communicate, about life, or friendship or anything else. The abstraction of the script demands a more abstract staging if it is to become anything more than a tatty footnote to the urban disinheritance drama of so much fringe theatre in the 1980s.</p>

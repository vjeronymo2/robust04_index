			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPILL CONTINUES ITS DEVASTATING TOLL ON WILDLIFE  </P> <P> The Exxon oil spill has continued to kill animals and devour pristine waters  off southern Alaska, and officials tracking the oil said Wednesday it has  covered 9,600 square miles.  </P> <P> The animal death toll also has continued to mount. Workers have collected  22,868 dead, oily birds and 743 sea otters, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  reported. That represents a fraction of the wildlife killed by the oil, and  regional director Walter Stieglitz said: "We're still counting its victims."  </P> <P> More than $155 million has been spent by Exxon and the state and federal  governments on cleanup since March 24, when the Exxon Valdez ran aground and  spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into waters south of the Valdez oil  terminal.  </P> <P> Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper appointed a task force Wednesday to investigate the  spill and recommend ways to prevent future spills. A new 5-cent tax on each  barrel of oil from Alaska will finance the panel, which is made up of five  Alaska residents, a former science adviser to three presidents and an  environmental scientist.  </P> <P> Oil tracker Marshal Kendziorek of the Department of Environmental Conservation  has mapped the spill, and his documents show that 9,600 square miles of  southern Alaska coastal waters have been affected by the oil. That makes the  country's largest oil spill as big in size as the state of Vermont, he said.  </P> <P> Oil has spread for eight weeks and has been tracked down Shelikof Strait to  Wide Bay, 475 miles from where the Exxon Valdez ran aground, Kendziorek said.  </P></p>

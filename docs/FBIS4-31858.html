			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Peter Weiss Emphasizes: There Are No </F> Disputes Within the Party of the Democratic Left"]    [Text] Trebisov--The 11 June meeting of the Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL] Executive Committee in Trebisov dealt with  the preparations for the local and parliamentary elections,  especially with the preparation of the lists of candidates in  the individual electoral districts.    Party Chairman P. Weiss said at a news conference held after  the meeting that the Republican Council will decide on the  definitive form of the list of candidates and on the themes for  the election program at its session in Bratislava on 9 July. He  emphasized that, apart from an election program, the SDL would  also like to submit a government program to the voters--that is,  a concept for the kind of government there would be if the  left-wing coalition were to win the elections. According to  him, the SDL's policy will not change in the principle policy  issues. The party has banked on a high level of expertise and  on ensuring that the changes needed in the economy are  implemented in a socially tolerable manner. It has banked on  its ability to cooperate with other political entities and would  like to make good use of its foreign political contacts to  resolve Slovakia's problems.    Weiss rejected the rumors about an alleged split within the  SDL and said that they are purposefully nourished during the  preelection period. "There are no disputes within the SDL;  there are just differences of opinion on the tactical measures,  and we are discussing them." The preelection coalition with the  Slovak Republic Farmers Movement, the Social Democratic Party of  Slovakia, and the Green Party in Slovakia has merely cemented  our party. Weiss also rejected the SDL's alleged drift away  from the workers. "I do not understand speaking to the workers  in such a way that we make them unfulfillable populistic  promises. We are merely saying to them that our party offers a  policy based on expertise. We have a program for economic  recovery; we have a concept for changes in the social system,"  he underlined and added that the offer of postelection  cooperation with the Association of Workers of Slovakia, which  the association turned down, still stands.</p>

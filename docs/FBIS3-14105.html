			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of </F> state for foreign affairs, by unidentified correspondent in  Salalah; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to  Oman is important. Would you please comment on this visit?    [Al-Hasan] I want to reiterate the deep and distinguished  Jordanian-Omani relations that have been reinforced by His  Majesty King Husayn and his brother His Majesty Sultan Qabus  Bin-Sa'id. As you know, these relations are becoming stronger  with time. These relations, which are fraternal in terms of  dealing and frank in terms of coordination and consultation,  have become an example for other countries. King Husayn's visit  to his brother Sultan Qabus falls within this framework. These  relations are based on the existing fraternal relations between  the two leaders and two people. I can say these relations are  strong, firm, and continuous. The two countries are determined  to strengthen these relations on all levels.    I can also say that the high level of consultation and  coordination will include many bilateral issues and many Arab,  regional, and international issues. King Husayn's visit  represents a qualitative move that will strength Jordanian-Omani  relations.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency: Today, you met with the  Omani minister of state for foreign affairs. What took place  during the meeting?    [Al-Hasan] I held a fraternal meeting with my brother His  Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi, the Omani minister of state for  foreign affairs. We reviewed our good and distinguished  bilateral relations on the political, economic, and cultural  levels. We discussed a number of measures to provide momentum  to these relations, to develop them, and to activate our  bilateral agreements. I also discussed with the minister a  number of Arab, regional, and international issues of mutual  interest. Thank you.    [Correspondent] Thank you, sir.</p>

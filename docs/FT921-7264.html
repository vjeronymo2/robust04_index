			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Arafat watches from the sidelines: The PLO leader's waning role THESE are not the easiest of times for the newly-wed Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman. Not only does he continue to be confined to the margins of the Arab world due to his unpopular Gulf war stand, he is also being obliged to cope with persistent internal criticism over where, if anywhere, he might be leading an organisation whose role these days seems much less clear cut. Nagging questions about the PLO's relevance are nothing new, nor is the fact that some of the strongest criticism is coming from within the ranks, but debate has been sharpened by a number of factors, including most especially the rise of new leadership faces from within the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to about one-third of the 6m strong Palestinian community worldwide. While Mr Arafat will have his moments of publicity this week with bilateral talks resuming in Washington between Israel and its Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians, the PLO leader will seek as usual to be seen pulling the strings from Tunis. This is unlikely to still the unease felt throughout his organisation at what is seen as the continued erosion of its position. Indeed, for many of the senior cadres the issue goes well beyond relevance to questions about the PLO's very survival in its present form as an old-style national liberation movement in the post-cold war era. Talk in Tunis and elsewhere in the Palestinian diaspora has been turning towards the creation of a 'modern PLO' with reforms of the organisation's structure to enable wider popular participation that more accurately reflects the will and talents of Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories. Change will not come easily to an organisation, however, where an old-guard leadership still holds sway and where privileges are jealously guarded. And lurking in the background is the perennial question of whether Mr Arafat himself is capable of accepting democratic reforms of an organisation over which he has exerted obsessive control for the past 23 years. Against the odds Mr Arafat has survived and confounded his legions of critics; but the end of the cold war, the withdrawal of East bloc support, and perhaps most important the collapse of Arab financial backing has exposed the PLO's 'structural' weaknesses as perhaps never before. It can hardly pretend to be a functioning liberation movement, since its fighters are scattered throughout the Arab world and have not engaged the 'enemy' for almost a decade. While Mr Arafat's role of 'puppeteer' in the peace talks allows him to claim that he is still firmly in control, this is not a substitute for direct participation, and the PLO leader must fear that somewhere down the road an autonomy agreement between Israel and the Palestinians of the occupied territories will further marginalise both himself and his organisation, although such agreement could not possibly be concluded without his imprimatur. Mr Arafat must also suspect the flickering support he receives from more powerful Arab states such as Egypt has much less to do with their commitment to the PLO as the 'sole, legitimate representative' of the Palestinians than it does with the perceived need to preserve the organisation as a distant guarantor of Palestinian participation in the peace process, and as a cover for Arab steps towards the normalisation of relations with Israel. The PLO, in its present weakness, has precious little room for manoeuvre. For better or worse, it is wedded to a process whose success might, ironically, signal the end of its existence without the fruits of victory the Palestinians of the disapora have craved for so long. However it feels obliged to stay the course provided the US continues to exert pressure on Israel to stop settlement-building in the occupied territories. Senior PLO officials say this is the sine qua non of their continued co-operation, and there seems no reason to doubt them. Perhaps the most interesting consequence of the peace process, as far as the Palestinians are concerned, is the changing and evolving balance in relations between what is known as the 'inside' and the 'outside' ' that is between the Palestinians of the occupied territories and those of the diaspora, represented by the Tunis leadership. There is no question that the influence of the 'inside' has risen relative to the 'outside' since the latest effort to bring peace to the Middle East was launched with much fanfare in Madrid last October, but representatives from the territories are still extremely careful about making suitably respectful gestures towards Tunis, to the extent that some Palestinians in Jerusalem grumble that their spokesmen and women ' the Faisal Husseinis and Hanan Ashrawis ' are 'too loyal.' In the meantime, Palestinian institution-building is continuing apace in the territories with committees being established to deal with such grassroots questions as housing, health and education in preparation for possible interim-self rule under an autonomy agreement. The Tunis leadership is obliged to watch all this and give cautious support ' at a distance. While Mr Arafat may be able to console himself with the fact that he remains the 'symbol' of Palestinian hopes, his exclusion from direct participation in negotiations on the future of at least part of his flock would certainly not accord with his aspirations at this critical time when voices are being raised for long overdue PLO internal reforms.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / A song and dance on CDs: The current debate over prices The high price of compact discs ranks lower in the litany of British gripes than the weather or late trains. Nevertheless, the idea that the music companies are engaged in shameless profiteering at the expense of CD buyers is widely held. Late last month aggrieved consumers received backing from a surprising quarter. Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of retailer WH Smith, called on the music companies to provide a wider range of lower-priced CDs. The appeal was timely. At the beginning of the year, WH Smith had announced that it would stop selling long-playing vinyl records. With music companies and retailers reducing the number of releases available on vinyl, consumers would welcome a reduction in compact disc prices. Many compact discs sold in the UK are expensive, compared with both other musical formats and with prices in the US. The CD of Luciano Pavarotti's 1991 concert in London's Hyde Park sells for Pounds 12.99, compared with Pounds 8.49 for either the cassette or the LP. Mr Mark Kingston, spokesman for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represents the music companies, says that the average full-priced CD sold for Pounds 11.99 in the UK last year. In the US, CDs sell for Dollars 12 or Dollars 13 (Pounds 6.60-Pounds 7.10). Sir Malcolm's appeal for lower prices, which came after his announcement of a difficult year for the group's music retailing business, elicited a frosty response from the music companies. 'I didn't know what he was talking about,' says Mr Rupert Perry, UK managing director of EMI Records. 'They had a difficult year so they had to blame someone.' Music companies such as EMI, Virgin and PolyGram say there has been a large increase in the number of CDs selling for Pounds 5-Pounds 7. London's large record stores do sell CDs at a wide variety of prices. Some are undoubtedly expensive. At the HMV store on Oxford Street, pop group Queen's greatest hits are selling for Pounds 14.99. Leonard Bernstein conducting Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in newly united Berlin costs Pounds 14.29, as does the CD of Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras performing in Rome during the 1990 World Cup. On the other hand, Herbert von Karajan taking the Berlin Philharmonic through Beethoven's Fifth and Eighth Symphonies is on sale for just Pounds 7.99. With the Mozart bicentennial over, HMV has devoted an entire rack to the composer, with CDs at Pounds 2.49 each. Mr Jeremy Silver, spokesman for the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the IFPI's UK arm, says that 30 per cent of all CDs sold in the UK are priced at Pounds 9 or less. Mr Will Whitehorn, corporate affairs director at the Virgin Group, says his company's central London store is selling 35,000 medium-priced titles. Although WH Smith has a 50 per cent stake in Virgin's retailing operation, Mr Whitehorn claims to be mystified by Sir Malcolm's comments. But there are still two anomalies that the music companies need to explain: that US retailers sell the same products so much more cheaply, and that the price of CDs seems high relative to production costs. Both charges elicit an angry response from music industry managers. Mr Whitehorn says: 'I bought myself a pair of jeans in the States for Dollars 34. Most products in the States sell for the same price in dollars as they do in pounds here.' He adds that one reason why compact discs are more expensive in the UK than in the US is that vinyl record sales have proved more durable in Britain, where CDs have had a more exclusive image. In the US, LP records have almost disappeared. In any event, says Mr Whitehorn, 'I do not believe CDs are expensive. When I was 17, in 1977, an LP cost between Pounds 4.50 and Pounds 5.50. In 1991, you can get a CD with more music and infinitely higher quality for Pounds 10.99 to Pounds 11.99.' The music companies deny, too, that CDs are expensive relative to manufacturing costs of about Pounds 1 a disc. They point to the cost of the recording, performer's and composer's royalties, packaging and its design, distribution and the expense of signing well-known artists. The IFPI put the total average production cost of a CD in 1990 at Pounds 6.34. Mr Silver at BPI argues, moreover, that the idea of an average production cost is misleading. He says that the more stable classical music market is used to subsidise the higher-risk pop industry. 'Companies have to balance their books by offsetting their high-risk product with sure-fire product.' The strongest argument the music companies have is that the appropriate price of a CD is what consumers are prepared to pay. And, whatever the price, British consumers are buying them in increasing quantities. Last year, the number sold in the UK rose by 23.4 per cent to 62.8m. The cumulative increase over the past two years has been 50.6 per cent. Over the same period, the number of LPs sold fell by 66 per cent to 12.9m, in spite of their lower selling price.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / First hat in ring for shadow ballot THE RESIGNATION of Mr Bryan Gould has set in motion little-used party machinery for a by-election to the shadow cabinet. When parliament returns next month, Labour MPs will be entitled to put their names forward for the position in a contest that will be substantially different from the usual election procedure. Unlike normal elections in which all 18 shadow cabinet seats are disputed, the by-election will be closely analysed as an indicator of the parliamentary Labour party's mood on European Community issues. Mr Ron Davies, the MP for Caerphilly who narrowly missed election this summer, confirmed last night that he would run. But with regional 'slates' and other trade-offs unlikely to play a substantial role in the election, Mr Davies is by no means a certain winner. One long-time analyst of Labour's internal machinations commented last night that the election would be 'a beauty contest, pure and simple'. Others expected to challenge for the post include Mr George Robertson, Labour's European spokesman and a passionate supporter of the Maastricht treaty, and Mr Martin O'Neill, who until the party's election defeat in April was shadow defence secretary.</p>

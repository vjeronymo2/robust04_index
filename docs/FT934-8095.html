			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Observer: Right spirit Just when staff at Coutts, NatWest's posh private bank, thought they had heard their last ghost story along come reports that one Mr Angerstein has been sighted flitting through Coutts' branch in the Lloyd's insurance building. Surely it could not be John Julius Angerstein, the father of Lloyd's and its chairman between 1790 and 1796? But this time Coutts did not need to call in the spook-busters for further inquiries revealed that the gentleman who had been spotted was 31-year-old Joachim Angerstein, the great, great, great, great nephew of John Julius. He works for the Essen branch of Dresdner Bank and is taking part in a regular secondment programme arranged for high flyers from the big German banks. Which is all jolly convenient for NatWest Markets, whose temerity in christening a new corporate capital vehicle the Angerstein Underwriting Trust had not gone unnoticed.</p>

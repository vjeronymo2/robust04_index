			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television It is one of those rare nights when I am glad to be a television critic and consequently in receipt of preview cassettes. At 8.00 Channel 4 begins a 3 hour 20 minute repeat of David Freeman's much-discussed Opera Factory production of Cos fan tutte, transferred from an 18th century Neapolitan cafe to a 20th century Mediterranean beach. Then at 8.30 ITV begins a two-hour Sherlock Holmes special: 'The Master Blackmailer'. This series has been consistently outstanding, shot on good locations, with excellent casts. Today, in addition to Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke playing Holmes and Watson as usual, the cast includes Robert Hardy, Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, and Nickolas Grace. Then, just to make life impossible, BBC2 begins a promising series at 8.30 called Perpetual Motion. It will be considering six forms of transport which 'refused to die', starting with the Morris Minor. It is also Jodie Foster's night. At 6.00 she features in the odd and not entirely satisfactory 'gangster movie' Bugsy Malone (BBC2) in which all parts are taken by children. Then at 10.00, in The Accused (BBC1), she has the key role of a girl who is gang-raped after behaving 'provocatively' in a bar.</p>

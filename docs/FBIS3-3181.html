According to her latest remarks,  after returning from Shanghai to Beijing, Deng Xiaoping, 90, is  "a bit fatter" than before. He still plays bridge three or four  times a week. He also reads newspapers for over two hours.    Deng Rong stressed that Deng Xiaoping need not rely on  others  when reading newspapers, neither does he have to use any  supplemental tools, such as a magnifier. Deng Rong said: "His  eyes are always very good. He is not myopic and he is  particularly good when looking at things far away. However, he  has to wear presbyopic glasses. He has worn glasses for more  than a decade. My father watches television programs every  night, but he is not so good in hearing what others say, so we  have to act as his `hearing aid'."    Deng Rong said: My father has a very regular diet and he  normally will not eat too much or too little. Now, he is also  concerned about our family's food. If he eats more, he will be  "praised" by our family members. He is a bit fatter after his  return to Beijing. In Beijing, he mainly eats cooked wheaten  food, whereas in Shanghai, he mainly ate rice.    When asked about Deng Xiaoping's hobbies, Deng Rong said:  "My father is fond of playing bridge and he can play three or  four times a week. He always plays with my sisters, my elder  brother, and some old bridge partners who have already retired."    Summing up her father's secret of longevity, she said that  apart from leading a regular life, there was also an important  factor, that is, "he is particularly sanguine and is always  cheerful." She said: "Someone described him as taking serious  things lightly. Without this characteristic, it would have been  very difficult to get over the decade of the Cultural  Revolution." Deng Rong, who claimed to stay with her father  everyday, said that she did not sense any change in her father's  health and that she always felt that her father was very  healthy. She said: The most important point is that he is  healthy, and right now, he does not catch any disease."    When asked about her progress in writing the second part of  her book, My Father, Deng Xiaoping, she said that the  table of contents had been fixed. She did not agree that it  must be more difficult to write the second part than the first  part "because I am writing about my father from a daughter's  viewpoint."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian leaders and the deputy chairman of the  European Union's Commission Leon Brittan agreed that very soon  Ukraine would appeal to the Commission for a 200 Mn [million]  ECU food loan. Along with this, Ukraine would be allowed to  export farm produce to the European marketplace. It would use  part of the profits to purchase pesticides.    Brittan met with the Ukrainian leaders on 5 May. The  Ukrainian Government requested him to drop Ukraine from the C  List of nations with government-controled economies. The  European Union placed restrictions on imports from the countries  of the C List.    According to Brittan, the European Union would be willing to  help Ukraine in the field of power production and encourage free  enterprise in that republic. But, he said, Ukraine would be  taken off the C List only if it made progress on the road for  economic liberalization and, more specifically, privatization.  More reform in Ukraine would enable the European Union to speed  up moves to lift the anti-dumping restrictions.    Brittan wanted to know when Ukraine was going to pay off the  European Union's 4.5 Mn ECU loan. Ukrainian Finance Minister  Grigoriy Piatachenko said Kiev would square its debt with the  European Union by mid-May or before the European Union's  Commission sat down to decide whether to render more aid to  Ukraine.</p>

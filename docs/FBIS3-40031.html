			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Communist Renewal leader Fausto Bertinotti </F> by Marco Panara in Rome; date not given: "My Model Is Robin  Hood: Take From the Rich and Give to the Poor"]    [Excerpt] [paragraph omitted] [Panara] What exactly are you  proposing?    [Bertinotti] The idea is to produce an ordinary property tax  in such a way that all income is taxed, with an exemption  threshold excluding the first 150 or 200 million lire [L] of  treasury bills and the primary residence.    [Panara] But do you realize that, in launching this idea in  the middle of an election campaign in which taxation is the  major issue, you are stirring up a hornets' nest?    [Bertinotti] I do not understand the reason for the  controversy. This proposal has been part of the traditional  position of the Left since the sixties, and has become relevant  nowadays given the heavy tax burden on workers. Their earnings  represent more or less half of all earnings while they pay three  quarters of all personal income tax. It is as if the tax  authorities were playing Robin Hood in reverse, taking from the  poor to give to the rich, and we want to bring all this back  into balance.    [Panara] You know that treasury bills can be taxed in three  ways: through a fixed withholding on the income, as is done  today; by including the income in the tax return and subjecting  it to progressive taxation; or through a property tax. Why have  you gone for a property tax?    [Bertinotti] My intention was not to offer a technical  solution to the problem. We are very open to any further  detailed suggestions. What I am attempting do is to highlight  the disparities between the tax treatment of incomes. Obviously  a property tax requires that the bills be registered, but it  does not seem to me improper for the state to ask about property  held by taxpayers. [Bertinotti ends]    Bertinotti is calm, as if unaware that he has rocked a  weighty container, unexpectedly rocking the progressive ship and  without warning the rest of the crew.    [Panara] But why, if your intention is to tax financial  income, did you not talk about financial income, but about  treasury bills, the sacred word?    [Bertinotti] Because one has to move gradually, and since we  have to begin with something, we decided to begin with the most  important thing.    [Panara] It seems to me difficult to do these things in  stages. If one begins by taxing treasury bills, the first and  inevitable consequence is that everyone will sell their treasury  bills and buy something else. The result is a useless and very  dangerous earthquake.    [Bertinotti] What we want to do is to rebalance the tax  burden by including all income, and not just treasury bills. We  mentioned treasury bills in order to kindle reflection on the  problem.    [Panara] But the Renewal is part of an alignment. Why did  you go it alone?    [Bertinotti] We are not making an exclusive out of this  proposal, we are seeking solely to push the progressive  alignment to analyze this proposal, nothing more.    [Panara] But to propose a new tax just when the right is  building up consensus on a tax reduction.    [Bertinotti] We are proposing a different balancing of the  tax burden; we say that our position exemplifies a line which is  different from that of the Right. We say: "Pay less, but pay on  all income."    [Panara] It seems that while your allies are working to  conquer the center, you are doing everything possible to throw  them off balance.    [Bertinotti] It seems to me that the alignment is working in  particular to lose the social sector of the left, whose votes  and enthusiasm it needs to reconquer and without which this  battle cannot be won. And it is precisely this rush to the  center, this alignment which is opening up to the moderates.  The Right, what is it, basically, but an alignment which is  tending to become a mass reactionary phenomenon based on fear  and uncertainty?    [Panara] And then?    [Bertinotti] And then we have to reassure the Fiat workers,  who are afraid.    [Panara] By saying that the agreement which has just been  reached should not be signed?    [Bertinotti] Yes, I believe that if, in factory-level  consultations, the agreement were to be rejected, this would be  a positive thing, because workers could move ahead in two areas.  The first is to change Fiat's attitude, which from the outset  has been: Industrial policy decision are mine but the social  consequences are for the state. The second is to avoid the  social "shock absorbers" having the effect of eliminating any  possibility of intervention by workers in the restructuring  process. With this agreement the shock absorbers have been  applied in such a way as to divide workers into a number of  sections unable to communicate between themselves. This is an  agreement concluded within the culture of the eighties, whereas  the situation demands inventiveness, novelty. [Bertinotti ends]    Bertinotti reflects for a moment: "This does not seem to me  such an extremist line of argument."    [Panara] But tell me one thing. Do you really think that  this system of fighting separately in order to achieve a unified  victory can work?    [Bertinotti] We need to learn to reconcile dissent and  unity.  We have a common basis and then everyone advances his proposals.  The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has presented its  program, which does not please a lot of people, there are  candidates for whom perhaps one does not vote gladly, there are  different ideas on certain points, but the elements of unity are  there and it is these which remain. For the rest we will see  what consensus we manage to build.    [Panara] In a Turin constituency where the Renewal is  strong,  Gino Giugni, the minister who put together the Fiat agreement  which you do not like, is standing. Will you vote for him?    [Bertinotti] It is here that Republican discipline comes  into  play; just as we do not silence dissent, in the same way this  dissent does not eliminate the reasons for a united battle  against the right. I will vote for Giugni, certainly I will  vote for him.</p>

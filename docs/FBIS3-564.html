Bophuthatswana defence force soldiers and police cordoned  off  townships around the capital Mmabatho on Tuesday in an attempt  to prevent disgruntled government workers from attending a rally  at the Mangope Stadium in Mmabatho.    Police were also moving into the nearby Rooigrond area, also  believed to be beset by unrest.    Teachers in the independent homeland were out on strike on  Tuesday and there was a sit-in by workers at the Health  Department in Mmabatho.    The sit-in and occupation of the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting  Corporation [BBC] offices was continuing to a lesser extent  early on Tuesday afternoon after police had entered the building  at about 11.30AM under a heavy screen of teargas.    A number of the workers committee members were arrested and  led outside.    BBC Chairman Eddie Mangope, said to have been held hostage  by  the strikers, was in the boardroom at the BBC insisting it was  business as usual and denying the hostage taking.    A work stoppage at the Mmabatho Sun Hotel has been planned  for Tuesday afternoon, workers said.</p>

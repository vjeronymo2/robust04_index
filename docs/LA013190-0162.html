			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EMMITT SMITH OPTS TO ENTER NFL DRAFT;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: SCOUTS RATE FLORIDA JUNIOR TAILBACK AMONG TOP PROSPECTS AND A CERTAIN  FIRST-ROUND PICK.  </P> <P> Florida tailback Emmitt Smith today became the fifth prominent college  underclassman to give up his college eligibility in a bid for this year's NFL  draft.  </P> <P> The teary-eyed junior informed his parents, teammates and Coach Steve Spurrier  of his decision not to return for his senior year shortly before a news  conference and said he was giving up his chase for the Heisman Trophy to pursue  an "opportunity of a lifetime."  </P> <P> "Every guy has a dream of being in the NFL. I'm not going to stand here and  give you a sob story about my family needing money because I feel like they  don't really need money," Smith said. "It's a personal goal of mine and I want  to achieve it in the best way possible.  </P> <P> "This past season has helped me increase my stock (in the draft) and I don't  want to risk the chance of decreasing it."  </P> <P> Smith rushed for 1,599 yards and 14 touchdowns last fall and finished the  season with 3,928 career yards -- fifth on the SEC's all-time list -- and 36  touchdowns. He holds 56 school records, including rushing yards and TDs, and  finished ninth in the Heisman balloting as a freshman and seventh in 1989.  </P> <P> "I never dreamed I'd be standing here after three years saying I'm leaving to  go to the NFL," he said. "But I felt like last season is the best I've had in  college, and I'm the healthiest I've been. I didn't win the Heisman and I  didn't win a (SEC) championship, but I feel I've done everything I could do  except graduate."  </P> <P> The 5-feet 10-inch, 202-pound tailback plans to remain in school this semester  and vowed to return to obtain his degree between pro seasons. Smith did not  face a deadline to declare himself eligible for the NFL until later in the  spring, but said he wanted to end speculation about his future so he could  enjoy life as a student again.  </P> <P> "It's been hectic for myself and my family," he said, adding that he made up  his mind to leave Florida last weekend but did not reveal his plans until just  before the news conference he arranged on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Smith joins Alabama linebacker Keith McCants, Arkansas fullback Barry Foster,  Georgia tailback Rodney Hampton and former Tennessee running back Reggie Cobb  in publicly declaring for the NFL draft. However, he said he has been told that  nearly 40 college juniors have petitioned for early entry to the NFL.  </P> <P> NFL scouts rate Smith as one of the top running back prospects and a certain  first-round pick. The tailback said he has not signed with an agent and did not  consult with anyone about his value in the draft before making his decision.  </P> <P> "The draft's been very strange the last three years, very unpredictable," he  said, adding that he does not have a preference for where he wants to play in  the NFL.  </P> <P> "I would like to play anywhere I'm drafted. I just want to play."  </P></p>

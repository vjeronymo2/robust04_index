			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Division of Research Grants (DRG) serves as the central receipt point for applications. When received, applications will be screened for eligibility, completeness, and compliance with instructions for submission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Announcement requires more rigor in the conceptualization, design and implementation of projects and in their evaluation than the previous High Risk Youth Demonstration Grant Program. The goal is to achieve and document measurable reductions in ATOD use incidence, prevalence, and related negative consequences among appropriately aged high risk youth populations, in addition to assessing the effectiveness of specified intervention strategies in reducing the risk factors, or enhancing the protective factors on which the project is focused. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSAP will support only applicant projects that have a well developed and comprehensive evaluation plan. The evaluation plan must be conceptually and procedurally integrated with the overall project, and must have both an outcome evaluation component and a process evaluation component (discussed below). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the purpose for issuing this Announcement is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of ATOD use and its related negative consequences and to assess the effectiveness of specified intervention strategies with selected high risk youth populations, instruments should be used which will provide periodic measures of all delineated indicators. Applicants must specify the means to be used to collect these data. Applicants are required to collect baseline data, yearly progress report data, end of project data, and follow-up data on all indices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation plan must present a sound methodology for the collection, storage, analysis, and interpretation of data. The evaluation plan must utilize psychometrically sound measures and instruments for data collection. Applicants must describe the selection of instruments to be used and must provide information about their normative properties, including the appropriateness of their use for the culture(s) under study. The presented evaluation methods, measures and instruments must be sensitive and relevant to the target groups of the community with respect to age and gender distribution, reading level, and culture. The evaluation plan must also present a time-line for carrying out all evaluation procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation plan must be designed and carried out by a professional who is highly experienced in comparative evaluation methodology, independent of the project, and able to work closely with the grantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A range of from fifteen to twenty-five percent of the funds available may be used for the evaluation component. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

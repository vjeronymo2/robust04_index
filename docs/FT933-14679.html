			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lyons buys German biscuit manufacturer Lyons, the food manufacturing operation of Allied-Lyons, has bought A Krombach, a German biscuit maker. The move forms part of Lyons' strategy of expanding in continental Europe and gives the company its first food manufacturing base in Germany. Krombach will become part of Lyons Continental Bakeries, which currently operates 10 factories in Benelux and France. The consideration is not material in relation to Allied-Lyons' assets.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / London buses to be sold LONDON BUSES, operator of the capital's red double-deckers, is to be broken into its 11 subsidiary companies and privatised from the end of next year, the government announced yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes. The move might mean the end of the capital's distinctive red buses if, as seems likely, buyers of the 11 companies adopt their own liveries and move towards single-deck, one-person-operated buses. The London Tourist Board said it would be 'a sad day for London' if privatisation led to the disappearance of one of the city's most famous symbols. 'The red double-decker is very much a part of the potential visitor's image of London and it should be protected,' the board said. Red double-deckers are already in retreat in the capital after a decision by London Transport, London Buses' parent, to put the operation of 40 per cent of the bus route network out to competitive tender. Where London Buses has won the route contracts, the buses have kept the distinctive red colour. Where private companies have won the contracts, buses have appeared in an increasingly wide variety of colours and sizes. The government's aim is to privatise London Buses' subsidiaries and encourage them to compete with other private-sector operators for the right to operate the rest of London Transport's bus routes. For the present, London Transport will continue to control routes, timetables and fares in the capital, but Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said it remained the government's intention to move towards deregulation of the London bus market at the earliest opportunity.</p>

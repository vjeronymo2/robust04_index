			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Bass The news that Bass is involved in litigation over its Dollars 2.2bn purchase of Holiday Inn is perhaps not quite as unnerving as it sounds. It may be that Bass is merely protecting its right to claim for minor damages, rather than suggesting it was seriously misled. All the same, it is not the best time for attention to be drawn to the most radical and ambitious diversification in the company's history. Two years on, it is possible Holiday Inn is breaking even after interest costs. If so, it is only because the slump in profits is being offset by cuts in US interest rates. The wider question is one of fundamental strategy. Bass would doubtless argue that it was right to reduce its dependence on UK pubs and brewing at a time of huge upheaval and regulatory change. The contrary argument is that this was just the time for the industry leader to concentrate on turning change to its advantage, rather than diversifying. Nor is the case helped by the fact that just as Bass was piling into hotels at the top of the market, both Grand Metropolitan and Scottish and Newcastle were astutely getting out. Then again, Bass was scarcely the only UK company to overpay for US assets in the last few years. Like the brewing business, Holiday Inn has considerable potential. The question is whether Bass is nimble enough to exploit it. There is a depressing contrast with GrandMet, which in just over three years has abandoned hotels, betting and brewing, hugely expanded its pub empire and absorbed the Pillsbury acquisition along the way.</p>

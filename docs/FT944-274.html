			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Mexico struggles to win back confidence Mexico's new finance minister, Mr Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, has a big task in front of him. Before investors return to the Mexican market in force, he will have to convince them that the country has a credible plan to combat the disastrous short-term effects that devaluation of the peso has brought to the Mexican economy. Beyond being appointed to head the finance ministry, Mr Ortiz got little help from the Mexican president's address to the nation yesterday. For more than a week, the international financial community has been impatiently awaiting details of what President Ernesto Zedillo called an 'emergency economic plan'. But after the speech, they are still waiting, as Mr Zedillo focused on explaining the reasons for the devaluation and on the resignation of Mr Jaime Serra Puche as finance minister. Investors want to know the government's projection for economic growth and inflation. Will Mr Ortiz concede the possibility of 15 per cent inflation and recession, as many economists are predicting? Or will he be more optimistic, as some government officials are indicating, thereby running the risk of being wrong? According to the government's own figures, to maintain a balanced budget, spending will have to be cut by 2-3 per cent of gross domestic product, or Dollars 7.5bn-Dollars 15bn. There are no firm indications yet of where such cuts will come from, although the government promises complete answers next Monday. Further privatisation is touted as one of the cornerstones of the government's plan. But estimates of privatisation income are not yet firm, nor are sales plans. In addition, the level of the international financial backing made available to the Mexican government may strike investors as being too low. Though the problems are enormous and complicated, Mr Ortiz has the credentials for the job. An economics PhD from Stanford, he was chief deputy for six years to Mr Pedro Aspe, the hugely successful former finance minister. More importantly, Mr Ortiz had since November 1993 been the most eloquent voice within the former administration of President Carlos Salinas arguing in favour of a devaluation, so he comes into his new position already having thought the measure through. But the success or failure of Mexico's economic stabilisation plan does not rest on Mr Ortiz's shoulders alone. He will need assistance from an inexperienced and seemingly mistake-prone administration on the politically delicate issues of wage demands and price controls, which the president is currently negotiating among business and the labour unions. 'We are going to introduce some strong and quick medicine,' says an official familiar with the developing plan. 'But a lot depends on whether people adhere to what we are negotiating.' Finally, government officials recognise that the whole strategy may not work unless the war in Chiapas province is resolved and political stability is restored. In fact, since the financial crisis began nearly two weeks ago, more progress has been made towards reopening negotiations in Chiapas than on the economic front. 'In terms of restoring confidence in this government, a solution in Chiapas would be worth 100 cabinet changes,' says a government official. As for the luckless Mr Serra, Wall Street wanted his head. US brokerage houses and mutual funds, which have lost billions of dollars in the Mexican market, had accused him of mismanaging the crisis. Money managers have been adamant that confidence in Mexico could not return until Mr Serra's departure.</p>

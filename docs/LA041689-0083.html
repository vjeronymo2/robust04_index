			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAP  </P> <P> Easy-E and N.W.A. are a disgrace to rap music, their community, and the people  in their community. I can't understand why people enjoy listening to such  degrading garbage.  </P> <P> Both Eazy-E and N.W.A. claim to rap about he realities of black people in the  black community. I'm a black teen-ager who lives in a black community, and I  can't relate to such nonsense.  </P> <P> NICOLE BUTLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

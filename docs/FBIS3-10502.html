			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Aranda] </F>   [Text] Nuevo Laredo, Tampico, 6 Mar -- Upon arriving in  Nuevo Laredo at the head of a Mexican delegation, Deputy Foreign  Secretary Andres Rozenthal said the Mexican Government will  today present the U.S. Government with its official rejection of  the enforcement of unilateral immigration practices, such as new  detection and detention methods. The Mexican Government will  also express its disapproval of the construction of additional  barriers at the border.    During the Mexican-U.S. meeting to be held on Tuesday this  week, the Mexican delegation will present its views regarding  each of the actions taken by the U.S. delegation in the past few  weeks. Rozenthal also denied that the military exercises  announced by the U.S. Army to be conducted at Fort Bliss, Texas,  pose a military threat to Mexico or that the exercises are in  any way related to border or immigration matters.    He added that at the end of this "high-level" meeting on  immigration, authorities from the Mexican and U.S. consuls with  offices along the border, in addition to officials from  municipal, state, immigration, customs, and police organization,  will participate in another session of the Liaison Mechanism for  the Mexican-U.S. Border.    During an interview, Ambassador Rozenthal commented that on  this occasion the Mexican delegation "will have an opportunity  to present its views" on the U.S. anti-migration policy, "an  opportunity that was previously negated." "We were not  consulted, only notified. For that reason, we will take this  opportunity to present our specific remarks on those points," he  said.    Rozenthal added that he will meet with Doris Meissner, U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization commissioner, to discuss  migration and the use of border-crossing cards, measures the two  countries will adopt as a function of NAFTA to facilitate the  movement of businessmen among the three countries. Also,  special importance will be placed on the human rights of  Mexicans emigrating to the United States.    In this meeting, the foreign secretariat delegation will  present several proposals to control the entry of Americans into  Mexico. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Mexico will have to  show a personal identity document to prove their nationality.  Rozenthal added, however, that the U.S. counterparts will be  consulted prior to the enforcement of such an action.    "We will not do anything without first asking their opinion,  then we will take specific measures," he said, clearly alluding  to the unilateral increase of Border Patrol police members, the  application of new methods for the detainment of illegal aliens,  and the construction by the United States of additional barriers  at the border. The Mexican Government has rejected those  actions not only because they hamper relations between the two  countries but because Mexico's opinion was not taken into  consideration.    In today's meeting, Rosenthal will insist on a general  solution of the immigration problem through full communication  between the two countries, not through police actions such as  those enforced by the U.S. Government.    After presenting studies on the consequences of  anti-migration actions on Mexicans living in the United States,  Rozenthal's delegation will initiate legal actions on behalf of  the Mexicans.    Again discussing the U.S. Army's exercises in El Paso,  Rozenthal said such exercises are conducted every year and that  at no time has the Mexican Foreign Secretariat observed military  actions related to border or immigration problems or the alleged  deployment of military forces at the border.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: Westar seeks court protection WESTAR MINING, Canada's largest coal exporter, has applied for court protection from its creditors to help deal with a crippling debt burden and a protracted labour dispute at its biggest mine. Westar's difficulties are a sign of the turmoil in western Canada's coal industry caused by its high costs and the sharp decline in world coal prices over the past five years. Another large British Columbia mine, Quintette, recently agreed to hand a one-third equity stake to its banks in return for debt concessions. Westar, which produces 9.5m tonnes of coal a year, has asked for court protection until September 30 under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act to enable it to finalise a financial restructuring. The move came after the company missed an interest payment on its CDollars 330m (USDollars 277.3m) debt at the end of April, and Royal Bank of Canada demanded repayment of a CDollars 45m loan. Westar's Balmer mine earlier this month locked out 1,100 members of the United Mine Workers union, after they rejected company demands for a two-year wage freeze and other workplace concessions. The company says the sacrifices are necessary partly to staunch losses, but also to ensure the viability of a proposed CDollars 75m mining pit. The existing pit is difficult to mine and has only seven to eight years of reserves at present prices. The new pit would add 20 years to the life of the mine. Mr Peter Dolazel, Westar's president, warned that unless a 'timely' agreement is reached, the Balmer mine will be permanently closed. Balmer exports 6m tonnes of coal a year, mainly to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Japanese steelmakers have a one-third equity stake in the parent company. Westar said its Greenhills mine would continue to operate normally while it is under the protection of the courts.</p>

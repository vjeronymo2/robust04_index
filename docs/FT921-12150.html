			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Surgeon eases the suffering: A look at a change in approach for NatWest's troubled US operations Mr John Tugwell, the 51-year-old main board director of Britain's National Westminster Bank who was rushed over to New York last April to take over as chief executive of the bank's troubled US operations, has no illusions about the mess he has inherited. 'This is a wounded bank,' he admits, as he recounts the surgery he has performed on the bank's loan portfolio and management. Earlier this month NatWest's US operation revealed a Dollars 371.5m (Pounds 208.2m) loss for 1991, with non-performing loans (most of them property) representing 8.16 per cent of the Dollars 14.1bn loan book. In the City and on Wall Street, NatWest's US adventure - which began with the 1979 acquisition of National Bank of North America - is considered a deep problem that has helped depress the parent company's London share price. In the first half of 1991, NatWest made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 101m; this profit would have been Pounds 250m had it not been for US losses. The US strategy, the brainchild of Mr Tom Frost, NatWest's chief executive, has cost the group Dollars 2.5bn in acquisition costs and capital injections. The return on this investment is negative - some Dollars 745.5m of net losses. Much of the pain has come since NatWest, on the back of bold talk about becoming a super-regional US bank, paid top-of-the-market prices and began a rapid expansion into New Jersey in the late 1980s. NatWest Bancorp - as the US operation is called - has suffered large losses in four out of the past five years, some Dollars 1.1bn of deficits in all. The losses resulted from risky Latin American sovereign lending, bad US project finance and property loans that include write-offs on borrowings by Mr Donald Trump, the discredited New York property developer, and the woes of recession in the New York area. Mr Tugwell concedes that the bank's US strategy has changed several times in recent years and claims he has a plan aimed at achieving a 15 per cent return on equity by 1995. 'This has not been, so far, a good investment for the NatWest shareholder. The stockholder will still be waiting for a return on investment,' he admits. 'I don't know whether we can ever recoup our investment.' Asked if NatWest Bancorp would have gone bankrupt had it been a stand-alone bank lacking a parent with deep pockets, he replies: 'It would have been very close to that. Some 10 to 11 per cent of our assets were non-performing at one point.' Mr Tugwell downplays any responsibility he had as a regional general manager of NatWest Bancorp between 1984 and 1987, but acknowledges mistakes of Bancorp's past management. He admits that his personal stake in turning the US business around is 'very substantial, it is my own reputation'. He acknowledges City speculation that he is seen as a possible heir to Mr Frost. NatWest's approach to the US is at odds with Britain's three other clearers. Lloyds has a tiny US presence. Barclays has been hard hit by the recession but it is more sharply focused on corporate and investment banking. Midland's US presence is a shadow of its past, not surprising after its debacle with the California-based Crocker National, which it sold off in 1986. NatWest now has Dollars 21.5bn of US assets, two-thirds of which are in its New York bank and the rest in New Jersey. Its 260-branch network and staff of 7,300 are evenly split between the two states. Mr Frost mapped out the growth strategy, proclaiming in 1988 the goal of building a super-regional bank in the north-east of the US with Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn of assets. He said he was seeking a 10 per cent contribution to group profits from the US. The original NatWest foray into the US market was couched in terms of global diversification. By 1988, when NatWest paid Dollars 820m to buy First Jersey National Bank, the super-regional strategy was adopted. Looking back, Mr Tugwell admits that too much was paid in New Jersey. Mr Tugwell says that among NatWest's worst mistakes were loan portfolios where the bank was overexposed. US commercial property - where 50 per cent of the bank's Dollars 1.5bn loan book is classified as non-performing - is the most obvious example. Since last April Mr Tugwell has ousted most of the previous top managers at NatWest Bancorp, made Dollars 567.7m of bad debt provisions and tried to steer the bank towards a new strategy. To correct the US bank's credit policies he brought over Mr Alan Jones as senior credit control manager, a role he played at the NatWest group level. Mr Tugwell says the bank is trading profitably and analysts expect it could earn Dollars 100m in 1992. One thrust of his attempt to reach a 15 per cent return on equity by 1995 is a drive into the retail market. He says the aim is to shift the business mix from its present 80:20 split between corporate and retail to 60:40 by 1995. He wants to develop more non-interest income by improving the number of services sold to clients, and to earn more from specialist areas such as leasing, cash management and lending in niche markets. The retail ambition seems odd at a time when consumer delinquencies are at record levels and even retail banking profits at Citicorp, the New York leader, have crashed as a result of the recession. 'We have neglected our consumer base of 1.25m customers and it ought to be relatively simple to achieve early results,' he says. This optimism runs counter to conventional wisdom in New York banking. But so does Mr Tugwell's conviction that he must expand NatWest in Connecticut, one of the most depressed states in the north-east. Mr Tugwell says the London board is committed to the bank. It discussed and 'soundly rejected' last year the option of selling the US business. But NatWest's top executives have repeatedly claimed the worst was over in the US - and they have repeatedly been wrong.</p>

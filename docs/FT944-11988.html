			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca seeks US healthcare links - Deal involving investment of up to Dollars 300m expected in few months Zeneca, the drugs company is considering forming joint ventures with US healthcare suppliers as an alternative to the multi-billion dollar acquisitions made by rivals such as SmithKline Beecham. A deal involving either a joint venture or close links with a US healthcare company is likely within four months. It would probably involve a cash commitment of between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m (Pounds 190m) over several years. Creating a free-standing joint venture would be an unusual approach to dealing with the newly cost-conscious US healthcare industry. The highest profile strategies so far have been from SmithKline and two US companies, Merck and Eli Lilly. Between them the two US companies have spent more than Dollars 12bn in 15 months on buying Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and Health Management Organisations (HMOs). These are two types of business which negotiate deals with hospitals and drug makers on behalf of employers who pay health insurance premiums for employees. But last month's decision by the US Federal Trade Commission to impose conditions on the Eli Lilly purchase has put the whole acquisition strategy in question. Zeneca is in talks with several HMOs on a tie up. It has established Stuart Disease Management in the US. Disease management programmes are attracting increasing interest in the US. The idea is that patient care should include the provision of non-drug treatments, such as diet regimes and screening programmes. Zeneca's biggest-selling product is Zestril, the heart drug. The company also produces low-fat, low-salt foods - of the kind recommended for many heart disease sufferers - that could find new markets in healthcare. Mr David Barnes, Zeneca chief executive, said yesterday he wanted to keep open options that would be closed by a large purchase. He said the approach pioneered by US company Pfizer, which this year set up a Dollars 100m disease management programme with HMO Valu-Health, was a good model. Zeneca has already signed three preliminary contracts with HMOs. The work they will undertake, under a system called capitation, is designed to 'share the risk in healthcare,' said Mr Barnes. Under the system a company receives a flat fee for treatment per head of population rather than a per treatment payment.</p>

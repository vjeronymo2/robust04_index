			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Sport: Kings of the lawn - Croquet AS YOU get out the mower and casually contemplate a gentle turn through the hoops, give a thought to top-level croquet. Great Britain played a Test match in Australia this spring and won - for a record ninth time. The event passed unremarked. The occasion also saw the debut of the US in top-class croquet. They joined Britain, Australia and New Zealand for the first time since Test matches were instituted in 1925. Their participation marked a turning point in the performance of the British team. 'We lost on the first day,' says British Captain David Openshaw. 'It was only after we beat the Americans on day five that we really got our act together. Our team had decided that they not only wanted to win but to win well. Privately I had my doubts about that. I thought it was too aggressive.' Openshaw is a croquet veteran of five test matches and has captained four of them. He has a reputation in croquet for tenacity and relishes a close fight. In this he was disappointed in Australia as the result, 17-3, was a walkover for the British. 'It lacked the same thrill as the last test in New Zealand (in 1990) which was much closer,' he says but he was justifiably pleased with his team's success as three of the six players, John Walters, David Maugham and Chris Clarke, were newcomers to test matches. John Walters, 28, won the 1991 World Championship after nearly a decade of unremarkable play. He battled through to the finals again last year in Newport, Rhode Island, where he lost to Robert Fulford. Maugham, 23, is distinguished by his accurate and consistent 'shooting' ability on the lawns. In Australia, he set a test record by completing a 12-hoop two-ball break against the veteran New Zealand champion, Bob Jackson. Fulford, 23, is the undisputed top player in the world. He let slip a maths degree at Durham to concentrate on croquet and since then, has toured the world, earning a meagre living from his play. He made his first test appearance in 1990, has won the World Championship twice and during his recent world tour, won the New Zealand Open Championship, becoming the first British player to do so in 30 years. He is keen on chess and bridge and obsessed by tactics. Fulford's style of play is unnattractive to watch but his ability is undeniable. If croquet provided a fraction of the prize money of golf or tennis, Fulford would be a rich man. His success is all the more impressive because of the growing number of good British players. With young talent such as this, backed by the experience of players like Openshaw and Colin Irwin, playing his third test this year, it is small wonder that the British are currently supreme in croquet. Yet both the players and the game receive little recognition. There are two main reasons for this. One is the ingrained image of croquet as nothing more than a 'vicious garden game', making it hard for anyone except a keen player to take it seriously. More important, is the muddled attitude of British croquet's governing body, the Croquet Association. From its tiny corner in London's elegant Hurlingham Club, the CA consistently fights a battle with itself over the nature of croquet. It is a 'game' that even Lewis Carroll would have found hard to conceive. On one side lies a craving for publicity and the necessary sponsorship it brings. On the other, is the fear of crude limelight that can follow fame and a rigid defence of British croquet's amateur status. Endless discussions are held on promoting croquet the 'right way' which invariably means not at all. Opportunities slip by. Sponsors find themselves welcomed eagerly then forgotten in the stampede to find someone else to back the latest tournament. Press coverage is haphazard and publicity - of any kind - is usually greeted with suspicion. However, as in all things concerning croquet, the unexpected can and does occur. Just when the weighty flamingo of administration seems too much to bear something happens to make it all worthwhile. The British Council is staging an exhibition of International Croquet in Milan. Milan is the headquarters of Italian croquet and, not surprisingly perhaps, given the complicated tactics of their politics and economy, the Italians appear to have a great ability for the game. Until July 21, the Milanese can enjoy an exhibition of more than 100 photographs of croquet players from the 1860s to the present day and follow the fortunes of a game which is now played from Palm Beach to Palermo.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Hungary to put up steel trade barriers next week HUNGARY has decided to put up trade barriers against steel imports from next week in the latest concession to industries and joint ventures demanding protection. The ministry of international economic relations said that Hungary would introduce quotas on imports of 15 steel products. The move comes after the local industry accused competitors in other east European countries, notably Czechoslovakia and the former Soviet Union, of dumping subsidised production. Officials also promised Voest-Alpine, the Austrian state-owned steelmaker, that imports would be curtailed, when a month ago, the company bought into Hungary's largest cold-rolling mill at Dunaujvaros. The measure is a sign of increasing protectionist pressure, particularly effective when it comes from western joint ventures. The government sees its concessions to the protectionist lobby as tactical and denies that they go so far as to compromise Hungary's general commitment to import liberalisation. Hungary is locked into reducing tariffs by the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and the terms of its association agreement with the European Community, the trade element of which came into effect this month. None the less, in quick succession, Hungary has restricted imports of steel and cars, along with cement and televisions. Hungary issued licences for only 84,000 cars to be imported in the first half of 1992, a reduction of 44 per cent on the 1991 level. The cut was in response to claims to infant-industry status by General Motors of the US and Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation, both of which have set up new car plants in Hungary. The Hungarian authorities have also raised to 25 per cent the tariff on colour televisions, which Samsung, the South Korean electronics company, produces locally. The overall trend, however, is still towards liberalisation. Of imports, 92 per cent in 1991 needed no licences, up from 70 per cent the year before. Meanwhile the average tariff rate fell from 16 to 13 per cent.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Judges consider abandoning their wigs CEREMONIAL wigs may be going out of fashion after almost 300 years. As commercial court judges yesterday debated a proposal from the Commercial Bar Association that barristers and judges should no longer have to wear wigs, the new speaker of the Commons, Miss Betty Boothroyd, took her seat without wearing the traditional wig. Barristers have complained that wigs are uncomfortable and old-fashioned, and say they intimidate the public. The commercial judges reached no conclusions yesterday, but recommended widening the debate to all judges of the Queen's Bench Division. Lord Taylor, the new lord chief justice, said yesterday the question of abandoning wigs was a matter for the Judges' Council, and no decision could be taken without extensive consultation. He has previously expressed the opinion that wigs are unnecessary. Wigs became fashionable in the 17th century under King Charles II and were adopted by lawyers among others. Wigs then were made of human hair  - the horsehair wig worn by most barristers today was invented by Humphrey Ravenscroft in 1822. His company, Ede and Ravenscroft, the ceremonial outfitters, is still the main supplier of legal wigs in the UK, and exports to countries with British-inspired legal systems. Even if barristers do cast aside their wigs, Ede and Ravenscroft's main business  - robes for academics, lawyers and the royal family  - shows no signs of disappearing. Abandonment of wigs has been proposed before without result, but this time a relaxation of the rules in some courts seems likely. LORD MACKAY, the lord chancellor, denied yesterday that he intends to step down in the autumn after five years in the job, Robert Rice writes. His department said Lord Mackay was disturbed by continuing press speculation that he no longer wished to continue in office. Rumours began circulating in Whitehall shortly before the election that the lord chancellor would not continue in office for more than six months. His department said he had been unable to deny the rumours at the time because the election campaign was under way and parliamentary convention prevented him from making any statement. The lord chancellor recently proposed to reduce the normal retirement age for judges from 75 to 70.  At 65, he could thus remain in office until 1997. Lord Mackay succeeded the late Lord Havers as lord chancellor in 1987.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Swedish anti-EU camp grows Opposition to joining the European Union has strengthened significantly in Sweden over the past month according to an opinion poll published yesterday. It underlined the difficulty facing the country's political leaders in their attempt to win acceptance of membership in a referendum on November 13. The poll, in the Gothenburg Post newspaper, showed opposition rising to 45 per cent from 40 per cent in a similar poll in May. Support also grew for the Yes camp, from 34 per cent to 37 per cent. But the worrying trend for EU supporters was the greater share won over by the No side from a narrowing pool of undecided voters, widening the opposition's lead.</p>

Martin Equihua, leader of the Indian group, pointed out that  approximately 560 representatives from Guerrero ethnic groups  will begin marching toward the Mexican capital on 21 February so  as to "not leave the Chiapas Indians without support." The march  will begin at Chilpancingo, 210 km south of Mexico City.    He said this organization "supports" the rebellion started  by  the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) on 1 January, but,  after meeting with Guerrero Indian communities, it agreed "not  to take up arms because we are going to follow the path of a  peaceful and legal organization and to more enthusiastically  promote the political demands" of the rebels.    In a message that did not specify if they were requesting  military or simply political support, the Zapatist rebels asked  the Guerrero Council "not to leave them alone" in their fight  and to take our blood as nourishment." [quotation marks as  received]    In early February, journalist Raymundo Riva told the local  EL  FINANCIERO newspaper that there are reportedly 52 groups apt to  engage in guerrilla warfare in Mexico. These groups could take  up arms anytime; the probable date of an uprising reportedly  would be in August just before the presidential elections.    Equihua emphasized that the Guerrero peasants will walk 11  days before reaching Mexico City and will try to meet with  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to ask him to create an  autonomous fund for the development of Indian peoples and to  keep the official promises to meet Guerrero State's  socioeconomic demands.    The Indian leader added that some 200 Nathuatlaca Indians  will participate in the 21 February march, along with 150  Mixtecos, 110 Tlapenecos, and some 100 Amuzgos. These Indians  live in the mountainous zones of Guerrero and will hide their  faces behind balaclavas, as the EZLN rebels do.    Equihua noted that the march, for which the Council has  requested support from political organizations and the 56 ethnic  groups that live in the country, "has no partisan or electoral  goals."</p>

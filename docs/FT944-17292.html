			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Cabaret set for revival - In search of night life, Antony Thorncroft finds Tony Martin at the Green Room London swings] Oh no it doesn't. Of all the major cities of the world London is among the most dreary and unimaginative when it comes to night life. Anyone who fancies a well-rounded celebration - a good meal, an exciting cabaret and then a lively, or romantic, dance, had better get real. It is not so bad if you are under 30. In fact these days it is quite lively. There are the proliferating comedy clubs for a start, and if you are young and smart you can spend your evenings queuing up outside dance clubs, waiting to be rejected by the all mighty doormen. But anyone falling at this hurdle, and committing the even greater sin of maturity, faces an impoverished choice. Where are the gay night clubs of the 1920s and '30s, even of the '40s and '50s. All long gone. If you like jazz, Ronnie Scott's is as reliable as ever, certainly the jokes are unchanging. At Pizza on the Park, you get to hear some half forgotten names in comfort (Julie Wilson is currently there). But traditional cabaret haunts are almost as extinct as white ties and tails. In recent months there has been another attempt to lure the middle aged, middle classes, out at night. Hotels like the Dorchester and the Lanesborough have joined the Savoy in adding a torch singer to the traditional background pianist, at least at weekends. And the Cafe Royal has gone all the way, creating the Green Room, a cabaret spot where you can also dine and dance. The Green Room has been going for a year now, and recently had its first sell out season with the Three Degrees. Much encouraged, it is booking acts well into next year. The choice is worryingly eclectic, throwbacks to British television of the 1960s, like the Bachelors, jostling alongside such greats as Bobby Short, the American cabaret performer who keeps alive the tradition of Coward and Hutch; and Freddie Cole, brother of the more famous Nat. In a way this sums up the Green Room: while Barbra Streisand was selling out Wembley at Pounds 250 a ticket, her sister Roslyn Kind was playing the Green Room at Pounds 20. But there have been intriguing bookings: songwriter Jimmy Webb for example, as well as sightings of such long lost stars as Frankie Vaughan and Sasha Distel. What can you expect from a visit to the Green Room? Well the cost is fixed - Pounds 48 for meal and cabaret, Pounds 20 for the show alone. But no one goes to the Green Room for the food. The action starts around 9.15pm; the lights go down, blotting out the fact that by day the Room hosts conferences of brand managers; and a star appears. Until October 15 it is Tony Martin. Yes, that Tony Martin, the romantic Hollywood lead of the 1940s who crooned to such leading ladies as Judy Garland, Shirley Temple and Lana Turner, and who ended up marrying one of them, Cyd Charisse. The Tony Martin who introduced Begin the Beguine and for whom Jerome Kern wrote 'All the things you are'. He is in amazing shape and the finest vocal fettle. The face and the hair might be works of science rather than nature but his vocal range and breath control are staggering. For Tony Martin is galloping towards his 82nd birthday, and needs absolutely no critical favours. Unlike a younger rival, Sinatra, he remembers the lyrics; he has also learned new songs, like 'The wind beneath my wings'. That is the attraction of cabaret. It might be a dying art form, but watching Martin with his anecdotes about Irving Berlin, and his obvious pleasure in still hitting and holding the notes (''All the things you are' is an octave plus five', he points out), gives you a last, lingering, look at one of the 20th century's greatest artistic heritages. Tony Martin is at the Green Room, Cafe Royal until October 15. (071 437 9090)</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tofik Gasymov: `We Did Not Embark </F> on Compromise'"]    [Text] "The fact that 15 deputies of the National Assembly  have returned to work in the parliament does not mean that we  are afraid of a rotation that could result in our displacement,"  stated Tofik Gasymov, people's deputy of Azerbaijan and chairman  of the parliamentary Commission on State Structuring, in an  interview with a correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVIS agency. "We  do not want to be accused of disrupting the adoption of economic  laws and decisions important for the republic and for the  people." The demand upon which these deputies just recently  left the parliament, depriving it of a quorum for an indefinite  period of time, remains unchanged: The issue of the Bishkek  Protocol must be included in the agenda of parliamentary  sessions.    T. Gasymov noted that the group continues to insist on an  examination of this question at a separate session of the  National Assembly. He categorically denied the assertion that  the return of the deputies constituted a compromise with the  authorities. "This step was dictated by a desire not to inflame  political passions in the republic to their ultimate limit. The  authorities intended to provoke the people, in their eyes  heaping upon us all the clumsiness and incompetence of the  leadership," the chairman of the parliamentary commission stated.</p>

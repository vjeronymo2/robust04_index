			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To retain the add-back provision under the proposal recommended for adoption herein could only result in increasing the minimum Class II milk price. An analysis of what the Class II price would have been with and without an add-back provision reveals that in 1990 the add-back would have enhanced the effective Class II differential by 19 cents; for 1991 it would have enhanced the Class II differential by 24 cents; for 1992 it would have enhanced the Class II differential by 15 cents; and for 1993 the Class II differential would have been enhanced by 34 cents. Additionally, because this decision makes a clear break from the past in that Class II prices are more importantly coordinated with the Class I price, there remains no rational argument for its retention. The need for advance pricing, as well as the need for coordination with Class I price movements, means moving away from price coordination with the current month's Class III price. Both objectives can not be simultaneously satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Need for Emergency Action. On the basis of the record evidence and testimony, no emergency conditions could be ascertained that would warrant the omission of a recommended decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulings on Proposed Findings and Conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Briefs and proposed findings and conclusions were filed on behalf of certain interested parties.

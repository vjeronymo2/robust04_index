			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: Tartans fit for a queen ANYBODY wondering how to use tartan in their home should hurry along to Anta at 141 Portland Road, London W11, where the shop seems to be devoted to nothing but the hundred-and-one things you can do with it. Annie Stewart, commissioned by Hunters of Brora to design a new range of floor coverings and furnishing fabrics, has been experimenting with the Scottish material for years, re-colouring and re-working the ancient theme. At the moment, there is a serious flirtation with tartan in interior design circles. Any decorating magazine worth its glossy paper devoted pages at Christmas to bedecking candles, tables and mantelpieces with dark, rich tartans; while Ralph Lauren has for some time been showing us the posh American way with tartan, using it on everything from plates and candle-holders to bed linen and rugs. But tartan is much, much more than a temporary decorative phase. Those sumptuous colours with their rigorous purity of lines, , and the satisfyingly geometric patterns - all stand the test of time, and both Hunters and Annie Stewart see it as an enduring classic to be updated and freshened in keeping with modern life. Anybody who visits Anta will soon see that Annie and her architect husband, Lachlan, really have found new and contemporary ways of building on the traditional elements, lifting tartan right out of the world of the tawdry instant tourist cliche of toffee tins and plastic-coated luggage. Besides producing one-off special designs for people such as Katharine Hamnett, Jasper Conran and Paul Smith, there has been a range of furnishing fabrics and floor coverings for the interior designer Nina Campbell - used in the Duke and Duchess of Yorks' new house at Windsor. Annie has re-introduced the flat-weave floor coverings that were used widely in the 18th century. All woven for her by Hunters from 100 per cent wool, these coverings once were known as Scots carpet but fell out of favour when tufted carpeting came in during the 1930s. Now, though, people are re-discovering them. They are far more hard-wearing than their plusher, softer, newer relations: for example, the Stewarts are busy organising a replacement for a carpet that has been down for 55 years in a Scottish ancestral home. Over at Balmoral, there is a similar request to replace a tartan floor covering that has been down since Queen Victoria's time. Anta has 12 different floor-covering designs, all at Pounds 35 a square metre, but will also make to special order. For the Hunters' collection, Annie will draw on the mill's authentic tradition - re-colouring the tweeds for furnishing fabrics and using tartan themes for the floor coverings. Hunters is selling four different colourways, among them a specially-attractive soft grey, blue and greenish tartan. Anybody wondering how to use tartan will find Anta a fund of inspiration. Those in Scotland (and it always seems extraordinary to southerners that Scottish houses make so little use of their own wonderful decorative heritage) might like to look at the watercolours in the exhibition 'Royal Residences of the Victorian Era,' now on display at Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh. They feature tartan-clad rooms at Balmoral. Part of the secret is not to be too timid, and to balance the bold tartans with gentler ones, keeping to the same tones. If you do not have the courage to go the whole hog, you could start experimenting with some tartan ceramics, a cushion, or the odd rug or two to fling over a sofa. Or you could don a dressing-gown, fill a duffel bag or sling on a coat - all in one or other of the Stewarts' new tartans.</p>

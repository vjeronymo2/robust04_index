A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  International Cooperation said the meeting was called following  a deterioration of the war situation between the Government of  Rwanda and RPF fighters, and as part of UN efforts to bring  about a ceasefire. Tanzania has been involved in reconciling  the two sides for a long period, culminating in the signing of a  peace accord last year. [passage omitted]    The statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  International Cooperation said the government had received  unconfirmed reports of the death of three Tanzanians. The  statement also stated that the government was continuing with  arrangements to repatriate Tanzanians currently in Rwanda [words  indistinct]    The government also called on the Government of Rwanda to  immediately release 44 vehicles and the goods in them.

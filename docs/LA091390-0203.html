			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Brazil to Open Computer Market: The Brazilian government said it would open its  computer market to imports, ending a controversial policy adopted in 1984 to  protect its fledgling computer industry that had prompted U.S. trade  retaliation. Under the latest plan, imports of only 30 types of products,  mainly in the area of microcomputers, will be prohibited until 1992. All other  computer products will be allowed in, although import tariffs have not yet been  set.  </P></p>

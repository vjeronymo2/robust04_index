			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yu Chong-mo] </F>   [Text] With the world abuzz over the North Korean nuclear  problem these days, an extraordinary kind of nuclear crisis is  brewing in South Korea. The deadline for the government to  secure a place to permanently store radioactive wastes from  domestic nuclear power plants is fast approaching. But officials  at the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) are finding  themselves increasingly helpless in the face of strong  resistance from local residents who fear their `backyards' might  be contaminated.    Analysts warn South Korea may have to suspend its nuclear  power generation around 2001 should it fail to find a permanent  storage by the end of next year. Considering atomic reactors  account for nearly 40 percent of electricity consumption here,  suspension of their operations would deal a hard blow to  national economy.    In Korea, where the first nuclear power plant was built in  1978, nine reactors are currently in operation, generating about  4,500 to 5,000 drums of radioactive waste annually. The  mountains of waste, however, have been stored at provisional  facilities inside nuclear power plants, raising problems  regarding safety and capacity.    The government, keenly aware that the temporary depots will  be filled before 2001, has desperately searched since the late  1980s for a region willing to host a waste dump.    Seven coastal towns had been designated as candidate sites  and MOST promised to redevelop the finally selected town into a  comprehensive science and research complex at a cost of 760  billion won. The ministry also offered to spend 3 billion won  annually on improving the welfare of the concerned residents.    But each time the government's efforts ended in failure in  the face of angry protests from Nimby [not in my backyard]  activists. In the latest incident, the ministry early this month  had to scrap its plan to build a dump site in Uljin, North  Kyongsang Province, after residents there staged violent street  demonstrations.    Waste from the nuclear power stations is classified into two  kinds according to the degree of radioactivity. Used nuclear  fuel and substances reprocessed from the used fuel are called  highly radioactive wastes. As Korea strictly abides by IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] regulations, reprocessed  wastes, like plutonium essential to making N-bombs, are not  produced here.    Low-grade radioactive wastes refer to almost all kinds of  throwaway items used at the nuclear power stations, including  operators' clothes, shoes, gloves, and tools.    A total of 43,700 drums of low-grade wastes have been  produced by the nine reactors through April, occupying over 55  percent of the existing temporary depots, whose aggregated  maximum capacity is 79,900 drums, the Korea Electric Power Corp.  (KEPCO) said. Depots of highly radioactive wastes were also  filled up to 57 percent of capacity.    KEPCO has recently expanded Kori's storage capacity by  23,000  drums and taken other emergency countermeasures. Nevertheless,  one after another temporary depot will reach saturation between  1995 and 2001 -- Uljin Nuclear Power Station in 1995, Yonggwang  in 1999, and Kori and Wolsong in 2001, respectively.    Considering that it takes at least six to seven years to  build a permanent storage facility, the selection process has to  be finished by the end of next year. On the other hand, the fact  that seven more reactors are currently under construction adds  to the seriousness of the problem.    Furthermore, the Nimby syndrome is likely to intensify with  the advent of the provincial self-rule system next year.    Despite a series of studies confirming the safety of  preserved radioactive wastes, the public doubts hardly show  signs of abating. A recent poll found that 52.5 percent of the  people have negative image toward nuclear-related matters and  nearly half mistakenly believe that reactors can suddenly  explode just like an atomic bomb. Shortly after the survey, MOST  officials started to call radioactive waste "nuclear byproducts"  in its bid to dispel the negative image.    As part of the government's last-ditch publicity efforts,  Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung had a mini nuclear  waste dump installed next to his office in Kwachon last December.    MOST once considered building a permanent depot on an  uninhabited island or in an abandoned mine, but such plans  turned out to be ineffective.    If the government fails to meet the deadline eventually,  even  the possibility of "exporting" the wastes should be explored, a  MOST official laments.</p>

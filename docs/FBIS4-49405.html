			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Economic and trade  co-operation between east China's Shandong Province and  Singapore is booming.    By the end of last year the economically-developed province  had approved the establishment of 230 enterprises funded by  Singapore business people.    The first such enterprise was set up in 1985.    A provincial official in charge of foreign investment said  that Singapore-funded projects are on a large scale, with the  contracted investment averaging 2.6 million U.S. dollars.    Of the projects concluded last year, the official noted, 123  were Sino-Singapore joint ventures and 27 were solely funded by  the Singapore side.    These projects are distributed in 16 prefectures and cities,  with the coastal cities of Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai being the  main locations. They are involved in the fields of food  processing, textiles, building materials, electronics, real  estate, tourism and information consultancy.    Last year saw Shandong's foreign trade with Singapore total  220 million U.S. dollars, accounting for three percent of the  province's total.</p>

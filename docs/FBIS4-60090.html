Discussion dealt with the Arab situation and the ALO  activities.    Khaddam also received at 1300 (Jacob Kleinberger), Swiss  secretary of state for foreign affairs. The meeting was  attended by Swiss ambassador in Damascus Kurt Wyss. Talks dealt  with the situation in the region, the international situation,  and latest developments in the peace process.    Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' received (Kleinberger) this  morning. The meeting was attended by Yusuf Shakkur, assistant  to the foreign minister; Muwaffaq Nassar, director of the  Western Europe Desk; (Martin Schbkhar), director of the Middle  East Department at the Swiss Foreign Ministry; and the Swiss  ambassador in Damascus.    Talks centered on the latest developments in the peace  process in light of the results of the Geneva summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, and the latest tours  of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the region.    The foreign minister said the Israeli proposals conveyed by  Secretary Christopher during his latest visit did not help  achieve progress because they were based on premeditated Israeli  intentions not to fully withdraw from the territories that were  occupied in 1967.    (Kleinberger) expressed the Swiss Government's position in  support of the peace process on the basis of implementing  Security Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace.    The Swiss secretary of state for foreign affairs arrived in  Damascus yesterday afternoon.</p>

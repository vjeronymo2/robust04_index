			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Observer: Brave words Connoisseurs of political whistling in the dark may care to compare the Finnish president's statement after last week's flotation of the markka with two classic British examples of former times. 'My conviction is that our currency is not fundamentally overvalued and that there is a real possibility that when more transactions are made, when exporters and importers meet, the level of the exchange rate will be substantially lower (meaning a stronger markka) than the level of those very few and non-representative transactions that have got much publicity.' President Mauno Koivisto, as reported by Reuter, September 8 1992. 'That doesn't mean, of course, that the pound here in Britain - in your pocket or purse or in your bank - has been devalued.' Prime Minister Harold Wilson, November 19 1967. 'We have had great losses in equipment, but our men have gained immeasurably in experience of warfare.' War Minister Anthony Eden, commenting on the Dunkirk evacuation, June 2 1940.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sims Food bounces to Pounds 1.21m Shares in Sims Food Group climbed 6p to 87p yesterday as the meat processor and supplier turned losses of Pounds 1.26m to pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.21m in the six months to September 30. Strong demand in the fast food sector helped to lift sales by 4 per cent on continuing activities, although overall turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 134m (Pounds 149m). Mr John Stone, chairman, reported that 'we are enjoying improved trading conditions in all our divisions as input prices have eased and consumption has increased'. The Milton Keynes-based company reported retail sales up 9 per cent to Pounds 88.8m, following a 40 per cent reduction in slaughtering capacity last year. Volumes at the core wholesale hamburger business rose 10 per cent to lift manufacturing sales 9 per cent to Pounds 16.4m. The catering division reported sales down 14 per cent at Pounds 23.7m, as meat costs rose higher than expected. Earnings per share were of 2.1p, compared to losses of 3p. The interim dividend is maintained at 2p.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Asda The UK's three biggest grocery chains have cause for complaint with Asda. Not only does the once-struggling retailer have the temerity to cling to existence, hampering their imperial designs. It then proceeds to utter bearish noises about the industry's future, jangling nerves and share prices throughout the sector. If Asda's revival continues at its present pace, then Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway may have even more reason to be upset. Revamped Asda stores and an expanding Dales discount chain could provide far stiffer competition in the low growth, low inflation environment of the 1990s. But it would not do to get so swept up in the excitement, as Asda's share price has done this year. Much of the recovery rests with the belief that Asda can lift its 4 per cent margins closer to the 8 per cent achieved by the big three. Yet this supposition may be suspect should Asda's predictions prove correct. If the industry's margins do subside as price competition sharpens, it will be all the more difficult for Asda to fight the trend. This year Asda will only make modest earnings progress as it refurbishes 40 stores. The critical test will then be how successfully it spends its Pounds 347m rights issue money to re-ignite sales growth in future. A share rating matching Sainsbury's takes a lot on trust when so much is still unproven. Investors may do better to favour those second tier stocks, such as Wm Morrison, Iceland or Shoprite, where continued growth prospects are more assured.</p>

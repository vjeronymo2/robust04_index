			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz stays silent over banker DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, yesterday refused to be drawn into the controversy generated by remarks from a board director of the Deutsche Bank. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, director of the Deutsche Bank responsible for corporate finance, on Wednesday said both groups wanted to see Deutsche's stake in Daimler reduced from the current level of 28 per cent. Daimler said yesterday that Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive, had held discussions with Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive and his predecessor, Mr Alfred Herr-hausen, over the level of the holding. But Daimler insisted that there were no talks on the issue and no plans for the stake to be cut. Mr Schmitz told investors on Wednesday that 'there are those in the bank who may feel sorry not to have got out (of Daimler-Benz shares) when the price was better'. He said: 'There is a consensus within the bank and Daimler Benz that it is in the interests of both entities that the stake does not remain at 28 per cent for too long.' Although Mr Schmitz said there were no immediate plans to cut the stake, the report of his comments triggered a fall in Daimler's share price by DM8.10 to DM606.20. It recovered after Deutsche Bank put out a statement repeating that there was no intention to sell the stake and Mr Schmitz's remarks had been misinterpreted, closing at DM613.50. Mr Schmitz's comments came at a sensitive time as Daimler is in the throes of a major restructuring involving significant job losses and a reorientation of the core automobile business at Mercedes Benz. Profits for 1992 are likely to fall by almost a quarter to DM1.5bn. Deutsche Bank has had the Daimler stake for over 60 years. Sanguine view from the top, Page 14</p>

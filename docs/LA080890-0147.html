			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SWISS RED CROSS WORKER FREED IN LEBANON; WAS HELD 10 MONTHS  </P> <P> Kidnapers freed a Swiss Red Cross worker in Lebanon today and handed him over  to Syrian authorities, a Syrian official said.  </P> <P> There was no immediate word on the identity of the hostage, one of two Red  Cross workers kidnaped 10 months ago in Sidon in southern Lebanon.  </P> <P> It was the first breakthrough in the hostage situation since April, when two  American hostages were freed.  </P> <P> A group calling itself the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads had said in a  statement released late Tuesday that it would free the two hostages within 24  hours. It was not known why only one hostage was expected in Damascus.  </P> <P> The statement, delivered to the independent newspaper An-Nahar and a Western  news agency, came with a photograph of captive Emanuel Christen, 33. He  appeared with short hair, a clipped beard and a mustache and looked straight  into the camera.  </P></p>

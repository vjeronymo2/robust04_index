			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japan's benchmark money  supply grew 1.7 percent in May from a year before, slowing down  from a 2.2 percent rise in April, the Bank of japan said Friday  [17 June].    That brought the widely watched measure of money supply --  cash in circulation, time and demand deposits, plus certificates  of deposit (CDs) -- to 518.0 trillion yen, the central bank said  in a preliminary report.    The broad measure of liquidity, including postal savings,  government debts and investment trusts, rose 3.2 percent from a  year before, compared with the 3.3 percent rise in April, the  report said.    The lower key money supply growth in May was a reaction to  the jump from a 0.5 percent year-to-year rise in April last year  to a 1.5 percent yearly gain in May 1993, which was due to  sluggish tax collection under the economic slowdown, said Kengo  Inoue, research and statistics deputy director at the central  bank.    The basic trend of slow growth in money supply remained  unchanged in May and will continue in June, Inoue told reporters.    No factors have emerged that would revise largely either  upward or downward the central bank's forecast for the  April-June quarter of the 1 percent level growth from year  earlier levels, he said.    Within the money supply figures, time and savings deposits  rose 1.1 percent in May from a year before, compared with the  1.2 percent gain in April.    CDs fell for the fifth straight month, declining 18.2  percent  from a year before after the 8.8 percent yearly fall in April.    Inoue attributed the expanding fall in CDs mainly to fewer  issuances by financial institutions as their reserve positions  have improved.    The 18.2 percent year-to-year decline was the biggest since  March 1992, when CDs dropped 19.0 percent from a year earlier,  he said.</p>

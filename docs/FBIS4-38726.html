			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian government will not impose mutual debt  cancellation on factories even though overdue debts have grown  in April in both quantitative and qualitative terms, Deputy  Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said. He told the Federation  Council that this would be inflationary.    According to Shokhin, the budget revenue was eight trillion  rubles short of the target in the first four months of the year.  The debts to banks amounted to 6.5 trillion rubles, to the  suppliers, 23 trillion rubles and to the customers, 28 trillion  rubles in the first quarter of 1994.    Shokhin said that reducing the inflation rate, which has  ranged between eight and nine percent a month, and issue of  treasury bills to pay 800 billion rubles of the state debt to  factories were the priority steps in resolving the debt crisis.    He added that the government would continue centralized  crediting of factories; in particular, the Central Bank had  allocated four trillion rubles for that purpose.    Shokhin promised that the government would follow through on  the procedure of declaring insolvent factories bankrupt. Twelve  factories out of more than 1000 are under close scrutiny the  results of which will be discussed by the government in  mid-June, he said.</p>

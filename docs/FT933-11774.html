			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Ulster scoops bulk of EC grant NORTHERN IRELAND will receive more than half of the nearly Pounds 2bn-worth of European Community funding allotted to help the UK's poorest regions over the next five years. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said in a Commons written answer yesterday that Northern Ireland would receive Pounds 1.04bn, with Pounds 690m going to Merseyside and Pounds 260m to the Highlands and Islands. EC ministers last week decided how to apportion the Community's structural funds between the 12 member states. The UK receives funds for Northern Ireland, Merseyside and the Highlands and Islands because the regional gross domestic product of these regions is 75 per cent or less than the EC average. The government has divided the Pounds 2bn according to population. Although there is no EC check on how the funds are spent, structural fund regulations commit the UK government to spend a sum which is at least 25 per cent of that provided by the EC and which is no less than the amount it has spent over the last five years. The poorest regions are classified 'Objective One' by the EC. A map of regions classified 'Objective Two', because they are suffering from industrial decline and are eligible for other EC structural funding, is being drawn up for publication in the autumn.</p>

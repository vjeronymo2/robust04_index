			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Business leaders call for support from Heseltine INDUSTRIALISTS yesterday called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to end years of alleged ministerial misunderstanding about the needs of British manufacturing industry and to champion its cause at home and abroad. Mr Heseltine was given the message at a meeting with members of the Confederation of British Industry's National Manufacturing Council, set up to promote the manufacturing sector. The session with 50 leading industrialists was his first outside engagement since taking over the department. He was told industry wanted, above all, a champion for business in Whitehall, at Westminster and in Brussels. Those responsible for UK and EC legislation had to be asked to examine its effect on business, in particular in respect of costs. With Mr Heseltine long-pledged to make his department a more powerful advocate of industry's interests throughout government, he will have readily welcomed the CBI's views, although the meeting was primarily billed as an opportunity for him to listen rather than to respond. Since his appointment, Mr Heseltine has not given any public indication of his detailed ambitions for the DTI, but he is due to make his first keynote speech next week. The DTI last night had no comment to make on the talks, which it said formed part of Mr Heseltine's initial dialogue with the business community. The CBI, which was critical of the government's relations with industry under several of Mr Heseltine's predecessors, said it wanted him to stand up for industry inside the Civil Service and government, within the European community and other export markets. The CBI said after the meeting: 'In the past, UK industry has been ill-understood by the DTI and its interests have been subordinated to the interests of more powerful departments like the Treasury. Business needs to be properly represented in the corridors of power.' The CBI said it was very important that the DTI understood the importance of wealth creation and the international competitive pressures on different industrial sectors. It was made clear that industry was not looking to the DTI for subsidies or handouts but it was concerned to ensure that it was not placed at a disadvantage by financial and other forms of assistance given to competitors by other governments. The CBI also called on Mr Heseltine to help improve export promotion and to encourage the development of Training and Enterprise Councils.</p>

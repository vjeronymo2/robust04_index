At the time of  their withdrawal in December, the finger was pointed at ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] for the  looting of the main UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]  base in Lofa. The agencies had been looking after tens of  thousands of Sierra Leonean refugees as well as displaced  Liberians, and although they finally went back last week, it  looks as if they are going to have their work cut out, dealing  with the problem of malnutrition. Our correspondent, Nii  Anartey Allison, is in the Lofa town of Koilahun. He telexed us  this report.    Scores of children are said to be dying every week in this  town. The Koilahun Hospital, the only health center, is without  medical supplies and doctors serving there left when the aid  agencies withdrew last December. Joseph Sipo, the administrator  of the Koilahun Hospital, told me yesterday that kwashiorkor was  widespread among children, and he had seen about 20 cases of  measles in the last week. The most painful incidents, he said,  were the deaths two weeks ago of three pregnant women, who would  have been saved if they had been operated on. During my stay in  Koilahun with the UNHCR chief of mission, residents in Koilahun  said they are barely surviving on roots. Old man Maridorba told  me: If the relief people do not help us, we will all die.    In another development, the ULIMO battalion commander  accused  of masterminding the assault of the UNHCR base camp in Vahun  last December, said yesterday that officers at ULIMO  headquarters in Tubmanburg ordered the raid on the base camp  without his knowledge. Ousmane Kone, better known as Colonel  Pepper and Salt, said: They are putting the blame on me for  what they did. He explained that at the time the UNHCR base  camp was raided, he was busy commanding the boys in the war  against the Lorma Defense Force in Upper Lofa. Pepper and Salt  is seen in ULIMO circles as the most feared of the commanders,  often accused of killing people at will, but he hit back  yesterday, accusing the ULIMO headquarters in Tubmanburg of  harboring murderous commanders.</p>

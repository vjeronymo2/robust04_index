			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS: VONS CUTS LOSSES BY 40%, SALES CLIMB 30%  </P> <P> Vons Cos., apparently successfully coping with the financial fallout from its  acquisition of the Southern California operations of Safeway Stores last year,  reported improved results Tuesday, with third-quarter losses about 40% below  their levels a year ago.  </P> <P> El Monte-based Vons, which acquired 162 Safeway stores in August, 1988, to  merge into its chain of Vons, Pavilions and Tianguis supermarkets in Southern  California, reported a net loss of $5.9 million for the 16-week period ended  Oct. 8, 1989, compared to a net loss of $9.5 million during the third quarter  of 1988.  </P> <P> "We are extremely pleased with our progress in integrating the Safeway  operations," said Roger E. Stangeland, chairman and chief executive of Vons.  "And we anticipate that our performance will continue to improve as we near  completion of the integration project."  </P> <P> Vons, the largest supermarket chain in Southern California with 334 stores,  said sales for the third quarter rose 30% to $1.6 billion. The company also  announced that it had renovated 68 stores and remodeled 22 of its store  facilities. During the first three quarters of 1989, Vons opened five new  stores and closed 21.  </P> <P> Wall Street reacted favorably to Vons' financial news, which was released at  the beginning of trading Tuesday. Vons shares closed at $15, up 62.5 cents on  trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Although supermarket rivals Ralphs Grocery Co. and American Stores Co., which  operates Lucky Stores, are expected to release their quarterly financial  results later this month, analysts on Tuesday were already predicting that Vons  was benefiting more from its own good management than any favorable industry  trends. As a result, many analysts expect Vons to continue to capitalize on its  acquisition of the 162 Safeway stores.  </P> <P> "The big payoff will come in the next few quarters in terms of accelerating  results," said Gary M. Giblen, a vice president of Paine Webber. "It's no  longer a question of 'if' but 'when,' " he said. "Vons made one of the most  dramatic moves in the history of retailing by doubling their store base with  the purchase of (Southern California) Safeway. Now they are reaping the  benefits."  </P> <P> Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles-based food and beverage  industry consultant, was equally optimistic.  </P> <P> "We've watched Vons consolidate a lot of their gains and become stronger," he  said. "Basically these results show they are over the hurdle." JUBE SHIVER Jr.  </P></p>

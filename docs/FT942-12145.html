			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (3): Collectors' items - The rebound of the wristwatch Last autumn Patek Philippe, a leading Swiss watch house, issued a collectors' watch on classic lines. The watch was to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the appointment of Garrard's, of London, as crown jewellers and was available only through Garrard's. It was limited to 150 pieces in rose gold with a rose gold dial and the glazed back revealing the self-winding movement with engraved pivoted rotor weight. Priced at just under Pounds 8,000, it sold out in under two months, providing confirmation, if any were needed, of the health of the retail wristwatch market, especially for watches with collector appeal. Serious collecting of wristwatches is still a comparatively new phenomenon. A little history puts this in context. Having started out in the mid-1800s as women's bangles, with a timepiece concealed behind a hinged cover, wristwatches were originally considered effeminate. But during the first world war, the prejudice was overcome by the convenience of wearing a watch on the wrist, rather than carrying it in a pocket. The spread of the car sealed the popularity of wristwatches for men and there was even a model developed - the Driver's watch - that curved to fit the wrist so that time could be read with both hands on the steering wheel. Initially, most people owned just one watch, acquired at some significant moment such as a 21st birthday, and it was the best that could be afforded. Of course it had to be Swiss. When the quartz watch arrived in 1975 it was dismissed by the Swiss watch houses as beneath them. Cheap quartz watches, made in vast quantities, especially in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, soon grabbed a sizeable slice of the world market and the Swiss watch industry was heading into crisis. It is said that 60 per cent of the Swiss watch labour force was laid off for good. But the very cheapness and impersonal, mass-produced nature of these early quartz watches - mostly digital - bred a reaction in the buying public. By 1980, analogue dials with conventional faces and rotating hands were again heavily in demand. Although a ready source of traditional watches was found in the rapidly expanding secondhand market, the Swiss watch houses responded by going either down or upmarket. Marques such as Accurist, Avia, Rotary, Tissot and Longines embraced quartz in order to produce a reasonably cheap analogue watch. Others, such as the big five - Patek Philippe, Rolex, Vacheron Constantin, Audemars Piguet, Jaeger-LeCoultre and IWC - stayed upmarket. They also dug into their history and put back into production some more complicated classic models that had started to command high prices in the secondhand auction market. There are still two markets and retail sales have remained remarkably buoyant. The focus is on highly complicated pieces with multifarious features such as perpetual calendars allowing for leap years and minute repeating actions. These are long in the making and cannot keep up with demand. At the Basle fair this month there was great interest in new models from retailers encouraged by sales increases. At auction, comparisons can be made with the top of the market in 1990. Prices fell by between 25 and 30 per cent across the board. Some fared even worse: Tina Millar, of Sotheby's, quotes the example of a typical chronograph (zeroing stopwatch) that would have made Pounds 18,000-Pounds 20,000 then but now commands only Pounds 8,000-Pounds 10,000, even though the market bottomed out towards the end of 1992, around Black Monday. Again, world time-indicating wristwatches, by Patek, now routinely make Pounds 25,000-Pounds 30,000 as opposed to Pounds 70,000-Pounds 80,000 in 1989/90. Undoubtedly, in the late 1980s, speculators were active in the market. Since then greater sense has prevailed. Sellers are accepting more conservative pre-sale estimates, even at Antiquorum's Geneva sales. London auctioneers can now boast high success rates - only 7 per cent unsold in Sotheby's March sale, while Christie's sale, also last month, was not too far behind at 14 per cent unsold. Discernment, rather than investment, is the by-word in the current market. Thus Simon Bull, formerly of Antiquorum, talks of a buyer who spent SFr400,000 on a split-action chronograph by Patek - rare because of its steel case, whereas Millar cannot see the rare platinum (one of only three) calendar, moon-phase watch making as much today as the Pounds 280,000 it sold for in 1990 in London. One section of the auction market that has dwindled to nothing is collectable Swatches. While producers of low-production models such as the Sun King, Swatch 1993 Christmas specials (only 1,300 were allocated to the UK market) can see queues on launch day, none of the auction houses are selling second-hand Swatches any longer. This was a speculative market and has proved a flash in the pan. Auctioneers trumpet sales statistics, but retailers are more discreet. While far eastern buyers took up 14.28 per cent of the March watch sale at Christie's, the east Pacific rim accounts for a significant slice of the retail market, supplanting the Italian domination of the 1980s. Rolex is the volume seller, Audemars and Patek and other complicated watches are widely collected. Customers in the far east are highly brand-conscious, but taste is by no means uniform. Quartz watches are more popular than mechanical ones because resetting complicated calendar watches is easier. Taiwan and Singapore collectors, while appreciating complicated watches, concentrate just as much on their decorative appeal, akin to the Arab taste of 10 years ago. There can be resistance to 'used' property in Moslem communities. The Japanese are famous for shopping around before buying. Their view is long-term - and speculation in a 'watch market' seems a western preoccupation. The inclusion of one of the Garrard's / Patek watches in a London sale will soon show whether there are still occasional quick profits to be made, now that on-sale premiums for rarer Rolex models, such as Daytonas, have all but gone. The pre-sale estimate of up to Pounds 6,000 may prove encouragingly conservative, considering that the previous Patek special limited edition watch, the Officier of 1989, repeatedly resells at way over its original offer price, and more than 2,000 of them were issued.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Caterpillar digs in for bruising fight: Four months on strike may earn the UAW no more than a Pyrrhic victory THE three-month labour dispute between Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, and the powerful United Auto Workers union is becoming more and more bruising. After last week's failure to restart negotiations, the company and the union have dug in for a protracted battle which observers believe will produce no real winners. Bets are that the dispute could rival the seven-month strike of 1982-1983, the longest in UAW history. The union, which in early November sent out on strike only 2,400 workers, last week sent out a further 8,400, bringing the total to two-thirds of its members at Caterpillar. This included the 5,650 workers whom the company had locked out as a retaliatory step in November but had recalled nine days ago. The union is determined to win a pattern contract agreement from Caterpillar comparable with the one that it agreed last year with Deere &amp; Co, another heavy equipment manufacturer. Pattern agreements, which are designed to establish contract patterns throughout an industry, are the heart and soul of the UAW's strength, particularly in relation to the big US car makers. The three-year Deere agreement, which is broadly in line with the UAW's auto company contracts, includes a 3 per cent general wage increase in the first year, 3 per cent lump sum bonuses in the second and third years and job security and benefits provisions wanted by the union. Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Illinois, says it must have an agreement that will allow it to continue to be internationally competitive. Last year, sales outside the US accounted for Dollars 5.8bn, or 59 per cent, of the company's Dollars 9.84bn total. It says a pattern agreement would undercut its long-term viability. The company, which lost Dollars 404m in 1991, claims that the strike did not have a significant effect on last year's results but says the dispute is 'seriously clouding the outlook' for this year. A first-quarter loss is now expected, and, as the spring construction season arrives, the company may face difficulties in meeting orders despite having built up several months of inventory before the strike. The company vows 'to do whatever it takes to keep customers from buying competitors' products,' and speculation has grown that, if a settlement is not reached soon, the company may try to employ non-union replacement workers. This has been fueled by Caterpillar's recent engagement of Vance International, the private security firm known for its tough tactics in in recent years involving companies' attempts to break their unions. Caterpillar says that it hired Vance after receiving threats, and that it had to take 'steps to protect its people and property.' Security analysts take a dim view of the possibility of the hiring of replacement workers. 'If they do that, you'll have a war in Peoria,' said Mr Tobias Levkovich, a security analyst with Smith Barney Upham. Labour experts say Caterpillar management is more likely eventually to concede a pattern agreement and then quietly move as many jobs as possible, either overseas or to non-union US plants, giving the UAW a Pyrrhic victory. The union, however, cannot afford to flinch: if a Caterpillar precedent is set that breaks the tradition of pattern agreements, it could face a demand from the car makers to re-open negotiations and thereby risk having its power undermined. Moreover, this is a delicate time for the UAW leadership, which faces re-election in June at the union's triennial convention. It will not want to serve up to its members a defeat in Peoria and bleak prospects in the nation's car-making capital of Detroit. In an attempt to demonstrate union might and solidarity, the UAW leadership has called on its own members and those of other unions to march in Peoria on March 22. The UAW will be hoping that the march will not prove to be its last big stand. The Caterpillar-UAW dispute is spilling over ominously into the economy of Illinois, where the company has its largest operations. The length of the strike will be a significant element in determining when the state can emerge from recession, according to Ms Diane Swonk, First Chicago's economist for the Midwest region. She calculates that as many as 7,000 of the 17,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the state last year were related to the strike.</p>

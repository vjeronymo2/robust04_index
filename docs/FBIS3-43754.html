			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Boer Army Being Established"] </F>   [Text] Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, Conservative Party [CP]  leader and Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front]  co- chairman, told PATRIOT this week that the national army  being assembled countrywide will be the defense force for a new  Afrikaner People's Republic. Dr. Hartzenberg was reacting to  the announcement that the Transitional Executive Council [TEC],  which is not recognized by the CP and the AVF, took the first  step this week to establish a communist-controlled National  Peace-keeping Force as a "single" defense force for all of South  Africa. He said that the Afrikaner People's Republic, in the  process of being established, would have to appoint its own  security services. This means its own national army, its own  police force, as well as other necessary security services which  will be responsible for safeguarding the people's republic. The  people's republic will have its own civil service, tax system,  and control structures. There is no way key state departments  of the people's republic will be entrusted to a future ANC  [African National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party]  government.  <H5>  Freedom at All Costs </H5>   Dr. Hartzenberg emphasized that the Afrikaner people will  get  its freedom and will not be suppressed by any other nation or  group. "If the people do not get their independence before 27  April, then the independence process for the Afrikaners and  other patriots who align themselves with the internationally  accepted principle of self-determination for nations and for the  Boer-Afrikaners, will have to be quickly realized."  <H5>  Effective Steps </H5>   PATRIOT has been informed that definite steps have been  taken  over the past week to bring about an Afrikaner People's  Republic. The enemy of the Boer Afrikaner people, still denying  them their right to self-determination, will have to decide if  they want lasting peace with the "peaceful Boer nation" or if  they want to engage in a struggle. If they choose the struggle,  then they will have to deal with probably the most formidable  freedom fighters in the world. In other words, the atheists and  communists who are going to get South Africa served on a tray on  27 April by the outgoing National Party, should urgently decide  if they want to give the Afrikaner people their right to  self-determination in its own people's republic before the 27  April, and thus allow the election to proceed peacefully, or if  they want to make South Africa the venue for the world's most  dangerous freedom struggle. If the enemy of the Afrikaner  people should choose a struggle, then they will find that they  have chosen the most difficult opponent imaginable.  <H5>  Warning </H5>   Dr. Willie Snyman, the CP's spokesman on defense, has issued  an urgent warning to all white members of the SADF [South  African Defense Force] and the SAP [South African Police] to  decide now if they want to join the Afrikaner people's army or  whether they want to serve the communist-controlled atheistic  Azanian government who will control part of the country on 27  April. He says that the Boer Afrikaner people are irrevocably  committed to freedom and a government in its own fatherland, and  to the complete service of God in that territory.  <H5>  Unpractical </H5>   General Constand Viljoen, chairman of the Directorate of  Generals of the AVF, says that the AVF has always regarded the  TEC structures as redundant and as a waste of money. The  command structures of the SADF and the SAP should not be touched  because these organizations are the only ones standing between  anarchy and a manageable stability in the country. General  Viljoen says that the TEC's peace-keeping force is merely a  "political necessity." The force, consisting of 3,000 members,  equipped with special uniforms and vehicles, still has to be  approved and trained. It takes approximately 75 days to  assemble and train such a force, at great expense. Without any  practical experience and with only 3,000 members it is too small  to really exercise any influence, according to General Viljoen.</p>

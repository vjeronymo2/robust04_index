			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / LSE poised to alter rules on disclosure THE London Stock Exchange is poised to drop its requirement that market makers publish details of large trades, reversing a move to greater transparency taken a year ago. However, the exchange's board is also due on Thursday to approve stricter disclosure requirements for trading in overseas stocks on London's successful SEAQ International. The decisions will re-open the dispute over disclosure in the London market. One large trader said the SEAQ decision could drive business abroad. Market makers claim too much visibility alerts others to their positions, exposing them to loss. In the past, however, the Securities and Investments Board and the Office of Fair Trading have pushed for greater rather than less, disclosure. Publication of trades has also become the central issue in the row in the European Community over the proposed Investment Services Directive. At Thursday's meeting, the exchange's board will consider three important changes to London trading: Details of large trades, which have to be published within 90 minutes, will no longer be disclosed. Instead, an hourly indication of trading volumes will be published on the exchange's 'ticker'. The next day, the range of prices at which each stock was traded will be disclosed. The SIB and OFT are thought to be more sympathetic to the exchange's plans than three years ago, when a switch to delayed trade publication prompted criticisms that London was returning to its pre-Big Bang 'jobbers' cartel'. Identical rules will be adopted for SEAQ. At present, the only information published is the total daily trading volume in each stock, disclosed the next day. Bringing the UK and international markets together is part of the exchange's strategy to create a European market in London. Arrangements will be introduced to protect private shareholders, who otherwise would suffer from the lower visibility. The exchange plans to introduce a central 'limit order book' on which investors can lodge prices at which they want to buy and sell stocks. When a large trade passes through the market at a better price, individual investors' orders will be given priority and completed automatically. A similar arrangement operates in New York and Paris.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STRUIKSMA HAS CHALLENGER IN COUNCIL RACE  </P> <P> Echoing the words of President Bush's inaugural address, lawyer Mike Eckmann  announced Wednesday that he plans to oppose San Diego City Councilman Ed  Struiksma in this fall's 5th District race.  </P> <P> Calling for a "kinder and gentler philosophy at City Hall," Eckmann said he  would bring a more balanced approach to land-use decisions and other issues  than Struiksma, whom he described as "unquestionably the most pro-growth  member" of the council.  </P> <P> "The incumbent's eight years of special-interest considerations have resulted  in community confusion, confrontation, divisiveness and citizen initiatives and  referendums," Eckmann said. "We need new, enlightened leadership so that more  citizen land-use initiatives and referendums will not be necessary."  </P> <P> Eckmann is former head of Mayor Maureen O'Connor's open space task force and a  former city budget official who, in addition to his legal career, has worked  part time for the county planning department since 1980. The father of two,  Eckmann, 44, and his wife live in Scripps Ranch.  </P> <P> The 5th District, which Struiksma has represented since 1981, covers  northeastern San Diego.  </P></p>

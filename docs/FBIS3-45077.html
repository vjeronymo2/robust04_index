The total  amount of the middle and primary school teachers' wages in  arrears across the country dropped to 309 million yuan at the  end of 1993 from 1.43 billion yuan in September 1993. The State  Education Commission has called on all localities to pay more  attention to solving the problem and pay all the arrears before  the Spring Festival.    According to reports from various localities, teachers'  wages  have never been in arrears in Beijing Municipality and Tibet  Region; 17 provinces municipalities, and autonomous regions --  Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Gansu, Yunnan, Jilin, Sichuan,  Qinghai, Hainan, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Guangxi,  Jiangsu, Guizhou, Shandong, and Ningxia -- have paid or  basically paid the teachers' wages in arrears; and arrears of  teachers' wages still exist to a varying degree in 10 provinces.  The arrears exceed 10 million yuan in Henan, Hubei, Anhui,  Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Fujian. Henan  Province owes the most -- 120 million yuan.    The spokesman said: The party Central Committee and the  State Council are deeply concerned about the middle and primary  school teachers' wages in arrears and attach great importance to  the problem. At the national rural work conference held in  October last year, Premier Li Peng pointed out that it is  impermissible to owe arrears of teachers' wages, and he called  on all localities to take effective measures to solve the  problem. Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, has  successively written the governors or party committee  secretaries of Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Hubei, Henan,  Hunan, Jiangsu, and Sichuan to speed up the solution to the  problem. The party committees and people's governments of  various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have  made great efforts to pay the arrears of teachers' wages,  despite financial difficulties. The principal party and  government leaders of many provinces are personally taking a  hand in the matter. They have instructed that wherever the  teachers' wages are in arrears, the wages of government office  cadres should also be withheld; and that if the arrears of  teachers' wages are caused by diversion of budget fund to  building unauthorized projects or buying automobiles, such  diversion must be resolutely stopped. Henan Province owes more  than 100 million yuan in arrears of teachers' wages. In  addition to adopting other measures, the provincial government  appropriated a special funding of 43 million yuan in late  December last year. Moreover, the eighth session of the fifth  provincial party committee has made some arrangements and  demanded that all necessary measures be taken to open up sources  of funds so as to pay all the teachers' wages in arrears.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Orobets, candidate in technical </F> sciences, by Roman [Kulchynskyy]: "Expert Opinion: `Despite  Difficulties with Energy Sources, Gasoline Remains Ukraine's  Main Export'"]    [Text] Gasoline is in short supply, there are  shortages of electric power, trains and buses are cancelled,  apartments are freezing and television broadcasts only in the  evening: we are in the midst of an energy crisis. The  nomenklatura blames it on the "disruption of ties" and "collapse  of the Union". To explain the true causes of the severe crisis  and how it could be solved we invited Yuriy Orobets, candidate  in technical sciences and a specialist in managing the energy  industry.    [Orobets] Our country is not particularly poor in energy  sources. Coal deposits alone, even if worked intensively, could  satisfy Ukrainian demand for more than two centuries. However,  conditions in the coal industry as a whole do not meet current  requirements. Twelve 12 percent of mines are older than 50  years, while 60 percent have not been overhauled for the past 30  years. These factors negatively impact on the production of  fuel. Substantial investment is also required to modernize the  industry.    The outlook is good also for brown coal deposits in the  Dnieper basin. Especially since coal can be mined there the  cheapest way: in open pits. Experts estimate that brown coal  could yield 600,000 tonnes of cheap gasoline per year.    The situation is difficult in the oil and gas industry. The  peak of its development in the Carpathian region and eastern  oblasts is long past, and Ukraine supplies only 9 percent of its  oil demand and 22 percent of its gas needs. It was the discovery  of rich deposits in Siberia and Central Asia that lead to the  contraction of exploration and development works here. Another  negative factor was our ground yield coefficient for oil, which  is low (but, nonetheless, twice as high as in the U.S., where  geological conditions are similar.)    [Kulchynskyy] What is the cause of the energy crisis in  Ukraine?    [Orobets] Supply and demand for energy have developed over  the past 30 years without regard for world prices, which have  the decisive impact on the development of energy producing and  processing operations. This has caused an energy crisis not only  in Ukraine and other new countries, but in Russia itself.    The discovery of rich deposits of oil and gas in Siberia led  to the intensive production of light products, such as gasoline,  kerosine and diesel fuel, and a huge quantity of heavy fuels.  Moreover, low yields from refining were tolerated. Ukrainian  refineries get only 40 percent of light fuels from processed  crude, whereas US refineries get up to 70 percent.    The existence of rich deposits of inexpensive natural gas  allowed us to bring gas to most cities and towns, and to use it  widely in industry. The low prices on oil and natural gas were  based on costs, and not set to match world prices. This  principle resulted in the construction of a large number of  cheap but wasteful energy using systems.    Unfortunately, delivery of oil and gas to Ukraine is being  used by Russia to apply pressure in solving political problems.  At the same time, Russia itself is experiencing a profound  crisis of oil production. Output has declined by 40 percent.  Therefore, from every point of view, Ukraine must find a general  solution for other sources of energy.    [Kulchynskyy] What is the outlook for the development of  hydroelectric and nuclear power?    [Orobets] Ukraine has resources to develop nuclear power,  but  the entire processing plant of the nuclear power industry is  based in Russia.    As to hydroelectric power, our low-lying country with  slow-flowing rivers would limit the development of this type of  energy. This is why hydroelectric plants produce only 4 percent  of power while their reservoirs take up hundreds of hectares of  some of the richest black soil in the world.    [Kulchynskyy] Recently, in this country and the world over,  the idea of using alternative sources has become popular.    [Orobets] The most realistic sources of alternative energy  are, in practice, the energy of the sun, the wind, sea waves and  photosynthesis. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to tap  solar and wind energy. From the practical point of view, it is  necessary to know exactly how much capacity must be in reserve  for the period when there is no sun or when it goes behind  clouds, or when there is no wind, and how long it will last.  Taking into account these details, as well as the great  expenditures required for the mass production of generating  equipment, commercial production of this "free" energy turns out  to be considerably more expensive than traditional sources.  Along with wind-driven generators, the most promising is  research in the production of fuel using photochemical and  photobiological processes. Also, sun batteries can be used  effectively. By the way, Ukraine produces and profitably exports  them. Using alternative sources, the problem of supplying energy  to some remote sites can be easily resolved.    [Kulchynskyy] In your opinion, can the energy crisis be  overcome, or at least mitigated, using domestic capabilities?    [Orobets] Of course. To do this, we must first of all  reorganize import and export of petroleum products. Despite  difficulties with energy sources, gasoline remains Ukraine's  main export. The theft of national property must be decisively  stopped. Moreover, for various reasons, energy is used very  ineffectively. Measures to save energy can be divided into two  categories. The first category consists of organizational  measures, which entail the introduction of strict discipline and  order in industry. The second category is the development of  technical measures to reduce energy intensity in industry. The  first category of measures can be implemented very rapidly.  Moreover, privatization would accelerate this process. This can  save 5-to-7 percent of electric power and 10-to-15 percent of  energy used for heating. The implementation of the second  category of measures will bring results that are 2-to-3 times  greater, but here, major investment and considerable  reconstruction will be required.    Ukraine is building an oil terminal near Odessa, the first  line of which will begin operation in October of this year. We  must also explore the possibility of bringing in oil through  Baltic ports, using the pipeline system in Belarus. In the  future, we could export light fuels produced by the excess  capacity of our refineries. For this, however, investments are  necessary to raise yields. It is extremely important to reduce  the use of gas and heavy fuels in producing electric power. The  necessary condition for this is to modernize our coal-burning  plants, first of all by installing boilers using nontraditional  methods to burn solid fuels with a high soot content. But  Ukraine produces no such boilers.    [Kulchynskyy] What would you like to see happen in the  industry?    [Orobets] To rebalance our fuel and energy complex will  require much work and, as you have already seen, considerable  investment. To attract it, we need a strong government comprised  of specialists and reformers whose deeds would not differ from  their words.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Bezveselnyy: "Belarus and NATO: Options </F> for Cooperation"]    [Text] As part of his trip to Belarus, Field Marshall  Richard Frederick Vincent, chairman of the NATO Military  Committee, met with Colonel-General Kozlovskiy, Belarusian  defense minister. The negotiations were devoted to the issues  of continuously developing contacts between the Belarusian Armed  Forces and the North Atlantic bloc and the exchange of  experience in reforming the Army and arms reduction.    During talks between both military officials, substantial  attention was attached to determining their positions regarding  the possibility of Belarus joining the "Partnership for Peace"  initiative. Incidentally, this issue was also brought up during  the recent visit of U.S. President Clinton in Minsk and in  negotiations with the leadership of our Republic. Mr. Vincent  shared his views on the development of cooperation among  European countries to achieve guarantees of their sovereignty  and territorial integrity.    Regarding this, there was particular interest in  understanding the positions on the intention of our Republic to  become a neutral state and to completely remove nuclear weapons  from the Belarusian territory, as well as possible forms of  bilateral cooperation in the military sphere [sentence as  published]. It is believed that this may have an impact on a  future visit of a group of NATO military inspectors to examine  Belarusian participation in the "Partnership for Peace."    Toward the end of the meeting, Field Marshall Richard  Vincent  noted that the North Atlantic Bloc knows very well and respects  the Republic's foreign policies directed at entirely giving up  its nuclear arsenals. As a result, this evokes the bloc's  sincere desire to help Belarus, especially in the sphere of  conventional weapons.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Competition may hit Mercury Mercury, the main rival to British Telecommunications, is being 'squeezed from all sides' and is set for only modest growth in the next few years, according to a broker's survey of 100 large business users. The survey, by James Capel, finds that after six years of rapid growth at the expense of BT in the large corporate sector, Mercury has now reached a plateau in terms of the spending intentions of companies. The 100 companies, representing about 10 per cent of the large corporate market by value, are at the heart of Mercury's existing bus iness. Their average telecoms spending is projected at more than Pounds 3m this year, with Mercury expected to take a 22 per cent share, far ahead of the 13 per cent it is estimated to have of the total UK telecoms market. The companies surveyed were strongly attracted to new telecoms operators such as Worldcom, MFS and Sprint, licensed since the abolition of the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, which are focusing on the large business sector. A year ago, only 14 per cent of the companies used telecoms carriers other than BT and Mercury. This year 28 per cent do so, with a further 18 per cent claiming to be very or quite likely to use another carrier. Nearly 80 per cent of the companies claimed to be Mercury users, Mercury's highest rate to date, with another 10 per likely to subscribe. But four in five existing users said they used Mercury mainly for cost savings, against only 10 per cent naming quality, suggesting that its market is highly vulnerable to competition. 'Competition is squeezing Mercury from all sides', said Mr Martin Mabbutt, telecoms analyst at James Capel. 'The growth of new operators in the business sectors is eroding margins in its areas of historic strength.' He added: 'Over the next few years the company seems set to pay the price for a low level of penetration of the residential market.' In spite of rapid progress in the past year, Mercury has only about 1m residential customers, against BT's 20m. A large proportion of these users are connected through local cable operators, many of whom are prepared to switch their long-distance traffic to other carriers if they can get a better price. Mercury has responded with initiatives to improve its network quality and its access to residential customers. A Pounds 200m upgrading of its national network is under way, and it is experimenting with radio technology as a means of by-passing BT and cable operators at the local level. However, some analysts see other recent moves as evidence of its predicament. It is engaged in an acrimonious battle with Oftel, the industry regulator, to secure a more favourable regulatory regime. It also began negotiations with AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, for an alliance, but drew back at a late stage.</p>

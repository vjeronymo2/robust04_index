			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Bush fails to take brakes off campaign PRESIDENT George Bush's hopes of kicking his re-election campaign back into gear at the weekend seem to have been frustrated on at least four counts, negating the impact of his whistle-stop train swing through the important mid-western states of Ohio and Michigan. Fresh accusations of his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair have been made by a former White House aide, Mr Howard Teicher, who said he briefed the then vice-president three times in the middle of 1986 about the 'operational details' of the arms-for-hostages clandestine scheme. Mr Bush has insisted he knew none of the details until December. Yesterday he said he had been 'totally forthcoming' about his role and suggested the issue was being used to counter controversy about the draft record of Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. Second, attention has been diverted to Dallas and to today's national television, where Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, may announce whether he is entering the race. Signs from the Perot camp were hopelessly conflicting over the weekend, but delegations from both the Bush and Clinton campaigns are to address a meeting of his volunteers in Dallas. Third, national and local public opinion polls suggest Governor Clinton is consolidating his double digit lead. A Time-CNN survey at the weekend had him 12 points ahead, double the margin of earlier this month. Positing a Perot candidacy still left Mr Clinton 11 points up, while other polls also show Mr Perot's stature much diminished. An ABC survey found Mr Clinton ahead in 30 states, with 346 electoral college votes, and Mr Bush up in only 10, with 110 votes, with the balance undecided. A total of 270 votes is needed to win. Finally, Mr Bush was possibly embarrassed by the resignation from his cabinet of Mr Edward Derwinski, the secretary for veterans' affairs. Mr Derwinski was unpopular with the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the ex-servicemen's association which had endorsed Mr Bush early in 1988 and which may have made the departure of the secretary contingent on backing this year. Mr Bush's weekend message was that Mr Clinton would worsen the problems of the middle class by higher taxation. His campaign claims Mr Clinton's plan to increase taxes on the top 2 per cent (a couple earning Dollars 200,000 a year and more) would be insufficient to help raise his targeted Dollars 150bn in new revenues. He would need to hit the top 8 per cent, earning Dollars 60,000 plus a year, according to the Republicans. Mr Clinton, in New England, countered by saying that Mr Bush 'has no credibility on taxes, everything he says is wrong.' He contrasted the fact that he had a plan, compiled with numbers from the Congressional Budget Office, whereas the president 'just raises taxes on everybody.' There was no breakthrough on the stalemate over the presidential televised debates. The next one on the schedule, next Sunday in San Diego, now looks at severe risk. There is even speculation now that for the first time since 1972 there may be none at all.</p>

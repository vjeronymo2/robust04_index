			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE KLEIN: WHAT IN THE WORLD IS ALL THE HUBBLE HUBBUB ABOUT?  </P> <P> HUBBA-HUBBA: Uh . . . So this is it, huh? The Hubble Space Telescope snaps a  picture of a fuzzy space dot  </P> <P> not to be confused with slightly more fuzzy dot shot from earth -- and NASA  astronomers go into orbit. "It's quite an image-fantastic," says a Hubble  honcho. "We are just pleased as punch at this point." Gee, me too. Except for  $1.5 billion, you'd think it would come with double prints.  </P> <P> TEEN-AGE MUTANT MEDFLIES: The first of the sterile Mediterranean fruit flies is  buzzing around Orange County. Agriculture officials have dyed them pink,  undoubtedly after years of research about what really turns flies on. I'm not  sure about the details, but as I understand it, the plan calls for the  deceptively sexual steriles to lure the fertiles into an amorous embrace and  voila! Safe sex whether they like it or not.  </P> <P> This is progressive thinking. Now if only the governor could think as  creatively about financing family planning clinics.  </P> <P> BUT MOMMY, IT'S ONLY PRETEND: Sixteen-year-old Ariel defies father, runs away  from home, is snookered in business deal, brings bodily harm to father, but  it's all worth it because she eventually gets her guy. Check it out: "The  Little Mermaid," now a Disney sensation in video.  </P> <P> SNAKES, BUT NO SNAKES: Mike Courtney, who lives in Orange, thinks the City  Council should let him keep B.C., his 10-foot boa constrictor, at home. Seems  B.C. has grown longer than a city ordinance allows. Courtney argues that if the  council relaxes its ordinance, other snake owners would "come out of the  woodwork" instead of harboring their snakes illegally.  </P> <P> Hissss. No offense intended, Mike, but I'd just as soon all those snakes stayed  in the woodwork. Or under a rock, in the desert, where even a developer dare  not tread. Or in a jungle, far far away, beyond the travel itinerary of even  the most intrepid yuppie vacationer.  </P> <P> ONE FOR THE BIRDS: And speaking of Orange . . . the City Council recently voted  to lift restrictions on the number of pet birds residents may keep. This is  thanks to Lou and Delores Palush, whom I wrote about months ago. Makes me want  to crow.  </P> <P> THE SHOCKING S-WORD: If another radio or TV announcer tells me that we're in  for a day of hazy sunshine around the Southland, I'll scream. Smog. Just say  it. That's what it is.  </P> <P> AND THE TWAIN SHALL PEAK: So maybe tonight we'll find out who killed coke head,  gal-about-town and all-around beautiful person Laura Palmer on the season  finale of Twin Peaks. Or will we? Or is Laura really dead? It could all be a  dream, you know. Laura could really be Arnold Palmer's daughter, hit with a  golf ball on the driving range and knocked unconscious, a la Newhart. Twin  Peaks may be Munchkin Land, or Hooterville. Or it could be a cast hallucination  brought on by a sugar overdose.  </P> <P> I know, of course. Agent Cooper's been telling me everything, on tape, from the  start. But don't think I'm going to ruin the surprise now.  </P> <P> AD INFINITUM: The sea . . . shoosh. The gulls . . . caw, caw. The fog moves in,  heavy, fecund with its white silence. The Zen of advertising. We were supposed  to know that it was a car they were selling, the Infiniti. Well now the car  company has a new ad. It, too, goes on and on and on. We see a car, presumably  the Infiniti, going up a street and down a street. Up, down, up, down. The  announcer even says that. It's annoying, it's repetitive, it's boring . . . ah,  yes, Zen master. It's what infinity is all about.  </P> <P> GET THOSE EXCUSES IN ORDER: About 15 sea lions have washed up on Orange County  shores over the past two weeks. Not to worry, says a biologist with the  National Marine Fisheries Service. "If it keeps building to, let's say, about  50 in two weeks," he goes on, "then we can say it's because of some commercial  fishing." Beyond that, it's anyone's guess. Gang warfare at sea? Mass suicide  sparked by word of a Sea World roundup?  </P> <P> THE DEVIL RAISED THE RENT: The Rev. Robert H. Schuller is putting out the word  to the faithful to hand over $3.2 million so he can keep his "Hour of Power" on  the air. Here's a radical idea. How about donating the same amount to charity  for a better return on your money?  </P> <P>  Dianne Klein's column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Readers may reach  Klein by writing to her at The Times Orange County Edition, 1375 Sunflower  Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626, or calling (714) 966-7406.  </P> <P> </P></p>

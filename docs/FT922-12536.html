			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Champagne nettled by Britain's small beer FRANCE'S fiercely protective champagne producers yesterday blocked an assault on the integrity of their famous name by an Olde English cordial marketed as 'elderflower champagne'. Justice Robert Reid ruled in the High Court in London that the Surrey-based soft drink maker should print no more labels that included the word 'champagne', pending final resolution of a complaint from Taittinger, champagne maker, and the French industry. Mr Guy Woodall, an owner of the Thorncroft Vineyard partnership that distributes the drink, said he was confident the French would lose their case which claims he is damaging the region's famous reputation. 'We think it wrong that a perfectly well-known name should be legislated out of the English language because of the monopolistic interests of French wine growers,' Mr Woodall said. He said elderflower champagne and other traditional 'small beers', such as barley water and ginger ale, have been around since the Middle Ages, when people tried to avoid contamination by boiling water, flavouring it with herbs, dandelions or nettles, and fermenting it lightly. Mr Woodall said he had taken an old recipe for elderflower champagne, removed the alcohol and used carbonated water. The controversy began last November, when the drink began to be sold in bottles with wired champagne-style corks. The drink is mainly sold through health food shops, and has a reputation for 'clearing the system' and warding off flu. But with sales of only 100,000 bottles since November, it is hardly a threat to the grandes marques champagne houses from the exclusive 85,000 acre region north-east of Paris, which has been producing champagne since Roman times. The champagne industry, however, jealously guards its name. It has successfully prevented a company on Spain's Costa Brava from passing off its sparkling wine as champagne, and Babycham no longer uses the term 'the champagne perry' for its pear-based drink. From 1993 the EC is banning the description of methode champenoise on all but labels of champagne. The French have not, however, managed to extend their influence to North America where New York and Canadian 'champagnes' are available.</p>

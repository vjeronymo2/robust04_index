			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Warning on RAF bases MR TOM KING, the defence secretary, yesterday warned voters in north-east Scotland that the two RAF bases in the area would ultimately close if Scotland became independent under the Scottish National party. The two bases, Lossiemouth and Kinloss, are in the Moray constituency where Mrs Margaret Ewing, the SNP's parliamentary leader, is defending the seat. Between them the bases employ about 5,000 military and civilian personnel and are an important source of secondary employment.</p>

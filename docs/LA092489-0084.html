			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE:: EILEEN FARRELL SINGS HAROLD ARLEN. REFERENCE RECORDINGS, RR30CD  (COMPACT DISC).  </P> <P> Recorded a year ago when she was 69, this disc of superb Arlen songs represents  a comeback of sorts for soprano Farrell, who always had an interest in pop  music. She was more successful than most classical singers in attempting to  cross the line, yet her work has a slickness and sameness that is ultimately  unconvincing. Here, she is at her best in the bouncy material such as "Let's  Fall in Love," hopelessly out of her element in "A Woman's Prerogative," not to  mention a passionless "Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe." In addition,  there is a lot of flat singing, which may or may not be an intentional  mannerism. Loonis McGlohon's arrangements suit the occasion. Walter Price  </P></p>

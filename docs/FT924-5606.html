			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Turkey leads call for UN forces deployment in Kosovo TURKEY together with eight Balkan countries yesterday urged the United Nations to consider the deployment of forces in the Serbian province of Kosovo, where violence has raised fears that this ethnically Albanian region could become the next flashpoint in the worsening Yugoslav conflict. A joint declaration issued at the end of a one-day conference in Istanbul agreed to set up a consultative body, in an effort to prevent the Yugoslav crisis dragging in regional powers. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, on Tuesday agreed to send 'a dozen military, political and civilian personnel on an exploratory mission' to Macedonia, after which he will seek the Security Council's authority for a larger force. The immediate mandate is to visit Macedonia's border areas with Albania and Serbia. Foreign ministers called for rapid deployment of UN observers on the border of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and urged the UN Security Council to 'examine the possibility of deploying forces in Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandjak to contain the 'explosive situation.' Ankara believes it is now in a position to urge moderation at the December 2 meeting of the 47-member Organisation of Islamic Conference countries, which has become impatient at the failure of the UN and EC to stem Serb attacks on Bosnian Moslems. Turkey said it would seek Arab funds for a bigger UN peacekeeping role. Yesterday's statement also called for the setting up of 'militarily protected safe areas in Bosnia Hercegovina.' Kerin Hope adds from Athens: Greece has partially lifted its oil embargo on Macedonia by permitting the shipment of 20,000 tonnes of crude to the former Yugoslav republic in what the Greek government claimed was a humanitarian gesture. However, the timing of the oil shipment suggests that the Greek government is mainly concerned with appeasing its EC partners, who are anxious to see the embargo against Skopje lifted ahead of the Edinburgh summit. Lord Owen, co-chairman of the peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, said the EC must decide at the summit whether to recognise Macedonia as an independent republic.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The implications of the results of the  12 June European Parliament elections, in which both the  governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] and the  opposition New Democracy [ND] lost ground, were the subject of  commentaries in the Greek press.  <H5>  Government Problems Viewed </H5>   In anticipation of the elections, the 12 June Athens daily  ELEVTHEROTIPIA ran an article by Bambis Papapanayiotou listing  the "thorny" postelectoral problems awaiting the PASOK  government. Foremost among these is the economy, Papapanayiotou  asserted, noting that a new wave of profit-taking may hit the  drachma, with devaluation still possible in the future. The  government must also submit its program for the convergence of  the Greek economy with that of its European partners; a  consensus exists that this program will include harsh austerity  measures. The "unfreezing" of government public works and the  awarding of the various contracts are another problem, as the  obvious need for an economic "shot in the arm" will clash with  the opposing interests of both domestic and foreign large  economic interests. The government must also make a decision on  the size and pace of the privatization of state-owned companies.    The electoral results will influence the "long march" to the  1995 presidential elections, Papapanayiotou continued. Since  PASOK lacks the requisite two-thirds majority in the Chamber of  Deputies to elect the next president of the republic, a  presidential majority in the spring of 1995 presupposes a series  of moves in which Political Spring's 10 parliamentary votes  might be crucial to PASOK.    According to Papapanayiotou, a government reshuffle will  follow the Euroelections.  <H5>  PASOK Reaction </H5>   Following the losses sustained by the two largest parties,  Viktor Netas commented in the 14 June ELEVTHEROTIPIA that "there  was no cause for celebration" as some PASOK circles believed.  While voters expected from the government an analysis of the  results, Prime Minister Papandreou limited himself to stating  that "PASOK is again the winner" and noting that "the government  will continue to implement its program by intensifying the  pace." However, Netas contended, matters were seen differently  by a number of PASOK officials. Alternate Minister of Foreign  Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos said that "while results do not put  the government's stability in doubt, vote losses reveal the  existence of a communications problem with the electorate."  Netas further quoted Pangalos as saying that "the people did not  disapprove of our policies but of our methods and style, blaming  us for lacking a sense of responsibility and transparency."  Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis was also cited as  attributing lower PASOK vote shares to the government's slow  pace and lack of decisiveness. Deputy Minister of Foreign  Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou openly said that the electoral  results showed popular "dissatisfaction" with the government.  Netas commented that voters, "keenly aware of what they expected  from PASOK, of what was done and what was not" by the government  in the eight months of its existence, expressed their feelings  in the voting booth.  <H5>  Interpretations Criticized </H5>   If one were to believe the facile interpretations of  "voters'  messages," wrote Themos Anastasiadhis in the 15 June  ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Greeks "smacked a PASOK which is (supposedly)  worthy of governing us but unworthy of representing us  internationally, (supposedly) expressed their attachment to  [former ND leader] Konstandinos Mitsotakis as opposed to wicked  leader Miltiadhis Evert, and showed Political Spring to be a  `party of government' which must, however, wage a hard battle  with rising parties like the KKE and the coalition, whose power  was greatly increased." The electorate, Anastasiadhis continued,  had no reason to favor PASOK, given the government's lackluster  performance and Papandreou's obvious inability to carry out his  duties "as of old." According to Anastasiadhis, the ND's 33  percent of the vote did not mean a "disapproval" of Miltiadhis  Evert as his ND opponents are proclaiming, and is not solely due  to the electorate's switch to smaller parties. In fact, ND  losses stemmed from the "organized sabotage" by pro-Mitsotakis  circles against Evert. Evert's poor political discourse and his  "extraordinary vagueness" facilitated his opponents' task and  precipitated his "self-destruction." However, Evert "is not  finished," for he would easily win in a future confrontation  with a PASOK without Papandreou.    Those who believe that the "great winner" was Political  Spring leader Andonis Samaras are "deluding themselves,"  Anastasiadhis continued. The party scored only 2 points above  the Coalition and the KKE, failing to prove itself a "party of  government." Finally, the KKE and the Coalition's "triumphant"  claim that "bipolarity was defeated" must await the results of  the next parliamentary elections, Anastasiadhis commented. While  the Coalition had the advantage of leader Nikos Konstandopoulos'  seriousness and status, it also benefited from the  "philanthropy" of the Greek people, who "generously" accorded  this "hapless" party some seats in the European Parliament,  Anastasiadhis added with some irony. The KKE's slight gains came  from disaffected PASOK voters who will likely "return home" in  the next elections.  <H5>  Papandreou Presidential Plans </H5>   PASOK election losses stemmed from a number of causes, wrote  Stavros Liyeros in the 14 June Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. An  important one was the electorate's uncertainty about the party's  future. While the widespread impression that Papandreou will  jump to the presidency leaving Akis Tsokhatzopoulos to succeed  him as prime minister caused considerable dissatisfaction in  PASOK ranks, PASOK losses made it more likely that Papandreou  will run in the next presidential elections. According to an  unattributed article in the 14 June I KATHIMERINI citing  knowledgeable sources, PASOK's "dramatic" losses, which have  weakened Papandreou's position within the party, will lead him  to attempt a presidential run. In the present balance of forces  in the Chamber of Deputies, the election of a president depends  on an alliance between PASOK and Political Spring, an unlikely  development given Samaras' reluctance to contribute to a  prolongation of the present government. For its part, the KKE  already announced it will reject a Papandreou presidency but  left open the possibility it would vote for another candidate  proposed by the majority. This leaves only the ND, whose  leadership would never cooperate with PASOK in a presidential  election. At this time, the article concluded, any decisions  about a presidential candidacy should await the results of the  October municipal elections, which will permit a better  evaluation of the electorate's mood.  <H5>  Discussion in ND </H5>   According to an unattributed article in the 14 June I  KATHIMERINI, a 15 June meeting of the ND central committee will  attempt to define the reasons for the party's poor showing in  the Euroelections. The daily's list includes the following  causes:     -  The ND did not campaign for Europe and Greece but  for the party chairman. It supported his modernizing policies,  which are seemingly not understood by a large segment of the  party's grass-roots supporters.    -  The party was disorganized and  the electoral commissions failed to perform  adequately.    -  Mitsotakis offered no help and contributed to the  creation of anti-Evert sentiment.    -  The ND entered the electoral  fray at an inappropriate time, following an electoral  defeat.    -  The poarty suffered from a lack of vision and an  uncertain political identity.    -  ND candidates offered no thing new.   <H5>  `Bipolarity' Seen Shattered </H5>   An unattributed article in the 14 June I KATHIMERINI  commented that the failure of the ND to take advantage of  PASOK's attrition in popularity means that the "closed cycle" of  bipolarity, ensuring the two parties' alternation in power, was  shattered. While this must be seen as just the beginning of a  process that may be interrupted and reversed in the next  elections, the gap will widen with time, the article asserted.  Events will depend on ND internal developments, which may lead  to a breakup and may increase similar pressures on PASOK when  its succession problem will have to be tackled.</p>

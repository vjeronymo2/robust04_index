			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, we are also amending &sect;92.301(c)(1) to include the Member States of the EU in the list of countries where CEM exists. At the same time, we are not removing from the list individual Member States of the EU that are affected with CEM. These steps will ensure that the Member States of the EU that are affected with CEM will remain on the list whether or not they retain their EU membership. Conversely, adding the phrase ``the Member States of the European Union'' will ensure that new countries that join the EU will be covered immediately by these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, we are making two miscellaneous changes to &sect;92.301(c)(1) to facilitate the use of the list of countries where CEM exists. We are alphabetizing the list of countries to make them easier to read. Further, we are changing the entry for ``Czechoslovakia'' to the two Republics now recognized by the United States: ``Czech Republic'' and ``Slovakia.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> African Horse Sickness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 92.308(a)(2) of the regulations requires all horses intended for importation from Saudi Arabia, Spain, The Yemen Arab Republic, and all countries on the continent of Africa, including horses that have stopped in or transited those countries, to enter the United States only at the port of New York and be quarantined at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, New York, for at least 60 days because those countries are considered to be affected with AHS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have received information that during the Persian-Gulf War, the Governments of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates allowed movement of horses from other countries considered to be affected with AHS, without testing the horses for AHS. Therefore, horses imported into the United States from Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates present an unacceptable risk of introducing AHS into the United States. As a result of this increased disease risk, special efforts are necessary to determine the health of these animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To establish the health of horses intended for importation from Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, we are amending &sect;92.308(a)(2) to add these countries to the list of countries considered to be affected with AHS. This means that horses intended for importation from Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates may enter the United States only at the port of New York and must be quarantined at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, New York, for at least 60 days. This 60-day quarantine will provide the necessary time to test or examine horses intended for importation from these countries for AHS and other communicable diseases. Only if the horses test negative and are free from clinical evidence of communicable disease, as certified by the port veterinarian, will horses from Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates be released from quarantine. This action will help ensure that AHS is not introduced into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Immediate Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the introduction of CEM and AHS into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule will help protect horses in the United States from CEM and AHS. There are probably between 5.2 and 6.6 million horses in the United States. The total value of U.S. horses is about $8 billion ($1,430 each). A very small fraction (between 0.2 and 0.3 percent, based upon 1991 to 1992 figures) of those horses were imported into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for the Member States of the EU, the affected countries export very few horses to the United States. Horses imported into the United States from the Member States of the EU accounted for under 10 percent of the total U.S. horse imports in 1991 and 1992. From 1991 to 1992, the United States imported about 32 horses (less than 0.2 percent of the total U.S. horse imports) from countries whose horses will be prohibited or restricted for the first time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The horses imported from the affected countries tend to be higher-valued, purebred horses. These horses, worth 10 to 20 times more than the average price per horse from the rest of the world, are likely to continue to be imported despite any additional costs related to quarantine and testing. Quarantine and testing of horses has been estimated at $4,700 for the 60-day AHS quarantine and between $1,200 and $1,500 for the quarantine and testing that is required for CEM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. trade in horses is expected to be minimally changed by this rule, since some restrictions already apply to the importation of horses into the United States from most of the affected countries. All but four of the Member States of the EU are already included in the list of countries where CEM exists. Two of those four are affected with AHS and are already subject to restrictions on the importation of their horses into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Ernst &amp; Young cleared by regulators ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the accountancy firm, has been cleared of any deficiencies in its current procedures and audit controls by the profession's regulators. The Audit Registration Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales concluded yesterday that it would propose no regulatory action as a result of its investigation. It emerged yesterday that at least three other public interest inquiries into large accountancy firms are under way. One is believed to be at Price Waterhouse, on which an announcement is imminent. Yesterday's announcement signalled the conclusion of the Ernst &amp; Young investigation, which was the first public interest inquiry to be conducted by the commit-tee. It followed criticism of the firm's audits and those of Arthur Young, with which it has since merged, in several inquiries by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. These included audits of Sound Diffusion, Milbury, Rotaprint and Edencorp Leisure. The inquiries examine the adequacy of procedures and their documentation by firms. But Mr Bruce Picking, director of practice regulation at the institute, said it was far more difficult for its committee to review professional judgment made during audits.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- Referring to the threats  of sanctions against Croatia, FRY [Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia] Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told the  Zagreb-based weekly DANAS that the FRY is against sanctions  because they aggravate problems rather than resolve them.    The best example of this is Yugoslavia where the sanctions  are expected "to bring peace to Bosnia but instead they have  served to foment the war even further."    At the same time they have brought about destabilization not  just in Yugoslavia but further afield and have "become the  largest obstacle to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Jovanovic  warned.    Minister Jovanovic described the recent declaration between  Croatia and the FRY as a major step forward and as an obligation  for both sides to use political means and a peaceful way, rather  than force, in resolving future problems.    According to Jovanovic, the declaration reflects the  determination on both sides to embark upon efforts to normalize  relations. A joint statement from Geneva provides for an  agreement to open representative offices "and not to establish  diplomatic relations or to recognize each other." The  declaration is only a step in that direction, Jovanovic  explained.    Asked to comment on the views that since the joint  declaration was based on CSCE documents and the UN Charter it  indirectly implied recognition of the Republic of Croatia by the  FRY, Jovanovic said that "one should not look for something that  is not in the agreement."    He added that this agreement "prejudges none of the  outstanding issues including Krajina, the division of assets,  mutual recognition or even full diplomatic relations." When  conditions are ripe these issues will be settled, the federal  foreign minister stressed.    We must bear in mind that the issue of Krajina is part of  the  Vance plan which stipulates that its political future and status  must be resolved through direct negotiations between legitimate  representatives of Krajina and the Republic of Croatia. Our  agreement in Geneva is conducive to negotiations on these  issues. The fact is that we have opened a process likely to  increase the chances for exchanging political visits and  establishing political contacts directly without mediators.  This is a natural course to be pursued by two countries that  want to settle their bilateral relations without "foreign  middlemen."    The coming visit by FRY Federal Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko  Simic to Zagreb is a step in this direction. This visit will  most likely be followed by a visit to Belgrade by the Croatian  deputy prime minister and foreign minister [Mate Granic].  Contacts of a different kind at an even higher level are also a  possibility, Jovanovic said.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Small companies Ever since it announced the closure of the Unlisted Securities Market, the Stock Exchange has been in a bind. On the one hand it remains unconvinced that there is sufficient demand to support a separate market for smaller company shares. Yet it is also afraid of fragmentation. Threats by outsiders to set up a market of their own have been enough to spur Mr Michael Lawrence, the exchange's new chief executive, to action. The plan to build on the success of rule 535.2 - under which the shares of 236 companies are now traded - is sensible enough. But tighter regulations will be required to satisfy European law and attract institutional investors, on whom the liquidity of the new market will depend. It is far from clear that the exchange will be able to find a formula tough enough to satisfy institutions without re-inventing the USM. Since it is keen to avoid that trap, a lightly-regulated market of only limited interest to institutional investors is the likely outcome. The proponents of a separate market may thus be tempted to press ahead with their own plans, on the grounds that a more heavily-regulated market tailored for smaller companies could be made to work under vigorous independent management. But institutional interest is highly cyclical. NASDAQ, the successful US smaller companies exchange, can draw on a far deeper pool of retail investors. The eventual solution may be a pan-European market on the NASDAQ model. For the time being, all sides are trying to make the best of a bad job.</p>

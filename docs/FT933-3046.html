			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Plan to create 'dual anchor' for ERM: European Monetary Institute to be urged to move more quickly MR Phillipe Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium which presides over the EC, yesterday hinted at a plan to create a 'dual anchor' for the ERM, with the D-Mark locked to a new form of 'hard' Ecu, or European currency unit. The plan is due to be unveiled next month by the European Parliament's monetary affairs committee. Its essence is that the European Monetary Institute (EMI), due to be set up by January in Emu's second stage, should assume more quickly the functions of the European central bank it is meant to prefigure, by issuing and managing the Ecu as a joint anchor to the system alongside the D-Mark. The Ecu would be fixed against the D-Mark, with other EC currencies having their weighting in the Ecu 'basket' adjusted according to whether they appreciated or devalued, but with much tighter monetary co-ordination, and more joint intervention capability. Mr Joao Cravinho, the Portuguese socialist and economist who has devised the plan, has already discussed it with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, the Belgian presidency, the Bundesbank, and the Spanish prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez. Spain is the country most worried that if hard currency member states try to establish a mini-Emu to salvage something from the wreckage, both the Emu project and the single market will come apart. The plan will include proposals that: Member states turn over 20 per cent of their gold and foreign exchange reserves to the EMI to manage; The member states issue all new debt in Ecus; The EMI and Bundesbank assume joint responsibility for holding the Ecu/D-Mark parity; The Twelve set a joint 'interest rate indicator'; The Twelve evolve a joint incomes policy linking wage rises to productivity. 'If you're going to keep Emu on track the problem of the anchor (to the ERM) has to be tackled,' Mr Cravinho said.</p>

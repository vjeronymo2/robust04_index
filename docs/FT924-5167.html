			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tax staff lobby over privatisation INLAND Revenue typists and secretaries yesterday lobbied parliament to protest at the threat to taxpayers' confidentiality over plans to privatise their work. The tax staff, members of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, also warned of redundancies if their work is handed over to private companies under the government's 'market testing' policy. The union claimed that the policy created an 'immense threat' to individual and business confidentiality.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Claiming for my travels I AM A Paye employee. My base office is in London and I live 30 miles outside London. I frequently go directly from home to work at clients' sites and return home directly, for which I claim expenses. Which of the following expense claims would be accepted by the Inland Revenue: The return journey by car between home and client. The lesser of the above claim and the return journey between my base office (in London) to the client. Is the eligibility of the claim affected by: My rail season ticket between home and office. The fact that the direct route by car from home to the client sometimes goes close to my base office. Calling into my office on the outward or return journey to collect mail and messages. Section 198 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 only entitles you to tax relief on 'the expenses of travelling in the performance of the duties of the . . . employment', and presumably your duties do not commence (each day) until you arrive at the office or at the client site - and presumably your duties end (each day) just before you leave the office or the client site. That being so, it is only a journey between office and site and between site and office, or between one site and another during the day, which satisfy the tough rules laid down by parliament, so far as we can tell from your letter. The rules are not so tough for employees who are required to travel on horseback or in a horse drawn vehicle, if they have to look after the horse themselves. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

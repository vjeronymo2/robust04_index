			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Ardayev: "Nazarbayev Proposes </F> Amendments" ]    [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- President Nursultan  Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan has sent the Republic's Supreme Council  a message entitled: "On the acceleration of market  transformations and measures to escape from the economic crisis."    According to his assessment, the situation in Kazakhstan is  characterized mainly by negative processes and unstable  phenomena: "The crisis and its extreme manifestations in the  form of the slump and rising inflation are nullifying many of  our efforts to stabilize the economy and are a heavy burden on  citizens' shoulders."    The speech and the president's message outline the main  areas  of what N. Nazarbayev sees as the best option for Kazakhstan's  development. Center stage goes to a money-credit and banking  reform "which takes real and not formal account of the sovereign  state's demands on the market economy" in which the key task is  to halt galloping inflation and strengthen the national  currency. The president believes that Kazakhstan has only one  path to financial stabilization -- the reduction of all state  spending apart from the most essential: appropriations for the  payment of wages, pensions, and social security grants.  According to this program all subsidies to enterprises, both  direct and hidden, are to be terminated with the result that  loss-makers will face bankruptcy but the state will not bear any  responsibility for that. It is necessary to cut spending on the  upkeep of state agencies. In addition, prices for all types of  goods and services are to be decontroled.    The head of state dwelt in particular on the problem of  stability in Kazakhstan. He dealt in greatest detail with the  sensitive question of migration, noting that he is enraged both  by the "attempts to overdo it" and the "desire to embellish  reality a little and pretend that there is nothing special  happening." Population loss due to migration has been  characteristic of Kazakhstan for a quarter of a century now but  in recent years has increased more than tenfold, reaching  222,100 people last year.    N. Nazarbayev cited factors which, in his view, have been  encouraging non-Kazakhs to leave Kazakhstan and said that the  prime reason was mistakes in language policy and the definition  of the status of the state language. N. Nazarbayev asserted  that "it is necessary immediately to adopt a new law on  languages and remove all discrimination against the Russian  language, which is just as necessary to the development of the  Kazakhs and other peoples as it is to Russian-speaking  population itself." A negative role, to use the president's  phrase, was also played by the "distortion in cadre policy" and  the "imbalance in the admission of school-leavers to higher and  secondary specialized educational institutions." In addition,  N. Nazarbayev believes that the time has come to draw attention  to manifestations of vulgar nationalism and said that "there  must be severe penalities for racial abuse."    All these conclusions are correct but are they not too late?    In addition, the author of the message ignored questions  relating to the domestic political reorganization in Kazakhstan.  He believes, among other things, that the best option would to  be reform parliament as a bicameral body, empowering it to  impeach the president and empowering the president to dissolve  parliament. There must also be a fundamental restructuring of  the legal system.    As for the activity of the government, which is presently  receiving most criticism, the president said that the Cabinet of  Ministers should be given carte blanche for 15 months in order  to implement the updated program of anticrisis measures.    However, that did not stop N. Nazarbayev from carrying out a  reorganization and a reshuffle in the government cabinet  literally just a couple of days later.    The most interesting of the cadre reshuffles is the  appointment of 40-year old Kozykorpesh Yesenberlin, head of the  Alemsistem Finance and Investment Corporation, one of the  largest nonstate production and commercial structures in  Kazakhstan, to one of the key posts in the government --  chairman of the State Committee for State Property. Whatever  else, it is hard to describe the change of holders of government  portfolios as anything other than positive.</p>

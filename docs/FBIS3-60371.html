			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [As received via ANSASERVICE database] </F>   [Text] Chamonix (ANSA) 29 Nov -- The measures that Italy,  France, and Switzerland intend to adopt to reduce the air  pollution caused by ozone, which is reaching ever more worrying  levels, include road transport, chemical plants and products, as  well as economic measures and research. The cause of the  excessive concentrations of ozone are nitric oxide and volatile  organic compounds (in practice hydrocarbon vapors) emissions.  During a meeting held in Chamonix, the environment ministers of  the three countries signed a joint statement in order to reduce  these emissions by 70-80 percent (over 1980 levels) and to  achieve a "substantial" reduction by the year 2000.  Furthermore, other governments have been invited to sign the  agreement.    In transport the committment is to: reduce in the volume of  truck traffic by using trains (even high-speed trains at night)  and rivers to transport goods over long distances; put a stop to  the increasing horsepower of vehicles and limiting average fuel  consumption to 5 liters per 100 km.; step up controls on  automobiles and speed limits; improve the effectiveness of  catalytic converters; promote public transport; perform studies  to determine the possible harmful consequences of building new  roads.    Measures concerning plants include establishing limits for  nitric oxide and hydrocarbon vapor emissions, both now and for  the future. For products instead, the use of organic solvents in  paints, detergents, glues will be suppressed or at least  limited; in addition products containing organic solvents will  be required to bear a label indicating the percentage content.    The economic measures to be adopted include increased taxes  (exise rate) on fuels and measures designed to progressively  cover the total cost of heavy traffic. Finally, studies to  assess the measures to be adopted after the year 2000 and better  exchange of information on research being performed in the  sector.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STOLEN CAR TRACKING SYSTEM GOES ON LINE  </P> <P> An anti-theft system that uses radio signals to lead police to stolen cars went  on line Tuesday in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The Stolen Vehicle Recovery Network's key component is a homing device,  manufactured by the Massachusetts-based electronics firm LoJack.  </P> <P> The system costs about $595 for a private citizen to install. When a  LoJack-equipped car is reported stolen, police enter the report into the  state's stolen vehicle system computer, which sends a radio signal from one of  seven transmission towers throughout the county.  </P> <P> All but two police departments -- Culver City and Long Beach -- have joined the  47-agency recovery network.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol is coordinating the three-year pilot program,  which was unveiled at a news conference attended by county Sheriff's Department  and Los Angeles police officials.  </P></p>

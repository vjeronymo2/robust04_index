			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Olena Hubina report: "`An-24' Is Now Too Much of a Luxury"] </F>   [Text] Nowadays, we seldom travel by air. One year ago,  there was an extreme shortage of fuel. Today, people put it  differently: There are no problems related to fuel; there are  money-related problems. That is why an air ticket to Moscow  costs between 1,200,000 and 1,400,000 karbovantsi.    Despite such a situation, today there are already about 70  aviation companies operating in Ukraine. Some of them have just  one plane, others -- just two. However, the state-owned  "Ukrainian Airlines" company remains, undoubtedly, the largest  one.    President of the air company Leonid Pohrebnyak calls it  "aviation enterprise." It may be readily realized that, like  the overwhelming majority of Ukrainian enterprises, it finds it  quite difficult to become integrated into market conditions.  For example, today, the company owns quite a sizeable fleet of  aircraft -- seven "Il-62," 15 "Tu-154," 15 "Tu-134," and 25  "An-24." Even though the technology functions without fail and  with great precision, some of the aircraft will only be used  until the year 2005. However, this technology is obsolete.  Besides, is Ukraine capable, today, of replacing all of its old  aircraft with new ones? For example, when flights to the United  States were organized, at the U.S. side's demand, our planes  were re-equipped with special technology. One such system costs  $300,000.    The low fuel efficiency of the aircraft has considerably  reduced the amount of air transportations. Today, the fuel  price accounts for 70 percent of the ticket price. That is why  it is difficult to compete in terms of ticket prices. It is one  thing that Ukrainian aviation companies must coordinate prices  with the "Ukrainian Airlines." In flights to the United States,  Russian and Finnish companies turn out to be competitive.    There also exists yet another problem. The aircraft are  mainly repaired in Russia. This means that rubles must be paid.  Today, "Ukrainian Airlines" needs 9.6 billion rubles to be able  to take back our repaired technology from there.    It is, therefore, perfectly understandable that in present  conditions the aircraft largely make charter flights, when the  customer pays for the flights. The "Ukrainian Airlines"  arranges much fewer regular flights than we would like it to.  There are regular flights to Tel Aviv, Athens, Cairo, Istanbul,  Prague, Warsaw, Beijing, Delhi, and some other cities. At the  same time, the flight to Toronto that was initiated on 23 April  is on charter terms -- there is a contract for 19 flights.  However, regular flights to Canada are being negotiated for  1995.    There are also attempts to compete in terms of the quality  of  services. People say that, on the flight to Moscow, food is now  served and that even wine is on the menu. Other flights abroad  are also maintained at a proper level.    In summer, weekly flights to Washington and Chicago will  open. Tickets for these flights are on sale.</p>

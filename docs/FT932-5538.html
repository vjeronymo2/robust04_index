			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Trial by Jury in ideal surroundings - Opera The best joke of the BOC Covent Garden Festival has been in setting. No, not The Magic Flute in the Freemasons' Hall, but Trial by Jury in Bow Street Magistrates' Court. The performance was not wonderful; it never interfered with the immense fun of watching Gilbert and Sullivan's travesty of a breach-of-promise trial in one of the most celebrated courtrooms in the country. The chamber proved ideally intimate; the production, by John Gardner, was updated. Some jurors carried tabloid newspapers, and at the end Judge and plaintiff posed for press photographs. It cannot be said too often, however, that Gilbert and Sullivan would be more seriously funny if singers trusted the music and stopped behaving as if they knew very well they were part of a jolly amusing jape. Worst culprit here was the Judge - Robert Neil Kingham. Most nearly scotfree was the defendant, Andrew Busker, singing with blithe ease and never mugging once. Yet why dress him in T-shirt and jeans? The words tell you he has respect for the court, and the music gives him so plain a kind of tawdry lower-middle-class heroism that you know he should be wearing at least a tie, if not also a nasty double-breasted suit. Over at the Donmar Warehouse, travesty of another kind. I have been catching the Second Annual Farewell Recitals of Vera Galupe-Borszkh (traumatic soprano) since 1988, and the pleasure does not pall. The great, the abiding, joke here is Vera herself, with her grande dame gown, jewels and hairdo, calmly hellbent on making opera communicate to us, giving us a strenuous and ludicrous explanation of what each of her arias is about, and during the aria underlining the point of every phrase with graphic mime. Azucena not only scorches her fingers on the pyre into which she has just thrown her baby, she then puts on glasses to check that it was indeed her baby - 'Il figlio mio]' All done with Vera's incomparably silly earnestness, her intensely unspontaneous delivery, and her crack musical timing. I don't know which is funnier - the degree to which this self-important and well-seasoned Slavic prima donna becomes Azucena, or the degree to which she doesn't. A few Vera non-musical jokes should have gone years ago - the wheedling Renata Scotto plea 'Forgive me my poor English,' and the unoriginal nickname 'Jess E Normous'. And, though Vera's incidentally spiteful remarks about other sopranos are one of her most hilarious facets, her bitchiness is often too laboured. The most unnervingly comic aspect of her is her musicality - the Mad Scene cadenza she inserts at just the right place into her pop song; the longer-than-long phrase-lengths; the gutsy plunges into chest register; or the relieved emergence from chest register. An evening with Vera Galupe-Borszkh is a master-class in opera and its absurdity. You don't have to know about opera to hear why Vera is funny - she herself is a crash-course in the art.</p>

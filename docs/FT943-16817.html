			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / British Coal to sell largest subsidiary British Coal is to offer Coal Products, its largest business subsidiary, for sale. The Chesterfield-based company is the UK's largest manufacturer of solid smokeless fuels and foundry coke. Its annual turnover of Pounds 130m makes it larger than some of the regional mining businesses into which British Coal will be divided for privatisation. Coal Products has four plants and employs about 550 people. Last year's profits of Pounds 12m before tax were three times the previous year's. British Coal said it had received more than a dozen expressions of interest from potential buyers, including a management buy-out proposal.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: N.C. STATE TOLD TO PAY $365,180  </P> <P> North Carolina State has been ordered to repay $365,180 to the NCAA because  Charles Shackleford, a former Wolfpack basketball player, accepted money while  playing for the school.  </P> <P> The amount of the repayment is 90% of N.C. State's net earnings from the 1987  and 1988 NCAA tournaments, played during Shackleford's sophomore and junior  years.  </P> <P> Repayment to the NCAA will come from money raised by the athletic department,  such as revenue from ticket sales and television contracts, said Harold B.  Hopfenberg, N.C. State athletic director.  </P> <P> In February, Shackleford admitted accepting more than $60,000 from two men  during his final two years at N.C. State. He said one payment had been from a  sports agent seeking to represent him, and the other a loan that he since has  repaid.  </P></p>

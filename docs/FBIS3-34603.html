			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Our National Security"] </F>   [Text] Because we have only this homeland, and because its  tranquility and security are our only genuine wealth, we cannot  allow any attempt to harm it or turn its tranquility into horror  and security into fear. We will confront any hand that seeks to  encroach on the homeland, its security and tranquility, and its  citizens' safety.    We know we are targeted by many, particularly the Zionist  enemy and its terrorist agencies. That enemy thinks the  Jordanian land is fertile soil for sedition among members of the  one family, its political and intellectual schools, or its  various origins. Therefore, our eyes focus primarily on the  enemy and its agencies, even if his tools were from within us  and not from his own ranks. That is why we also speak loud to  warn against leaving any door or window open to terrorism or  sabotage by this enemy, or any other enemy of Jordan's  stability, march, and national unity.    The House of Representatives, which denounced the recent  acts  of terrorism in our country, was speaking on behalf of all of  our people in various positions and from various trends. This  Jordan has always been a supporter of the language of dialogue,  not the language of bombs; of peaceful arguments, not fighting  with time bombs; and of democracy, and not darkness and  suppression with bombs or bullets.    Our people were shaken by the bombing of two movie theaters  in Amman and al-Zarqa' because they realize that no one benefits  from these operations, not even those who carried them out. We  do not know what kind of victory can be achieved by burning the  seats of a movie theater and what honor can be gained by  wounding innocent citizens who happened to be in the theater at  the time of the explosion.    Confronting any hostile act against our security, peace, and  unity is not the responsibility of our security agencies alone,  but that of every member of the Jordanian family, each from his  own position and according to his own abilities. Each citizen  is a soldier for the homeland and each citizen must stand guard  for security and tranquility and the enormous achievements  scored under them. We know this is a transient wave, but the  highest degree of vigilance is required, now and all the time,  to guarantee tranquility for our children, security for our  elderly, and happiness and peace for our young men and women.</p>

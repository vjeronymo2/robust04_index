			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> A Pittsburgh radio station that wanted to call attention to its new format  played part of the same song for two days, prompting listeners worried about  the station's disc jockeys to flood emergency, FBI and police lines with  telephone calls, officials said. WYDD-FM started playing the song "What's on  Your Mind" by Information Society at 6 p.m. Tuesday, and when it got to the  phrase "pure energy," repeated it over and over until 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, when  the station changed to its new format. Program director Rick Sklar made a tape  loop that "just kept repeating, 'Pure energy, pure energy,' " said Bob Hank,  station general manager. The new station's theme is "Energy 105," based on the  new call letters, W-N-R-J. But listeners hoping for the usual tunes became  alarmed when regular music never came on and began phoning the station, the  police, the 911 emergency number and the FBI, said station general manager Bob  Hank. After the station realized listeners were worried, it ran teasers on the  promotion's second day saying the stuck record was intentional, Hank said. "We  were just trying to draw a little bit of attention," he said. "We never dreamed  it would go this far." Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS' FUND TO HELP BOY BURNED IN FIREBOMBING  </P> <P> Inglewood firefighters have set up a fund to help a 12-year-old boy who was  severely burned last week by homemade firebombs hurled through the front window  of his sister's home.  </P> <P> Terrell Mullen, a student at Lennox Middle School, was in stable condition  Thursday at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital with second- and third-degree burns  on his hands, face and back.  </P> <P> Hospital officials said he is undergoing surgical skin grafts.  </P> <P> Family members, who have been visiting the boy daily, said they appreciate the  firefighters' concern.  </P> <P> Mullen's sister, Brenda Walker, who was in the house with her four children,  said she is looking for a new home and attempting to put the fire behind her.  </P> <P> "I have to worry now," she said. "I don't know why they did that to my house. I  can't go anywhere now without looking behind my back. I almost got burned up."  </P> <P> Ella Walker, another sister, said Terrell is concerned about how the burns on  his face will affect his appearance but is handling the painful treatment well.  </P> <P> "My little brother could have been dead," she said. "He's badly burned, but I  thank God that no one died."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, arson investigators said they have identified one possible suspect  in the fire. They declined to reveal a motive for the firebombing, which is  being investigated as an attempted murder. Witnesses said they saw four men  wearing white T-shirts running from the home last Wednesday night after hurling  as many as four homemade bombs.  </P> <P> Donations to the Terrell Mullen Burn Fund can be sent to Inglewood Firefighters  Assn., PO Box 525 Inglewood, Calif. 90307.  </P></p>

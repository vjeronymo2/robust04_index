			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marco Antonio Moreira] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 1 Jun (AE) -- The PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] deputy for Santa Catarina, Luiz  Henrique -- the president of the PMDB, today told President  Itamar Franco that despite criticism from PMDB presidential  candidate Orestes Quercia, the party will continue supporting  the government. "We have to separate the electoral side from the  institutional side," he said, "Quercia knows about our decision  and he understands that the PMDB, with its blocs in the Chamber  of Deputies and the Senate, is essential for guaranteeing the  country's stability."    In return, Franco assured Luiz Henrique that the government  will not put the government apparatus at the service of any  candidate and the president will not demand a unified opinion on  the subject from his ministers. "The president did not prohibit  any government member from joining an electoral campaign during  off-duty hours," he said, "He never said it, at least not that I  know."    Henrique explained that a government official -- he did not  report his name -- informed Franco that he would hold an  executive position in a campaign. "I do not know who the  official is; I only know that the president advised him to  resign," Henrique said, "There is nothing wrong with ministers,  most of whom are politicians, publicly expressing their  preferences."</p>

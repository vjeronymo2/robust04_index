The Department of Employment has costed one directive, that on working time, at Pounds 5bn. An internal departmental memo on the estimates reveals the sketchy basis of the calculations. The memo says: 'The basic approach is to estimate the proportion of hours worked annually contrary to the directive restrictions and then to calculate the wage cost of those hours.' The memo also states that transport is likely to be excluded from the directive, which will reduce the cost by about Pounds 400m. The memo reveals that the government hopes to be able to avoid the imposition of the working-time directive.

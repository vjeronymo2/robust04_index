			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Motor trade moves into surplus THE UK motor industry achieved a quarterly trade surplus in the final three months of last year for the first time since the early 1980s. According to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the motor industry trade balance showed a surplus of Pounds 121m in the final quarter last year, compared with a deficit of Pounds 167m in the same period the year before. For the whole of last year the deficit fell by 78.3 per cent to Pounds 1bn from Pounds 4.6bn in 1990, and a peak deficit of Pounds 6.6bn in 1889. The motor industry trade balance has been in deficit every year since 1982, but last year's deficit was the lowest for nine years. The rapid improvement in the past two years - a significant factor in the reduction of the overall UK trade deficit - has been driven both by the recession depressing imports of new cars and commercial vehicles, and by strong car exports. But the SMMT warned yesterday there were 'clear signs that the big growth in exports which took place last year is coming to an end'. In the final quarter of last year total motor industry export earnings fell by 1 per cent to Pounds 2.9bn, while the value of exports for the whole of last year rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 10.7bn. The rate of decline in the value of imported automotive products also slowed in the final quarter, with a fall of 10 per cent to almost Pounds 2.8bn compared with an 18 per cent fall in the whole of last year to Pounds 11.7bn. The value of UK car exports fell by 8 per cent in the final quarter against the corresponding period a year earlier, reversing the trend of earlier months and cutting the year-on-year growth rate for all of last year to 25 per cent. The growth in light commercial vehicle exports also slowed in the final quarter, in both volume and value terms.  -------------------------------------------- UK MOTOR TRADE (Pounds M)  -------------------------------------------- January-December  --------------------------------------------             Exports  --------------------------------------------                      1991       1990  -------------------------------------------- Cars                3,872      3,093 Comm. vehicles        829        713 Parts and  accessories        4,766      4,417 Others*             1,250      1,434  --------------------------------------------             Imports  -------------------------------------------- Cars                5,453      7,268 Comm. vehicles        595        927 Parts and  accessories        5,192      5,435 Others*               482        606  --------------------------------------------             Trade balance  -------------------------------------------- Cars               -1,581     -4,175 Comm. vehicles       +234       -214 Parts and  accessories         -426     -1,018 Others*              +768       +828 Total balance      -1,005     -4,579  -------------------------------------------- *Others includes agricultural tractors, dumpers, trailers, caravans, industrial works trucks and freight containers.  -------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and Customs and Excise  --------------------------------------------</p>

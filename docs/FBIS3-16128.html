			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Leonid Vorontsov and Aleksey </F> Korinenko]    [Excerpts] Berlin, 13 Mar -- Russian Defense Minister  General Pavel Grachev ended a five-day visit to Germany today.  [passage omitted]    A chance is at hand, which under no circumstances must be  let  slip, the Russian minister said, appearing before the press.  This is a chance to considerably improve bilateral relations in  all areas. [passage omitted]    Speaking to journalists in Berlin, Grachev stressed that the  fundamental role in the system of European security should  belong to the "main peacemaking organization" -- the Conference  on Security and Cooperation in Europe. He did not rule out NATO  being integrated into the common European process right through  to the transformation of that organization into a single  structure. [sentence as heard] Time will show what kind of  structure that will be, Grachev said, calling for cooperation  between Russia and the North Atlantic bloc but not for  integration into it.    After noting that a final decision on the parting ceremony  for the allied troops leaving Berlin would be taken at the  highest political level, both ministers stressed that it would  have to proceed in a fitting manner. We would like to leave  Germany as friends, Grachev said, all the more so since good  relations have arisen between the Western Group of Forces and  the German side. [passage omitted]</p>

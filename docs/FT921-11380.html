			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / GPA plans Dollars 1.5bn flotation for spring GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is hoping to bring forward its flotation to late March or early April, when it is expected to launch a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 820m) international share offering. An adviser to the group, which is based in Shannon in the Irish Republic, said yesterday that Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's president, is planning to announce the group's decision to go public on February 11, when it discloses its quarterly profits. Yesterday, the group's financial advisers were meeting to discuss the pricing of the flotation, which could value the group at more than Dollars 3bn. The share offer is likely to be one of the biggest flotations of a private sector company, as opposed to a privatisation. Earlier this year GPA raised Dollars 100m through a private placement of convertible redeemable preference shares in the US. These convert into ordinary shares at a price of Dollars 34. However, the group's advisers believe the new ordinary shares are likely to be priced at between Dollars 20 and Dollars 25. The offering will make multi-millionaires out of most of GPA's executive directors. The shareholding of Mr Tony Ryan, the group's chairman and founder, is likely to be worth more than Dollars 200m at the flotation price. The share sale will raise hundreds of millions of dollars in new money for the company, which it needs to finance its ambitious programme of aircraft purchases. The total value of shares on offer - likely to be no more than Dollars 1.5bn - will depend on how many of its existing shareholders wish to sell. GPA has decided to accelerate the flotation process to take advantage of the buoyancy of the US stock market. It hopes to make a preliminary filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, by the end of next month. The marketing of the offer would then begin at the end of March and the sale of shares would take place in April. The timing of the flotation depends in part on the date of the UK general election. GPA is hopeful that the election will be called on April 9 and is thought to be relying on the political intelligence of Mr Nigel Lawson, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, who is a non-executive director. If the election is later, the offer may have to be delayed until afterwards. The group's investment bank advisers - Japan's Nomura, Schroders, the UK merchant bank, and Goldman Sachs of the US - are earmarking a third of the shares for each of the London, Tokyo and New York markets. GPA will obtain listings simultaneously in New York and London. The Japanese share sale will be a public offering without listing, a technique pioneered in the sale of the UK water industry.</p>

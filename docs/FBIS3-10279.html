			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Reinaldo Antonio Tefel] </F>   [Text] If we listen to the language that the political  factions of Sandinism and other parties use, we notice right  away that they agree on the need to democratize party programs  and structures. This is positive because it offers the hope that  party unity can be preserved through a convergence around  several items in our program. Regrettably, however, three basic  divergences underlie the formation of the factions within  Sandinism: violence or public spirit, elitism or equality, and  single-person leadership or collective, democratically monitored  governance.    The first two divergences are reflected in parallel articles  by Julio Lopez Campos and Dora Maria Tellez, who are well-known  representatives of two factions.  <H5>  Violence or Public Spirit </H5>   Whereas Dora Maria Tellez gives this categorical reply to  the  journalist's question: "All methods of struggle are valid,  except the armed struggle and (of course) every violent form of  struggle," Julio Lopez, while ruling out armed struggle as an  immediately viable option, says this about violence in the  social struggle: "If this is called violence, then we on the  left cannot be against it."    We in Nicaragua have been immersed in the subculture of  violence, exclusion, and annihilating victory over one's  adversaries. For the first time in our history the FSLN  [Sandinist National Liberation Front] achieved peaceful change  from a ruling political movement to one of a different kind. We  are obliged historically and morally to continue the democratic  process of dialogue that we ourselves began. Sandinism must  annihilate not our adversaries but rather the culture of  violence, and we must begin by banishing it from our minds and  behavior in public and party life. What happened to the UNO  [National Opposition Union] must not happen to us. Because the  UNO stubbornly locked itself up in the culture of violence by  demanding the overthrow of the government because it failed to  annihilate the Sandinists, it disintegrated as an alliance  thanks to the good sense of a major segment of its defunct core.  <H5>  Elitism or Equality </H5>   Julio Lopez affirms his faith in democracy, only to  contradict himself later by upholding the elitism that has  crippled and destroyed so many revolutions. In this regard he  says: "But our party cannot be a party in which all members are  equals. We must acknowledge the merits of the unselfish and  self-sacrificing." I ask myself: Who will decide who is  unselfish and self-sacrificing? Only the people, through  transparent elections, can so decide.    Dora Maria is categorical once again in describing the  democratic nature of the FSLN: "...eliminate the categories of  affiliate and activist and leave a single one for all: member."  Without at least relative equality there can be no democracy.  Major political, economic, social, and cultural differences  often prevent true democracy, or at least hamper it. Can a  democratic-revolutionary party build elitism into its party  structures? Would it be truly democratic? Would it be truly  revolutionary?  <H3>  Single-Person, Authoritarian or Collective, Democratic  Leadership </H3>   On this point I am no longer talking about the two  aforementioned articles but rather about the entire Sandinist  political debate and actual events, inasmuch as the proponents  of the first approach are not very explicit.    We all agree that the National Directorate (DN) has already  played its historic role; it even accepts a change of name.  Nonetheless, there is a well-organized movement to transfer the  pre-eminent position and powers that the DN had to a specific  post: secretary general. The argument then runs that this  individual must be elected directly by the Congress in order to  strengthen the post and raise it above the collective leadership  bodies. Although it is not being said expressly within  Nicaragua's presidentialist, caudillo-dominated political  atmosphere, this would mean creating a single-person,  authoritarian leadership as an organizational fact. Underlying  this approach is the mistaken belief that revolution is  synonymous with authoritarianism, that strongly autocratic  leadership is needed.    This belief is at odds with history, because  authoritarianism  or caudillismo swamps a revolution. The French Revolution lost  its democratic, republican direction with Bonapartism, and the  Russian Revolution bureaucratized socialism and blinded  democracy with Stalinism.    This is why many of us have called for a collective,  democratic leadership: the Sandinist Assembly, with its own  Governing Board, as the highest legislative body, representing  the Congress, and the 25-member Sandinist National Council as  the executive body that reports periodically to the Sandinist  Assembly. In order to aid the functioning of the National  Council, which will meet monthly, it will elect from among its  members a Standing or Executive Commission of seven national  secretaries who will report monthly to the National Council. The  first of these secretaries will, of course, be the secretary  general or political secretary, who will have important,  specific functions but not predominant ones, and will not be  above the other party structures. This will ensure truly  effective and democratic operations and leadership, inasmuch as  the Standing Commission can be responsive and dynamic and, at  the same time, will be overseen by the National Council under  which it functions and of which it is a part.    We must remember that for many years the FSLN boasted of  having a collective leadership. Although it was a top-down  leadership, it did not consist of a single individual. We must  develop and bring up to date the positive aspects of Sandinist  history and denounce our own mistakes. Only in this way will we  be able to become the democratic party of the great majority of  the Nicaraguan people.    31 January 1994</p>

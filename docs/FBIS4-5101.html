			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane -- The opening of the first bridge  between Laos and Thailand should not be seen as a threat to  Laos' sovereignty or cultural identity, Laotian leaders said  yesterday.    They also reaffirmed that continued political and social  stability is a key factor in ensuring the further success of the  country's economic reform.    Responding to reporters' questions at a rare press  conference  here here yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui  Keobuoalapha said the opening of the bridge should make it  easier for foreign visitors to see, better understand and  appreciate Laotian society, culture and national identity.    The press conference, also attended by Foreign Minister  Somsavat Lengsavat and Seun Phetsanghan, the minister for  transportation, post, communications and construction, was in  response to several requests by the foreign press for interviews  with key government leaders in the lead-up to the official  opening of the bridge tomorrow.    Hundreds of foreign reporters were granted the entry to  Vientiane to cover the event, which is seen as an important step  in Laos' economic openness. In the past they have been allowed  into the landed-locked country only during major events.  Regular news cover of Laos has been restricted.    Khamphoui also rejected fears the bridge will facilitate the  arrival of bad influences from "outside" -- especially from  Thailand.    "Both Thailand and Laos have agreed to respect each other's  laws and regulations, which are designed to protect national  interest, sovereignty and cultural and national identity," said  the deputy prime minister.    Instead, he said, the maintenance and preservation of the  bridge -- a symbol of friendship between Thailand, Laos and  Australia -- would meaningfully contribute to the preservation  and maintenance of good bilateral relations and co-operation,  and thus towards peace and stability in the region as a whole.    Khamphoui sidestepped many controversial questions including  when the bridge will be opened to regular traffic after Friday's  official inauguration, given that some problems remain.    "We have survived without the bridge in the past, please  don't rush," he said jokingly.    Responding to the same question Phetsanghan said the purpose  of the bridge was to facilitate border crossing by local people  as well as for foreigners who want to visit and invest in Laos.    However as far as cultural preservation was concerned, the  government had a clear policy to preserve the country's culture  and identity but not to an extent which blocked other cultures.    Foreign Minister Somsavat yesterday said the date for  opening  of the bridge to regular use will be decided tomorrow, when a  joint Thai-Lao committee meets.    The minister said there were two issues still to be settled.    Under the government-to-government agreement signed on April  2, three working committees were set up -- one to administer the  bridge, the others to operate the bridge and to rule on legal  problems and jurisdiction.    Somsavat expressed optimism that the relaxation of  immigration rules would bring-more investors to the country.  Visa restrictions for foreigners have been eased to encourage  investment and tourism.</p>

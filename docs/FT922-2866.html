			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Letter: Negative view of Spain Sir, Having worked in Spain for two years, I feel that many of the comments in your article 'Start at El Aeropuerto' (FT survey of Spain, June 1) were ill-informed, exaggerated or simply not true. For example, bank service, on the whole, is much more efficient than in England. Also, Barcelona airport is not too big: forecasts say it will be too small from 1998 onwards. The tone of the article was negative and showed only a partial view of Spain. To show Spaniards as inefficient and almost stupid is not funny.

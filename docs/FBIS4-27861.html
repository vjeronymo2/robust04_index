			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, June 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu flew to New York Sunday to lobby for a  sanctions resolution on North Korea by the United Nations  Security Council.    Upon his arrival, Han was briefed by Kim Sam-hun, Seoul's  ambassador in charge of nuclear affairs, on the results of  three-way talks on Saturday among South Korea, the United States  and Japan on the imposition of sanctions against Pyongyang.    Han will hold separate meetings with Security Council  President Salim Bin Mohammed al-Khussaiby and the U.N.  ambassadors of the five permanent council members to convey the  South Korean Government position that sanctions are inevitable  at this stage and to persuade them to endorse a sanctions  resolution, sources here said.    The South Korean foreign minister will also meet with Robert  Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state for political and  military affairs, Monday afternoon when Gallucci comes to New  York to speak at the Asia Society, they said. Han and Gallucci  will discuss their governments' positions on sanctions and  coordinate their future strategy in pushing ahead with sanctions  at the Security Council.    The council is likely to take up the sanctions issue early  this week on the basis of a proposal made by South Korea, the  United States and Japan. The proposal will be made into a draft  resolution after consultations with the four other standing  council members -- Britain, China, Russia and France -- before  finally being presented at a Security Council meeting.    Seoul, Washington and Tokyo have already reached complete  agreement on the timing and intensity of sanctions, according to  the sources, who expect a draft resolution to be completed by  early this week.    Minister Han, who stopped off in London on Saturday on his  way to New York, had telephone talks with U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher and his British counterpart Douglas  Hurd on cooperating at the Security Council on the North Korean  nuclear issue. Han also briefed Christopher and Hurd, who were  having bilateral talks in London, on the results of President  Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia.    Han separated from the presidential entourage just before  its  departure from Moscow to Uzbekistan on President Kim's  instruction to fly to go to New York for talks with U.N.  officials prior to U.N. Security Council's discussion of  sanctions to be imposed on North Korea.</p>

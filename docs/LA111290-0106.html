			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Qantas Cuts Jobs: Australia's international airline will slash jobs in a bid to  remain competitive, chief executive John Ward said. It will cut 500 from its  work force of 17,000 by March 1 and sell five Boeing 747 aircraft earlier than  planned, bringing to nine the number to be sold in the next 18 months. The  Labor government said it planned to sell 49% of the state-owned carrier and  would let foreign investors own up to 35% of Qantas.  </P></p>

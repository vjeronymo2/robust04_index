			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Frelimo heads for Mozambique election victory Mozambique last night seemed within reach of a lasting peace when the country's former rebel leader indicated that he would accept the outcome of the country's first multi-party elections, and would accept a post in a government of national unity. As early results in the three day election suggested a comfortable victory for President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party, Mr Afonso Dhlakama, head of Renamo said he would abide by the outcome if it were adjudged free and fair. Final results of the election, the final stage in the agreement signed in 1992 which ended the country's 16-year civil war, are not expected before mid-November. Over 90 per cent of the estimated 6.4m electorate are thought to have voted in an exercise which internal observers endorsed as democratic. Apparently conceding defeat, Mr Dhlakama said: 'We have to admit sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. It (democracy) is like football. If the elections are fair we will not contest them . We would accept and recognise the results.' He also called for an early meeting with President Joaquim Chissano: 'I am prepared (to meet him) anytime so that we can discuss the future,' Mr Dhlakama said. 'We want to build confidence with our brothers.' The Renamo leader said he wanted to discuss with Mr Chissano ways to ensure a peaceful transition after the elections. The president, while not ruling out a government of national unity, has not so far displayed great enthusiasm for the concept. Some senior party members, however, are urging Mr Chissano to follow South Africa's example. 'The way forward is a unity government - that way we will avoid trouble by ensuring all Mozambicans are winners,' said Mr Alves Gomes, an influential and long-standing Frelimo supporter. 'I know my party will win but I want it to work with other parties,' he added. Frelimo is also coming under pressure from South African President Nelson Mandela and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe to bring all main parties into his government.</p>

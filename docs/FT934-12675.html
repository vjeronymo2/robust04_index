			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: French managers back Gatt peace MOST French employers would prefer their government to make a compromise, even a 'mediocre' one, in the Gatt trade negotiations, rather than risk isolating the country by opposing a Gatt deal, according to an Ifop poll published in La Tribune, a business daily, yesterday. The Ifop polling organisation found that 79 per cent of the top managers of 408 companies canvassed last week backed compromise, and that 67 per cent believed the government was paying undue attention to farmers' interests to the detriment of industry and the service sector. The poll is another sign that the mood for compromise is gaining ground in France, with more than half (54 per cent) the employers believing a Gatt deal would help pull France of recession. But it is typical of this silent majority of French businessmen that they are only ready to vouchsafe their pro-Gatt views to the anonymity of an opinion poll, because these views are still at odds with general public sentiment. In a BVA poll for France 2 television, two-thirds backed prime minister Edouard Balladur's tough public stance on Gatt. Eighty-one per cent believed a Gatt deal on present terms would endanger French farming, while 75 per cent felt it would reinforce American economic dominance.</p>

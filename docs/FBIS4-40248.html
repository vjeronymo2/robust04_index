			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] A candidate for this month's presidential elections,  the present head of state, Leonid Kravchuk, has said: if he  gets elected he will press for adopting a new constitution. He  also stands for sharing power between the president and  parliament, which, in his view, excludes the possibility of  monopolizing authority by one of the branches of power.    This is stated in Kravchuk's election program, which became  available to INTERFAX. The program is called "To strengthen the  state and speed up reforms through civic concord."    Kravchuk views himself as a supporter of unitarian state  with  well-developed self-government and broad economic independence  for the regions. He stands for settling relations with the  Republic of the Crimea legislatively.    Kravchuk calls for developing the CIS, for promoting  economic  integration in its framework, for having equitable relations  with the neighbors, including Russia.    He finds it necessary to radically improve the climate for  investment and enable the domestic and foreign entrepreneurs to  be equally interested in making investments in Ukraine's  industries.    Kravchuk is planning to speed up the implementation of a  full-scale monetary reform and the introduction of the grivna.    He thinks it necessary to lower interest rates, separate the  funds belonging to enterprises from national revenues and step  up privatization under government control.    Kravchuk also finds it possible to have two official  languages in the country -- Ukrainian and Russian. According to  observers, Kravchuk's stand in favor of giving Russian the  status of another official language is designed to ensure for  him additional votes in elections in Ukraine's east and  south-east, where the Russian speaking population is predominant.    Addressing students at the university in Zaporozhye on  Monday, another presidential candidate, Leonid Kuchma, strongly  criticized the present head of state. The people are capable of  comparing their 1990 and 1994 living standards. If they want to  continue destroying their economy for another four years, let  them reelect Kravchuk, he said.    He stands only for an economic union with Russia, Kuchma  pointed out. He never called for forming a Slav union. In this  connection he dismissed the relevant statement by Kravchuk and  added that it must be embarrassing for a president to tell open  lies and attribute such ideas to him.    With reference to the Black Sea Fleet problem Kuchma  stressed  that today "we would not have spoken about the fact that Ukraine  was defeated politically and economically in that area, had the  Ukrainian leadership heeded his call for leasing the fleet to  Russia a year ago."    IF Note: As regards the popularity of presidential  candidates, Leonid Kuchma is in the lead. Witness the poll  conducted by Socis- Gallap among 1200 voters in all areas of  Ukraine. The poll shows that 19 pct of respondents give  preference to Kuchma, 18 pct to Kravchuk, 6 pct to Ivan Plusch  and 5 pct to Vladimir Lanovoy. The other contenders are trusted  by less than 1 pct of those questioned.</p>

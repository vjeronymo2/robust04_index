			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pits 'could have been kept open' MR ARTHUR Scargill yesterday claimed that all of British Coal's pits could remain open for the next 20 years if the money spent on redundancies and colliery closures had been invested in the industry. The National Union of Mineworkers' president said care and maintenance costs at pits where production has ended, coupled with payment of wages to miners 'prevented' from cutting coal, has cost Pounds 450m since last October. 'If this sum together with Pounds 1bn earmarked by Michael Heseltine for redundancies had been made available to the coal industry to preserve rather than destroy jobs, it would ensure that all of British Coal's 51 pits remain open for the next 20 years,' Mr Scargill told the NUM's annual conference in Scarborough. He attacked the TUC and the Labour leadership for 'refusing' to support direct action against pit closures. 'We have won the argument hands-down and yet this government has remained impervious to logic.'' Mr Scargill told delegates it was 'vitally important' that the NUM continued to fight to re-open closed pits and to win back the thousands of jobs lost in recent weeks. He told the conference the NUM has paid Pounds 5.5m in severance pay to its own staff and members because of the pit closure programme. 'While British Coal has received money from the government and the EC to fully fund its severance arrangements, the NUM has not received a penny.' The European Commission has said the NUM should get a refund from the government out of European funds for the mining industry, he said. Mr Scargill later confirmed the union was set to move its headquarters from Sheffield to the Yorkshire area offices in Barnsley because of a cutback in staff caused by the pit closure programme.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Gold shares make ground South African shares ended mixed after investors remained net buyers of gold-related stocks but held back in industrials. Dealers, however, said that sentiment remained steady after Wednesday's gains and demand could re-emerge today. The overall index was 13 ahead at 5,672, the industrial index lost 22 at 6,434 and golds added 21 at 2,167. Gencor saw most of Wednesday's gain pared, dipping 30 cents to R11.95 as demand slowed after the announcement of its purchase of Billiton. Anglos rose R6 to R246 after gaining on Nasdaq, while De Beers firmed 25 cents to R111.75. Traders said the shares had attracted offshore interest after recent inactivity. Pick'n Pay Stores fell 50 cents to R12.50 as the shares remained under pressure from continued strike action throughout the country.</p>

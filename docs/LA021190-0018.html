			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S EXPERIENCE STRIKES FAMILIAR CHORD  </P> <P> I personally think the problem lies with our educational system, in that the  Afro power structure will not demand that black history and true-to-real-life  job training be taught to all students on an equal basis from junior high  through graduate school.  </P> <P> I am of the opinion that if this were to be done, the stigma of color would  eventually fade away and all people would be accepted on the basis of their  character and ability and not on the circumstance of their color.  </P> <P> Best wishes to Bean for upward mobility and success in fighting racism at every  opportunity.  </P> <P> RAYMOND L. JACKSON, San Fernando  </P></p>

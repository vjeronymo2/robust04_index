			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> B-2 TAKING A LOT OF FLAK;  </P> <P> CONGRESS URGED TO STOP PRODUCTION AFTER THE 15 ALREADY AUTHORIZED ARE COMPLETED  </P> <P> For some months, the B-2 Stealth bomber has been losing its fight for survival  because of rising costs and rising doubts that it could do any job better than  far cheaper weapons. On Monday, Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee, fired a couple more rounds at its moving parts.  </P> <P> Aspin urged Congress to stop producing the hump-backed flying wings when the  last of 15 already authorized is finished. Those 15 are enough to permit the  Air Force to go on testing the plane's new technology.  </P> <P> Aspin opposed a bill to shut the B-2 down last year, saying the Air Force was  entitled to another budget cycle to make a better case for the plane. He now  says it did not.  </P> <P> Aside from the absence of a clear-cut mission, one of the B-2's most serious  problems is rotten timing. A budget crisis, serious enough to force President  Bush to suspend his no-new-taxes pledge, has Washington in virtual  round-the-clock meetings seeking a way out. The last thing a government budget  in that shape needs is the most expensive airplane project in aviation history,  especially when the cost keeps going up.  </P> <P> For example, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered the Air Force to cut its  planned B-2 fleet from 132 planes to 75. With production delays and inflation,  the Congressional Budget Office calculates that the 75 planes will still cost  nearly $7 billion more than what the entire fleet was estimated to cost in  1986.  </P> <P> To complicate the cost picture, the General Accounting Office, which keeps  track of such details for Congress, warns that nobody will know for certain  whether the B-2 can do what it was designed to do until another three years of  testing is completed. This would make continued production fiscally dicey at  any time; with the current budget crunch, it is even riskier.  </P> <P> Finally, with one exception, other planes or missiles can perform any mission  the Air Force wants to assign to the B-2. The Air Force says it would need the  B-2 to track down and destroy Soviet missiles that could be rushed into hiding  in event of a nuclear exchange. The flaw in this argument, though, is that the  first B-2s could not track down mobile missiles, either. Nor can anyone be  certain that they could ever be equipped for such a mission.  </P> <P> Aspin's attack did not appear to diminish White House enthusiasm for the B-2  Monday, and the Senate has not rushed to accept his position. But the stealth  bomber cannot -- and should not -- shake off too many more direct hits like  this.  </P></p>

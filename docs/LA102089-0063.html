			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SNOW BLITZES MIDWEST, CAUSING POWER OUTAGES  </P> <P> Trees in autumnal technicolor of crimson and gold turned suddenly white  Thursday when a storm blitzed the Midwest with up to 6 inches of snow, causing  power outages to more than 200,000 customers in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan,  officials said.  </P> <P> It was the earliest snowfall on record for many cities, including Cincinnati  and Dayton in Ohio, Indianapolis and St. Louis.  </P> <P> Snow also fell in parts of Kentucky, where a firefighter was electrocuted by  power lines downed by the snow.  </P> <P> In Covington, Ohio, a man was killed when his car veered into the opposite lane  of a snow-slickened highway and struck a pickup truck near Dayton, said Patty  Carey of the Ohio Highway Patrol. The area had received 4 inches of snow.  </P> <P> "I can't believe this," said Jan Fredbeck of Franklin, Ind., where 6 inches of  snow fell. "We've got Halloween decorations up inside and they look so stupid  now."  </P> <P> John Robinson, a National Weather Service forecaster, said records dating back  to about 1870 show no snowfall in Cincinnati as early as Oct. 19. It also was  the earliest snowfall record for Dayton.  </P> <P> In Kentucky, up to 4 inches of snow fell, knocking out power to up to 100,000  customers stretched from Louisville to the state's north-central and  northeastern sections.  </P> <P> Indianapolis' snowfall of up to 6 inches was the deepest on record since the  weather service began keeping records in 1885, said meteorologist John Curran  of the weather service. It also broke a record for the earliest measurable  snow, set on Oct. 20, 1916.  </P> <P> Snow flurries in the eastern half of Missouri gave St. Louis its earliest  snowfall on record. Like Indianapolis, it broke a record, set Oct. 20, 1916.  </P></p>

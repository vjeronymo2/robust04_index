			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Retail sales drop points to fragile recovery THE FRAGILE STATE of Britain's economic upturn was yesterday exposed by an unexpected decline in retail sales, which last month fell for the first time since the beginning of the year. The figures follow poor manufacturing output figures earlier this week, and, although analysts warned not to read too much into one month's figures, they are the first sign that the UK recovery might not be on an uninterrupted upward path. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that retail sales volumes fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent last month, compared with March. However, sales were up strongly in the latest three months, a measure which the government and independent economists take as a better guide to recent trends. In the three months to April, sales volumes rose by 1.4 per cent and were 3.2 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Compared with the same month a year ago, sales in April were 2.4 per cent higher compared with growth of 4 per cent in the year to March. Economists expect the recovery in the UK to be bumpy, following the experience of the US, which is suffering from similar private sector debt problems and where recent economic indicators have painted a conflicting picture. Concern over the economy was raised further when it emerged that the government needed to borrow Pounds 4.69bn last month to finance public spending, 34 per cent up from the figure for the same period last year. This highlights the prospect of high deficits later in the year as a result of the economic slowdown. The weakness of April's retail sales figures was concentrated in food retailers and mixed businesses, mainly department stores. Sales in both sectors fell, while non-food retailers' sales were flat. Over the three months to April growth was concentrated in the non-food sector. Sales rose by 2.7 per cent compared with the previous three months. Food retailers, whose sales held up relatively well during the recession, have not fared so well since the beginning of the year. Sales volumes rose by 0.5 per cent in the last three months. Sales for mixed business retailers rose by only 0.1 per cent over the three months to April. One reason for caution about the growth of sales is that heavy discounting, which helped to underpin retail sales, appears to be coming to an end. The Society of Business Economists also warns today that sluggish growth of real incomes is likely to hold-back consumer spending. The Treasury stressed that it was dangerous to read too much into one month's figures.</p>

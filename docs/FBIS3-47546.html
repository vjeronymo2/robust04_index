He also indicated five fields  that Japan believes should be considered important in providing  the fourth yen loan.    The five fields are: 1) preservation of environment; 2)  economic infrastructure, such as transportation and  communications; 3) city infrastructure, such as water supply and  drainage; 4) agriculture; and 5) assistance to economically  undeveloped areas in inland of China. The bureau chief  expressed his hope to emphasize the northeast region among other  regions in providing aid, saying: "We would like to place  emphasis on the northeast region which is close to Japan."    Moreover, because the fourth yen loan will be the major  focal  point during Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China  in March -- the visit is now under coordination between Japan  and China, Hirabayashi called on China to include "projects that  could become a symbol of friendship between Japan and China" in  lists of China's requests for the yen loan. Hirabayashi said  Japan "would like to decide on projects for aid, which will be  provided in three years, as soon as possible."    Minister Wu said: "China regards Japan as the largest  partner in economic cooperation. We agree to the Japanese idea  of emphasizing preservation of environment."</p>

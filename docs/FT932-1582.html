			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Clean-up brings unusual alliance - An innovative plan to repair damage caused by mining Mining is a messy business. And coping with its social and environmental side-effects has often posed an even murkier problem, especially in the Third World. In spite of the wealth of expertise among development agencies, and the growing environmental pressure on the sector, mining companies and development charities have usually been reluctant to collaborate - or even to communicate - with each other. But in the impoverished west African country of Sierra Leone, a scheme is under way which shows that, though co-operation is not easy, it can be innovative. The partners in the project are a small mining company, Sierra Rutile - a subsidiary of the US-based group Nord Resources Corporation - and Care, an international development charity. Sierra Rutile's main business since the mid 1980s has been mining the titanium mineral rutile through wet dredging. The process requires flooding areas of fertile farm land, which are often unusable for farming afterwards. But since the late 1980s, the company has tried to make amends by putting about 3 per cent of its annual turnover into alternative agricultural and development projects. Using that funding, and the development expertise of Care, basic sanitation and sustainable agricultural programmes have been set up for some 3,400 farming families living around the mining area. 'The aim is to provide something for people who have nothing,' says Derric Hanvey, a director of Sierra Rutile and a key architect of the scheme. He points out that in a country like Sierra Leone, where the state is weak, the mine is practically the only form of infrastructure - and employment - in the region. The practice of providing wells, seeds and schools is not in itself unusual in the mining world. In recent years, most mining companies operating in west Africa have been stepping up their assistance to local communities and environmental programmes - primarily as a result of environmental pressure and tougher legislation. 'The big mining companies are now on the defensive about these issues,' says Chris Hinde, editor of the Mining Journal which, in deference to the changing climate, is about to launch a new environmental supplement. He estimates that approximately 10 per cent of the total start-up costs for new mines is earmarked for environmental rehabilitation projects. What makes Sierra Rutile's project unusual is the involvement of a non-governmental charity. Until now, mining companies have preferred to use their own staff or consultants, rather than charities or environmental groups, to administer their aid. 'In this respect the project is unique,' says Edward Watkins, a mining and environment consultant who believes that, by collaborating with Care, Sierra Rutile now has 'much more credibility' in the region. Sierra Rutile claims it chose to work with Care because of the charity's expertise and as a recognition that the most effective forms of development work are those that stress farmer participation - something that is hard to develop under the paternal structure of a big mining company. However, some green groups believe that, despite the mine's efforts, the farmers are still losing out. And they say Care is in danger of becoming compromised by being involved in the project. Care stresses that the actual implementation of the project remains under its control. 'We appreciate that this donor is enabling the charity to assist project participation as planned,' says Patrick Sayer, UK director of Care's west African projects. 'What we get out of this project is the same as what we get out of any donor.' The sensitivity of charities to criticism on this issue highlights the problems that may dog attempts to repeat the scheme elsewhere. For while all parties say they hope the project will set an example, overcoming the decades of suspicion - and differing objectives - between mining companies and development workers may prove as difficult as rehabilitating the mining land.</p>

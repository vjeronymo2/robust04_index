			<p>DEA   Questioning   <F P=102> PY0804021294 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish  1700 GMT 7 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY0804021294 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz Television Nacional Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] The government continues to fail to clarify the  mysterious manner in which Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, assistant to  Isaac Oso Chavarria, traveled to Costa Rica to be questioned by  the DEA.    Justice Minister Rene Blattman says he has no information  about this case, which is being investigated by the Ministry of  Government. He also does not know whether or not Edgar  Fernandez Lazcano was forbidden to leave the country. But this  is not very important, the minister said, as anyone in Bolivia  can disobey a prohibition from leaving the country and get out  of Bolivia. The migration under secretary certainly did not  like this statement from Blattman.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified migration under secretary]  Did the justice minister say that? Well, he must send me a list  of the names of people who during my administration have left  the country in disobedience of an order to remain.    [Unidentified reporter] Was Fernandez Lazcano prohibited  from  leaving the country?    [Under secretary] Fernandez Lazcano? No, he had no order  prohibiting him from leaving the country. Until the moment he  left--because it is not known when he left the country--there  was no order prohibiting him from leaving the country. [end  recording]    If Fernandez Lazcano was not forbidden from leaving the  country, he could have left the country legally, with a  passport. The migration office says he did not use it:    [Begin under secretary recording] I can tell you that his  departure is not registered in any airport controlled by the  Migration Undersecretariat. The only thing I can tell you is  that if he left the country he could have left using one of the  many ways used by people linked with drug trafficking, through  clandestine air strips or by land. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the president of the Republic has met with  several  ministers to discuss this subject, and it has been reported that  in the next few hours a communique will be released to the  public explaining how Edgar Fernandez Lazcano left Bolivia.    In turn, the DEA was criticized in political circles for  having kidnapped Edgar Fernandez Lazcano to question him in  Costa Rica. Bolivian congressmen agree that the U.S. DEA owes an  explanation to Bolivia.    [Begin Deputy Fernando Kieffer Guzman recording] Yes, of  course, I think they acted in excess and arbitrarily, which must  be repaired as soon as possible; otherwise this will  unnecessarily affect U.S.-Bolivian relations, as there was no  real reason for this action. The two objectives sought by the  DEA in this case could have been met: that Fernandez Lazcano act  as a witness in court, and also as a witness in the lawsuits  that are being followed in the United States. Right? But this  was a precipitate, clumsy action. It was an abuse... [end  recording]    MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] Deputy Fernando  Campero said that in the case of Edgar Fernandez Lazcano,  Bolivian sovereignty is being trampled upon.    [Begin Campero recording] The amendment approved some time  ago by the U.S. Congress, which authorizes the kidnapping of  individuals linked with drug trafficking even without the  knowledge or coordination with the officials of the foreign  country, represents an offense to the dignity of our countries.  I think that in this joint struggle carried out jointly by the  United States and all the rest of the countries against this  scourge which is drug trafficking, we should seek mechanisms of  coordination and mutual respect. [end recording]    So far, neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the  Government Ministry have made any statements on this sensitive  subject.</p>

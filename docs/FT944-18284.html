			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact members try to break deadlock Rubber producing and consuming countries yesterday began a second round of talks on a new price-stabilising commodity pact to succeed the 1987 International Natural Rubber Agreement. The negotiations will centre on the key issues of the price level and range for buffer stock operations. Mr Peter Lai, chairman of the talks, has put forward new price proposals to break the deadlock that prevented agreement on a new accord at the last negotiating session in April. However, despite expressing cautious optimism that a deal can be reached this time, the two sides have shown little sign of shifting their positions. Consumer countries, led by the US and European Union, have so far resisted the demand by producers for an increase in the reference price for rubber. This has remained basically unchanged since the first rubber pact was agreed in 1979. The current reference price is 196.84 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilogram with a range of 15 to 20 per cent either way before buffer stock operations come into play. The present round of talks takes place against a backdrop of an unexpected surge in rubber prices this summer which enabled the buffer stock manager to sell most of the 222,000 tonnes accumulated over four years of depressed prices. The reasons for the sharp rise in prices include heavy rains in the three main exporting countries - Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia - which restricted tapping, increased imports by China in particular, stockbuilding in industrialised countries where economic recovery is under way and purchases by investment funds. Some analysts believe this could signal a fundamental shift in the balance of world supply and demand, from abundance and low prices to scarcity and generally higher prices. This would underpin the producers' case for a higher reference price. The 1987 accord, the only international commodity pact remaining with price-stabilising provisions, is due to expire on December 28 but can be extended for a further year if no agreement is reached this time. The two-week meeting, under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, is being attended by 32 countries, accounting in 1993 for 97 per cent of world exports and 72 per cent of world imports. The main consumers, apart from the US and EU, are Japan and China.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RBV BEATS NEIGHBOR VISTA  </P> <P> Finally, after Rancho Buena Vista defeated Vista Friday night, 34-14, RBV Coach  Craig Bell acknowledged what he had refused to admit all week.  </P> <P> "You say this is just another league game," he said. "Then there are balloons,  presentations, floats, you name it . . . "  </P> <P> No. 2 RBV scored 20 second-half points to run away in the schools' first  meeting. Markeith Ross scored on a 23-yard run, his second touchdown of the  night, and James Lewis scored on runs of 28 and 14 yards.  </P> <P> There was as much activity off the field as there was on. There were 1,000  balloons released before the game, as well as a gift exchange between the  student governments.  </P> <P> The game was dedicated to Sal Aunese, a former Vista quarterback who died of  cancer last Saturday. "Sal" was painted onto the field across the 50-yard line  facing bleachers on both sides of the field, and a large red helmet with "8" --  Aunese's number at Vista -- was painted in the middle.

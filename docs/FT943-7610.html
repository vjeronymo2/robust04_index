			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / The Markets: Go-ahead for platinum mine - Commodities Zimbabwe's biggest foreign investment project since independence, the USDollars 200m Hartley platinum joint venture, will be given the final go-ahead on Wednesday when the minister of mines formally signs the special mining lease and mining agreement on behalf of the government. Two Australian groups, Broken Hill Proprietary and Delta Gold, are behind the project to dig the biggest platinum mine in the western world outside South Africa, capable of producing 150,000 troy ounces a year. Mr Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, is expected to turn the first turf at the mine site on September 9. Elsewhere, the International Natural Rubber Organisation is holding a meeting today at its Kuala Lumpur headquarters to review the buffer stock operations with which it tries to stabilise rubber prices within a pre-determined range. The review is mandatory under the rules of the International Natural Rubber Agreement following the sale of 100,000 tonnes of stockpiled rubber in an attempt to damp down rising prices. Tomorrow, also in Kuala Lumpur, the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries will meet to decide on its response to any action agreed at today's session. ANRPC members have been unhappy over the refusal of Inro's consuming country members to consider a rise in the Inra target range in the light of the market's recent strength and have threatened to set up their own price support system. Today also sees the publication of aluminium production figures for July covering members of the International Primary Aluminium Institute. This will give a further indication of progress with the output-cutting agreement reached by leading producing countries in January. On Thursday the International Wheat Council is to publish its monthly Market Report, giving its latest assessment of world-wide production and consumption prospects for wheat and coarse grains.</p>

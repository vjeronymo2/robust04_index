The book "My Father Deng Xiaoping," written by Mao Mao, was  published by the Central Party Literature Publishing House in  September 1993. A mere one month after its publication, pirated  copies appeared on the market as if they were legitimate. By  February this year, over 100,000 copies of seven pirated  versions had been discovered. These pirated books are of very  poor quality and are riddled with errors, which has made the  readers very unhappy and has caused the publisher and the author  to suffer unjustified wrong.    The Central Party Literature Publishing House has now been  fully authorized by the author to look into this matter and has  officially engaged a prominent lawyer to act on its behalf.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / General unions closer to merger Britain's new super-union, to be formed from the merger of the TGWU and GMB general unions, will appeal to the workforce of the future - part-timers, people working in small companies and those who move from job to job, according to Mr John Edmonds, the GMB leader. Mr Edmonds, and Mr Bill Morris the TGWU leader, yesterday unveiled the next stage in the merger which is expected to be completed by 1996. The executives of the two unions have agreed to set up working parties to cover benefits and services, industrial servicing, political activity, recruitment and organisation and structure. Each group will study how the unions operate and suggest how co-operation and closer working can be extended. They will produce an initial report by March 1994. Although the merger is unlikely to be derailed, there are several difficulties to be overcome. The TGWU is a leftwing union with a recent history of domination by its lay activist executive. The GMB by contrast is right-of-centre union controlled by full-time officials. Mr Edmonds has far more top-down power than Mr Morris. However, political differences have become less marked in recent months as Mr Morris has helped to move the TGWU in a more pragmatic direction. And Mr Edmonds has delighted many on the left by his criticisms of Labour economic policy and his attack on the policy of one member one vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates. The merger may even be seen as a threat by Labour leaders as the organisation will control about half of all union funds going to the party. Both leaders have indicated they expect better value for money.</p>

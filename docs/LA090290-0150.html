			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLAME IT ON 'LA BAMBA';  </P> <P> IN RECORDING ITS NEW 'THE NEIGHBORHOOD' ALBUM, LOS LOBOS WRESTLED WITH  QUESTIONS OF ARTISTIC PURITY AND COMMERCIAL COMPROMISE  </P> <P> "There's no success like failure and failure's no success at all," Bob Dylan  wrote more than 25 years ago, capturing the ironic nature of these powerful but  unpredictable forces. Depending on how they are handled, success can often lead  to failure, and failure can spur one on to success.  </P> <P> One reason Los Lobos has taken so long to record the true follow-up to its 1987  album, "By the Light of the Moon," is that the East Los Angeles-spawned quintet  has been dealing with questions of success and possible failure. At stake: the  group's artistic purpose.  </P> <P> "Moon" was a dark, moving series of tales about the troubled pursuit of the  American Dream, seen inescapably through a barrio perspective.  </P> <P> Arguably the most culturally arresting and musically embracing work by a Los  Angeles-based group in nearly a decade, the graceful, warm-spirited collection  sold a respectable 400,000 copies and was named to the year-end Top 10 lists of  numerous critics.  </P> <P> Yet "Moon" was almost totally eclipsed in the public mind by the runaway  success a few months later of Los Lobos' next recording venture: four songs for  the soundtrack of "La Bamba," the film biography of '50s Los Angeles Latino  rock star Ritchie Valens. The album sold more than 2 million copies and Los  Lobos' title track spent 3 weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts.  </P> <P> The natural thing from a commercial standpoint would have been for Los Lobos to  return with another collection of good-time oldies. But that would have meant  setting aside the compelling vision that made "Moon" and the earlier "How Will  the Wolf Survive?" recordings so memorable.  </P> <P> Instead, the quintet released "La Pistola y El Corazon," an album of Mexican  folk music. The album sold about 100,000 copies -- impressive for such a daring  venture, but negligible when compared to the "La Bamba" success.  </P> <P> Louie Perez and David Hidalgo, the group's primary songwriters, now admit that  Los Lobos was, in some ways, buying time with the "La Pistola" album.  </P> <P> "The only sad part of the 'Moon' album (experience) was that it was  overshadowed by 'La Bamba,' " said Hidalgo, who also sings lead on most Los  Lobos tunes. He was sitting with Perez on the porch of Perez's old family house  in East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It was nice to see the crowds start getting bigger at the shows, but we would  wonder sometimes why these people were in the theater. Was it to see us or just  because of the movie? So, in a way we were removed from some of that success."  </P> <P> The "Pistola" project, he added, was designed to salute the Mexican folk music  that the group played for years at weddings and dances in East Los Angeles  before moving over to rock in the early '80s.  </P> <P> Perez, who plays drums and writes most of the band's lyrics, said "Pistola"  gave them a way to "dig back, get back to us again . . . help us get on the  right track to write  </P> <P> this new album."  </P> <P> The band's new album, "The Neighborhood," features a few bluesy, high-spirited  workouts that should appeal to "La Bamba" fans, but mainly the album -- which  will be released Tuesday -- radiates with the disarming artistic vision  exhibited in "By the Light of the Moon." (See adjoining review).  </P> <P> It wasn't always easy.  </P> <P> Los Lobos -- which will be in concert Oct. 18 at the Starlight Bowl in San  Diego and Oct. 19 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles -- began work on the new  album in late 1988, expecting to finish in time for release last January. But  writing it took longer than expected. One reason: "La Bamba's" success.  </P> <P> "It felt great when (Warner Bros. Records president) Lenny Waronker told us,  'Don't worry about the 'La Bamba' thing. . . . Get back to what you guys are  about,' " said Perez, who tends to speak more during interviews than Hidalgo.  </P> <P> "And it's not that we ever thought of trying to make 'La Bamba II.' That would  have been ridiculous. But there's no doubt that during the course of writing  the songs for this album there was this thing looming over you . . . the  thought that you have to live up to the commercial success that we had with 'La  Bamba.' "  </P> <P> Perez paused -- as if trying to find the right words to describe the  psychological currents at work in the band as they made the new album.  </P> <P> "I think we told ourselves a few times that maybe we shouldn't be as dark and  as introspective as 'Moon.' . . . That maybe we should do something more  accessible," he said.  </P> <P> "But every time we started going too far in that direction, we found ourselves  stopping and clearing the table . . . starting all over, getting back to  something that really meant something to us.  </P> <P> When Perez, 37, talks about his neighborhood, on the porch of the small,  one-bedroom house that his grandparents passed on to his dad when his parents  got married, he is also talking about his music.  </P> <P> "It's a funny place, kind of in the middle of nowhere," he said of the  neighborhood near the intersection of Brooklyn and Eastern avenues. "It has  always been that way as far as the gangs were concerned. They kind of left this  area alone because it was like nobody's territory.  </P> <P> "One (gang's) territory begins over there around Eastern and there's another  that starts at the top of the hill and another when you cross Brooklyn.  </P> <P> "It was never a completely peaceful place, but it was this little island when I  was growing up. It's starting to deteriorate now. Things are starting to creep  up on it a little bit. About the only thing that is left here is a lot of  memories."  </P> <P> Many of those memories are musical.  </P> <P> "There was always music at the house," Perez said, while his mother prepared  chiles rellenos for him and Hidalgo in the kitchen. "My mom was really into  music. When I was about 8 or 9, she used to drag my sister and myself to  downtown L.A. to these Mexican variety shows."  </P> <P> The four original members of Los Lobos (saxophonist Steve Berlin joined the  group in the '80s) were friends at Garfield High School, but were in separate  rock bands until getting together in the early '70s. Disillusioned by only  being able to play Top 40 hits at clubs and dances with their bands, the four  friends began exploring acoustic Mexican music in their off hours at the Perez  house.  </P> <P> They enjoyed it so much -- and found such a positive reaction to it -- that  they switched styles, playing hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and  1980.  </P> <P> Eventually, however, Los Lobos got caught up in the energy and imagination that  was being generated by such rock bands as X and the Blasters on the Hollywood  club circuit, and the group shifted to rock.  </P> <P> There were other bands on the scene with a Latino connection, including the  Plugz and Los Illegals, but none offered the originality and imagination of Los  Lobos' cross-cultural vision.  </P> <P> "A lot of people warned us that we'd never be accepted in the Hollywood rock  clubs," Hidalgo said. "And other people used to tell us how they liked our  music better before we started playing the Hollywood clubs."  </P> <P> "We didn't buy it," Perez said. "The idea that there were boundaries or  limitations because we were from East Los Angeles or there might be some racial  problem," he said. "It's real easy for people to just kind of put themselves  into this psychological gridlock. . . . Like, 'You're stuck here and there is  nothing you can do about it.' "  </P> <P> The early shows had the relaxed, good-natured feel of a neighborhood block  party. But gradually, an undercurrent of social commentary began to surface and  the group stepped up to an entire new creative level.  </P> <P> A turning point was 1984's "Will the Wolf Survive?," a song of hope from the  group's second Slash album.  </P> <P> Sample lyrics:  </P> <P>  All alone in a world that's changed  </P> <P>  Running scared now forced to hide  </P> <P>  In a land where he once stood with pride  </P> <P>  But he'll find his way by the morning light  </P> <P>  Encouraged by the strong response to "Wolf," Perez and Hidalgo began  concentrating more fully on social themes in the stirring "By the Light of the  Moon" album.  </P> <P> Though part of the power of the music was in its reflection of a barrio  experience, the songs were written with a universality that made them odes to  people anywhere who cling to their ideals and faith in the face of handicaps  and social adversity.  </P> <P> The memories at Perez's house aren't all musical.  </P> <P> Before heading inside for lunch, Perez saw two youngsters walking down the  street, pulling a wagon, and remembered his own childhood.  </P> <P> "There are some things you learn real quickly as a little kid riding your bike  . . . like where you can go without running into gangs or trouble. . . . But  there are other things that take you years to figure out," he said.  </P> <P> "Like, I could never understand why all those women were in the building around  the corner. . . . 150 sewing machines in there. It was a sweatshop. It just  didn't seem right, but you didn't know why. Those are some of the things we  explore now in our music."  </P> <P> In fact, Perez and Hidalgo used the image of a sweatshop worker in "One Time,  One Night," on the last album, and there are other images of the neighborhood  in some of the songs on the new album.  </P> <P> "We didn't set out to call the album 'The Neighborhood,' " Perez said. "It (the  title song) was one of the last songs we wrote for the album and it seemed to  tie things together.  </P> <P> "It's a song about urban decay and drugs and everything. . . . About the way  each person in a family is affected by the pressures of the inner city."  </P> <P> Perez lives with his wife and three sons (ages 14, 5 and 1) about 15 minutes  away in Whittier, and he's planning to move his mother closer to him. (Hidalgo  also lives in Whittier, while Rosas lives in Rowland Heights, Lozano lives in  Walnut and Berlin makes his home near Seattle.) Most of her old friends in the  neighborhood have either moved or died, and the bars on the windows underscore  his concern about increased crime in the area. Meanwhile, he stops by often to  say hello or have lunch.  </P> <P> Despite the darkness in the song "The Neighborhood," there is also an ultimate  sense of optimism -- a faith in the resilience of people:  </P> <P> Like the smallest rose  </P> <P> Out of the hardest ground  </P> <P> Like a tiny hand  </P> <P> Reaching up for the sun ...  </P> <P> Let's hope our hearts are one.  </P> <P> "You can't get away from the usual news of gang violence and drive-bys and  everything else, but there's no reason to lose hope," Perez said. "And that's  what we do in our music. We try to be constructive, give people some of that  hope."  </P> <P> Perez paused once more, digging deeper into the band's philosophy and past.  </P> <P> "We had to make a decision a long time ago . . . whether to just be a good sock  hop band or something more," he said. "And I think the answer to that question  had a lot to do with where we came from. . . . This neighborhood."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALENDAR'S SUMMER SPLASH;  </P> <P> THEME PARKS;  </P> <P> COOLING WATERS TO EXPLORE FOR SUMMER FUN IN THE SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Summer fun seekers can cool off by riding rafts and waves without encountering  a single jellyfish or strand of seaweed -- at the Southland's four water parks.  Here's what they offer:  </P> <P> RAGING WATERS, 111 Raging Waters Drive, San Dimas, claims to be the largest  water-adventure theme park in the West and covers 44 acres. The park offers  more than 25 water slides and flume rides, ranging from high-speed to kiddie  level. A 3-acre "Typhoon Beach" features a lagoon surrounded by sunbathing  areas and children's activities.  </P> <P> The "Wave Cove," a simulated ocean where 3-foot waves crash on a somewhat sandy  shore, is one of the featured attractions. The park's newest attraction, "The  Bermuda Triangle," promises to bolt water sliders through three 100-foot long,  spiral tunnels. Other slide rides include "The Screamer," which shoots the  thrill-seeker down eight stories at up to 25 m.p.h. before splashdown.  "Dropout," takes sliders to speeds of up to 40 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Open weekends and holidays; daily beginning June 10. General admission: $14.50;  children 3 1/2-4 feet, $8.50, under 3 1/2 feet, free. Hours: 10 a.m.-6 p.m.  Information: (714) 592-6453.  </P> <P> MONSOON LAGOON, 2410 W. Compton Blvd., North Redondo Beach, features four  fiberglass slide flumes, designed to vary from exciting to relaxing.  </P> <P> The park-goer can test the water with several friends on the "Big Splash River  Ride," an inner tube cascade down 3,500 gallons of churning water that  accommodates 840 riders an hour.  </P> <P> Open weekends and holidays; daily beginning June 18. Hours: 11 a.m.-6 p.m.  Admission: adults, $12; Children ages 4-11, $6.50. Information: (213) 643-6130.  </P> <P> WILD RIVERS, 8800 Irvine Center Drive, Laguna Hills, sits on 20 tropical acres  and features about 40 water rides and attractions. This season's new rides are  "Wipeout!" where more than 200 gallons of water flush riders down a flume, and  "Dinosaur Slide," where kids can slide and swing on a "two-headed"  brontosaurus.  </P> <P> For the smaller set, there's "Explorers' Island," which features a less than  1-foot deep "Pygmy Pound," and a "Typhoon Lagoon," geared for miniature  daredevils. The park also offers Jacuzzi pools, sunbathing and volleyball  areas, and for those who aren't a sun god or goddess, indoor arcades.  </P> <P> Open weekends and holidays; daily beginning June 5 and ending Sept. 16. Hours:  11 a.m.-5 p.m., with extended hours June 17-Sept. 4. Admission: adults, $14.95;  children ages 3-9, $10.95. Information: (714) 768-WILD.  </P> <P> OASIS WATER PARK, 1500 Gene Autry Trail, Palm Springs, features seven  high-speed water slides and tube rides that hotdoggers can speed down at 40  m.p.h. In contrast, the "Whitewater River" is a slow-moving inner tube ride  with a 600-foot loop.  </P> <P> The park also offers a "Squirt City," with slides and a wave pool for children,  several spas and a health club.  </P> <P> Open daily, 11 a.m.-6 p.m. through Sept. 4. Weekends through Oct. 29.  Admission: adults, $13.95; children ages 4-11, $9.95. Information: (619)  327-0499. PAM LOPEZ-JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] With the local elections slated for next year,  unifying all opposition forces is becoming a matter of interest  to the opposition parties. DP President Yi Ki-taek has seized  every opportunity to stress the need for unifying the  opposition camp, assuring that he will make every effort for  this purpose. UNP President Kim Tong-kil, NKP President Yi  Chong-chan, and Pak Chan- chong, head of the New Party for  Political Renewal [NPPR] are all stressing the need for  bringing the opposition forces together, although there are  shades of difference in the substance of their statements. Yi  Ki-taek, Kim Tong-kil, and Yi Chong-chan met on 16 April and  agreed in principle to a three-party merger of the DP, UNP, and  NKP.    However, the road to a unified opposition party is far from  smooth. Each party has a different goal for and a different  interest in the proposed merger. Even in the same party the  opinions of the factions are as much different as their  interests and emotions are.    The opposition camp consists of the existing opposition  political parties (the DP, the UNP, the NKP, and NPPR) and  dissident groups. Naturally, the party that will become the  center for the merger of the opposition forces is the DP, the  first opposition party. Within the DP there are roughly three  different views among its factions regarding the opposition  merger issue. The mainstream, consisting of the followers of DP  President Yi Ki-taek and the Tonggyodong faction, regards it as  the primary goal to merge the DP, the UNP, and the NKP into  one. It is also searching for ways to bring the dissident group  led by Kim Kun-tae, who is preparing to organize a group called  the "Society for Political Renewal," into a unified opposition  party. NPPR President Pak Chan-chong, whose goal is to become  the "prince of the opposition camp," is excluded for the time  being.    However, NPPR President Pak Chan-chong is included, in  addition to the UNP and the NKP, in the targets of an  opposition merger as conceived by the DP non-mainstream led by  Standing Advisor Kim Sang-hyon. The nonmainstream also calls  for the inclusion of all dissident forces including Kim Kun-tae  in the merger of the opposition forces. It is also discussing  role sharing between the DP and civic groups. It is studying  ways for the DP's area-by-area coalescence with civic groups in  areas such as environment, pollution, education, and rural  problems. In brief, its idea is to organize a united "anti-DLP"  force through an opposition-wide merger or coalition.    DP Supreme Council Member Cho Se-Hyong has a similar  opinion. He conceives of a "platform formula" by which the  existing political parties, dissident groups, and civic  organizations formulate a joint platform and policy with the DP  at the center and join forces under this platform and policy.  This idea is similar to the "idea of forming a non-LDP  coalition government" in Japan.    On the other hand, the Society of Political Reform, a group  of dissident-turned National Assembly members, attaches greater  importance to the DP's merging with the dissident forces than  the merger of the existing three opposition parties. The group  takes the position that in turning the DP into a reform force,  it is more desirable to bring together the DP and the dissident  forces as a whole than to have dissident figures join the DP  individually.    In this connection, DP assemblymen Yi Pu-yong, Yim  Chae-Chong, Che Chong-ku, and three dissident figures, namely,  Yi Chang-pok, Chang Ki- pyo, and Kim Kun-tae, launched a forum  tentatively named "the New Age Plaza" on 13 April. Their  purpose in organizing this forum is to "bring the dissident  forces together for reform and national unification."    The UNP is divided over the opposition merger issue with its  assemblymen having different views. There is one faction that  has a positive view of the DP-led merger of the opposition  camp. Its president, Kim Tong-kil, is the key figure of this  faction. There is also an independent faction which calls for  the formation of a UNP-centered third party. The idea of this  faction is to organize a third party by joining forces with the  NPPR led by Pak Chong-chan. The advocates of this idea is  called the school of strengthening or reinventing the UNP.  Assemblyman Han Yong-su is at the center of this school. UNP  President Kim Tong-kil has signed for now, but he is not too  keen about this idea.    The third faction favors the preservation of the UNP,  namely, the merger of the opposition camp centering on the UNP.  This faction takes a passive or negative attitude toward the  idea of creating a third party by joining forces with the NPPR.  This faction consists mainly of former DLP members. President  Yi Chong-chan and assemblyman Chang Kyong-u of the NKP has a  positive stance toward the merger of the opposition camp  centering on the DP.    NPPR President Pak Chan-chong is searching ways for a merger  with some members of the UNP while advocating an "anti-DLP,  anti-DP" cause. He demands an end to "politics by two Kims,"  namely, ROK President Kim Yong-sam and Kim Tae-chung, board  chairman of the Asia-Pacific Foundation, and shift in  generation. To this end, he demands that President Kim withdraw  from the DLP, and that Kim Tae-chung completely give up his  idea of staging a political comeback by using the DP as a  foothold. Pak Chan-chong says that he will organize a planning  group in April to push forward with his plan. He has  practically no interest in a DP-centered merger of the  opposition forces.    Dissident figure Kim Kun-tae plans to launch a preparatory  committee for the "Society for Political Renewal" on or about  23 April to consolidate the internal unity of the dissident  camp as an alternate political force.    The road to the merger of the opposition forces is far from  smooth because as you see, different parties, and even  different factions in each party, have their own ideas about  merging the opposition forces, depending on their interests.  Some DP members, a sort of vested interest group, have a  negative view of the merger of the opposition. Those who have  grown up as party bureaucrats in the DP are particularly  against the idea because they fear that a merger of the  opposition parties or the dissident forces will weaken their  "position."    Some DP assemblymen fear that a wrong step in merging the  opposition forces might give birth to an "anti-DLP, anti-DP  party." In this event, they fear, the purpose of bringing the  opposition forces together as a counterbalance to the mammoth  government party would be defeated. It would become a case of  "go for wool and come home shorn."    Another factor that makes the merger of the opposition  forces difficult is the fact that the DP does not have a  decisive enough strength to be at the center of the opposition  camp.    In the case of the UNP, the amount of subsidy it receives  from the national treasure has drastically increased as a  result of the new legislation for political reform. This poses  another obstacle to the merger of the opposition forces. Next  year the UNP will receive a subsidy of 10.9 billion won in  connection with four local elections. Even now the party has  little financial trouble thanks to the state subsidy exceeding  200 million won. Still, it will receive a far larger sum of  subsidy next year.    Some UNP assemblymen such as Yi Cha-hon and Kim Yong-hwan  are against the UNP's merger with the DP because of their  temperament. Assemblymen from the Taegu-Kyongbuk area,  including Yu Su-ho and Kim Pok-tong, feel the same way.    Nevertheless it is questionable whether the move for the  formation of a third party by some of the UNP members and NPPR  President Pak Chan-chon will proceed smoothly. Pak insists that  he should be both the head of the new party to be organized and  its presidential candidate in the 15th presidential election.  This demand will place the greatest obstacle in the way of  organizing a third party.    While searching for ways of merging with the UNP and the  NKP, the DP is contacting some of the UNP assemblymen  separately just in case the efforts for merger are aborted and  UNP members join the DP individually. The targets are those UNP  assemblymen who are in favor of or at least not opposed to  joining the DP.    The DP expects that as next year's local elections draw  near, the atmosphere will grow more and more in favor of the  merger of the opposition forces and the merger issue will  become an active topic. But the DP thinks that the conditions  are not yet ripe.</p>

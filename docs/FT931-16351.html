			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Scanlon admits damage caused by unions THE ABUSE of union power did more to destroy the British car industry than any other factor, according to Lord Scanlon, one of the men most associated with that power in the 1960s and 1970s. As Mr Hugh Scanlon, he was a leftwing champion of the shop stewards movement in the 1960s and president of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers for the 11 years up to 1978 during which the car industry was plagued by industrial strife. Interviewed for a BBC Radio series The Brothers, about the unions since 1945, Lord Scanlon, 79, said his ideal had been a publicly owned, British-based, car industry. But he conceded: 'Our actions probably did more to hold back that ideal than any other single factor.' Asked if that was because of too many unofficial stoppages, he added: 'Yes, and on trivial things too. It's not easy for me to say this but in looking back you can see just how much damage was done.' Until now, Lord Scanlon has generally emphasised poor management and lack of investment for the industry's failure. Reacting to the programme, Sir Michael Edwardes, a former chairman of British Leyland, where some of the worst disruption took place, said: 'Hugh has told the truth and proved he's a big man. But his comments do not surprise me, he was saying similar things in private in the late 1970s.' In 1977, the year Sir Michael took over at British Leyland, 33m man hours were lost in strike action and the principles of 'mutuality' and 'status quo' meant that no changes in working practices could be made without the consent of the unions. Mr Geoff Armstrong, employee relations manager at British Leyland between 1979 and 1984, called Lord Scanlon's comments a 'significant recantation'. However, Mr Armstrong, who was responsible for sacking the leading shop steward at the Longbridge plant, Mr Derek 'Red Robbo' Robinson, said the car industry's management was equally to blame. 'I think his comments place too much of the blame on the unions; the management was also failing to think strategically about customer choice and foreign competition,' he said.</p>

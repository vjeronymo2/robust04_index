			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Books: Benign dictator or corrupt despot? - Whatever one thinks of Tito, he recognised the dangers inherent in the Balkans TITO by Jasper Ridley Constable Pounds 20, 495 pages TITO AND THE RISE AND FALL OF YUGOSLAVIA by Richard West Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 436 pages Tito was dying. But anyone watching the thousands of ordinary people who in 1980 packed a square in Skopje for a spring festival of singing and folk dancing would have concluded that Tito's Yugoslavia was very much alive. Even in Pristina, capital of neighbouring Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanians drank their defiance of the Serb authorities it seemed - certainly to the younger generation - that the Old Man's federal framework, however fragile, was simply too precious to be allowed to break. Tito knew how fragile it was. Nine years before he died, Jasper Ridley records, he warned Croatian Communist party leaders who had met to discuss an outbreak of nationalist separatism: 'Under the cover of 'national interest', all hell is assembling . . . In some villages the Serbs, out of fear, are drilling and arming themselves . . . Do we want to have 1941 again?' Foreigners, he said, were speculating that after his death - he was then 79  -'the whole thing will collapse'. Meanwhile Brezhnev had mischievously offered to lend him Soviet troops to suppress the Croat militants. Josip Broz was a Croat himself. Yet he had no time for the absurdities of myth and language with which his heirs have attempted to justify the killing and the 'cleansing'. However cruel his courageous wartime leadership of the Partisans may have been and however ruthless his subsequent treatment of political opponents he could be pragmatic to the point of generosity when national unity was at stake. The topical question, of course, is to what extent Tito and the government he led can be held responsible for the dreadful civil war that has followed his departure. To some he is a benign dictator - the only good advertisement communism ever had - whose personal charisma and political vision converted ancient tribalisms into a convincing national identity. To others he is a sharp-suited, luxurious ex-revolutionary whose corrupt, extravagant regime was waiting to be hijacked by power-grabbing nationalists such as the Serb, Slobodan Milosevic, and the Croat, Franjo Tudjman. Both biographers incline to the first interpretation, but neither supplies an answer. Ridley's book is more history than biography. Being the historian he is, he not only maps out the life but carefully and usefully supplies the world context in which Tito operated, from the break with Stalin in 1948, through the depths of the Cold War to his reincarnation as a world statesman, leader of the 'non-aligned' nations. Ridley also scorns the theory advanced by Michael Lees in The Rape of Serbia that Winston Churchill was duped by left-wing intelligence advisers into switching British wartime support from Mihailovic's Cetniks to Tito's Communist partisans. But little emerges of Tito the man that has not already been recorded by his wartime comrades: Vladimir Dedijer in his politically-correct hagiography or Milovan Djilas in his sharp, dissident and more subjective portrait. With his chosen perspective, Ridley's Tito reads like a well-researched textbook, full of background but short of foreground. The pace quickens and lightens in the final chapters - there is a good anecdote about Tito's boar-hunt with an unsportsmanlike Ceausescu - but Ridley makes no attempt to analyse the man or his works, to offer a biographer's verdict. Richard West's book is really two. He set out to write his memoirs of a country he has been visiting as a journalist since 1951. His publisher suggested a biography. The result is a quick summary of Balkan history, a cursory narrative of Tito's life and a detailed indictment of the Croats, from the Catholic Ustasha's wartime butchery of Serbs to the revisionist ideology of the current Croat leadership, with a visit to the shrine of Medjugorje on the way. The book concludes with anecdotes and reminiscences whose effect is to illustrate rather than illuminate the Serbs' 'revenge' (a revenge in which the Moslems have once again become the proxy victims). Tito has vanished. His biographer muses vaguely about history and religion as the inevitable causes of the war, but it is a view contradicted by refugees of the conflict and by the humble folk that West himself has interviewed on his travels. Tito always divided outside opinion: ambivalence was one of his political gifts. Courageous, charming, autocratic, fond of dogs, hunting and women, he has exerted a particular fascination over the British, from the soldiers who met him in the mountains to modern historians at their desks. He inspires extremes of admiration and distaste. On balance his reputation seems to have been enhanced by the deluge which has followed his death. It may be too soon for history to judge. In the meantime, if one had to make room on the bookshelf for one more biography of Tito, it would probably be Ridley's.</p>

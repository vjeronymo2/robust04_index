			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo 16 May TASS -- Uzbekistan's President Islam  Karimov comes to Tokyo in the hope of restoring ancient links  with Japan, which originated at the time of the Great Silk Road,  which connected the East with the West. President Karimov has  taken with him to Japan more than ten projects of bilateral  cooperation designed to lay the groundwork for new economic  relations between the two countries.    President Karimov is accompanied on the trip by Deputy Prime  Minister Otkir Sultanov and Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar  Saidkasymov.    Under the Japanese diplomatic classification, the Uzbek  president's visit falls under the heading of "official business"  visits, and therefore the head of Uzbek state will be  accommodated in a hotel and not in the official residence for  top guests of the state. But this will not affect the level of  reception in any other way. Karimov will hold talks with Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata on 19 May and will be received by Emperor  Akihito. He will meet representatives of the Japanese business  community.    The two countries are expected to sign a joint document,  although Tokyo, pressed for time, has been unable to prepare  specific proposals for economic assistance to Tashkent.    Karimov is due to spend the last part of his visit in the  ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto, the "finishing point" of the  Great Silk Road, which linked Europe with the Far East via  Central Asia. The museums and temples of this ancient city keep  exhibits which were brought by the merchants and pilgrims from  what is now Uzbekistan more than 1500 years ago.    The main objective of the visit is of course to establish  business links and attract Japanese capital and investments.  Last year, the volume of trade between the two countries  amounted to a mere $30 million, mainly from trade in Uzbek  cotton and natural gas in exchange for Japanese computers and  equipment. Islam Karimov told journalists ahead of the visit  that Tashkent has prepared at least a dozen projects aimed at  expanding cooperation including in the field of ecological  normalisation of the Aral Sea and the improvement of water  supplies. Certain funds will be allocated for the purpose along  the line of the Japanese governmental assistance to developing  countries.    Prospects for major private investments are less promising  since Uzbekistan has not yet become a promising market for the  Japanese companies, according to Japan's Charge d'Affaires Kozi  Hino. The Japanese diplomat pointed to Uzbekistan's high taxes  on foreign businesses and the absence of effective joint  enterprises in Uzbekistan as the main obstacles. Business links  are further impeded by the fact that Tashkent, unlike Alma Ata  [Almaty], has not yet signed an agreement with the International  Monetary Fund which conditions the signing on the introduction  of tough restrictions on budget spending in Uzbekistan and a  tougher control over the currency and financial system.    Islam Karimov has already told Japanese journalists that he  sees the building of an oil and gas pipelines across Kazakhstan  and China to the Pacific coast as a priority in cooperation with  Tokyo. Other plans include the building of a railway to China  via Urumqi, and the building of a highway and a railway from  Uzbekistan via Afghanistan to Pakistan's port of Karachi. Most  of these initiatives appear romantic enough, but Tokyo does not  conceal its interest in the gradual expansion of contacts with  Uzbekistan, taking into account its important strategic location  in Central Asia, which, according to Kozi Hino, Japan cannot  ignore in the context of its continuating territorial dispute  with Russia.</p>

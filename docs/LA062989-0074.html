			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> $166-MILLION BUDGET OKD  </P> <P> The city has approved a $166-million budget that will add 12 police officers to  the 150-member force and provide for a new police station as part of a plan to  beef up law enforcement.  </P> <P> The 1989-90 budget got final approval from the City Council on Tuesday night.  The single dissenting vote came from Councilwoman Christine Reed, who objected  to dipping into reserves to make up for a $4-million shortfall in income.  </P> <P> Under the budget, spending will increase 5.8% over last year. Income is  projected at $149.9 million and expenditures are put at $154.5 million. Most of  an additional $12 million for the police station is expected to come from bond  proceeds.  </P> <P> Most of the debate at Tuesday's meeting centered on whether more money should  be allotted to neighborhood associations and social service agencies. The  council finally voted an additional $50,000 to hire another staff organizer to  work with the Mid-City Neighbors Assn. despite that group's failure to meet  several city requirements. The Mid-City group claimed that it needed help  because of an onslaught of development in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Other items on the city budget include a traffic management plan, an  environment-monitoring program, child care and Sunday hours for the public  library.  </P></p>

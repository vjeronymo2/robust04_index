			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Collecting: Market puts on a genial face - Desperate US dealers are even being polite THE ART market in New York is so much more genial these days. Dealers have become positively welcoming - even polite  - and the auction-houses have shed that attitude of disdain which went with their success in the eighties. Even the public have changed. At the Benefit Preview of The Art Show - the annual fair of the Art Dealers Association of America - the other week, everyone seemed to be actually enjoying themselves. Not that anyone was buying anything. On the contrary, in spite of the fact that a great deal of what was on show was decidedly middle-of-the- road and prices (most of them quite modest) were openly displayed, there was not a red dot to be seen. It was all very different from not so long ago. The year started with a huge emphasis on Old Masters. The auction-houses, sensing that these are sound 'Blue Chip', are busy trying to encourage the art-speculators, who have seen their investments in Contemporary Art dwindle, to move into more traditional art: 'Crossover Collectors' are the rage. Sotheby's mid-January sale of almost 200 lots went relatively well with 69 per cent sold by lot and a surprising top price of Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2m) paid (by a New York dealer) for a Van Huysum flowerpiece (estimate Dollars 1.5m-Dollars 2m) painted about 1730. Christie's Old Master sale that week had no comparable picture on offer but 78 per cent of the lots found buyers. The same firm had a similar success with their Master Drawings sales: 77 per cent sold by lot in an auction that was particularly strong on French drawings with a Watteau topping the bill at almost a Dollars 250,000. But a more exciting focus for collectors during January was away from the auction-houses. Several Old Master Drawings dealers staged excellent exhibitions and demonstrated the traditional attraction of buying from a dealer rather than in the scramble of an auction. In a gallery such as Mia Wiener's it is possible to study a wide range of well-researched and beautifully displayed drawings, discuss them in depth with the dealer, and educate one's taste in a way that is quite impossible in the saleroom. Furthermore, most dealers are prepared to trade so that if one has a change of mind - even after a number of years - it is generally possible to return a purchase. Mia Wiener's January show was called 'Regarding the Antique: aspects of antiquity in Renaissance and Baroque Italy' and it included about 40 drawings inspired (primarily) by ancient Rome. These were displayed in the company of a loan collection of classical bronzes and the muted effect of the arrangement made a visit to the exhibition like dropping in on the study of some humanist scholar. Nissman, Abromson - who are based in Massachusetts  - also exhibited master drawings in New York in January. Their collection, which they published in a handsome catalogue, ranged from an early-18th century drawing of a cherub by Marcantonio Raimondi to a sculptural study of Medusa by the English pre-Raphaelite, Simeon Solomon. New York-based drawings dealers Margot Gordon and Jill Newhouse traditionally show every January (otherwise by appointment) and this year they were joined by a relative newcomer, Richard Berman, who staged his exhibition at the Explorers' Club on East 70th Street. The Hamburg dealer, Thomas Le Claire, was in town for the first time with drawings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Last October, Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox opened new premises in New York and they imported Italian drawings from Carpaccio to Tiepolo from their Bury Street gallery for a January showing. London dealer, Richard Day, was also available. All in all, Old Master drawings seemed the hottest ticket around and business, although not exactly brisk, was said to be doing nicely. For the collector who simply wants to browse, one of the most stimulating (but least glittering) of New York's myriad art fairs is just a month away. This is 'Works on Paper' which takes place at the Armory on Park Avenue (at 67th Street) on the weekend of April 3-5. Most dealers who had shows in January will have stands. They will be joined by others who specialise in prints, watercolours, illustrated books, architectural drawings, posters, and photographs. This is quite a heady mix but the show traditionally attracts serious collectors as well as museum curators from all over the country.</p>

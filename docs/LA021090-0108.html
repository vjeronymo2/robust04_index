			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE REOPENS INQUIRY INTO ROBBINS' USE OF MONEY;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN FUNDS: THE TARZANA STATE SENATOR DENIES FINANCING A DEVELOPMENT NEAR  MOORPARK WITH A LOAN FROM HIS POLITICAL TREASURY.  </P> <P> State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has reopened an investigation into  allegations that Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) illegally used campaign funds to  finance a real estate development in Ventura County, it was announced Friday.  </P> <P> Investigators from Van de Kamp's office immediately moved to subpoena documents  from Robbins concerning the property deal, Assistant Atty. Gen. N. Eugene Hill  said.  </P> <P> The probe focuses on the development of Strathearn Ranch, a 3,850-acre parcel  near Moorpark in which the lawmaker holds a financial interest.  </P> <P> Robbins said he was confident that the renewed investigation would find no  impropriety.  </P> <P> "There were never any campaign funds that went into the Ranch. Period," he  said.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's office looked into Robbins' role in the Strathearn Ranch  transaction two years ago as part of a broad investigation into more than  $400,000 in loans that the lawmaker made from his political campaign treasury.  Many of the loans went to campaign contributors and business associates of the  senator.  </P> <P> But in March, 1988, Van de Kamp announced that he had closed the investigation  because there was no evidence that any of the loans were used for projects that  would benefit Robbins. This would have been a violation of the state law  barring the personal use of campaign funds -- a civil violation punishable by a  fine of twice the amount spent improperly. At the time, Robbins insisted that  the loans were made to others by his campaign committee as investments -- a  practice that would be permitted under the state campaign law.  </P> <P> However, Hill said on Friday that the attorney general's office reopened its  investigation because of sworn statements signed by Robbins as part of a  lawsuit filed in Los Angeles involving the Strathearn Ranch property. The  documents, Hill said, indicate that one loan may have helped finance the  development.  </P> <P> Statements by Robbins "made under penalty of perjury in the private litigation  contradict information he personally provided to this office," Hill said. "The  purpose of reopening the investigation is to determine what the facts are."  </P> <P> The court document was part of a countersuit filed by Robbins and Northlake  Land Co. against one of his partners in the Strathearn Ranch property, Jerry  Simms.  </P> <P> But Robbins denied that his sworn statement contradicts what he told Van de  Kamp's investigators two years ago.  </P> <P> "They were given access to all the records when they did their investigation,"  he said. "If they want to look at them again, they can look at them again."  </P> <P> The new investigation of Robbins adds to the woes facing the veteran lawmaker,  who is also the subject of an ongoing federal investigation into Capitol  political corruption.  </P> <P> In that probe, a Senate aide who had become an FBI informant asked for Robbins'  help in winning approval for special-interest legislation. The bill was  actually part of an elaborate FBI sting.  </P> <P> Robbins directed the aide, John Shahabian, to then-Sen. Joseph B. Montoya  (D-Whittier) and suggested that a payment of $3,000 would be needed to win  Montoya's support for the bill.  </P> <P> The tape of the conversation with Robbins was played for the jury that recently  convicted Montoya of seven counts of extortion, racketeering and money  laundering. On the tape, Robbins refused Shahabian's offer of a payment,  saying, "I don't need to be taken care of on every bill that comes through."  </P></p>

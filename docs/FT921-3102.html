			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Markets await grim week THE MARKETS are braced for a week of more grim news on the UK economy as the first full week of the election campaign coincides with the release of a string of monthly economic indicators. The release of the retail prices index on Friday is expected to show a fall in the annual inflation rate from 4.1 per cent in January to 4 per cent last month. The main focus of the week, however, will be Thursday's unemployment figures. These are expected to show that unemployment rose by 35,000 in February, the 23rd consecutive monthly rise. Uncertainty about the outcome of the election, with weekend polls continuing to point towards a hung parliament, is again likely to affect financial markets. The FT-SE 100 index fell nearly 100 points in the wake of the Budget on Tuesday to finish the week at 2,476. Meanwhile, pressure on sterling, which closed at DM2.85 on Friday, its lowest level for the week, has virtually ruled out any prospect of a cut in interest rates during the election campaign. Job prospects were highlighted yesterday in a survey by Manpower, the employment agency, which found that more big employers were expecting to shed jobs than create new ones this year. While prospects in manufacturing appeared to be holding up, banking showed a continuing deterioration, with a net 19 per cent of banking employers forecasting job cuts, it said. The survey of 2,074 employers showed that prospects were worst in London. Employers in Scotland were the most optimistic. Yesterday, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that, while unemployment would 'continue to rise for some months yet', jobs would result from last week's Budget. 'Anything that helps us to fight inflation and assist recovery is a Budget that helps to create employment,' he said. Other figures this week will provide little respite for the government. Industrial production is expected to show a further fall. But there may be some comfort for the government in Wednesday's retail sales figures for February. The City is predicting flat sales between January and February. But a survey by the Confederation of British Industry last week showed a slight rise in sales for the seventh month running.

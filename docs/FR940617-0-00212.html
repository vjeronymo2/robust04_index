This service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulation must be consistent with the new engine break-in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions contained in the applicable owner's manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The manufacturer must accumulate service at a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of 16 hours per engine during each 24-hour period, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise approved by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The first 24-hour period for service begins as soon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as authorized checks, inspections, and preparations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed on each engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not apply on weekends or holidays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the manufacturer's service or target is less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the minimum rate specified (16 hours per day), then the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum daily accumulation rate is equal to the manufacturer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service target.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Service accumulation must be completed on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient number of test engines during consecutive 24-hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods to assure that the number of engines tested per day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test engines after selection for testing, nor may the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator allow deletion of any engine from the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer and approved by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator before any engine maintenance or deletion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The manufacturer must expeditiously ship test engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the point of selection to the test facility. If the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of selection, the manufacturer must assure that test engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may approve more time for shipment based upon a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or an emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a test order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the Administrator within one working day of receipt of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test order as to which test facility will be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the test order. If no test cells are available at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the United States market for the applicable year of 7,500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or greater must complete emission testing at a minimum rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two engines per 24-hour period, including each voided test and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each smoke test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the United States market for the applicable year of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 7,500 must complete emission testing at a minimum rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one engine per 24-hour period, including each voided test and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each smoke test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Administrator may approve a lower daily rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission testing based upon a request by a manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accompanied by a satisfactory justification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The manufacturer must perform test engine selection,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping, preparation, service accumulation, and testing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a manner as to assure that the audit is performed in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expeditious manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Retesting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The manufacturer may retest any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines tested during a Selective Enforcement Audit once a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fail decision for the audit has been reached in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with &sect;89.510&hyph;96(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

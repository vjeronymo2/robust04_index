			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Air China passengers  can now be sure of being taken care of comfortably if a flight  is delayed.    To provide better services for passengers of delayed  flights,  Air China has recently drafted a number of special service  standards.    Air China sources said that these standards apply to flights  which are delayed for weather reasons or by mechanical failure.  They include the following services:    For passengers who are delayed more than two hours, drinks  and food should be provided. Important passengers and  first-class passengers should be served meals in dining halls.    When a flight is delayed over four hours, passengers should  be sent to hotels or sight-seeing and other entertainment  activities.    If a flight is postponed until the next day, board and  lodging should be arranged for the passengers. Important  passengers and first-class passengers should be sent to hotels  of at least four- star standard; business-class passengers  should be sent to hotels with three or more stars, while  economy-class passengers should be sent to hotels with at least  two stars.    If a flight is delayed due to mechanical failure, passengers  can make international or domestic long-distance calls or fax  materials free of charge.    If a flight is delayed due to bad weather, free  telecommunications services are provided for important  passengers and first-class and business-class passengers, while  economy class passengers have to pay for phone calls or faxes.</p>

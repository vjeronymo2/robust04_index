			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUCY DAWIDOWICZ; AUTHOR, HOLOCAUST HISTORIAN  </P> <P> Lucy S. Dawidowicz, a distinguished historian whose accounts of the Holocaust  are considered among the definitive works of that atrocity, died Wednesday.  </P> <P> She was 75 when she died of unreported causes in New York City, where she held  a chair in the interdisciplinary studies of the Holocaust at Yeshiva  University.  </P> <P> "A Holocaust Reader" and "The War Against the Jews" were eyewitness accounts of  the Holocaust, gleaned from her early years and postwar travels to Europe,  where she helped survivors of Nazi concentration camps rebuild schools and  libraries.  </P> <P> Those books and others, including the 1989 "From That Place and Time: A Memoir,  1938-47," were based on interviews and research with survivors and her own  recollections of Vilna, Poland, where she had lived in her youth.  </P> <P> The daughter of Polish immigrants, she was born in New York in 1915. She moved  to Poland while in her 20s and managed to escape Nazi invaders because she had  an American passport.  </P> <P> At the end of the war she came back to Europe, she told Publisher's Weekly last  year in connection with the publication of "From That Place and Time," hoping  to establish a center for Yiddish culture.  </P> <P> When she found that Jewish culture and life had been nearly extinguished by the  death camps, she helped recover some of the Hebrew literature seized by the  Germans and returned to the United States to write and study.  </P> <P> Mrs. Dawidowicz, who attended Hunter College and Columbia University, was often  at the center of disputes within the Jewish community over the nature of the  Holocaust and the responsibility of American Jews for not doing more to prevent  it.  </P> <P> She was critical of historians who postulated that European Jews were too  passive and cowardly in allowing the Holocaust to occur.  </P> <P> She argued that it was unfair to judge in hindsight those who actually went  through the experience. She also believed that European Jews were too isolated  and too militarily and materially weak to overcome the Germans.  </P> <P> Her central work, "The War Against the Jews," argues that destruction of her  people was not a byproduct of Germany's World War II strategy but a central  force in Hitler's plan to conquer Europe.  </P> <P> She had met her husband, Szymon, while in Vilna. He escaped from Poland and  died in 1979.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Opinions" column: "Preparation"] </F>   [Text] Let us assume that UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali responds to President Glavkos Kliridhis' indirect  suggestion to reject Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' letter  because the occupation leader's letter had the logo "Turkish  Republic of North Cyprus, President's Office."    What will happen afterwards? Most likely, after exhibiting  affecting manners, Denktas will reply to Butrus-Ghali on blank  paper or even orally. And of course, he will tell him what he  said in his second negative letter. That is, he will reply  semi-positively to Butrus-Ghali's question of whether he agrees  to discuss the confidence-building measures [CBM's].    Therefore, the ball will be in our court again. We cannot  throw it back, so we will start playing. That is, we will begin  discussing the CBM's. This is approximately how ?hings will  develop and this is why we must stop having illusions: We  either participate in such a discussion or we do not. And if  Kliridhis' stance so far has been to discuss the CBM's, then we  must make preparations now. We must not lose any more time.</p>

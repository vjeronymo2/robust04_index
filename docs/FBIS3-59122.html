This one would read "It's crime, stupid." For while  the news on the economy gets better every day, crime gets worse.  It now easily tops the list of issues that most concern the  public.    In his State of the Union message on Tuesday [25 January]  night, he spoke strongly of how "violent crime and the fear it  provokes are crippling our society, limiting personal freedom,  and fraying the ties that bind us." He has recognised that it  preoccupies not only the middle and upper classes but most of  the population, including especially the black communities that  are in the thick of it.    He also sees that his response must cut across the political  spectrum, dealing with both causes and symptoms, prevention and  punishment. In this he speaks for the modernising element in  the Democratic Party that is anxious to shed both its welfare  liberalism and the trendy, individualistic radicalism of the  Sixties, both of which are now widely felt to have undermined  the traditional fabric of American society.    There is a tactical element in this, too. Mr Clinton needs  to win back the working- and middle-class Democrats who voted  for Ronald Reagan and are still hesitant about supporting his  own presidency. Indeed, parts of his speech could have been  lifted straight from Mr Reagan. He promised more policemen and  tougher punishments, induding life sentences for those who  commit three violent offences. This may raise doubts among  experts who will ask why rehabilitation should be abandoned  after three offences, but it will go down well among voters,  especially those wanting reassurance that Mr Clinton is not at  heart a traditional liberal.    He should also win wide support for his rather less specific  "community empowerment agenda," designed to counter the  breakdown of community, family and the work ethic, and his call  for something suspiciously like back to basics: parental  responsibility, education and teaching children to "obey the  law, respect our neighbours and cherish our values."    But he also acknowledged the left by calling for partial gun  control, job creation and more money for drug treatment and  universal health care. He will need every ounce of political  support he can raise for his health-care programme because it  will be the central test of his presidency.    The speech thus confirms his determination to be a strong  reforming president, building on a legislative record that is  already impressive. Given his rising popularity as the economy  grows and the deficit shrinks, he now looks in a strong position  to push through a programme of more radical domestic change than  the United States has seen in many decades, provided he is not  tripped up by the various scandals that still hover around him.  If he succeeds, he will also be in a better position to provide  leadership abroad.</p>

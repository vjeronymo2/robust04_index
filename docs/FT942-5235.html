			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: Outside help for troubled workers - Jobs A statistical portrait of employees today does not amount to a cheery picture. Consider that one in three marriages breaks down. One in seven people will have a degree of mental illness during their working life. One in ten employees suffers from an alcohol problem. These difficulties are not left behind when an employee comes to work. 'Frequently stress in domestic life has knock-on effects at work,' says Dr Michael Turner, chief medical officer at Texaco, the oil company. To help workers deal with personal and professional anxieties, more than 80 per cent of companies in the UK offer some form of stress counselling. About 4 per cent now use specialised external counselling services, known as Employment Assistance Programmes. EAPs function as one-stop shops for employees to phone for legal, financial or psychological help. Each employee is given a telephone number where EAP staff are permanently on-call. Most services also offer face-to-face counselling which can be arranged within 48 hours of a phone call. The company pays for a specified range of services on a per capita basis and all employees and their families can use the EAP for free. Services cost about Pounds 18 to Pounds 45 annually per employee. All services are confidential. The employer may receive statistical feedback about employee up-take and types of services requested, but individuals who use the EAP are never identified. Such anonymity helps employees who fear black marks on their personnel records if they discuss anxieties with their managers. 'If people are going to receive counselling they do not want to have it from within the company,' says Cheryl Mann, training and development consultant at Sun Alliance, the insurance company, where almost 20 per cent of staff use the services of Independent Counselling &amp; Advisory Services, the company's contracted EAP. EAPs are also able to draw upon a pool of counsellors, rather than depending on one or two company medical officers. 'The difficulty with having services in-house is that the nature of enquiries are very varied - financial, legal, domestic,' says Turner. 'To find one person who is an expert in all these areas is impossible. The point of EAPs is that they have many experts.' ICAS, which has 45 EAP contracts, has 400 contracts with counsellors around the country. Personal Performance Consultants, another EAP which serves 96 companies, has 55 counselling staff and calls upon an additional 150 freelance therapists. Currently 10 to 20 per cent of employees in companies with EAP contracts phone for help at least once. Alistair Anderson, managing director of PPC, believes the number of employees seeking counselling help, as well as the number of companies contracting with EAPs, will increase sharply in the next decade. 'There are a whole range of pressures in the workplace and the level of awareness of counselling and its value is increasing,' he says. 'Suddenly external counselling services are seen as the answer.' But external services are not always perfect for companies. 'The potential downside of outside EAPs is that they do not know about the organisation,' says Prof Cary Cooper, Professor of Organisational Psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. 'So they are treating the individual but they cannot see if there is something grossly wrong in the organisation that is causing illness.' Cooper, who is studying the effectiveness of EAPs in the UK for the Health and Safety Executive, believes psychologists with both clinical and occupational skills will be trained in the future and be hired by EAPs. Improving the value of EAPs will no doubt be fueled by bottom-line considerations such as reductions in levels of sickness absence, which costs the UK around Pounds 27bn a year, and increases in employee performance. 'Now line managers are beginning to see connections between EAP and performance, rather than just seeing it as a part of the company's duty of care,' says Michael Reddy, chief executive of ICAS.</p>

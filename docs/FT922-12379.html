			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / O&amp;Y needs two new bank loans next week OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Cana-dian property developer, needs to raise vital bank loans by the end of next week in the toughest challenge so far in its fight to avoid filing for protection under bankruptcy procedures. The Bank of England has been told that banks are reluctant to provide the two new loans of Pounds 100m and CDollars 100m (Pounds 47.8m). They are concerned the money could be lost if it were given before agreement is reached on restructuring all O&amp;Y's CDollars 14.3bn debt. O&amp;Y said yesterday: 'We are confident the banks will support us in the belief that it is the best way for the banks to protect their own positions.' A banker involved in negotiations stressed the importance, for the property group's survival prospects, of reaching agreement by the end of next week. Over the next 90 days, O&amp;Y hopes to get its banks' approval for a reconstruction package which would involve a freeze on principal repayments, deferment of interest, the provision of Pounds 100m to pay for work at the Canary Wharf development in London's Docklands and CDollars 100m for Canadian expenses. However, O&amp;Y needs to persuade banks to allow it to draw some of the Pounds 100m and CDollars 100m by the end of the week. Without the new money and later agreement on the restructuring plan, O&amp;Y would be forced to invoke insolvency procedures to seek protection from its creditors in the US, the UK and Canada. Bankers fear such a move would have a devastating effect on the already weak property markets in the US, Canada and the UK. A banker said that confidence among O&amp;Y's 100 banks would improve if the Canadian government agreed to provide a short-term or bridging loan to facilitate the CDollars 300m sale of the Exchange Tower in Toronto. The proceeds of the sale are hoped to be used to pay off some of O&amp;Y's commercial paper - short-term securities the group is being forced to redeem. 'The Canadian government told us it would make a decision on the Exchange Tower by the end of this week (today),' a banker said. 'But they have made those kinds of promises before'. Bankers hope the UK government will help to relieve Canary Wharf's financial problems by agreeing to change the terms of O&amp;Y's Pounds 400m contribution to the construction costs of the Jubilee underground railway extension, which would link Canary Wharf to central London. Bankers hope that the government will agree to defer O&amp;Y's payments for many years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This is what IMA-PRESS has to say: At 1530 local  time [0530 GMT] today, the inhabitants of Vladivostok saw a huge  explosive mushroom, similar to that from a nuclear explosion.  Lieutenant-Colonel (Kuliyev), duty officer of the Maritime  region's civil defense, reported the storage depot contained  neither chemical nor biological nor nuclear munitions, but only  unguided [neupravlayemiye] missiles, shells, and depth charges.  At 2230 Vladivostok time [1230 GMT], the fire and explosions  were continuing. The area was concealed by thick smoke,  therefore it is difficult to assess the damage. There is  information about a great number of injured, mostly people hurt  by glass splinters from windows which were put out in all the  surrounding settlements. The director of Vladivostok private  radio station, (Dmitriy Bruzgin), informed IMA-PRESS that more  than 10 eyewitnesses had phoned the radio with reports of people  injured. Pioneer camps, dormitories and hotels are being  prepared for the evacuation of settlements near to the scene.</p>

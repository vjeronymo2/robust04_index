			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 6 Mar 94 Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to play its  part in portraying a better image of Japan. Beginning this  spring, the ministry plans to begin improving the look of  Japanese ambassadors and other diplomats by having them listen  to advice from experts so they can present their best  impressions when appearing in television interviews. As stated  by a Foreign Ministry source, it is felt "there are not many  diplomats who are used to the mass media." Therefore, the  ministry plans to launch a campaign to promote diplomacy in a  manner "which makes Japan visible" by making on-the-job  improvements in its diplomatic stance, a stance which has often  been described abroad as being "hard to understand."    Those who are to newly undergo this "media training" program  are mostly diplomats who have the greatest chance of being  interviewed by the mass media, such as ambassadors and directors  of overseas centers for public relations and cultural affairs.  Japanese diplomatic missions overseas will sign contracts with  consultants who will review video recordings of the interviews  of various diplomats and check on minute details--such as their  pronunciation, accents, pauses in speech, gestures, and even  their tastes in neckties. In this way, the consultants will  determine how the diplomats can most effectively appeal to their  audiences in future interviews with the mass media.</p>

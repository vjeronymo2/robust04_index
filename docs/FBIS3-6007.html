			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  reached a final agreement on the opening of the Japanese mobile  telephone market, averting U.S. trade retaliation against Japan,  the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said Saturday.    The agreement followed a private-level accord reached  between  Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) and Motorola Inc. of the U.S.    The U.S. was scheduled to unveil a list by March 17 of  Japanese products that will be subject to punitive tariffs  unless there is a negotiated settlement.    The Japanese and U.S. Governments will hold regular meetings  to check whether IDO is implementing its agreement with  Motorola, as demanded by the U.S. Government.    Under the accords on governmental and private levels, IDO  will open 159 new relay stations for Motorola-formula telephone  service by October 1995 to expand Motorola's service network in  Japan.    IDO will also change its radio frequency on the formula of  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) from 8 megahertz to  6.5 megahertz, the same as the Motorola formula.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF: SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> BILL ALLOWS DAMAGES FOR GROUP THREATS  </P> <P> Groups and individuals that use threats and coercion to violate people's  constitutional rights would be "hit in the wallet, where it really hurts" by a  bill overwhelmingly approved by the Assembly. Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd  (D-Carson) offered the legislation as a means of curbing acts of violence and  intimidation by groups like the Ku Klux Klan. Under current law, a court can  grant an injunction against future violations of constitutional rights, but it  cannot award damages to individuals involved.  </P></p>

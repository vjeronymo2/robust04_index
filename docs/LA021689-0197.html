			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3-A;  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR STOPS EL DORADO  </P> <P> Corona del Mar High School put the brakes on El Dorado's high-scoring offense  and scored a stunning 61-43 victory Wednesday night in Placentia in the opening  round of the Southern Section 3-A division playoffs.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar (16-9) opened a 9-0 lead and trailed only once, stopping El  Dorado's 14-game winning streak with a fine defensive effort.  </P> <P> El Dorado had scored 80 or more points in seven games and averaged 78.1 points  per game during its winning streak, but its fast-breaking offense was reduced  to a half-court game.  </P> <P> El Dorado (20-5) made only 16 of 58 shots, and center Matt Luke was the only  effective player offensively with 13 points and 9 rebounds.  </P> <P> "I can't be disappointed with our season, but I was disappointed with this  game," said Wayne Carlson, El Dorado coach. "They took us out of our game and  then we lost our poise. Give them credit, they're tough."  </P> <P> Unlike most of El Dorado's opponents, Corona del Mar did not play a transition  game with the Golden Hawks, trading baskets in a blistering pace. Instead,  Corona del Mar played tenacious, man-to-man defense and set the pace with a  slower tempo.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar methodically wore down El Dorado in the third quarter,  outscoring the Golden Hawks, 18-6, as El Dorado managed to make only a single  field goal.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar guard Matt Cwiertnia limited Mike Renaud, El Dorado's leading  scorer with a 16.4-point average, to only nine points. Center Brian Spratt  contained Luke, the county's leading rebounder with a 13.5 average, and led all  scorers with 23 points.  </P> <P> Teammate Matt Herrington was instrumental in cutting off El Dorado's outlet  passes, continually preventing fast-break opportunities.  </P> <P> Paul Orris, Corona del Mar coach, said he smelled an upset as early as Sunday  when the pairings were announced.  </P> <P> "I sensed they were nervous when I realized they didn't like their draw," Orris  said. "I think they were looking over their shoulders. We limited them to a  half-court game, and they got frustrated right from the start."  </P> <P> El Dorado's frustration reached it a point where two players were accessed  technical fouls in the third quarter as the season was slowly slipping away.  Corona del Mar opened a 38-28 lead with 27 seconds remaining in the third  quarter and it was apparent an upset was in the making.  </P> <P> Spratt sealed the victory in the final quarter, scoring 11 points before Orris  cleared his bench with 1:18 remaining. At that point, El Dorado had scored only  38 points.  </P> <P> "A great defensive effort, and a great team effort," Orris said.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar advances to play Laguna Hills Friday at a site to be determined.  </P></p>

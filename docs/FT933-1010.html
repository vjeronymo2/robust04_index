			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Show pensioners real values - Eric Short urges Lautro to make pension illustrations show more meaningful figures FROM THE beginning of November, life companies will have to show pension illustrations on two new investment return assumptions - 6 per cent and 12 per cent, instead of the present 8.5 per cent and 13 per cent. This change corrects one defect in the present illustration basis - that the rates shown are too high. Many traditional life companies are paying less than 8.5 per cent on their unitised with-profit contracts. But Lautro has failed to remedy other defects in the illustrations, in particular to indicate the real (inflation-adjusted) value of pension benefits as well as the money value. The general purpose of illustrating the benefits on life contracts is to provide the investor with some indication of the benefits provided. This means the calculations must be realistic and the illustration must be in a form that portrays the real value of those benefits. Low cost endowments used to repay a mortgage are monetary contracts because they are used to repay a liability which does not increase with inflation. So it is justified for the illustration to show the benefits in money terms. But pension contracts are real assets, because pension benefits need to rise with inflation in order for beneficiaries to use them to buy goods and services after retirement. Accordingly, illustrations should show not only the monetary value of pension benefits, but also their value in real terms. The Lautro illustration basis does not do this. Lautro is on the right lines in its illustration basis for appropriate personal pensions (used to contract-out of Serps). The contribution, less expenses, is accumulated at two different real rates of return - 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent. The pension thus illustrated relates to current money values and gives a realistic picture. There are disadvantages. First, the real rate shown is the difference between the investment return and earnings growth, whereas the general understanding of real rates of return is the difference between the investment return and price inflation. The second disadvantage is that such a picture is not easily understood by the layman. It is more likely to be understood if the illustration showed separately the money growth in the contributions and the increase in earnings to retirement and expressed the money pension as a percentage of earnings at retirement. However, with ordinary personal pensions, the illustration simply shows the accumulated value of the contributions, less expenses, as a cash sum, using two separate rates of investment return. The objective is to give some indication of the variation in benefits with different returns. The illustration then shows the annuity bought with that cash sum. Thus the benefits are shown in money values at the time they will be taken; there is no requirement to show the real value. The illustration is accompanied by an inflation statement and the individual is left to do his own adjustment. The effect is shown in the tables, which indicate that the new investment rates produce more realistic cash sums than the present rates. Indeed, even on the new rates, the benefits look adequate compared with the individual's earnings. But even if life companies wanted to adjust for inflation, they are not permitted to do so. I therefore had to make my own calculations, shown in italics. In table A, I took the pension and discounted the value back to the present using the Lautro price inflation assumptions - the method used by following the instructions on the Inflation Statement. Using this method, the benefits are shown to be inadequate. Second, the choice of contribution rate and type of annuity quoted is left to the individual and his adviser. Most illustrations are prepared on a level contribution basis and a level single life annuity, thereby presenting a false picture - compare table A with B and the level single life annuity with the increasing annuity plus spouse's pension. The investor should have a realistic picture of the contributions needed to provide an adequate pension - whether he pays them or not is another matter. At least, he would know what he is doing, and not be lulled into a false sense of security. My idea of the minimum information which should be provided is shown in table B - an increasing contribution with two types of annuity. The adjustment for real values in B is my preferred method - showing money values of benefits at the time of retirement and comparing them with estimated earnings growth. This is what happens in real life. If Lautro's assumptions are fulfilled, these are the amounts that will be paid in money terms and as a percentage of earnings.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL PENSION ILLUSTRATIONS: EXAMPLE A  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Man aged 40, wife three years younger.

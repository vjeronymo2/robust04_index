Settlement of Claim <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For grain sorghum and soybeans by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Subtracting from this the total production to count; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Multiplying this result by your share. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For corn by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Multiplying the insured acreage of each type (grain/silage) by the production guarantee for the applicable type; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Multiplying each result by the price election for the applicable type; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Adding these values; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Multiplying the production to count of each type (see subsection 12.(d)) by the price election for that type (see the provisions under section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities)); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Adding these dollar values; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Subtracting the result of step (v) from the result of step (iii); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Multiplying the result by your share. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The total production in bushels (tons for corn silage) (see subsection 12.(d)) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All appraised production as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) That is abandoned; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Put to another use without our consent; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with subsection 12.(e)); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The production to count for corn will be in bushels for grain and in tons for silage as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For harvested acreage, according to the method of harvest; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For unharvested acreage, according to the information contained on your acreage report; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> except as otherwise provided in paragraph 12.(c)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Mature coarse grain production (excluding corn insured or harvested as silage) may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality. Corn insured or harvested as silage will be adjusted for excess moisture and quality only as specified in subsection 12.(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Fifteen percent (15%) for corn (If moisture exceeds 30 percent (30%), production will be reduced 0.2 percent for each 0.1 percentage point above 30 percent (30%)); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Fourteen percent (14%) for grain sorghum; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Thirteen percent (13%) for soybeans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain, result in: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Corn not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Grain sorghum not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut odor), or meets the special grade requirements for smutty grain sorghum; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Soybeans not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except garlic odor), or which meet the special grade requirements for garlicky soybeans; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

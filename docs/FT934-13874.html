			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Mexicans warn on environment THE Mexican government has warned that environmental protection will be undermined if the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is rejected by the US Congress, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Mr Santiago Onate, attorney-general for the environment, said that without Nafta there could be a backlash in Mexico that would make environmental enforcement more difficult, and damage co-operation with the US and Canada. Mr Onate, Mexico's top environmental official, said he was concerned it would be impossible to fund a clean-up of the US-Mexican border, as planned under a billion-dollar scheme. His comments appear part of a concerted campaign by Mexico to pressure the US into approving the treaty. President Carlos Salinas has suggested that rejection of the treaty could set back US-Mexican relations for generations.</p>

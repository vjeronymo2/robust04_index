			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REQUIEM FOR RAPED AND WEEPING EARTH  </P> <P> Scant months ago, one would have thought mankind knew all there was to know of  tyrants with their deceits and infamies, great and petty.  </P> <P> But the disintegration of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and  the beginning of the dissolution of South African apartheid have revealed  something unexpected: Along with their crimes against humanity, the tyrants of  our own time have committed terrible wrongs against the Earth itself. Their  illusory utopias were, as we now see, sustained through the callous plunder of  their unborn children's environmental patrimony.  </P> <P> The stories and photographs coming out of the ruins of the Eastern Bloc are  horrifying. Many of its rivers are open sewers; its air is foul with fumes from  outdated industrial and energy facilities fueled by dirty coal; forests are  dying; ground water and soil have been poisoned by heedless discharge of  chemical wastes. The conditions in sections of the Soviet Union appear even  worse. Two recent disasters there -- the contamination from Chernobyl and the  draining of the Aral Sea -- are among history's worst environmental  catastrophes.  </P> <P> As a report issued by the Worldwatch Institute documents, the situation in  South Africa differs only in scope. To maintain its irrational system, Pretoria  has herded half of all black South Africans onto 13% of the country's land. The  consequence has been the transformation of these so-called "homelands" into  deserts.  </P> <P> To finance such injustice, South Africa relies on a mining industry whose  safety and pollution record is the worst in the Western world. Unable to obtain  other fuels because of its international isolation, Pretoria gets more of its  energy from coal than any other country but North Korea. As a result, sulfur  dioxide emissions are higher than those in East Germany and -- as the  accompanying chart shows -- white South Africans are the world's highest  emitters of carbon, a major contributor to the greenhouse effect.  </P> <P> This is powerful testimony to the lunacy of injustice -- and a chilling  reminder of the damage it ultimately does us all.  </P> <P> CARBON EMISSIONS  </P> <P> Carbon polution from coal (tons per capita)  </P> <P> South Africa (White): 9.3  </P> <P> United States: 5.0  </P> <P> Soviet Union: 3.7  </P> <P> Japan: 2.1  </P> <P> China: 0.6  </P> <P> Source: Worldwatch Institute  </P></p>

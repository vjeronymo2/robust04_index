Otherwise, we will not be able to  solve even the most minor issues. The First Plan started with  the slogan of more production and production in all fields. But  in the end, we had unrestrained imports and foreign debts.  Economic growth and development in various dimensions is  laudable. But the issue is at what price we achieve all this.    1. We have definitely suffered from weak management of the  country's financial resources. The officials at the Ministry of  Economy and Financial Affairs, as well as at the Central Bank  and the Plan and Budget Organization did not provide timely  information on the country's foreign exchange debts and its  massive purchases. As a result, we lacked correct management for  repayment of the country's debts, and ultimately our bank  credits decreased and their guarantees were not accepted. For  purchases from abroad, a third party should ensure our bank  guarantees, which would lead to a considerable rise in the  prices of imported goods. Who is responsible for the losses  that have been inflicted on the country? What is the role of the  Majles?    2. The Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Heavy  Industries resorted to foreign purchases that were outside the  framework of the Plan and thus placed heavy burdens on the  shoulders of the country. Purchases on a usance [preceding word  in English] basis are usually carried out when the buyer is sure  that he can repay within a short period of time. Otherwise, the  interest on what he owes increases considerably and thus makes  problems twice as bad. Such purchases took place outside the  Plan, which was approved by the Majles. These same industries  received $33.5 billion in foreign exchange, which is more than  they were authorized. And the interesting point is that this  violation was coupled with other violations, such as using up  resources in industries for consumer goods that were outside the  framework of the Plan instead of investing as was envisaged by  the approved Plan. What is the duty of the Majles in relation  with this?    Management weakness should be dealt with appropriately. But  more important than this is the way such behavior is justified.    In justifying the excessive rise in consumerism and in  consumer industries, the minister of industries said in an  interview on 23 November 1993: "When a market and a free  economy mechanism prevails, demand regulates supplies and the  production or non-production of an item cannot be dictated."  This comes at a time when we believe that "free economy" is  what the Westerners have to say; but that we do not want to  follow the West but the correct Islamic policy, as our society  and system requires.    In the Islamic system, supply and demand is controlled.  Starting from the government and moving down to the most  ordinary citizen, everyone has to decrease demand and prevent  waste. This is at a time when a weak approach to advertising  has led to an unrestrained increase in consumerism in the  country and when the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of  Iran too is playing a noteworthy part in encouraging consumerism.    The most important aspect of believing in the West is  accepting the West's pattern; and we see this being manifested  in the country's planning. Today we should accept the fact that  technocrats and those whose plans do not have a religions basis  are influential. What they are doing is to overshadow cultural  and spiritual growth with consumerism and gaudiness and then  blame the clergy and the system for the result of their efforts.  The idea that the economy is a worldly issue and that we should  lean on it to choose in which direction we want to move makes us  to consider our efforts to achieve development and, more  important yet, to achieve security to be contingent on  astronomic loans from European countries. But even if we  disregard the problems that stem from this type of outlook and  only take into consideration the experiences of those countries  that have tread this path, we will realize that we will not  achieve what we want. But if we stop tying our hopes for  economic development to the West and rely on our domestic  resources, then we will definitely be able to achieve our  objectives much more quickly. We should not forget that the  main objective is to ensure social justice and to tend to the  deprived masses of the country.</p>

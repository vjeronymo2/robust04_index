			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / This Week: Film/Video Summer is over, school is beginning. But just when you thought it was safe to stop wondering what to do with the children, we get two 'What to do with the children?' movies. Britain and Australia battle for custody of the child-care problem film. But Ken Loach's Ladybird Ladybird and Rolf De Heer's Bad Boy Bubby, both opening this week, have as many differences as likenesses. Homegrown Loach brings a dose of earnest docu-dramatics to his tale of a multiple unmarried mother (Crissy Rock) fighting to stop her brood being snatched by social workers. A true story and moments of power-acting; but too often a tendentious script and overwrought directing. The Dutch-Australian De Heer - more effectively - pours black comedy over the surreal tale of a teenager who has spent his whole boyhood penned at home by a possessive Mum. After a bout of parent-murder he breaks out into the real world: only to find that reality is in short supply even here. As well as bringing his own Martian's gaze to 'everyday' events, his air of dazed innocence is taken as the sign of a Messiah by everyone from the Salvation Army to a grunge rock band. Funny, satirical, highly inventive. Having just broken out of another closed world myself - the Venice Film Festival - I belatedly commend two recent UK openings. Richard Linklater's Dazed And Confused is a period piece that never drowns in nostalgia. A gaggle of 1976 American teenagers cope with sex, drugs, flared trousers and other rites of passage, without ever forfeiting their, or our, rich sense of an epoch's irony. Ronald F. Maxwell's Gettysburg, reaching deeper into the epochs, is a 4 1/2  hour Civil War epic, posted to the big screen from Turner Television. Much better than most processed history; even if the budget for false beards seems to have exceeded that for unflinching realism in the battle scenes. For stay-at-home viewers, the best video releases are a golden oldie and golden 'newie'. Mr Smith Goes To Washington (1939) is the best Frank Capra comedy bar none: James Stewart as a rural hick filibustering for democracy on Capitol Hill. And In The Line Of Fire has Clint Eastwood doing his bit for Washington, as an ex-Dallas security cop suspensefully caught up in new Presidential murder bid.</p>

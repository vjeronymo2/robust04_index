			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] (?Astounded) by the increasingly ruthless chetnik  advances on the protected zone and despite serious warnings by  NATO, foreign analysts concluded almost without exception that  the aggressor army around Gorazde was doing everything possible  to provoke air strikes. They explained this with the  stubbornness of the Pale leadership, ignoring the fact that they  are only pawns in a big game. This time, too, all strings were  in the hands of Belgrade.    Milosevic's regime has placed Serbia in the most difficult  situation in its long history. The process of turning a country  fascist is drawing to an end. The last foreign witnesses,  objective correspondents from CNN and AFP, are being removed.  Others are also being checked out, if they are there at all.    The regime has given up its efforts to improve its image in  the eyes of the world public. Who could possibly get involved  in that when everything else is going downhill. Objective  reporting by foreign media has been declared, we quote, a media  war against the Serbian people, end quote. Not against the  regime, as it is, but against the people -- something foreign  correspondents never insisted on. Serbia has simply found  herself in the same situation that Germany was during the Nazi  era, Russia during Stalinism, Albania during the time of Enver  Hoxha, and Chile during the time of Pinochet, with, of course,  much worse internal problems.    The project of a greater Serbia, the greatest inspiration  for  Serbian fascism, has definitely failed, mainly because of a  number of military defeats in Bosnia. There are even more  troubles in their own home. A new wave of hyperinflation is on  its way. This wave will finally destroy the last strongholds of  the Serbian economy. The embezzlement of foreign currency from  its own citizens is also drawing to an end. It is no longer  possible to explain to the people who sold their foreign  currency to the banks that these were automatically bought by  some new rich men for the freshly printed super dinars, which  will soon be completely worthless.    To stay in power and divert the people's attention from the  insoluble problems, Milosevic had to invent new enemies, much  bigger and more dangerous than the previous ones. And who is  more suitable at present than the biggest world power, the  United States? Belgrade propaganda therefore produced a new  puppet show in the public in the sense of (?evil) Americans,  persuaded by evil Muslims, treacherously attacked the innocent  Serbian people. Of course, they consciously concealed the fact  that the action by the United Nations enjoyed the general  support of the world and that the Russians complained only  because they were not consulted. Vitaliy Churkin was angry  because Karadzic's Serbs deceived him and denied their attacks  on Gorazde. Moreover, they never mentioned the reasons for the  attacks by the allied aircraft. They did not dare say that  because of the committed chetnik crimes the world could allow  hordes of bloodsuckers enter this suffering town and repeat what  they had already done in Zvornik, Visegrad, and Foca.</p>

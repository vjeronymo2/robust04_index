			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Tokyo tries to close chapter on 'comfort women' JAPAN yesterday attempted to seal a chapter in its history which has provoked fierce hostility from its Asian neighbours, by acknowledging that its imperial army during the Pacific war coerced a large number of women into providing sexual services in the countries it occupied. The admission came on what was expected to be the final day of the Liberal Democratic party's 38 years in office, and 48 years since Japan's forces surrendered. A statement by Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary and newly elected party leader, went further than previous efforts by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the outgoing prime minister, to atone for the so-called 'comfort women' issue. It follows an 18-month government inquiry which showed that women were kept in 'comfort stations' most notably in Korea but also in China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, Hong Kong, Macao, the then Malaya, New Guinea and French Indochina, as well in as Japan itself. Some 35 surviving Korean inmates gave testimony. Several court hearings remain to be processed in Japan's tortuous legal system. The timing of the report's release signals a desire to resolve the issue on the part of the LDP, which is trying to project a more open image in the wake of its defeat in last month's general election. On Tuesday, Mr Tsutomu Hata, of the Japan Renewal party and likely deputy prime minister in a new government, and the Social Democratic party's Ms Takako Doi, designated lower house speaker, both promised to seek full reconciliation with countries invaded during the war. Mr Kono said yesterday the brothels were operated 'in response to the request of the military authorities' whose personnel at times 'directly took part in the recruitments' of women, which 'were conducted generally against their will'. Accepting that the practice was both widespread and of long duration, he said the women 'suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds'. Mr Miyazawa, confronted with the issue before a trip to Seoul last year, offered an apology in which he said it was undeniable that women had been recruited. The extent of coercion involved has not been admitted before, however. Still, the latest report gives no indication of the number of women involved (estimates suggest upwards of 100,000 in Korea alone) and insists that private recruiters were largely responsible for rounding them up. While a senior foreign ministry official acknowledged last night that many of the women were held without pay, he declined to accept terms such as sex slaves and avoided recognising the episode as a war crime.</p>

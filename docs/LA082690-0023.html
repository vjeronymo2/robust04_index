			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YES, SOME DO HATE IMPRESSIONISM  </P> <P> Re Christopher Knight's Aug. 12 commentary, "Lasting Favorable Impressions":  </P> <P> Yes, Mr. Knight, there is someone who loathes the Impressionists. I hate the  bright colors that look like they are straight out of the tube, I hate the  childish, unfinished look, I hate the myopic fuzziness, I hate what  Impressionism developed into in the 20th Century.  </P> <P> But most of all I hate the media dictators of the last 40 years who have made  the Impressionists into everlasting images of the "avant-garde" and untouchable  cultural icons. Well, I'm an iconoclast!  </P> <P> How can one decide what his favorite art is when the options presented are so  limited? People do not know that they are kept from non-approved art because  they have never been allowed to see for themselves, or they have been told this  is what the Impressionists were revolting against and therefore it must be bad  art.  </P> <P> When I mention the names of the artists I think are great, I am met with two  responses: (1) "I never heard of them -- how good could they be?" or (2)  "They're trash, because that is what everybody believes." The names: Ingres,  Ama-Tadema, Tissot, Winterhalter, Parrish (yes, Maxfield Parrish!). The artists  I revere could take reality and better it -- they could make the casual  observer see what he frequently missed in nature.  </P> <P> Millions of art-conscious people believe as they've been taught -- that it  isn't art if it isn't fuzzy and indistinct. There are a tiny few of us who  think for ourselves.  </P> <P> ROBYN FRISCH  </P> <P> New York  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Kim Son-ki report from Moscow] </F>   [Text] It was learned that an ROK-Russia joint declaration,  the New Moscow Declaration, supporting our position surrounding  the North Korean nuclear issue, will be adopted at the  Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Yeltsin summit, scheduled to start  on 1 June.    In the New Moscow Declaration, Russia will actively support  our view on the North Korean nuclear issue, and reveal that it  fully supports efforts to bring about peace on the Korean  peninsula. It seems that a passage stating that all matters of  concern and interest between the two countries will be closely  maintained by dialogue and another one on readjusting the past  history, such as the Korean Air shooting incident, will be  included in the declaration. It will also include the human  rights issue such as that of the North Korean loggers.    This kind of joint declaration was not made when President  Kim visited China and Japan. It is believed that this  declaration has greater weight than the regular joint statements  that sum up the results of summits.    A diplomatic source said that a consultative protocol, which  provides for the foreign ministers and vice foreign ministers to  meet regularly, will be exchanged during President Kim's visit  to Russia. It also revealed that an agreement on preventing  maritime accidents, an environment cooperative agreement, and an  agreement to protect migratory birds will be signed.</p>

Financial Secretary Sir Hamish  Macleod declined to say what the figure might be, but he did not  rule out that it could be close to the $20 billion suggested  earlier by a senior official.    The healthy financial position is set to benefit the  construction of infrastructure projects, including the Chek Lap  Kok Airport, as Sir Hamish conceded that higher reserves  afforded the Government more choices in funding of public works  plans. Sir Hamish for the first time said there would  definitely be a surplus this year instead of the $3.36 billion  deficit he projected in his March Budget speech. "There is  going to be a surplus but I am not embarrassed by that. I am  only embarrassed if we seriously underspend on public works," he  said. Underspending by about $6 billion that occurred the  previous financial year was unlikely to be repeated.    Based on share transactions volume, the government income  from the stock market is expected to be several billions bigger  than the $9 billion forecast in March. Sir Hamish noted that  mortgage lending by the banks had grown by about 15 percent,  while property prices rose by 20 percent. But he stressed that  the Government would continue the guideline of keeping the  growth of public expenditure in line with the growth of the  economy. "I don't think we should get too much in the frame of  mind that simply because we have a surplus we can, or should,  spend it," Sir Hamish said.    Hong Kong finished with a $22 billion surplus for the last  financial year and the expectation of another this year has  prompted suggestions that the territory can afford to pump much  more money into the airport plan than the $16.6 billion capital  injection envisaged in the first financial package.    But the Financial Secretary said affordability was a  separate  question from how much money was desirable to pump into the  project. "I can't deny that if the reserves are better, we have  more choices--whether it is to build other infrastructure  projects or pump more money into the airport or anything else.  It's just a statement of fact," he said.</p>

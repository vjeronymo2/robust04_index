			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 20 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The United States  will support Honduras in its aspirations to join the UN Security  Council, the Foreign Relations Ministry reported today.    In a communique, the Honduran Foreign Ministry announced  U.S.  Ambassador to Tegucigalpa William Pryce expressed Washington's  support for Honduras. The United States "has the pleasure to  support Honduras' candidacy and hopes to work with its  representative at the Security Council that will be installed in  1995," the U.S. envoy said, according to the text of the  communique. Pryce remarked it will be "a pleasure and honor to  give them our support," while Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto  Paz Aguilar explained that the White House decision is valued  "highly," according to the document.    U.S. support of this nation's hopes to become a nonpermanent  member of the Security Council "represents a good piece of news,  a specific demonstration of the excellent relations between  Honduras and the United States," Paz Aguilar emphasized.    Honduras has become the sole candidate of the group of  nations from Latin America and the Caribbean for the election  that will take place during the 49th session of the UN General  Assembly, scheduled for next autumn.    The UN Security Council has five permanent members -- China,  the United States, France, Great Britain, and Russia -- and 10  nonpermanent members, whose membership changes every two years.</p>

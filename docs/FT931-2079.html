			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: Investors unsettled by rise in RPI THE gilt market is poised for an increase in yields across the maturity range after the steady increase in prices in recent weeks. A possible taste of what is in store came on Friday, when prices at the long end of the yield curve fell by about half a point on worse-than-expected news on UK retail price inflation. For short-dated gilts, yields fell by 15 to 20 basis points on the week as financial markets absorbed implications that the UK government is unlikely to cut base rates from their current 6 per cent in the near future. At the long end, prices rose marginally on the week. The yield on the 8.75 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2017 fell to 8.30 per cent on Friday night, from 8.33 per cent the previous Friday. The small upward movement in prices for long-dated gilts seen last week may, however, be difficult to sustain. That is because of the inflationary pressures that may be building up, together with the price-depressing effects of an estimated Pounds 45bn programme of gilt issues in the financial year beginning next month. The 1.8 per cent increase in the retail prices index in the year to last month, after a 1.7 per cent year-on-year rise in January, unsettled some gilt investors. The unease was magnified by news that the underlying inflation rate, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage payments, was 3.4 per cent in February. In January, the corresponding year-on-year rise was 3.2 per cent. The inflation data might indicate that higher import costs following the 13 per cent fall in sterling since September are working their way into the economy. The big funding programme for 1993-1994 will get under way a week on Wednesday when the Bank of England will auction between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn of stock in the maturity range 2008 to 2013. Details of the specific bonds, the amount to be auctioned and the terms will be announced tomorrow. During 1993-94, auctions are to take place roughly once a month. They will be the main way of financing the PSBR for the year, which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, said last week in his Budget statement would be about Pounds 50bn. The chancellor's simultaneous announcement of an end to the full funding rule - meaning that purchases of gilts by banks and building societies would count towards the PSBR - was welcomed in the gilts market. However, the direct impact of the change on the funding programme may be minor. At present, the incentives for banks and building societies to buy gilts at around the five-year level, after borrowing at shorter maturities at lower interest rates, is far from overwhelming. That problem could be rectified in the event of a steepening of the yield curve at the short end. However, the most likely way in which this could happen - through a cut in base rates sanctioned by the government to speed recovery - is considered not particularly probable, on the grounds that a fragile upturn appears to be on the way. That certainly was the inference from the announcement last week that seasonally-adjusted unemployment dropped by 22,000 last month, the first fall in three years. Even so, the position on interest rates is extremely fluid, given that Mr Lamont's three-year package of fiscal tightening announced in the Budget should, in theory, give him plenty of room to ease monetary policy should evidence arise of continuing weakness in economic activity. As for the PSBR, by the end of the week the gilt market had recovered from its initial alarm at the high estimate for 1993-1994 unveiled by the chancellor. In the Budget in March last year, the Treasury's corresponding forecast had been for a Pounds 32bn deficit, while in the November Autumn Statement the department put the figure at about Pounds 44bn. Many in the gilt market, however, had already accepted that the Treasury's previous forecasts were too optimistic and had adjusted their own projections. According to last week's Budget projections, the deficit will come down to Pounds 44bn in 1994-95, Pounds 39bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 35bn in 1996-97. That compares with unpublished Treasury estimates in early-1992 of Pounds 35bn, Pounds 29bn and Pounds 16bn for the three years in question. The numbers which were eventually published in last year's Budget were Pounds 25bn, Pounds 19bn and Pounds 6bn respectively.</p>

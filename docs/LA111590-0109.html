			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Michael Milken's Sentencing Delayed: Sentencing of the former junk bond  financier will take place next week, a clerk for U.S. District Judge Kimba M.  Wood said. The sentencing was expected to take place this week.  </P> <P> No reason for the delay was given. A specific date and time for the sentencing  was not announced. Milken, 44, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s  high-yield bond department, faces up to 28 years in prison for his guilty plea  to six felony counts of conspiracy and fraud related to illegal securities  trading. Prosecutors are seeking a stiff prison sentence. Milken and his  attorneys have asked the judge for a term of community service. Sentencing  initially was scheduled for Oct. 1 but was delayed for a hearing into  additional government allegations against Milken. Milken submitted a lengthy  letter to the judge accepting responsibility for his crimes but requesting  leniency.  </P></p>

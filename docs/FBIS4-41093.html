			<p>BFN     [Text] Today in Riga, the Saeima Committee on Defense and  Internal Affairs and Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis met the  members of the Swedish Parliament's Defense Committee, who are  currently acquainting themselves with the work of their  colleagues in the Baltic countries. The Swedish colleagues were  interested in Latvia's military doctrine, the national armed  forces structures, the relationship between the Home Guard and  the defense forces, the problems of guarding the borders, and  women's role in the creation of defense policy.    Yesterday, the members of the Swedish parliamentary Defense  Committee visited Lithuania; tomorrow, they arrive in Estonia.    It should be noted that this is the first instance since the  declaration of Latvian independence that the full complement of  another country's parliamentary commission has visited Latvia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] France is granting 200 million CFA francs to Congo  to ensure public security in Brazzaville. The Congolese  interior minister has just presented a plan designed jointly by  Congo and France to reform the security forces. Here are more  details from Assane Diop:    [Begin Diop recording] Soldiers and policemen must be able  to  cope with new forms of violence without killing people while  maintaining law and order. This is one of the Congolese  interior minister's objectives. Congo has called on France to  train its security forces. The French Police Department for  International Cooperation Service will be in charge of the  project. The head of the department, Jean-Louis Ottavi, visited  Brazzaville recently. French experts will first audit the  current operations of the Congolese security forces. These  operations were the object of controversy following the bloody  clashes which have recently pitched supporters of the president  and the opposition against each other. The security plan, which  has just been announced, will cost thousands of millions of CFA  francs, the Congolese minister said. Congo will finance the plan  with French support. [end recording]</p>

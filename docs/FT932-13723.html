			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Middle firms in muddle Mid-sized accountancy firms in the UK need to improve their marketing skills if they are to survive, according to a survey* by Huthwaite, a consultancy firm. Most have only a basic understanding of marketing and need to restructure their operations and approach to improve the business they generate. The report focused on mid-sized firms - those below the Big Six accountants  -which are sensitive about the labels attached to them and prefer to be called 'the national firms'. It argues that the partnership culture often acts as a break on marketing, with partners - many of whom are resistant to the idea of selling - normally controlling contact with clients and potential clients. The survey suggested that the accountants tended to be highly protective, and did not pass on any marketing leads they had to colleagues who might be better equipped to win a new client or sell additional services to an existing one. Many firms used seminars as a 'reward' for existing clients rather than as a way to bring in potential new business. Few had any formal, structured procedures that would allow them to assess their effectiveness in marketing. In general, the level of information was poor. One firm proudly told the interviewers that it was setting up a database listing clients and the staff working on them - an elementary device that should have been in place for a long time. Huthwaite recommends that firms should get more people involved in marketing and should appoint someone with overall responsibility to 'cajole, co-ordinate and coach' others. It says rewards linked to career development as well as money should be made available to those who are successful in generating new business. *What future for mid-sized accountancy firms?

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / CGIP seeks higher CarnaudMetalbox stake CGIP, the French holding company, confirmed it is considering raising its stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging company, by buying shares from MB-Caradon, the UK building products group, but stressed that it would not buy all of MB-Caradon's 25.3 per cent holding. Pechiney, the French state-controlled packaging group, has emerged as a potential purchaser for another part of the MB-Caradon stake. Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, said Pechiney could 'not remain aloof' from the situation. MB-Caradon announced on Monday that it planned to seek shareholders' permission to sell its stake in CarnaudMetalbox. CGIP already owns 25.3 per cent of CarnaudMetalbox and has pre-emptive rights over MB-Caradon's shares. The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), the market watchdog, yesterday stipulated that if CPIG raised its stake by more than 7 per cent it would be forced to mount a full bid for CarnaudMetalbox. CGIP said there was 'absolutely no question' of a full bid. MB-Caradon hopes to secure shareholders' approval to sell its CarnaudMetalbox holding, valued yesterday at Pounds 505.5m (Dollars 725m), at an extraordinary general meeting on March 4. There is speculation that MB-Caradon has already lined up a potential purchaser.</p>

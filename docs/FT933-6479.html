			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Technology: Personal telephone number may be up - Worth Watching The concept of a single personal telephone number, that follows the consumer from home to work and into the car, may seem alluring. But the technology research company Ovum is cautious about whether UPT (universal personal telecommunications) will gain widespread acceptance. In its report, 'Personal Numbering Services: the Business Opportunities for UPT', Ovum forecasts that only 132m European customers will subscribe to the service within the next 10 years and 156m in the US. This will result in projected revenues of Dollars 6.8bn (Pounds 4.56bn) per annum in Europe and Dollars 12bn in the US by the year 2000. Ovum: UK, 071 255 2670.</p>

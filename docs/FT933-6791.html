			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BUSINESS in London's derivatives markets fell away even further yesterday, leaving traders with little indication of the markets' underlying trends, writes Terry Byland. A firm opening in the September contract on the FT-SE Index proved a sign more of hope than conviction, since a further gain in the contract merely brought out a few sellers. After touching 3,069, the contract dipped to 3,054 before closing the session at 3,056. The closing level put a premium of 7 points on the contract against the cash market, about one point over estimated Fair Value. Volume dipped to 5,914 contracts from the 6,709 recorded on Monday. Overseas investors seemed unwilling to take views on the chances of a cut in German discount rates when the Bundesbank policy council meets tomorrow. Dealers said that the locals made most of the running. Traded options, too, had a quiet day, although volume at 22,382 contracts improved somewhat on Monday's session. Trading in the FT-SE contract jumped from 4,449 contracts to 6,773. Barclays, still responding to the appointment of a chief executive, topped the actives stocks list with 3,414 contracts. The Euro FT-SE was also relatively busy, with 2,540. Speculative interest in Lasmo continued, prompted by interest from Continental Europe, and 1,084 contracts were traded.</p>

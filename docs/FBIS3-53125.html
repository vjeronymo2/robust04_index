			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, general secretary of </F> Islamic Jihad in Palestine, by Tahir Shuraytah; place and date  not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Shuraytah] Why have you  been refusing to meet with Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]?    [Al-Shaqaqi] We believe that after the Oslo accord there is  no longer any chance left for a meeting. There is no  significance or benefit to such a meeting. As to why this  meeting did not take place before the accord; the main reason is  political. We have been witnessing a continuous retreat in the  political position in return for nothing.    [Shuraytah] How do you envisage the future of the self-rule  areas from the economic and political perspectives?    [Al-Shaqaqi] Israel has always tried to get rid of the Gaza  Strip. The dream or idea of throwing Gaza into the sea is not  Rabin's or Peres'. Since the fifties at least, it has been  Ben-Gurion's dream and idea. In practice, the Gaza Strip was  excluded from the Labor Party's platform. Even Shamir perceived  Israel's problem to be the Gaza Strip and its inhabitants, not  the Arabs as a whole. He said so in one of his statements a  year before his party lost to Labor in the recent Knesset  elections.    As for the West Bank, the picture is completely different.  The strategic importance of its range of mountains, its  location, its religious Jewish heritage, and the settlements in  it will make withdrawal from it now or after five years more  complicated. Therefore, I believe that there will be two  different models of self-rule even if the accord is implemented.  One in Gaza, and the other in the West Bank. In both cases,  the Israelis will try their utmost to prevent this self-rule  from being transformed into a Palestinian state. As for the  economic aspect, according to the declaration of principles and  our understanding of it, the self-rule area will remain tied to  Israel's economy.    [Shuraytah] What effect will the Gaza-Jericho agreement have  on Jordan? And what is the reason for Jordanian apprehension  concerning this agreement?    [Al-Shaqaqi] On the surface it seems that Jordan is the  biggest loser. Geopolitics does not permit the establishment of  three entities between Iraq's western borders and the  Mediterranean Sea. The setting up of some sort of an  independent entity in Jericho, the rest of the West Bank, and  Gaza will be at Jordan's expense and will lead to severe tension  in Jordan as half the population there is Palestinian.    Since the agreement does not give the Palestinians anything  and does not satisfy them, Jordan will remain the solution as  the alternative Palestinian homeland.    If we take into account that the West and the Jews believe  that since its inception Jordan's role has been to absorb the  effects of the inauspicious Balfour Declaration, this role now  seems to be in its latest stages in the wake of an agreement  that has given most of Palestine to the Israelis. Moreover,  Jordan not only fears losing its role in the region, but also  fears disintegration. This fear is reflected in the alarming  concessions at the talks with the Israelis. The agreement's  Palestinian team is competing with Jordan in making concessions  to acquire this role.    [Shuraytah] In the event that Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] participates in the self-rule elections, what will be  your position in view of the fact that you will remain almost  alone in confronting the current plan?    [Al-Shaqaqi] The brothers in Hamas have reiterated to us  that they oppose and will boycott these elections and that their  position on this matter is final and decisive. In any event,  our own position stems from our principled commitment to our  homeland, people, and nation. It also stems from our  understanding and analysis of the conspiracy against Palestine,  of the facts, and of the meaning of this inauspicious agreement  in terms of forging an alliance with the enemy against the  nation and the entire region.</p>

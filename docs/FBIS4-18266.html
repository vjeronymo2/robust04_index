'Umar al-Muntasir, Libyan secretary general of the People's  Bureau for External Liaison and International Cooperation who  arrived in Ankara on an official visit yesterday, called on  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin this morning. Later the Turkish  and Libyan delegations headed by the two ministers met. In a  statement issued prior to the meeting, Cetin said that bilateral  relations were raised to their highest level through the support  extended by Libya during the Cyprus Peace Operation and  continued as a result of Turkey's contribution to Libya's  development and advancement. He noted that the monies owed to  Turkish contracting firms in Libya are being paid according to a  system that uses oil as payment.

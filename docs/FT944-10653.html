			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (12): Details under discussion - Enaf metallurgical plants The Enaf-Vinto metallurgical smelter complex just east of Oruro, is close to Bolivia's principal tin mines, Huanuni and Colquiri, owned by the state mining company Comibol. Between them, the two produce some 7,000 tonnes of tin concentrate a year - of a national total of about 18,000 tonnes. Comibol officials expect tin concentrates output to rise to anything between 23,000 and 39,000 tonnes after Huanuni and Colquiri are transferred to the private sector through joint venture or leasing agreements. Vinto is a Comibol subsidiary. Because it was never nationalised, there is no constitutional obstacle to transfer of ownership. Rationalisation has cut the workforce sharply to about 1,000 from the 2,000-plus employed in the mid-80s while productivity in certain areas, such as the tin smelter, has increased many times over. The German government has donated DM10m for environmental control project. The Vinto complex comprises three metallurgical plants, two for tin (high grade and low grade) plus an antimony smelter. All came on stream in the 1970s. The high-grade, German-built smelter uses the fuming process, which allows treatment of complex concentrates such as Bolivia's in a single stage. 'Vinto is good business, it requires little new investment and enjoys a high international reputation - the Enaf trade mark for 99.95 per cent pure tin is known worldwide,' says Mr Carlos Morales, adviser to Comibol. Antimony production was recommenced in mid-1990 after heavy operating losses caused a 4 1/2 -year stoppage. Bolivia has traditionally been the world's second-largest antimony producer after China and ahead of the former Soviet Union and South Africa. Output, at some 6,000 tonnes a year, is less than half of that produced a decade ago, however. An interesting item on Comibol's books is the Karachipampa lead and silver smelter and refinery, built in the mining department of Potosi in the early 1980s by a German-Belgian consortium. The complex cost Dollars 147m and installed capacity is for 51,000 tonnes of concentrate a year. Karachipampa was hammered by problems at its scheduled 1985 start-up. Bolivian lead concentrate output slumped to levels inadequate to supply the smelter, while the Soviet Kivcet technology used for the smelting process was seriously questioned. As a result, Karachipampa never went into operation. The panorama is now somewhat brighter. Lead concentrate production is on the increase with some 25,000 tonnes projected for next year; and the Kivcet process has been given the metallurgical green light, with several western countries now employing it. According to Mr Morales, the plant's unused machinery and equipment has been well maintained and is virtually ready to go. The government has assumed all Karachipampa's debts. A private sector operator would be free to enter into a joint venture or lease option for Comibol lead-silver mines such as San Jose or San Vicente, or to buy from private producers in the area. Precise details of capitalisation are still under discussion. The Vinto smelter and refineries could well be offered as separate packages along with complementary Comibol mining deposits to ensure a raw materials source.</p>

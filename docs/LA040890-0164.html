Chief Ranger Ray  Bloomer, who is blind, found Saturday that the exhibit case that contained the  gun was loose.  </P> <P> The pistol, now valued at $500,000, was given to Roosevelt after its recovery  from the battleship Maine, whose sinking in Havana Harbor in 1898 led to the  U.S. declaration of war against Spain.  </P> <P> The gun's blued barrel is inscribed: "July 1, 1898, San Juan, carried and used  by Col. Theodore Roosevelt," and "From the sunken battleship MAINE."  </P></p>

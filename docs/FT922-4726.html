			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Letter: Britain's trade deficits should surely be a matter of concern Sir, Samuel Brittan professes ('Countries don't go broke', June 1) a lack of concern over the latest UK trade statistics, which, in April, recorded a deficit in non-oil visible trade - his preferred measure - of Pounds 1.46bn. This number, though receiving considerable media attention (perhaps now that the general election is safely out of the way]), was not vastly out of line with the monthly average deficit for this year of Pounds 1.2bn, or Pounds 15bn annually. But concern surely is in order when, at a similar stage in the economic cycle during all previous post-Second World War recessions, a depressed level of domestic spending has been sufficient, by curtailing imports and permitting exportables to be switched from home to overseas markets, to ensure substantial surpluses in visible trade. The continuing deterioration in the UK's relative economic performance, as evidenced by the worsening internal-external balance trade-off, is such that the level of domestic spending now required to get unemployment down from the rapidly-approaching 3m mark to a more humane figure of, say, 0.5m would, for a given (current) level of demand in the rest of the world, probably be associated with current account deficits of around 10 per cent of GDP. And I cannot think Samuel Brittan believes that to be the real rate of return on the UK's overseas assets] Moreover, those who profess concern at current structural weaknesses in the UK economy cannot be so easily dismissed, as his reference to Gosplan is presumably meant to suggest, as advocates of a siege economy. Such a thoroughly unfair trivialisation of his opponents' position does the cause of public debate no good whatsoever.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 2/6/1994 -- Deputies endorsed by  vote on June 2 Article 8 of the Education Bill, which stipulates  that education of all grades shall proceed in Romanian. It was  also established that the study and learning of the Romanian  language as the official language in the state shall be  compulsory for all Romanian citizens, irrespective of  nationality.    After contradictory discussions, the deputies rejected the  amendments promoted by Varujan Vosganian (Armenians' Union of  Romania) and Benedek Nagy (Democratic Union of Hungarians in  Romania) protesting the introduction of this article, which  belongs to the general principles of expressing provisions on  the education in the mother tongues of the nationalities and in  the languages of international circulation [sentence as  received]. The amendments were assessed as "overzealous,"  especially considering that by the same article the deputies  voted in favor of guaranteeing the right of persons belonging to  ethnic minorities to study and get instructed in their mother  tongue, and the education bill gives special attention to this  issue in other articles.</p>

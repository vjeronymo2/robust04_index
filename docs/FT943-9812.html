			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Welfare costs threaten to swamp US federal budget, Clinton told Runaway US government spending on pensions and healthcare is in danger of swamping the entire federal budget, a bipartisan commission warned yesterday. A preliminary report said if current trends continue unchecked, by the year 2012 the entire federal budget will be consumed by entitlements such as social security, which provides government pensions, and Medicare, which gives health insurance to the elderly. These increase automatically each year with the growth of the population and with inflation, and by interest on the government debt. The commission, chaired by Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, called for action to address the problem before it becomes overwhelming. 'What we are saying is that if we continue the trend lines that we are going right now, we are going to find the federal government essentially converted into an ATM machine,' Senator Kerrey said. The commission is due to present a more detailed final report in December - after the congressional elections - with its recommendations for action. The interim report was intended to raise public awareness of the extent of the problem. Although many voters favour cuts in government spending, they believe that the budget deficit can be brought into line by eliminating waste, fraud and welfare payments to the unemployed. But besides interest on the national debt, which is expected to eat up 14 per cent of government spending next year, the largest programmes in the federal budget are social security and Medicare, highly popular middle class benefits which together account for one third of all government spending. While social security currently generates an annual surplus, most of its beneficiaries take out much more than they put in, and the ageing of the US population means changes will be needed at some point. When the social security trust fund faced imminent insolvency in 1983, Congress raised payroll taxes in a reform it hoped would last until the year 2049. Already, however, the date of the next projected insolvency has been brought forward to 2029. Medicare, like other health spending, continues to climb much faster than the general rate of inflation and hopes are now dwindling that a reform of the healthcare system would bring it under control. The imbalance between benefits and taxation raises questions of fairness between generations. Where the average baby boomer born in 1950 is projected to pay 33 per cent of a lifetime income in taxes, after deducting the benefits received from social security, the same figure for someone born in 1993 would, if current benefit rates were maintained, climb to 82 per cent. The commission was set up by President Bill Clinton to fulfil a promise made to Senator Kerrey in return for his vote for last year's budget. Since Senator Kerrey now says he will not vote for the healthcare reform bill being debated, Mr Clinton may have to promise to do something about the commission's proposals to win him over once again.</p>

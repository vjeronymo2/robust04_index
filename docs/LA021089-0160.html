			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews.  </P> <P> Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714)  859-9393. Open for dinner only, Tuesday through Sunday from 6 to 10 p.m. All  major cards.  </P> <P> Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic dining  areas anywhere. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no utensils, and  are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings the evening will bring are  b'stilla (a sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a  savory vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire.  </P> <P> Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open 7 days, from 10  a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on weekdays, 10 a.m. to 3 a.m. weekends. All major cards.  </P> <P> Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a  crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture. The crowd is as diverse as the  menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic centered beef) are  two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50  noodle dishes.  </P> <P> McCharles House, 335 South C St., Tustin. (714) 731-4063. Open Mondays through  Saturdays 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. for lunch, 2 to 6 p.m. for tea; Thursdays through  Saturdays 5:30 to 9 p.m. for dinner.  </P> <P> If you have never experienced a proper English tea, then now's your chance at  this converted Victorian house, built circa 1885 in old town Tustin. You'll  even get heart-shaped scones. Lunch is a choice of salads and little tea  sandwiches. Dinner is simple and sweet. Don't miss a tempting array of  home-baked goodies, like the rich chocolate cake served with clotted cream.  </P></p>

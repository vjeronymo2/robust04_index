			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (2): Three fat years - Economy is reinforced by mass immigration GIVEN the recessionary gloom in Western Europe and the US, there is understandable satisfaction in Israel that the country will show real growth this year of some six per cent, the third year running the economy has expanded by more than five per cent, writes HUGH CARNEGY. The engine of this growth has been mass immigration from the former Soviet Union which has since late 1989 totalled some 450,000 - increasing the population by no less than 10 per cent. This huge inflow has at once posed great problems and offered great opportunities for the economy. The newcomers have pushed up unemployment to record levels at more than 11 per cent of the workforce. But the highly-educated immigrants are seen as a precious resource for generating a period of sustained, export-oriented growth the like of which Israel has failed to achieve since the early 1970s. This year, a sense of optimism that this can be achieved has been augmented by the prospect of regional stability held out by the Middle East peace negotiations, and the advent of the Labour-led government which promises growth-oriented policies. There remain nonetheless big question marks. Successive Israeli governments have for the best part of a decade promised to reform the heavily state-dominated and aid-dependent economy but have largely failed to deliver. For the moment, however, some important indicators are pointing in the right direction. Unlike 1991, when per capita growth was zero, real GDP growth per capita will grow by up to three per cent. Inflation has tumbled from 18 per cent last year and may be in single figures for the whole of 1992 for the first time in years. It is expected to stabilise at around nine per cent in 1993. Exports, which fell in 1991, have grown by an encouraging 14 per cent. A government-fuelled construction boom accounted for as much as 50 per cent of growth both in 1991 and in 1992. This has now peaked, reined in partly by the new government, and will result in lower growth rates in 1993, with business sector growth forecast in the 1993 budget at four per cent after seven per cent this year. But, assuming immigration remains steady at around 100,000 a year, the government expects this to surge significantly again in the subsequent two years. It forecasts that exports will rise by more than eight per cent for each of the next three years. During that time, the state will spend Dollars 8bn on infrastructural programmes. Unemployment is seen falling to nine per cent by 1993. This year, the growth in jobs in the economy slowed despite the growth in output. This worries many in the government. 'Some ministers want me to pay to create more jobs artificially,' says Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister. 'But we would have to carry the burden of this on our backs for years. It would prevent real growth in the economy.' Instead, the intention is to bring down the budget deficit from 3.2 per cent of GDP next year to close to zero in 1995. The expanded foreign borrowing programme built into the government's planning is underpinned by Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees spread over five years approved by Washington this autumn. Optimism is reflected in a dizzying bull run on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) and growing signs of interest by foreign investors. The TASE equity index is up 65 per cent this year, and has been rising since 1990. A flurry of new issues has taken the capitalisation of the equity market, at Dollars 28bn, ahead of the traditionally dominant government bond market for the first time. In September, the First Israel Fund aimed at foreign investors was launched by four US investment houses. Others are set to follow. 'Suddenly foreign brokerage and investment houses have discovered Israel,' says Mr David Friedman, chief executive of Bank Leumi. 'They are attracted by the performance of the TASE and industry, the expectations surrounding the peace process, the change of government and the approval of the US guarantees.' There are, however, still plenty of factors at play which fuel the fears of the sceptics. The country still relies heavily on unilateral transfers of funds. These totalled more than Dollars 6bn in 1991 - the majority made up of US military and economic grant aid - or a whopping 10 per cent of GDP. Without them a current account balance of payments deficit of Dollars 850m would have been of unmanageable proportions. With the deficit set to grow as investment rises, Israel will be extremely vulnerable to any cuts in US foreign aid programmes under the Clinton administration. On the other hand, despite the recent increase in foreign investor interest, the uncomfortable fact is that total net foreign investment has been negative in three of the last four years - to the tune of Dollars 460m in 1991. More than two thirds of economic activity in Israel is still accounted for by the public sector, government-owned companies or government-controlled institutions, a far higher proportion than, for example, in Israel's main European trading partners. The export-oriented private sector is relatively small. 'That part of the economy works - but it is the only part of the economy that works,' says Mr Alvin Rabushka, an economist from California's Stanford University who is a harsh critic of Israel's economic structure. The government has enacted significant reforms in the capital markets and begun a privatisation programme. But many doubt the Labour government's ability to achieve such reforms. The defence industries offer only one example of several areas which require expensive and difficult reform - but which are bastions of the Histadrut trade union federation, to which Labour is affiliated. Mr Jacob Frenkel, the Governor of the Bank of Israel, is one of those who believes the Israeli economy is 'well positioned to take off'. But, as he also stresses, there is a very long way to go.</p>

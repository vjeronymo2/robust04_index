			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Kenya is pledged Dollars 850m in new aid Kenya was yesterday promised Dollars 850m (Pounds 577m) in new aid - with enough due next year to cover its 1994 external financing requirement - provided it settles repayment of some Dollars 700m in arrears. Mr Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's finance minister, indicated that, in all but name, he was planning a standard rescheduling of debt arrears with the Paris club group of official creditors. He hoped Kenya would soon 'come to a reasonable arrangement on a multilateral basis' on the debt arrears. But the minister shied away from calling it a standard Paris club operation, apparently for fear that this might damage efforts to restore investor confidence in the Kenyan economy. Of the Dollars 850m in new aid pledged by donor countries yesterday, some Dollars 170m will be in the form of quickly-disbursed balance of payments aid. This will, in effect, bridge the country's 1994 financing gap, provided the arrears on past debt is separately settled. The bulk of the aid pledged yesterday is money for development projects spread over several years, but Kenya is due next year to get some Dollars 350m worth of project aid resulting from past pledges. Mr Mudavadi said there was 'no strict conditionality' attached to the aid, but he freely conceded concerns about ethnic clashes and corruption expressed by donors in a frankly-worded communique issued by the World Bank which chaired yesterday's meeting. Mr Mudavadi admitted that donors had insisted that 'elements of corruption should be dealt with firmly'. The minister himself stressed that the government's recent 'corrective' measures to root out corruption would be continued, and were not just a show to placate foreign donors at this week's Paris meeting.</p>

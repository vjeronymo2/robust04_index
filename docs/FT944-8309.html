			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Late again The European summer saw a deterioration in the length of delays on air routes, the Association of European Airlines said last week. It said it could confirm what air travellers had 'already been noticing: that delays are on the increase again'. The association represents 24 scheduled European airlines. In its quarterly punctuality review it said that the proportion of flights delayed in the July-September period by more than 15 minutes was 16.7 per cent, against 12.2 per cent in the second quarter and 13.5 per cent in the same period last year. The association said it had been a 'tremendous summer for passenger demand'. But there was another side to the coin: congestion. 'Record numbers of passengers have passed through airports.

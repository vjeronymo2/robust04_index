			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Hurd to press for Hong Kong talks progress MR Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, arrives in Beijing today for discussions with Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in an effort to give talks about Hong Kong's political development a fresh impetus. The meeting of the two foreign ministers, scheduled for tomorrow morning, follows high-level talks in London last week about Hong Kong policy and the appointment of Mr Qian to head a group charged with studying issues related to the colony's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Mr Hurd, who said last week that he would make no new proposals is expected to underline Britain's desire to reach an agreement with Beijing on the terms of Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 elections. He will make plain to Mr Qian that the principles enunciated by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, for fair and open elections are British government policy, and that the time for discussion between the two governments is not unlimited and that laws for the 1994-95 polls need to be enacted in the near future. In a speech in Singapore this week, Mr Hurd stressed the need for continuity, which he defined as 'objective criteria evident to everybody by which candidates who stand for election to the Legislative Council in 1995 know they can continue through 1997 the 'through train' to the next elections in 1999'. British and Chinese officials have had seven rounds of talks in Beijing on Hong Kong's constitutional development since April. Mr Hurd said: 'Progress has been slow - I must say slower than we would wish.' But he said most of the groundwork had been done and that Mr Patten had suggested a meeting between the two foreign ministers. Britain's objective in the talks, which Mr Patten characterises as his 'bottom line', is to secure a broadening of the electoral franchise for the representatives that will sit in the 1995 Legislative Council, Hong Kong's law making body. The UK also wants China to define the criteria of a 'loyalty test' it will apply in 1996, to those elected a year earlier, to assess their fitness for office after 1997. Mr Hurd last met Mr Qian in September when the two foreign ministers were in New York for opening of the UN general assembly. Since then Mr Qian has been promoted to full membership of the Politburo - the Chinese Communist party's top policy making organ - and assumed responsibility for Hong Kong affairs. British officials hope that Mr Qian's enhanced political clout, allied to his broader perspective on China's place in the world, might prove influential in persuading Beijing to accept accepting the need for a deal with which both can live.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Not cricket for culture - Off The Wall THE GENERAL apathy in ministerial and media circles about the political importance of the arts and heritage was spotlighted by the total absence of comment or concern about the removal of the chorister Robert Key, number two minister at the Department of National Heritage, in last week's government reshuffle. He was replaced by Iain Sproat, best known as editor of a cricketers Who's Who. This might be good news for the sports side of the department's activities but it bodes ill for its cultural brief. The overall lack of any initiative in the arts world is also reflected in the anodyne investigation by Price Waterhouse into the future role of the Arts Council, which faces, through delegation to Regional Arts Boards, the loss of many clients and influence. In the end no report was forthcoming; just a lot of alternative ideas on which the Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, can brood. There was a radical option: to drop 100 of the Arts Council's staff of 154, saving Pounds 2.5m and leaving the Council little more than an advocate for the arts. But Brooke made clear yesterday that he did not favour such root and branch surgery. If he does make a decision - promised by July - it is likely to be option two, cutting fewer than 40 jobs and saving less than Pounds 1m. There will be cosmetic changes - reducing the size of the Council's board from 20 to 12; defining the role of the Council with both the Department of National Heritage and the Regional Arts Boards; and getting the Arts Council to concentrate on its traditional core activity such as funding, assessing and championing the arts, and leaving well alone research, marketing, policy analyses and communications. The Arts Council department handing this sector has expanded to around 30 people in the last two years. This is the obvious area for money to be saved while the traditional Arts Council carries on as before. * * * However gloomy the arts scene in England, a trip to Cardiff provides a more optimistic picture. In the autumn the biggest arts building project under way in the UK will be completed - a Pounds 26m extension to the National Museum of Wales, which increases its display space by a third. Already paintings that have languished in store for years are being introduced to the six new art galleries emerging on former courtyard space. Most welcome will be a decent show at last for the Davies Collection of French Impressionists. Eight Monets, nine Rodins, three Cezannes and more will be adequately displayed. Other artists to get a comprehensive airing for the first time include Augustus and Gwen John, Richard Wilson and Ceri Richards. When the future of the National Museum was under investigation in the 1970s one suggestion was that it should be converted into the much needed opera house for Wales. Now even this long unravelling saga seems near conclusion. Few doubt that a Pounds 60m opera house, a decent home for Welsh National Opera after years of being squeezed at the New Theatre, will arise on the revitalised Cardiff Bay (the sanitised soubriquet for old Tiger Bay) in time for the Millennium celebrations. The site is fixed and the architectural competition for the building should be under way by the summer. Some of the Lottery-funded Millenium money must go to Wales, and this is the one project that unites the nation. By doubling the potential audience for each performance to 2,000 it could even re-pay its cost over a few decades.</p>

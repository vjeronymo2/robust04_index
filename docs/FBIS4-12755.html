			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has escorted to their final  resting place the martyrs of the heroic al-'Ayshiyah battle,  which the front's fedayeen carried out against the Zionist enemy  forces and their agents in southern Lebanon. These heroic  martyrs fell after they killed more than 15 of the U.S.-Zionist  enemy troops and their agents in a direct battle that came in  response to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Having carried out  their combat mission, our heroes were targeted by enemy  artillery and air raids while they were returning to their  bases. Other members of the group managed to return safely to  base.    Heroic martyr Khalid Muhmmad Hilal, also known as Abu-Sakhr;  heroic martyr Muhammad Mahmud al-Nu'aymi, also known as  Abu-Iskandar 'Umar; and heroic martyr Ahmad Nasr Ibrahim, also  known as Abu-Iskandar Ahmad, were laid to rest at the Martyrs  Cemetery at the al-Yarmuk Camp [near Damascus] this afternoon.  The funeral procession was led by Ahmad Jibril, PFLP-GC  secretary general; Talal Naji, PFLP-GC assistant secretary  general; Fadl Shururu, secretary of the PFLP-GC Political  Bureau; and 'Umar al-Shihabi, member of the PFLP-GC Political  Bureau. Also leading the funeral were a number of  representatives of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, the  martyrs' relatives, a number of the PFLP-GC Central Committee  members, and a large crowd of the masses of our Palestinian and  Syrian Arab people. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, in a funeral unprecedented since 1982, the body  of  the heroic martyr 'Awni Muhammad Manna', also known as  Abu-Nasir, the commander of the heroic al-'Ayshiyah operation,  was laid to rest at the 'Ayn al-Hulwah camp following the noon  prayers yesterday, Monday. [passage omitted]    Our correspondent in southern Lebanon reports that in an  attempt to disrupt the funeral, members of the 'Arafat clique  assassinated a member of their own clique. However, this did  not prevent the masses of our people from continuing  participation in the funeral of heroic martyr Abu-Nasir.</p>

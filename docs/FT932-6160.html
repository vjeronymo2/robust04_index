			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Malaya launches expansion plan with deals worth Pounds 2.7m MALAYA GROUP, the USM-quoted motor dealership company, yesterday unveiled an ambitious expansion plan which, it claims, could revolutionise the outlet system for vehicle sales in the UK. Announcing a Pounds 1.5m acquisition of Sands of Burnham, one of Britain's largest Citroen dealers, Malaya said it was the first step in a five-year strategy aimed at establishing a network of 55 dealerships around the country. Unlike traditional dealer networks, usually tied to one make of car, Malaya plans to take advantage of the relaxation of franchising rules to stock vehicles from every leading motor manufacturer. The network, designed to be an umbrella group for independent dealers, will allow some outlets to remain dedicated to one make, while others will be multi-franchise. As a whole, the network aims to encompass all makes. Mr Nick Lancaster, who built up the Lancaster dealership group and last year took control of Malaya, said the expansion would be financed through borrowing and a stock placing and open offer to shareholders. The first part of the scheme - the acquisition of Sands and a separate Pounds 1.18m dealership site at Bow, east London - depended on raising Pounds 9.6m from a placing due to be completed by June 25, he said. Malaya has agreed to pay Pounds 1.2m in cash for Sands, with additional finance raised through the issue of 1.2m new ordinary shares at 25p each. Albert E Sharp, which is underwriting the issue, said all the shares had been placed and up to 25 institutional investors were expected to take part. 'After the cash considerations for the Sands and Bow acquisitions, the balance of Pounds 7.2m will provide for the increased working capital of the enlarged group and for further acquisitions,' the directors said. The company aims to open 17 dealerships in London and the M25 corridor over the next 18 months and has set its sights on further outlets in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Although UK new car sales faltered last month with sales 1.9 per cent down on April 1992, Mr Lancaster forecast strengthening demand and a sharp turnround in profits.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional Pounds 32m gain will bolster L&amp;G balance sheet LEGAL AND General, the life assurance and financial services group, said yesterday that it was planning to strengthen its balance sheet through a transaction that would result in an exceptional profit of Pounds 32m for the six months ended June 30. The transaction would involve the sale of L&amp;G's UK investment management businesses - currently owned by the corporate holding company - to L&amp;G's Society Life Fund and would allow L&amp;G to extract about Pounds 42m of shareholders' funds in the life fund and shift these into the corporate balance sheet. The proceeds will include roughly Pounds 10m of consolidated tangible assets attributable to the four investment management companies. The four are the pensions management, unit trust management and portfolio management companies as well as the investment management holding company. There will be no capital gains tax on the transaction because a period of poor investment performance in the mid-1980s meant that the value of the combined companies has risen little over the past 10 years. As of December 31 1991, the UK investment management businesses had Pounds 17.1bn of funds under management - of which Pounds 12.1m related to L&amp;G Society Life Fund. About Pounds 1.7bn of the Society Life Fund is allocated to shareholders under complex regulatory arrangements set out by the Department of Trade and Industry. L&amp;G said it had consulted the DTI about the transaction and that no objections had been raised. Composite insurance companies have been seeking ways to extract shareholders' funds from their life funds in order to inject capital into their general insurance activities which sustained heavy losses over the past year. In 1991, L&amp;G recorded losses in its general insurance businesses, particularly mortgage indemnity, of Pounds 176m. Its life insurance activities, however, recorded profits of Pounds 126m. Extracting shareholders' funds from the life fund also enables companies to maintain dividends in the face of heavy losses. Insurance industry analysts yesterday applauded L&amp;G's move, saying that the transaction had bolstered the company's ability to maintain its dividend in line with inflation. Meanwhile, L&amp;G said the move was justified on managerial grounds as well.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Lessons to be learnt in vocational training: Improving skills at the workplace and in schools requires funds and flexibility, say practitioners In the scramble to boost opting-out of schools and tighten up further on trade union law, Mr John Patten and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education and employment secretaries, could lose sight of an urgent national priority: high-quality training and vocational education. Almost half of 16-year-olds currently leave full-time education; even the most ambitious growth figures for the next decade still leave one-quarter out of the system. In any case, for many of those that stay on, schools and further education colleges, largely concerned with entry to higher education, have little to offer. The 20 per cent A-level failure rate is their grim statistical memorial. Many of those going straight to work at 16 have fared little better. By European standards, Britain's training regime is poor, with nothing comparable to Germany's 'dual system' of work-plus-training. The response of the last Thatcher government was to hand training over to employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) while seeking to improve work-related skills among pupils and young employees. Serious problems are evident on both fronts. On the schools front, two state-funded initiatives - 'Compacts' and the Training and Vocational Education Initiative (TVEI) - have made a mark. Sixty-two Compacts arrange agreements between employers and pupils under which an employer undertakes to offer a job with training - or training leading to a job - in return for the pupil performing to an agreed standard. TVEI provides funding - about Pounds 20,000 per school - for secondary schools to develop links with business and foster vocationally oriented studies. Schools are concerned that funding for both schemes - totalling Pounds 125m in 1992-93 - is due to be withdrawn over the next few years. Some Compacts face the prospect as soon as next April: by then they are supposed to have gained sufficient private funding to sustain themselves, but few are likely to have done so. Improving links between the worlds of school and work is one thing: ensuring that pupils leave school with - and/or subsequently secure  - vocational qualifications another. Last year's white paper on education and training gave prominent billing to the latter. A single system of national vocational qualifications (NVQs) covering 80 per cent of the workforce is to be accredited by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) by the end of this 'general vocational qualifications' (GVQs) will be introduced, offering a vocational route through the sixth form or further education colleges. NCVQ and the three main providers of vocational qualifications - RSA, City and Guilds and the Business and Technician Education Council (BTEC) - look set to meet the deadlines. But the challenge to turn the results into a successful vocational system remains considerable in three respects: Parity of esteem. Will employers and universities treat NVQs and GVQs with respect - or as second-rate courses for A-level 'drop-outs'? Much depends on the quality of the new two-year GVQs - five varieties of which (for business, manufacturing, art and design, health and social care, and leisure and tourism) are to be piloted in 100 centres this year, and offered generally next. There is widespread concern at the emphasis on the 'testing competence' approach, and on the haste of their introduction. NCVQ is due to review the pilots at the end of this year, when they will have been going for only a matter of months. 'It could be the seven-year-old tests all over again: chaos, followed by endless revisions,' says one insider. Changing horses. Once the new qualifications are up and running, most state funding will be tied to them alone. Tecs and Scotland's Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) will be virtually obliged to fund only NCVQ-approved courses. It is vital, therefore, that the new structure 'takes off', for whether it does or not the existing range of qualifications will be drastically curtailed. Not all the omens are good: BTEC expects 270,000 first-year students this September, its highest number ever - yet some employers are expressing disquiet at the content of new courses. Vocational qualifications in schools. As yet only 137 schools offer the BTEC first diploma (equivalent to GCSEs) and a mere 40 the National (equivalent to A-levels). Not until NVQs and GVQs are as common as A-levels in schools can the reforms be judged a success. This is not just a matter of overcoming parental and professional prejudice: schools will need fresh facilities, and extra staff and training for existing teachers. None of this will come cheap. Injecting NVQs into Youth Training (YT), the scheme for 16-19-year-olds, and Employment Training, the programme for unemployed adults, is the responsibility of the new Tecs. The original targets set by Sir Norman Fowler, the architect of Tecs when employment secretary, were ambitious - by 1996 more than 80 per cent of 16-19-years-olds were to have achieved an NVQ at level two, equivalent to four GCSEs. Sir Norman's successor, Mr Michael Howard, revoked such targets. The Confederation of British Industry has resurrected them, but only as voluntary targets. Tec funding for YT and ET is linked to a complex formula, which takes no account of these voluntary targets. Many Tecs complain that their three-year corporate plans, which included strategies for working towards the targets, are ignored by government. Instead the government, for a second year running, has cut in real terms their budgets for YT and ET. Tecs, in turn, are cutting the amounts paid to training providers. Training organisations, which include charitable providers, claim many of them could be forced out of business. Many Tec chairmen fear training and the acquisition of qualifications will suffer seriously under the cuts. Mrs Gwynneth Flower, chief executive of Central London Tec, says: 'There comes a time when cutting back on the price must have an impact on the quality of training and the attainment of qualifications. I believe we at Centec have got to that point now.' Tecs argue that government must either increase funding or enhance their flexibility in offering training programmes. According to Mr Peter Clarke, chairman of North and Mid Cheshire Tec: 'Funding has now dried up, and if we don't get fresh flexibilities we might as well pack up.' His Tec questions, for instance, why adult training is tied into long-term unemployment and is not available to individuals immediately after redundancy. Mrs Shepard is unlikely to grant such flexibilities unless Tecs fight hard for them. Whether G10, the group of chairmen which represents the Tec movement to government, can fight hard remains to be seen. Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, says: 'Politicians should decide what they are voting this money for ET and YT for. Is it to take people off the unemployment register or to create a better pool of skilled labour?'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] North Korea has not submitted its list of champions  to participate in the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway  before the 31 January deadline. Thus, there is a great  possibility that North Korea will not participate in the Winter  Olympics to be held from 12 to 27 February. Some people view  that the failure to present the list of champions is related to  the political situation in North Korea, while others think that  North Korea simply did not meet the deadline.</p>

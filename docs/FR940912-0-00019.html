This value is derived from either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Capitalizing a single year's income expectancy or an annual average of several years' income expectancies at a market-derived capitalization rate that reflects a specific income pattern, return on investment, and change in the value of the investment; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Discounting the annual cashflows for the holding period and the reversion at a specified yield rate or specified yield rates which reflect market behavior.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Market value <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the most probable price that a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably, and assuming neither is under duress.

For the purposes of this definition, the term ``qualified evaluator'' includes an appraiser or valuator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Real estate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means an identified parcel or tract of land, including improvements, if any.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (p)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Real estate-related financial transactions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means any transaction involving:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The sale, lease, purchase, investment in, or exchange of real property, including interests in property or the financing thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The refinancing of real property or interests in real property; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The use of real property or interests in real property as security for a loan or investment, including mortgage-backed securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (q)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Real property <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means all interests, benefits, and rights inherent in the ownership of real estate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (r)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sales comparison approach <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the procedure that values property by comparing the subject property to similar properties located in relatively close proximity, having similar size and utility, and having been recently sold in arm's-length transactions (comparable sales). The sales comparison approach requires the evaluator to estimate the degree of similarity and difference between the subject property and comparable sales. Such comparison shall be made on the basis of conditions of sale, financing terms, market conditions, location, physical characteristics, and income characteristics. Appropriate adjustments shall be made to the sales price of the comparable property based on the identified deficiencies or superiorities of the subject property to arrive at a probable price for which the subject property could be sold on the date of the collateral evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (s)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State certified appraiser <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means any individual who has satisfied the requirements for and has been certified as a real estate appraiser by a State or territory whose requirements for certification currently meet or exceed the minimum criteria for certification issued by the Appraiser Qualification Board of the Appraisal Foundation. No individual shall be a State certified appraiser unless such individual has achieved a passing grade on a suitable examination administered by a State or territory that is consistent with and equivalent to the Uniform State Certification Examination issued or endorsed by the Appraiser Qualification Board of the Appraisal Foundation. In addition, the Appraisal Subcommittee must not have issued a finding that the policies, practices, or procedures of the State or territory are inconsistent with title XI of FIRREA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (t)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State licensed appraiser <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means any individual who has satisfied the requirements for licensing and has been licensed as a real estate appraiser by a State or territory in which the licensing procedures comply with title XI of FIRREA and in which the Appraisal Subcommittee has not issued a finding that the policies, practices, or procedures of the State or territory are inconsistent with title XI of FIRREA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

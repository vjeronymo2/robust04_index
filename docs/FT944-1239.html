			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Blackwood holders take BM to court Three preference shareholders in Blackwood Hodge have filed a petition against its parent, BM Group, in the High Court, claiming that its affairs have been managed in a manner prejudicial to the interests of preference shareholders. Blackwood Hodge had net assets of Pounds 95m when BM acquired it in 1990. BM made an offer for the three classes of its preference share capital on October 26 this year. The offer closes tomorrow after which BM plans to put Blackwood Hodge into liquidation. One of the petitioners, Mr Stephen Cockburn, managing director of Investment Company, which owns preference shares in Blackwood Hodge, said that he would not now be making a rival offer for two classes of the shares. Mr Cockburn, who also has a personal holding, said that if the petition was successful he would not be entitled to relief on the shares acquired under the offer. The petition, filed on November 30, claims BM has undervalued the surplus from the Blackwood Hodge pension fund, which was merged with BM's pension fund at the time of the acquisition. BM's 1992 accounts value the surplus at Pounds 15.3m. The BM offer says Blackwood Hodge has net liabilities of Pounds 500,000. The petitioners claim that the pension fund surplus now has a value of at least Pounds 5.6m, which would give Blackwood Hodge net assets of Pounds 5m, radically changing the terms of the offer.</p>

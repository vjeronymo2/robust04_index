			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "'Abd-al-Majid: Yemen Could </F> Turn Into Another Somalia"]    [Text] Alexandria -- Arab League Secretary General Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has warned against turning Yemen into a new  Somalia. He urged Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to work to prevent a further  deterioration in conditions in Yemen "and, hence, an unfavorable  outcome."    In a statement to AL-HAYAH 'Abd-al-Majid revealed that there  is a "wide gap between the Yemeni president and his deputy." He  said that "a considerable part of this dispute is personal. The  other part is to do with the union and ways of implementing its  mechanisms, especially the Armed Forces, which have not been  unified. This is the main reason for the clashes that have  occurred there." He said that the existence of huge quantities  of arms in Yemen threatens conditions there. He expressed his  hope that "the two 'Alis will apply reason and respond to Arab  endeavors to safeguard Yemeni unity."    'Abd-al-Majid returned to Alexandria the evening of the day  before yesterday after a two-day visit to Libya, during which he  met with Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He also  held a series of meetings with a large number of Libyan  officials. The meetings dealt with the mechanisms of Arab and  Libyan moves to end the Lockerbie problem. 'Abd-al-Majid  pointed out that the moves will be conducted through the  Security Council member states in order to urge them to accept  the League's proposal regarding trying the two suspects at the  International Court of Justice in The Hague in accordance with  the rules of Scottish law and by Scottish judges. He added that  "solving this problem is not easy, but it is not impossible."    He pointed out that the League's proposal "offers a legal  way  out for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 731."  This "requires a new Security Council resolution on the  acceptance of the Arab proposal by the parties to the  Libyan-Western crisis."    He pointed out that the League will intensify its moves  during the Nonaligned Movement conference to be held in Cairo  this month and the African summit meeting to be held in Tunis in  June. This move will be parallel with the Libyan move. He said  that "Scottish law contains three options with regard to the  verdict: guilty, not guilty, or not proven -- which offers an  opportunity for a fair trial for the defendants."    'Abd-al-Majid described the U.S. and British rejection of  the  League's proposal "as an unjustifiable position." He stressed  the need to avoid stepping up the sanctions against Libya and to  adhere to the Arab solution.    AL-HAYAH has learned that 'Abd-al-Majid yesterday began his  contacts with the foreign ministers of the Arab seven-man  committee entrusted with discussing the Libyan-Western crisis.  He briefed them on the results of his talks in Libya.    'Abd-al-Majid renewed his call for eliminating weapons of  mass destruction from the Middle East. He urged that an Arab  summit on water should be held to tackle the problem of its  scarcity. He also renewed his call for setting up an Arab court  of justice and amending the Arab League charter.</p>

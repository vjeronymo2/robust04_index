			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with respondent. It was decided early on in these investigations that CA cement and cement clinker constituted two such or similar categories of merchandise in accordance with the definition of similar merchandise under section 771(16)(B)(ii) and (C)(ii) of the Act, which states that the component materials and uses of the products must be ``like.'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  June 15, 1993, Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford Re Such or Similar Categories and attached Memorandum from Stafford to Moreland). In this case, while cement and clinker may be made of similar materials, they are not used for the same purposes. Clinker is used to make cement, and cement is used to bind things together or to create some structure or form. Clinker requires further processing to be like cement in the purposes for which it is used. For these reasons we have held cement and clinker to constitute different such or similar merchandise categories in this and past cement cases. Moreover, contrary to petitioner's assertion, the component materials and uses of products within the class or kind of merchandise subject to investigation are the determinants in establishing categories of such or similar merchandise: The 20 percent difmer rule is not considered by the Department in establishing such or similar categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent maintains that in the preliminary determination the Department incorrectly deducted from the USP as an indirect selling expense, inventory carrying costs (ICC) based on an inventory period including the time between clinker production in France and production of the finished cement in the United States. Respondent claims that it did not sell clinker to an unrelated party in the United States, but rather to its U.S. subsidiary for further processing into cement. Therefore, the clinker in this case is work-in-process inventory, and the period between the production of the intermediate clinker product and the completion of the finished cement product is part of the production period. Respondent maintains that the Department ordinarily imputes an ICC for finished goods inventory and almost never imputes ICC on work-in-process inventory, except for large, made-to-order goods that are produced as discrete projects. To support its arguments, respondent cites among other cases the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors of One Megabit and Above from the Republic of Korea (58 FR 15467, March 23, 1993) (DRAMs from Korea) and Color Television Receivers from the Republic of Korea; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (55 FR 26,255, June 27, 1990) (CTVs from Korea). Furthermore, citing Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Offshore Platform Jackets and Piles from Japan (51 FR 11788, April 7, 1986) (OPJPs from Japan) and the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan (55 FR 335, January 4, 1990) (MTPs from Japan), respondent maintains that in the rare instances in which the Department has imputed ICC on work-in-process inventory, it classifies those costs as part of the COM, not as selling expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

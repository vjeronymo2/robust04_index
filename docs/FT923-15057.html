			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Observer: Perotver-taken Rumours that advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was about to be signed up to organise the US presidential campaign of Ross Perot - who seems unable to make up his mind whether or not to run - have been dashed. Saatchi's US media-buying arm has just clinched a deal with the Bush-Quayle camp to do all its media buying. The appointment came after the Republican party sent observers to the UK's recent general election, where Saatchi worked for the Tory winners. The big question, of course, is not how many millions of dollars Bush will pay. It's that, given Saatchi's record, will Perot now throw in the towel without trying?</p>

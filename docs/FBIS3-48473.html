The  company intends to begin construction of the center in March,  with the aim of completing construction this year. The  investment amount is approximately 2 billion yen. Nissan plans  to gather at the center about 500 employees in charge of parts  design, purchase, and quality control who are now doing business  in various places within the country in order to make it a base  for providing design and development assistance to about 170  local parts manufacturers with which Nissan has dealings in  Mexico. With an eye on the yen's appreciation and the  effectuation of the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA],  Nissan intends to further increase local production of parts and  to strengthen the competitive power of Nissan cars made in  Mexico.    Nissan will build the center in Toluca, approximately 50  kilometers west of Mexico City. The center will be constructed  on a 90,000-square-meter site adjoining a foundry of Mexico  Nissan (headquartered in Mexico City, with Masao Horie as  representative), Nissan's local production corporate in the  country. In addition to those in charge of parts purchase and  quality control, the company intends to transfer to the center  310 people in charge of design who are now doing business at  various plants.    The company intends to open the center, which will be  equipped with design rooms and various test facilities, to all  manufacturers dealing with Nissan -- such as local corporations  of Nissan-affiliated parts manufacturers as well as  locally-capitalized parts manufacturers. Both Nissan and parts  manufacturers plan to discuss which parts should be produced in  Mexico, and to make efforts to shorten the term for developing  parts for exclusive use in locally produced cars. By stopping  parts imports from Japan and beginning local production, Nissan  intends to establish a procurement system that will not be  affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.    With the effectuation of NAFTA, foreign manufacturers doing  business in North America have been forced to further raise the  local procurement rate of parts to increase dealings within the  NAFTA region. The local procurement rate of parts, which is a  condition for exempting finished cars from duties in the NAFTA  region, will be 50 percent for four years starting this year, 56  percent for four years starting in 1998, and 62.5 percent after  2002.    Although presently Nissan reportedly clears the first  condition of 50 percent, for the time being it has no intention  of exporting finished cars from Mexico to the United States and  Canada. However, there is a possibility the company will begin  dividing production at its plants within North America. The  company intends to further promote local production of parts in  Mexico in an effort to attain the local procurement rate under  the NAFTA calculation system and to maintain its competitive  power in the price war.    Nissan is now producing finished "Sunny" and "AD Van" [name  as published] cars as well as engines for "Altima" cars in  Mexico. Its plant and equipment investment in Mexico was more  than 20 billion yen in 1993. In accordance with its plan to  start production of the new "Sunny" car in February next year,  Nissan intends to invest approximately 30 billion yen in 1994.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On Saturday, 9 Bahman 1372 [29 January 1994] the  Majles began studying the 7,968-billion-toman national budget  for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. The budget bill  was presented to the Majles on 30 Azar [21 December] by 'Ali  Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the republic. Statements  from the Majles and opinions expressed in the Islamic Republic's  economic circles concerning the 1373 budget are focused on three  basic points: the assessment of oil revenues for the coming  fiscal year, Note 25 of the budget bill concerning the prices of  some government services and goods, and finally the issue of  foreign debt repayment.  <H5>  Oil Revenue </H5>   The most important point of debate for the 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] budget is naturally the question of foreign  exchange revenues from crude oil exports. In the bill presented  by the government, 22,000 billion rials[R] of the government's  R34,000 billion in revenues, equal to $12.8 billion, is  calculated based on the sale of oil. This amount, which is  roughly equal to Iran's oil revenues in the current solar year,  is being severely criticized by the deputies.    The deputies in the majority faction of the Majles consider  the revenues from the sale of oil as projected in the budget  bill to be "unrealistic." Finally, after much discussion, on  Sunday 10 Bahman [30 January] they decreased the figure to  $10.15 billion. The note pertaining to oil revenues, which was  approved by the Majles, makes no reference to the volume of  exports or to the price per barrel of oil. To the figure of  $10.15 billion must be added the $600 million expected from  natural gas exports.    We note that according to Aqazadeh, Iran's petroleum  minister, oil revenues from 1 Farvardin 1372 [21 March 1993] to  30 Dey [20 January 1994] the same year reached $11.38 billion.  This figure was $2.8 billion, or about 20 percent less than the  projected amount.    The projected figure of $12.8 billion in oil revenues in  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's proposed budget was severely criticized in  the last few weeks by the majority faction in the Majles.    In a harsh editorial published in the newspaper RESALAT on  28  Dey [18 January], Morteza Nabavi questioned the fundamental  assumptions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget. He  wrote: The nation's general revenues for the year 1373 were  projected at R33,767 billion, and this was a 42.5-percent  increase over the general revenues for the current year. In view  of the sharp drop in oil prices for the current year and the  failure to realize this year's revenues, the outlook for oil  prices in the coming year is not bright or hopeful. The failure  of OPEC members to agree to reduce the production ceiling,  increased oil production in the North Sea, and reduced oil  extraction costs for non-OPEC nations, create an uncertain  future for oil prices.    In view of the above elements, Morteza Nabavi concludes that  the price of oil in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]  will be less than $10 billion.  <H5>  Note 25 </H5>   The second controversial point is Note 25 in the 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] National Budget Bill. If approved in  the form proposed by the government, there would be increases of  100 to 140 percent in the prices of some oil products. Economic  circles in the IRI say that keeping prices low on oil products,  which is really paying major subsidies on these products, cost  the country about $10 billion in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20  March 1994]. In reality, the very heavy consumption of oil  products in the country is caused by their very low prices,  which in some cases have remained unchanged since after the  revolution. For example, the price of a liter of gasoline in  Iran is equivalent to 15 centimes in France, meaning  one-fortieth of its price in France! This situation causes  Iran's oil products to be smuggled to neighboring countries,  especially Turkey, where the price of gasoline is 20 times the  price in Iran.    Concerning Note 25 and its consequences for Iran's economy  there are two different views in the Islamic Republic's economic  circles. One group says that with the increase in the price of  oil products, people will not be wasteful and consequently the  government can export some of what would be consumed  domestically and increase its foreign exchange revenues. On the  other side, opponents of Note 25 say that Iran's ability to  export oil cannot be increased that much and that it would be  difficult for the government to increase oil exports by  decreasing domestic consumption. In this case, the only effect  of increasing the price of oil products would be an explosive  growth in inflation, while the effect on the nation's foreign  exchange revenues would be insignificant.    The Majles finally approved Note 25, but it did not accept  the increase in price for oil and gas products expected by  Hashemi-Rafsanjani. With 118 votes in favor, 92 votes in  opposition, and 2 abstentions, the Majles rejected a proposal to  reject all of Note 25, and authorized the government in 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] to increase the average price of a  cubic meter of gas to R12.4, and to increase the price of a  liter of the four oil products to the following maximum amounts:  R80 for gasoline, R20 for kerosene, R10 for furnace oil, and R15  for gasoil, and the difference between the prices set and the  prices for 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] would be deposited  into the nation's general revenue account as oil and gas product  taxes.  <H5>  Foreign Debts </H5>   The third issue, which has brought on a great struggle  between the government and the Majles deputies, is the repayment  of Iran's foreign debt. In its proposed budget for 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] the government assumes that $1 billion  of the nation's oil revenues will be used to reduce the level of  foreign commitments. The majority faction in the Majles  considers this figure insignificant in view of the volume of the  nation's debt, and it believes that a schedule for repaying  these debts is the first and most important issue, which must be  clarified before any decision is made about the 1373 budget.    Ever since studying the budget bill (9 Bahman [29 January]),  Mahmud Astaneh, deputy from Sarband-e Araq, as the first  opponent of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill,  gave vigorous emphasis to the government's foreign debt. He  said: It is entirely regrettable that in the year 1372 [21 March  1993-20 March 1994] we were faced with $10 billion in unpaid  debt, and in the worst form, meaning several thousand small  debts to different countries, and this shows lack of management  on the part of the nation's economic experts. Yet in the year  1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] we will incur roughly an  additional $6 billion in debts.    The speaker accused the Central Bank of illegally using  government assets and said: Under Note 29 of the 1372 [21 March  1993-20 March 1994] budget bill, the Central Bank was required  to act in such a way that the amount of commitments at the end  of the year [20 March 1994] would be 15.72 percent less than it  was at the beginning of the year [21 March 1993]. However, it  was observed how the chief of the Central Bank's performance and  economic revolution amounted to an auction of the dollars  obtained through the sale of national capital....    The deputy from Sarband-e Araq also added: One of the most  important issues with which the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] budget must deal is setting up a schedule for the  repayment of foreign debt, and yet in its proposed budget the  government is asking authorization for taking on another $5.4  billion in foreign exchange commitments.  <H5>  'Adeli's Return </H5>   On the other hand, Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli, whose position as  president seems to be solidified, has again returned to the  public eye, and in an interview with the English-language  newspaper TEHRAN TIMES, published on 28 Dey [18 January], he  claimed that "the government or the Central Bank do not owe a  cent to any country or company. Rather, it is the private  companies and Iran's commercial banks who have foreign debt, and  even these debts are not fixed and they change over time."    The chief of the Central Bank said Iran's total outstanding  debt is $8 billion, and he attributed that to the failure of  insurance agencies to grant coverage to Iran's mid-term and  long-term credits.    In response to 'Adeli's remarks, the newspaper SALAM, in its  "Notes" published Sunday 3 Bahman [23 January], wrote: Really,  if someone said such a thing who had no knowledge of the science  of economics or banking affairs it would not be surprising, but  when the Central Bank chief says such a thing, it is very  surprising. We do not know whether the central banks chiefs in  other countries can say such things or not, and if they do, can  they still continue working at their jobs?    Does he expect foreign insurance companies to pay for the  Central Bank's failure to manage its foreign repayments? It is  truly interesting that he says Iran does not owe a cent to any  country or company, but that it is these private companies and  Iran's commercial banks who have foreign debt. We ask him, from  what bank have Iranian citizens gotten credit certification for  their import purchases? Did they not give rial amounts  equivalent to the foreign exchange to the Central Bank and other  banks, and did they not establish credit certification for the  purchases? In reality, before making any kind of purchase,  Iranian citizens give the equivalent amount in rials to the  banks and after that it is these banks who deal with the foreign  companies, and no Iranian citizen is in debt for this credit, it  is the banks who are in debt and we all know that the banks in  Iran are government banks. That is, it is the Government of Iran  that is in debt, and nothing is changed by saying such things.</p>

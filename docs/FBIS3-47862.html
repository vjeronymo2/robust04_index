Almost all of the survivors, who were in total panic, deserted  the battlefield.    Seeing that the first, second, and third groups of his  assaulting forces were beaten and dispersed, Pol Saroeun, the  Vietnamese puppets' general staff commander, ordered 500  soldiers from the Kompong Cham provincial unit to rescue their  colleagues on Route 68. However, he could mobilize only 300 of  them. However, nearly 100 of these forces fled while they were  sent by truck to this area.    Between 15 and 18 January, these assaulting forces tried to  launch an onslaught, but all their attempts were smashed by our  mine attacks. Many of them were killed or wounded, and their  trucks and armored personnel carriers were destroyed. All the  wounded were in despair, waiting only for their dying day.    On 16 and 17 January, six trucks hit land mines and were  shot  at and destroyed in an area east of Samraong District.  Fifty-six puppet soldiers were killed, 62 others were wounded,  and 180 others deserted the battlefield. A major general from  the engineering unit [name indistinct] and 12 colonels, majors,  and captains were among those killed. [passage omitted]</p>

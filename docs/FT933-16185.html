			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: UK investment management - a question of style IS IT POSSIBLE to identify clear styles among UK investment managers? That question has preoccupied researchers in the US, where extensive analysis of managers' styles has allowed clients to identify clear biases in portfolios that go a long way towards explaining variations in performance. But can such distinct styles be said to exist in the UK? And if they do, what are the implications for those who measure performance? After all, if different styles produce different results at different stages of a market cycle, is it reasonable or, indeed, productive to compare the results of managers with vastly different styles? Instead, it may be far more relevant to compare the results of managers with similar styles to each other rather than to, say, the FT-A All Share Index or even the performance of all other fund managers. These questions have been examined in some detail in research produced by Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors and by Barra Incorporated, a US-based investment technology firm. The research, a jointly-produced paper, looks at the portfolios of UK unit trusts for which data are readily available. It does not examine investment styles of institutional managers. Nevertheless, it is likely that similar styles would emerge if institutional funds were examined as well as retail funds. To conduct their analysis, Barra and Wells Fargo Nikko have broken the FT-A Index into three categories: growth stocks, value-income stocks and small capitalisation stocks. The study looked at 77 unit trusts with at least five years of results and with at least Pounds 100m in assets. Not surprisingly, clear styles emerged showing a disproportionate exposure to small companies. Small companies by value are only 5 per cent of the FT-A index. However, growth funds did prove true to their name in the sense that 37 per cent of assets fell into that category with 30 per cent of assets categorised as value stock. Value unit trusts on average had 62 per cent of assets in value stocks but also carried a hefty 20 per cent waiting in small companies. The so-called balanced funds showed a distinct tilt towards value stocks and a disproportionate concentration of about 24 per cent in small company stocks. The authors of the research, Mr Andrew Rudd, chief executive of Barra, and Mr Jeffrey Skelton, managing director of Wells Fargo Nikko, suggest that the mis-labelling of unit trusts may reflect the fact that managers are unaware of biases which have crept into stock selection. The research also examines the extent to which individual managers were true to their style and the percentage of performance which can be explained by their having stuck to it. The research records significant variations among managers on this score. Deviation from a style can lead to outperformance. A manager who has spotted a turn in the market cycle may have adjusted his portfolio accordingly. Or he may be somewhat better at stock selection. But too often, the research shows, those who deviate from their style underperform others with the same style. In their paper, Mr Rudd and Mr Skelton note that with this type of analysis it is possible to discover managers who are particularly good at one style or another. 'From the history of the value and growth indexes in our sample period, it is obvious that a manager might outperform the growth style and still underperform the All Share. Likewise, a manager might have underperformed the value index and still outperformed the All Share. Rather than replacing the good growth manager with the poor value manager, the pension fund should replace the underperforming manager with one with better prospects against the value style index'. An effort to select managers in this fashion would doubtless create a new field of performance measurement in which managers could be measured against a more precise peer group. Aside from the commercial opportunities this would create for performance measurement services, it would be interesting to see just what this sort of scrutiny does for investment styles.</p>

This was said by Director of the president's  service on international affairs, Anton Buteyko, at a briefing  on the results of the Ukrainian governmental delegation's visit  to the U.S. in Kiev on Tuesday [1 February].    In his opinion, the signed documents reflected that the U.S.  had finished the assessment and working out of the policy  towards Ukraine. The joint communique and the supplementary  documents underline that the U.S. will pay primary attention to  the democratic and market reforms in Ukraine. The documents  emphasize that Ukraine plays the role of a stabilizer in the  region. That is why its political and economic security is of  exceptional importance for the U.S. and Europe.    Buteyko believes that the U.S. party has decided to allot  economic aid to Russia while taking into consideration these  factors. In his words, the funds will be allotted for  dismantling of nuclear and conventional weapons, for support of  the agricultural reforms and for overcoming of the difficulties  stemming from the transition period.    The briefing's organizers said that the sums of economic aid  would be announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president  to the U.S. planned for March, 1994.    Chief of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's Information  Department, Yuriy Sergeyev, said that he had received the  official authority to comment on the statement of Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the meeting on the foreign  policy of CIS and Baltic States in Moscow. Kozyrev estimated  the "defense of the rights of Russians in the neighboring states  as one of Russia's priority strategic interests."    Sergeyev expressed Ukraine's deep concern over the tendency  in Russia of toughning its foreign policy towards the new  independent states.    According to Sergeyev, "Ukraine understands the necessity to  defend human rights of people not living on their native  territory and tries to guarantee all their rights including the  one for a cultural autonomy." However, "we firmly stand against  the intention of any state to resolve the issue on human rights  of the nationalities living beyond its frontier."    In his words, Ukraine considered it unacceptable that other  states' armed forces be on its territory and supported the  demands that "all foreign troops" be withdrawn from Moldova and  Baltic states.</p>

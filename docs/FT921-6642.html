			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (3): It looks better, but it may not last - The economy has recovered in the past 18 months A SHARP drop in inflation and the chance of a resumption of economic growth this year have encouraged greater optimism about prospects for the Dominican economy than has existed in years. Such optimism hardly seemed conceivable less than 18 months ago. As the government attempted to tackle inflation which exceeded 100 per cent in 1990, petrol and food shortages developed and electricity and water supplies were cut off for 20 hours a day or more. Yet 1991 inflation was below 5 per cent. The economy, after shrinking by 5.3 per cent in 1990, levelled out or contracted slightly last year. The prospects for a resumption this year of economic growth, perhaps of 2 to 3 per cent, seem good as the high interest rates that were part of the economic stabilisation plan have fallen. At the end of 1990, t h e country was in arrears to all its creditors, including the international financial organisations, forcing the World Bank to cut off new lending to the country. Arrears were cleared to the organisations last April, allowing for a resumption of World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank loans and for a standby agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund last summer. Foreign reserves have begun to climb, with inflows into the country of flight capital, encouraged by positive real interest rates. The plan included a unification of the exchange rate and a liberalisation of foreign currency rules and of interest rates. Government subsidies were reduced for a variety of goods, including petrol and electricity. A new central bank governor, Mr Luis Toral, was appointed, who appears to have ceased, more or less, printing money not backed by government transfers of funds to the central bank. As a result of the programme, the public sector deficit fell from 6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1989 and 5.1 per cent in 1990 to 0.1 per cent in 1991. The government has also begun to attempt structural reform of the economy. A presidential decree simplified the tariff structure in September 1990, reducing the maximum tariff to 35 per cent from over 200 per cent previously. A new law on tax reform, which would include a reduction of the top marginal rate of personal income tax from 73 to 30 per cent, has been presented to Congress. A reform of the banking sector is expected to be introduced this year which would lead to universal banking. It would aim to strengthen a financial system where many of the specialist banks are weak, and which saw a handful fail in late 1990. This is expected to encourage further consolidation. Of the 650 financial firms in the country in 1983, only some 50 remain. The trend continues: in December, Chase Manhattan of the US sold its assets to Banco Nacional de Creditos, an affiliate of the Grupo Financiero Nacional, a fast-growing financial services group. Although all this has added to improved sentiment about prospects for the economy, some economists see a limit to the extent of the reform. They also express concern that the programme could easily be reversed. Since much of it has been introduced by presidential decree and has not been passed into law by Congress, it can be reversed by decree. The rationale behind the changes appear to have been linked more with President Joaquin Balaguer's view of how he can gain politically than with any coherent economic policy objective. 'The president has an exclusively political mind, not an economic one,' says one close observer. Mr Hugo Guiliani Cury, a former central bank governor, reckons economic policy is still being decided 'on a day-to-day basis.' Mr Andres Daujhare of the Economic and Development Foundation, a pro-market think tank in Santo Domingo, sees limits to likely immediate structural reform in the Dominican economy. For example, the president still thinks of 'state enterprises as necessary to employ poor people who don't have jobs.' Pressure on the government not to liberalise quickly is also coming from those domestic businessmen who want to keep out cheap foreign imports which challenge their protected position in the domestic market. In a country where unemployment is reckoned at a quarter of the workforce, this view may well carry significant weight with an electorally - sensitive president. The view of these domestic producers is opposed by a significant group of exporters and foreign investors. Mr Randolph Fleming, president of the fruit group Dole Dominicana, a subsidiary of Dole Corporation of the US, represents one of the largest foreign investors in the country. He says that the tariffs that his company is forced to pay on imports are increasing his company's costs. Unless they are lowered, foreign investment will be attracted to other countries in the region offering tariff-free regimes. This presents a dilemma for a country which is still seeking to diversify its economy away from sugar. But there are other priorities, too. Agricultural reform is needed to strengthen a debilitated sector of the economy: productivity growth is coming mainly from foreign investors. The government is ill-equipped to deal with its role, for example, in plague control. And, because many farmers only have provisional title to their land, they cannot obtain bank loans. Another priority, which particularly influences foreign investment, is to tackle the weakness of the legal system. Mr Luis Heredia-Bonetti, a prominent lawyer in Santo Domingo, says: 'The legal structure of the Dominican Republic has become obsolete.' Much economic and business law needs to be reformulated, he says. Priorities include: revisions to laws which set one Dominican peso as equal to one US dollar, when the actual rate is 12.5 to the dollar. a repeal of the state's usury laws which limit to 1 per cent a month the interest chargeable on loans. a revision of foreign investment laws that do not allow for repatriation of funds. This contrast between the law of the land and the recent decreed reforms of the president is serving to enlarge daily the already huge informal economy. 'Every day,' remarks Mr Daujhare, 'the government violates all the laws.'</p>

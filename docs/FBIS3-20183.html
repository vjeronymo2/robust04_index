Those who still hope that one can soon offer a firm construct  again, feeling a certain longing for the solid even though  hostile world of the past, begin to understand more and more  that this will not be the case.    The topic of this forum is not only a central one for the  armed forces, but for all of German politics. The Federal  Government and parliament now have to make difficult basic  decisions in order to define the kind and size of the armed  forces that Germany wants to have and keep.    Basically, it is not so much a quantitative than a far more  important qualitative debate about the future of the Bundeswehr.    So far, we have largely taken quantitative steps because of  the changed international situation -- the Bundeswehr will be  reduced to 370,000 men. Now the qualitative changes must be put  into the foreground more strongly. With the 1994 white book,  the Federal Government has set the necessary conceptional  framework for that.    When I spoke at this forum last May, the opening of the  alliance toward the east was the most important message, and at  that time there was no discussion at all in NATO about this  issue. Today, the opening up to new members is the declared  political strategy of the North Atlantic alliance.    For the European Union [EU] this opening up is already a  reality. It is deepening and expanding. Austria, Finland,  Sweden, and Norway will become new members -- several East  European states have quite definite prospects for membership.  This process is a desired one and must not be blocked by  egotistical individual interests.  The development of the EU is not just an economic event. The  issue is a comprehensive political process, during which the  things that belong together grow together in Europe. It is not  a provocation if one advocates that Hungary, the Czech Republic,  the Slovak Republic, and Poland, grow together with Europe also  in terms of security policy.    I gave a speech at Charles University in Prague. There I was  welcomed in Latin. Now tell me one German university where I  would be welcomed in this way. For me, Prague is just as  European as Berlin and Hamburg and Munich and Rome and Paris.    Our northern neighbors accept their share of responsibility  for the stability of our continent. Opportunities for intensive  security policy and defense policy cooperation are opening up,  which were not possible during the times of the East-West  conflict and the division of Europe. This becomes particularly  obvious by the example of Sweden. For more than 90 years,  Germany has not held any general staff meetings with Sweden. In  the future, this will not only be a regular exercise, but there  will also be intensive coordination regarding important  questions of the development of our Armed Forces.    The decision of the Swedish Government to equip its Armed  Forces with German Leopard tanks is or strategic quality and  means a new opportunity for cooperation, which would have been  completely inconceivable only a short time ago.    However, the EU is not just expanding toward the north, but  also toward the east. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and  the Slovak Republic are making clear political and economic  progress. They have meanwhile concluded European agreements and  are thus actively participating in European integration. We  want to help them with consolidating democratic structures, in  implementing a functioning social market economy, and in  reorienting their security and defense policy. Therefore, we  are willing to accept them as members in to the EU and to bring  them close to the European security structures already now.    The complicated process of deepening and expanding the EU  cannot be separated from the reform of the Atlantic alliance.  European and transatlantic developments must not diverge. This  was a central message of the NATO summit in Brussels in January  1994.    Europe, which is growing together, has been recognized as an  equal partner of the United States. The West European Union is  strengthened as the European pillar of the alliance. In the  future, it can rely on NATO structures and forces so that Europe  becomes capable of strategic action and can take over more  responsibility for the common tasks. This reduction of the  burden on North America at the same time creates the  preconditions for lasting involvement in and for Europe.    The alliance has accepted the stabilization of Central and  East Europe as the main strategic task. As a result, it can  fulfill two decisive political and strategic functions today and  in the future:    -- First, it is the only functioning mechanism that links  North America and Europe.    -- Second, it is the only institution that can create  effective partnership between the Euro-Atlantic community on the  one hand and Russia and the other East European states on the  other.    The instrument for that is a balanced approach of  integration  and cooperation. NATO's "Partnership for Peace" initiative is a  flexible mechanism with which this approach can be made more  concrete. We can differentiate without discrimination.    Twelve states have already joined the "Partnership for  Peace"  initiative, others are on the point of doing so, including  Russia -- which is a step of strategic importance for Europe's  security policy.    Over the past 18 months I have held intensive talks with  most  Central and East European states. One important goal was to  create a network of intensive relations of cooperation and to  practically implement Europe's opening up toward the East.  Another concern was not to fix our neighbors in the East to an  exclusive orientation toward the West, but to encourage them to  improve their relations with each other.    Of particular importance for the regional balance in East  Europe and thus for Europe's stability as a whole is an  independent, democratic, and economically viable Ukraine.  However, Ukraine is in a profound crisis at the moment.    We need an internationally coordinated approach so that  critical developments do not endanger European stability. This  is the task not only of Russia and the United States regarding  the issue of nuclear disarmament, but also of neighbor Russia in  relations with neighbor Ukraine, of the EU in its relations with  East Europe, and of the United States in a differentiated policy  toward East Europe, which now sets the correct priorities.    The reform process in Russia is and remains the key for a  peaceful development in East Europe. It must be successful.  Therefore, Germany supports this process with everything it can  provide.    Just because of its enormous size, Russia will always have a  special position. However, no one can and wants to isolate the  big power Russia. Stability in Europe can come about only with  Russia and not against it. We need and want togetherness and  cooperation also on military issues for safeguarding peace.  This is the opposite of isolation and marginalization.    However, Russia must obtain the trust of its neighbors and  partners primarily through its own actions. This includes  respecting the neighbors' sovereignty and the inviolability of  the orders. We must do everything so that Russia takes the  right path in a difficult situation and that the wrong decisions  are not made by the wrong forces.    Russia links the participation in the "Partnership for  Peace"  program with the expectation that NATO develops cooperation  relations of a special quality with Russia. Russia does not  want to be a guest in Europe, as President Yeltsin said. It  wants to participate in solving security problems in Europe and  wants to be occasionally included in NATO projects for  exercises, to which I do not object.    In this connection, Defense Minister Grachev suggested  explaining the new Russian military doctrine to the Nato defense  ministers. I do not see any reason why we should not support  this.    It is now important to preserve the momentum of cooperation  and to implement it in practical steps in such a way that Russia  is recognized as a strategic partner of NATO and can also feel  like a partner. We must take care that the special quality of  partnership between NATO and Russia does not strangle the  process of integration of others in the Western institutions.    After the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Germany,  further development of our defense-policy relations is of  special importance. Therefore, together with my Russian  colleague, I have decided to hold a joint navy exercise in the  Baltic Sea this year, which will be followed in 1995 by a  German-Russian command post exercise in Russia and in 1996 by a  German-Russian maneuver in western Germany.    Our contribution to stability and peace demonstrates that  Germany can be relied on as a member of the alliance and that we  take over all necessary duties as an equal member in the  international community.    However, this must also have an effect when it is necessary.  We will never agree to opting out of military integration. The  Federal Constitutional Court has approved this attitude twice.  I am sure that our policy will be definitely confirmed in  summer. Apart from that, one just has to imagine what would  have happened internationally if we had left the AWACS planes.    This is true historic progress that here nations have  irrevocably linked their fates with each other, that they have  entered a voluntary dependence, that it is not each individual  nation that operates its own plane but that one plane is  operated by 12 nations. There you have one system that shows the  core of political progress, of confidence-building after World  War II. However, this plane must then also be flown together  when it is necessary.    In order to save resources, it will be necessary that not  everyone has his universal army, but that one either operates  joint systems or puts them together as modules. We are holding  talks with the Dutch to put together German and Dutch submarines  -- a fascinating idea.    However, if my Dutch colleague asks me whether they will  also  leave port together and I tell him, on principle yes but it may  be that I have to go to Karlsruhe first, this shows how  untenable German positions are.    The international missions of the Bundeswehr are a most  profoundly central political issue, which decides on our ability  to join Europe and our credibility as an alliance partner.    German-French brigade, Eurocorps, German-U.S. corps,  German-Dutch corps -- how are all these things going to work if  Germany follows a special path all the time? By the way, we  have a German commanding general in Strasbourg -- the first  commanding general, who leads the Eurocorps, who commands  German, French, and Belgian soldiers on French territory. This  is one example of progress. And if one talks to the German  soldiers in Strasboug, they say: We like walking around in  German uniforms here much better than in some large western  German cities.    Germany needs armed forces for national defense, which can  be  reduced in their presence and readiness for action because of  the improved situation and can become more dependent on  mobilization.    The structures for collective defense need not be fully  fleshed out anymore in Central Europe. The preparation period  of several weeks, which can be used militarily in the unlikely  case of a major aggression suggests to shift operational  training for individual units of the main defense forces to the  period of a crisis.    At the same time a minimum contingent of present, quickly  replaceable, and flexible crisis reaction forces with high  professionality is needed, which is capable of multinational  cooperation.    The requirements of national defense and the ability to  react  in a crisis under completely different strategic conditions  primarily determine the presence and structure of our future  armed forces.    From that we are now drawing conclusions for the reform of  the Bundeswehr. The Bundeswehr's need for adjustment is great  and requires mobility. When I see how much trouble the 7,000  Bonn civil servants are making, who are supposed to come to  Berlin in the course of 10 years, and I know that in the  Bundeswehr 20,000 people must move every year, this shows where  the mobile parts of our society are.    The Bundeswehr is underfinanced today. This is a sentence  that sounds very harmless but that has effects: There is a gap  between structure and assignment on the one hand and the  finances that are available on the other. This gap must be  closed.    We have to continue consistently with rationalization. It is  necessary to gain financial leeway for the urgently needed  investments, which the Bundeswehr needs for new construction. I  have ordered corresponding studies and measures.    The results are summarized in a conceptional guideline for  the development of the Bundeswehr, which I want to present to  the Parliament and to the Defense Committee in April and to have  it discussed on a broad basis.    Only at the end of this process will the overall picture of  the future Bundeswehr become visible. Only then will it also be  possible to make a final decision on the future size.    Usually, something like that is not done during an election  year, but I believe that we owe it to the Bundeswehr to look  beyond the election date into the future and to come to as much  consensus as possible.    The Bundeswehr is proving its worth in a difficult time, it  is mastering the challenges of the upheavals excellently. The  criticism that is voiced occasionally is inappropriate. The  report by the defense commissioner, which is justified in  showing specific deficiencies, must, however, not be confused  with a report on the general condition of the armed forces.    I believe that over the past years the Bundeswehr has  adjusted to new tasks more quickly than many people expected. I  still remember how anxiously some soldiers went on their way to  Cambodia. And I am very proud of the achievements that our  soldiers complied in Beledweynne in Somalia.    I believe that in the future, too, the Bundeswehr will  decisively contribute to preserving Germany's ability to act and  to function in the alliance. It is not only in Germany's  interest that we have efficient armed forces.    There is no European defense without appropriate German  armed  forces. Nor is there a European defense without German armed  forces that are basically wiling to do the same as the French,  Danish, British, and Polish armed forces. I think that we will  be able to close this one open flank, which still exists, in a  reasonable way.</p>

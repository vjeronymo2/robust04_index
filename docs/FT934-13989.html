			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Publicis in share swap expansion PUBLICIS, one of France's leading marketing services groups, is expanding its interests by merging with FCA], one of the few remaining independent French advertising agencies, in a share swap deal. The merger, which will leave Publicis with a majority interest in the combined company, follows months of negotiations in which FCA] has tried to find an international partner. FCA], the fourth largest advertising agency in France, which also has an international network, fell into the red last year following a fraud perpetrated by an executive who is now in prison. It held talks with McCann-Erickson, one of the largest agencies within Interpublic, the US marketing group, but eventually decided to merge with Publicis. Mr Maurice Levy, chairman of Publicis, said that the merger 'will reinforce our position in almost every country and will enable us for the first time to have a strong agency in New York'.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Voyage of the damned: a slaver's diary - In 1700, Walter Prideaux sailed for Africa on the slave ship Daniel and Henry. His log of the voyage has now been published. John Kitching re-tells his tale IN THE 500th anniversary year of Columbus's voyage to America, another extraordinary trans-Atlantic tale can be told. By chance, the log of the slave ship Daniel and Henry, which sailed from Dartmouth in 1700, was found on a London bookstall. The discovery has led to a vivid reconstruction* of a remarkable trip to Africa's Guinea coast and the West Indies. It is the shameful story of a trade in which the British always claimed an abolitionist role. CHRISTMAS: quite the worst time of year for a journey, and the most difficult at which to put together a crew. It would take Roger Mathew, an experienced Devonian captain, several weeks to find the 44 men he needed for his gruelling voyage. For several reasons, the complement of a slave ship had to be more than double that of a normal merchant vessel: its financial backers feared slave revolt, against which they could not insure; the barter process was labour-intensive; guarding the slaves took many man-hours, and the death rate among the crew was high. Of the Daniel and Henry's company, 10 were to die and five to run away; others married or were bundled into the Royal Navy. Only 24 returned. But the fate of the slaves was far worse. Roger Mathew's ship would sail for the African coast to collect men, women and children in exchange for cloth and weapons. Months later, the slaves who survived would be delivered to rich plantation owners in the West Indies in hard bargaining for sugar. It was a brutally simple equation: barter equals slaves equals sugar. In 1683, Mathew had delivered 123 slaves to Barbados as an unlicenced trader, returning to Dartmouth with, among other things, two tons of Guinea redwood. It was clear to the boat's merchant backers, Daniel Ivy and Henry Arthur, that he was the man for the job. be With him would be Walter Prideaux, his 23-year-old nephew, who came from a well-known Quaker family. Nearly 300 years later, it is Prideaux's meticulous record of the voyage that serves as an epitaph for this trade in human beings. Like a good seaman, Prideaux records the ship's position dutifully. As conditions worsen, so his sympathy for the slaves grows. An uneasiness and a strong whiff of superstition creep into his log. Repeatedly, he describes a flaming sword (suggesting divine retribution) and his record becomes a catalogue of slave deaths. When Prideaux set sail for Africa, in February 1700, there were no restrictions on involvement by the Society of Friends (Quakers) in the slave trade. William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania and a devout Quaker, had owned slaves in the 1690s. Indeed, during its journey to Jamaica the Daniel and Henry fell in with the Society, a Quaker slave ship. The Friends did not act on their involvement in slavery until 1757 - the year Prideaux died - when alarm was expressed at their yearly meeting in London. The Daniel and Henry was a merchantman typical of the period: broad-beamed, apple-cheeked at the bow and made entirely of wood: oak, elm, beech, pine, mahogany or teak were all in use as planking, baulks, keels, masts and spars. It carried between 25 and 30 sails. As it left Dartmouth, Prideaux's hopes were running high; but he was already suffering: '5th March, 1700: The wind at topgallant gale: being not all well myself, having my head in raging pain.' Even before taking the slaves on board, life for the crew below decks was cramped and chaotic: 'A mass of humanity in which each man was permitted approximately 14 inches (35 cm) breadth to sling his hammock.' It was dark and cold and the air was foul. 'The Daniel and Henry, fully laden, rode deep in the green waters of the Western Approaches . . . the risk of fire on a timber ship, caulked and coated with combustible oakum and tar pitch, carrying 80 barrels of gunpowder and hogsheads of highly inflammable spirits, constantly occupied the minds of her officers . . . into these cramped quarters, already alive with vermin, came the flower of England's merchant marine. They had but the haziest idea of whence they were bound, little idea of basic hygiene, only the most meagre of bedding and few clothes.' What lay ahead was the prospect of protracted negotiations with caboceers (village headmen) as bolts of woollen cloth, sets of knives or Guinea coast gold (often fake) were traded for slaves. The English were sustained by the then-fashionable notion that Africa was so overcrowded that the slave ships were doing the continent a favour. Another seafarer, Captain Nathaniel Uring, wrote in 1726: 'The country is full of people, as may be supposed by every man's being allowed as many wives as he has the ability to maintain; and if it were not for these wars among themselves, and the Europeans carrying such great numbers of slaves from thence, it is highly probable that they would grow so numerous at last that the country would not contain them.' Almost all the slaves destined for the hold of the Daniel and Henry were from what is now Ghana. Slaves of Coromantine (Ghanaian) origin were the most highly-prized as strong, long-living and healthy specimens. Caboceers were always on the look-out for novice traders: the headmen were past masters at dressing mutton as lamb. Grey hair would be dyed, bodies shaved smooth and oiled to give the appearance of health. Bartering was a long, tiresome process with a complex set of rules entirely of the Africans' making and liable to change at any time. A selection of goods from the Daniel and Henry would be demanded and inspected. Plenty of gifts - dashee - to headmen also changed hands. When both sides were satisfied, slaves were marked with the initial letters of the ship's name and consigned to minor caboceers until the goods were ferried ashore. Mathew and Prideaux found themselves in fierce competition with other traders on the Guinea coast. Negotiations began at daybreak and continued until sunset. Several trips by longboat had to be made from the Daniel and Henry, which was moored well offshore for added security. Prideaux negotiated from the longboat, Mathew from the ship. Their first slave was bought in Dix Cove on April 11 but progress for several weeks after that was desperately slow: '7th April, 1700: We seeing at Caotre several canoes on shore and many negroes on the sand and we had one canoe which came off to us . . . but got nothing but a few limes.' Then, mooring at Poinyon, the Daniel and Henry took on 452 slaves, mostly women and girls. But within 30 days of leaving Africa, Prideaux records on October 6, 1700, that 153 slaves had already died and been jettisoned. In the end, the number sold in Jamaica was 246 out of the 452 loaded in Guinea. Ruthless captains could trade on the basis of losing up to 80 per cent of their slaves en route. Disease and overcrowding were among the main culprits on the so-called 'middle passage' between Africa and Jamaica. So was despair. Dysentery was rife, with slaves who had been used to high-fibre food reduced to eating beans boiled in lard and salt beef. The Africans, it was noted by many seafarers, cared little for salt. It was impossible to conceal the poor physical condition of many of Mathew's slaves, and the predominance of women was to depress further the price merchants were prepared to bid. Few captains can have felt at ease during the middle passage. Perhaps their very discomfort is caught by the 18th century writer Thomas Aubrey: 'What a devil makes these plaguey toads die so fast? To which I answer: 'Tis inhumanity, barbarity and the greatest cruelty of their commander and his crew'.' The four-month run to Jamaica tested Prideaux sorely. He had been writing his log diligently in a vellum-bound ledger bearing his coat of arms and the legend Walter Prideaux - His Booke - Anno Domini 1688. It had been his 12th birthday present. 'As in the first stage, Prideaux opens his account with the ritual entreaty of God's blessing upon the voyage,' writes Nigel Tattersfield in The Forgotten Trade. 'This is no empty supplication, for nowhere was man more at the mercy of the elements than at sea. And, beneath the everyday navigational conventions of the log book, there arises a suggestion that Prideaux is far from easy about being employed on a slave ship . . . He grows more and more fearful; five prayers are invoked on this passage.' Even sighting Barbados gives him no cause for joy. To him, the Daniel and Henry has become a ship of death. Prideaux has become acutely conscious of his own mortality. The devil seems to sail with him. On October 22 he writes: 'Saw a star shoot which continued like a flaming sword for three minutes.' Jamaica was reached in November. For the first time in nine months, the ship's scuttles and gunports could be opened, the foul air released and the hold scrubbed out. Pitch was burned like incense in a bid to fumigate the area. Wood was washed down with vinegar, a makeshift disinfectant. The huge accumulation of sewage made cleaning the bilges a hideous task. Rats roamed freely; cockroaches and mice were everywhere. The sails had been ruined by a year of verminous attack. There was much to be done before the Daniel and Henry could change from slave ship to merchantman. By the following summer, 1701, some 18 months after starting its voyage, the crew of the Daniel and Henry was back in Devon. For the captain, the balance sheet was not healthy. The slaves had generated perhaps Pounds 3,800, although this was largely in bills of exchange and promissory notes likely to be discounted heavily by London bankers. He had also brought back five tons of muscovado sugar worth less than Pounds 300. His outgoings were about Pounds 5,300. His hazardous and often horrific voyage had not made him or his backers rich. None of the crew ever worked the slave routes again. Mathew went back to ordinary merchantmen and never returned to Africa. Prideaux, who married and produced 13 children, became a maltster. Several of his descendants were important figures in the Society of Friends, well into this century. But, chiefly, he left us his log, which hints at horrors almost beyond comprehension. * The Forgotten Trade, by Nigel Tattersfield; Jonathan Cape, Pounds 20.</p>

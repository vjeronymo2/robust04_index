			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNSON PROPOSES LIMITS ON CHATSWORTH BUSINESSES  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson on Tuesday asked the Los Angeles City Council to  temporarily ban certain businesses -- including motels, thrift shops and  auto-related firms -- from Chatsworth's main commercial strip.  </P> <P> His proposal would impose tighter controls on building heights, design,  landscaping, parking and signs on Devonshire Street between De Soto Avenue and  Topanga Canyon Boulevard, and on a short stretch of Topanga Canyon south of  Devonshire.  </P> <P> It would temporarily prohibit development of businesses that would better fit  into industrial areas, said Ralph Crouch, planning deputy to Bernson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Due for Vote Tuesday  </P> <P> Bernson's proposal, which will come before the council for a vote Tuesday,  would set the wheels in motion for city planners to recommend specific  restrictions. Their recommendations would be the subject of public hearings.  </P> <P> The restrictions would remain in effect for a year or until the council  approves a new development plan for the area. The plan, which seeks to  transform the area in a fashionable shopping district, is expected to be  finished in a year.  </P> <P> "We want to upgrade it into a desirable commercial area rather than a catch-all  for everything," Bernson said. He introduced his proposal at the request of a  citizens advisory committee that he appointed to prepare a development plan for  the area.  </P> <P> The council recently enacted similar controls for the Reseda business district  at the behest of Councilwoman Joy Picus.  </P></p>

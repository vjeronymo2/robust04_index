			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Leicester western bypass plan AMEC has started the New Year with a trio of contracts worth around Pounds 90m, all of which were given the 'green light' in the run-up to Christmas. Heading the list is the Pounds 36m A46 Leicester western bypass contract, which AMEC Civil Engineering won in joint venture with Alfred McAlpine. The 130-week contract, which started on site on January 4, covers construction of about 12.5km of dual lane carriageway located to the north and west of the city from the M1 at Kirby Muxloe to the A46 Fosse Way at Syston. Work includes the construction of a range of grade separated junctions and over 50 structures. Crossings include the Rothley Brook at Thurcaston, the Grand Central Railway, the River Soar, the Grand Union Canal and the M1. At the same time, AMEC Design and Management and American sister company Morse Diesel International have been awarded a construction management contract to fit-out the new London headquarter's for Barclays Bank. Located at 54 Lombard Street, in the heart of the City of London, the 17-storey 300,000 sq ft building will be fitted out under a phased contract, starting in May and ending in July next year. In Bristol, AMEC Developments has been given the go-ahead on the Pounds 24m Severn Gate project, following approval of a Pounds 3.6m city grant by the Department of the Environment. The project will provide 430,000 sq ft of industrial and distribution facilities on a 35 acre site. The development is part of a 400 acre landholding owned by AMEC's joint development partner, RTZ Estates and is situated adjacent to the proposed link from the M5 to the new Severn crossing.</p>

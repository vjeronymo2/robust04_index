			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers by </F> Vladimir Plesnik in The Hague on 3 March: "East Europe Is  Transforming Itself and the West"]    [Text] Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers (55)  granted an interview to Czech reporters in The Hague on 3 March.  Prior to the visit to the Czech Republic by Netherlands Queen  Beatrix on 22-24 March, the prime minister outlined his  country's views on the issues affecting present-day Europe.    [Plesnik] Many leading Czech politicians believe that the  integration of the countries of Central and East Europe will  mean far-reaching changes not only for the postcommunist  countries, but also for West Europe itself.    [Lubbers] This is already happening. I will not only refer  to the Association Agreements with the East European countries  -- they are certainly opening the gates, and not just to one-way  traffic. The current world is characterized by the  globalization of the economy; in this new and changed situation,  new pressure is coming from those seeking membership to the  European Union, not only from the former communist countries,  but also from countries such as Austria and Scandinavia. What  is the result? Greater competitiveness, tougher competition,  and new impulses.    Let me give you an example: How do we stimulate investments  in the financially demanding most modern technologies so that we  stay abreast of Japan or the United States? Until recently, our  financial system preferred direct taxation, because it  guaranteed progressive taxes and, consequently, higher revenue  for the state and the possibility of higher social benefits.  Now, everything has changed quite substantially. Even the  left-wing Greens, who were successful in the local elections on  Wednesday [2 March], have beseeched us: Support indirect  taxation; it could release funds for ecological projects, for  other sources of energy.    [Plesnik] Do you share the view of some politicians in the  postcommunist Central European countries that the vision of a  united Europe along the lines of Maastricht was premature and  naive?    [Lubbers] No, I do not think this at all. I look at the  Maastricht Treaty on two levels: On the one hand, as a specific  vision following the culmination of which the Community should  shift as a whole to a higher level and, on the other hand, as  something that contains the resources for fulfilling this  vision. This is not a stiff, rigid strategy, but one that can  be modified relatively flexibly. I have in mind, for instance,  the negotiations on the affiliation of Austria and Norway to the  European Union being held since the beginning of this week,  negotiations that went into the smallest details.    [Plesnik] The Russian nationalist Zhirinovskiy forecasts  that, sooner or later, the Czech Republic will be swallowed up  by Germany and, thus, the instincts of previous generations will  be aroused. What are the Netherlands' experiences with European  Germany as a partner? Does the country view it as such a threat  as, for example, some of the Danes?    [Lubbers] The Netherlands, as a small country, immediately  and fatefully depended for centuries on communication and  contacts with the surrounding world, including an economically  and politically influential neighbor. This has something to do  with national identity and preserving and developing it, because  it is not ingrained forever. I view equilibrium in relations  with a strong and influential Germany based on democratic  principles, a Germany integrating into Europe, as a challenge  and as a stimulus for the Netherlands itself.    [Plesnik] Do you think that the Kingdom of the Netherlands  will "disappear" in the future European federal superstate or  will it try to preserve its identity?    [Lubbers] I do not think that we would be lost in the Europe  of the future. Society in the Netherlands in recent years has  transformed itself from a traditional social welfare state into  a state with a resolutely functioning government and responsible  citizens and has found a certain equilibrium between these two  elements. The state is simply moving toward the citizen as much  as possible -- take culture, health care, and education. Of  course, the state is not abandoning its mission, because some of  the most pressing issues can only be resolved on a pan-European  or even global level -- for example, ecology.    Naturally, during the Cold War, while someone was labelled  an  adversary, it was simpler to lump people together. However, the  situation has changed, and it is the task of politicians not to  make promises that cannot be fulfilled, but to constantly  communicate with the citizens.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondentr Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin made a decision and issue directives on a  state subsidy of 110,400 million roubles to Russian newspapers  before the end of 1994. This decision was adopted at the prime  minister's meeting with a large group of editors of national and  regional newspapers on Tuesday afternoon, Valentin Sergeyev,  chief of the press office of the Russian Government, told  ITAR-TASS.    It was also agreed at the meeting that the distribution of  state subsidies will be made by a public council formed of heads  of central and local media at the Russian committee on the press.    During the meeting there was a thorough discussion of the  situation and problems of the central and regional press, the  need for financial support for most publications, particularly  in the economically weak regions, Sergeyev said. The  fundamental provisions of the draft Russian law on state  protection for the media were also discussed. Chernomyrdin  described to chief editors in detail the economic situation in  the country and the government's cardinal measures for economic  stabilisation.    Commenting on the results of the meeting, Sergeyev said he  believes that during the conversation chief editors received the  maximum of information they need in their daily work and for  grasping the actual situation in the country. This enabled them  to revise the viewpoint about the alleged lack of understanding  in the government for problems of the press. "I believe editors  got convinced that the goverment regards the press not only as  the `fourth power' but also as branch number one, the situation  in which should always be given close attention", Sergeyev said.</p>

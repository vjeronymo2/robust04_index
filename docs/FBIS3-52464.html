The results showed the victory  of 10 new aspirants while six incumbents retained their seats.  Ishaq al-Farhan was reelected president of the executive  council while 'Abd-al-Majid al-Dhunaybat was reelected as  president of the Majlis al-Shura by acclamation.    The Majlis al-Shura then elected 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shuraydah  as its vice-president and 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jabir and Khalid  al-Qudat as the president's assistants.    Only 106 out of 120 Majlis al-Shura members proceeded  afterwards to the election of the 16 executive council members  out of 25 candidates; eight members cast empty ballots. Leading  members Hammam Sa'id and Muhammad Abu-Faris refused to nominate  themselves to the council despite suggestions by many.    The results showed that moderates won most of the seats on  the party's executive council.    The IAF is the political branch of the Muslim Brotherhood  and  while Brotherhood membership is not a pre-requisite for IAF  membership, most IAF members are Brotherhood members as well.    A majority of IAF members, estimated by the party at between  3,000 and 5,000, supports the moderates.    The new executive council and number of votes they obtained  are as follows: 'Abd-al-Latif 'Arabiyat (78 votes), Hamzah  Mansur (76 votes), 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Qudat (73 votes), Bassam  al-'Umush (72 votes), 'Adnan al-Jaljuli (70 votes), Ahmad Tanash  (69 votes), Ahmad al-Kafawin (69 votes), 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah  (68 votes), Na'il al-Masalihah (68 voters), Muhammad 'Uwaydah  (61 votes), Jamil Abu-Bakir (60 votes), Ibrahim al-Kilani (57  votes), Tariq al-Tall (57 votes), Zuhayr al-Zumayli (56 votes),  Sa'ud Abu-Mahfuz (55 votes), 'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur (53 votes)  and Ziyad Khalifah (49 votes -- a reserve member)    The first meeting of the council was set for next Thursday  during which several committees will be formed, mainly a legal  committee that will investigate into contestations raised by  some IAF members of the results of the Shura council that took  place last week.    The IAF also issued a statement in which it condemns  Vatican's recognition of the state of Israel that "denotes the  submission of the spiritual leadership of the Christian  followers to the Zionist domination."    The statement also called on all political parties and  groupings in the Arab and Muslim world to denounce this  recognition.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Air France faces third inquiry The European Commission yesterday opened an inquiry into a FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) capital injection granted to Air France, on the grounds that it might amount to illegal state aid, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The French government announced in February that it was providing extra capital to the national carrier through a subscription of equity-linked debt from Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state-controlled financial institution. It is the Commission's third inquiry in two years into alleged state subsidies at Air France. In November 1991, Brussels waved through a FFr2bn capital injection and last July approved the FFr1.25bn purchase of an 8.8 per cent stake in the company by Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled bank.</p>

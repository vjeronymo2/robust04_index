			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Ballot rules favour modernisers Labour's modernisers - Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown - look likely to benefit from the new system for electing the party leader. The procedures which came into force last year replace a system under which union barons wielded hundreds of thousands of block votes and constituency activists fixed their choice in smoke-filled rooms. Instead, Labour's elected representatives, party members and trade union members who pay the political levy will vote by ballot in three sections, each holding a third of the vote: Labour's 264 MPs and 45 MEPs. About 250,000 individual members of the party, who will vote in a postal ballot. The estimated 4.5m political levy-payers in the unions. Each union will ballot levy-paying members under their own procedures and the result will be aggregated into a national total at Labour party headquarters. Union leaders will be able to recommend and campaign for a favoured leadership candidate, but under the new system of secret ballots, they will not be able to apply the kind of pressure they often exercised in the past. Mr John Prescott, Labour's employment spokesman, is a clear favourite among many union leaders, their officials and shop stewards. But they may not speak for their members in expressing that preference. Both Mr Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, and Mr Brown, shadow chancellor, may have less support inside union organisations than Mr Prescott but either of them could look more attractive as general election winners to the wider party membership. Opinion is divided over when the election should be held. Theoretically it would be possible to hold the contest quickly. 'We could send out ballot papers to our levy-payers tomorrow,' one senior union official said. This means that Labour need not wait until its annual conference in the autumn to elect a new leader, and the election does not require the calling of a special conference. The timing of the election will be decided at a meeting of the party's national executive committee, probably after the European elections on June 9. Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, will be the key figure in the process. He will make a recommendation to the executive about the timing of the election. Some senior figures in the party believe the leadership contest should be held as soon as possible after the European elections. 'We want to turn the focus back on John Major and his government and not get involved in a protracted election campaign all through the summer,' said one party source. Lord Healey, the former deputy leader of the party, said yesterday only Labour MPs should be entitled to vote in the leadership election - as was the case before 1981. As the system of electing the leader can be changed only by a party conference, Lord Healey's suggestion could not be implemented in time for this election. In any case, an election under the new system is designed to ensure that the Labour leader can claim genuine popular support. Each nomination for the party leadership requires the backing of 20 per cent of Labour MPs to be valid. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader who will be acting leader until an election, can choose to remain as deputy, as the first official opportunity for a challenge to her position is the autumn party conference. It was unclear last night whether she would remain as deputy leader or decide to run for leader.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> PLANNING OFFICIAL QUITS IN JAPAN STOCK SCANDAL  </P> <P> Japan's Economic Planning Minister, Ken Harada, resigned today over a share  trading scandal he was once charged to investigate.  </P> <P> Harada joined two other ministers driven out of office last month by the  Recruit Co. scandal but said he had done nothing illegal.  </P> <P> Harada, who took over as economic planning minister less than a month ago, had  previously been chairman of a government committee charged with investigating  the share trading scandal.  </P> <P> The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported in its afternoon edition that Harada had  received large contributions from Recruit Co., parent company of a real-estate  firm at the center of the scandal that has rocked the Japanese government.  </P> <P> In a statement to reporters after handing his resignation to Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita, Harada confirmed that he had received money from the company.  </P> <P> "I don't think I have done anything wrong in receiving political contributions.  The amount of contributions I received was within the law," he said.  </P> <P> Harada, a close aide to Takeshita, said he resigned in order to spare the  government any trouble.  </P></p>

He named such former Russian military bases as Loksa,  Keila-Joa, Klooga and Tapa as being the first where similar  activities should be conducted.    Olesk said that besides the need to guarantee security and  order in Paldiski during the dismantling work of the nuclear  reactors of the training base, the registry was a good  experience for the authorities to test the new methods of  registering. Olesk added that after the census of 1989 the  number and structure of population in Estonia has changed  greatly, with no new census being in view before 2000.    According to the preliminary results of registering of  inhabitants in Paldiski, over six thousand people live there,  Olesk told ETA on Monday. In the course of registration that  lasted from March 22 to 25, 3,684 registration questionnaires  were fulfilled. In addition, a list of 892 Russian military and  their families from the submarine training centre and 69  military from Tallinn fleet headquarters is in the possession of  Estonian Government. Children up to 16 years were inscribed in  the questionnaires of their parents and their exact amount,  estimated at about one thousand, will be clear next week.  Another thousand people did not appear at the registration  mainly for being on a business trip.    Olesk added that people that did not register themselves  will  have difficulties in moving in the town when the dismantling  work of the nuclear reactor at the former military base will  start and people that do not have a registering inscription in  their documents or do not possess a special permission to be in  the town, will be detained until their identification is  determined.    Up to now the exact number and composition of population in  Paldiski, largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and  Russian military, was not known, for the former town  authorities, subject to Russian military authorities and  dissolved by a law adopted by Estonian Riigikogu [parliament] on  March 9, refused to hand over data on the subject.    Government's special representative in Paldiski Juri Tikk  told a press conference, on Tuesday, that the dismantling work  of the nuclear reactor, which will bring about a special order  to be enforced in the town, will start in the second decade of  April and last till the nuclear fuel is deported from Estonia at  the end of June or beginning of July.    Tikk said that at the first stage of dismantling, the  Russian  side will not allow anybody but "his own men" to observe the  process, for several allegedly secret mechanisms are situated at  the object. Later Estonian and international observers are  allowed to observe the liquidation process.    Tikk added that the possibility of a "black scenario", which  would mean a radioactive contamination of the environment, is  about zero but should not be excluded. In an emergency  situation Russian side intends to bring 200 chemical specialists  from Kaliningrad in an hour. In case there is a need to  evacuate local population, the Estonian side will pay the costs,  he added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Normally no depreciation is to be charged against goods during periods of storage. However, this does not mean that deductions cannot be taken for other reasons, such as a reduction in the market value of an item because of changes in style or obsolescence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Do not depreciate an item which is less than six months old (including an item subject to flat rate depreciation) except clothing and other rapidly depreciating articles which may be subject to considerable use in such a short period of time. Calculate yearly depreciation from the date an item is originally acquired to either the date of pickup (for shipment or storage claims), or to the date the property was lost or damaged (for other personnel claims). If the claimant acquired a used item, then the claimant should use either the date the original owner acquired the item and the original purchase price, or the claimant's purchase price and date he or she purchased the item. In accordance with the Allowance List_Depreciation Guide, compute yearly depreciation in 12 month increments (e.g., 6&hyph;17 months equals one year), excluding the month the property was acquired and the month that the property was picked up, lost or damaged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) No item will be depreciated by more than 75 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) No depreciation is charged against genuine antiques, objects of art, and collector's items, except for repair of portions thereof, such as upholstery, which requires periodic replacement or repair. For the purpose of this rule, a ``souvenir'' is not considered a collector's item.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Compensation normally allowed for an item damaged beyond economic repair is the actual value at the time of destruction. However, if an item has not been totally destroyed and any part remains useful and has a salvage value, and that part is to be retained by the claimant, the allowance will be the value at time of destruction less the ascertained value of the salvageable part. If the claimant does not wish to retain any salvageable part of a destroyed item, he or she may be allowed the full value at the time of the destruction with no deduction for salvage value, provided the claimant turns in the salvageable part to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office prior to payment of the claim or holds the item for turn-in to the carrier (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;44). If the item is turned in to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office, a receipt for the property, DD Form 1348&hyph;1 (DOD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document), will be included in the file of the paid claim. If the staff or command JA determines that salvageable items are valued at $25.00 or less, he or she may advise the claimant to dispose of them other than by turn-in and this decision will be noted on the chronology sheet. In certain situations it may be necessary for the claims office to assist the claimant to arrange for disposition of the property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) If, after payment of a claim, an approving or settlement authority discovers that the payment was erroneous because the claimant misrepresented the quality, quantity, age, condition, or replacement or repair cost of items, or other facts necessary to the adjudication of the claim, the approval or settlement authority may recalculate the amount allowed and arrange for recoupment of the erroneous amount paid. However, this procedure should be used sparingly, with doubts resolved in favor of the claimant. The procedure is independent of any other action taken against the claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) In determining allowable amounts, cents will be rounded off to the nearest whole dollar on each line item. Drop amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next dollar. Thus, $1.49 becomes $1.00 and $2.50 becomes $3.00.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.175 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Cognizable incidental expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expenses incident to repair or replacement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to actual value, the cost of obtaining estimates of repair necessary to substantiate amounts claimed for damaged property may be considered, provided the action of the claimant in contracting for the estimates appears reasonable under the circumstances or was specifically directed by the approval or settlement authority. However, when the cost of an estimate can be applied toward the bill due upon completion of repairs, the cost of the estimate will not be allowed, whether or not the claimant chooses to have the repair done.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Replacement of certain documents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The fee charged for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacing certain necessary documents such as marriage licenses, driver's licenses, passports, or birth certificates may be allowed when these documents are lost or destroyed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sales tax and drayage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Sales tax and drayage (including postage or handling charges to mail an item or replacement part) can be allowed up to $50 per claim prior to the actual cost being incurred. However, payment in excess of $50 will require the claimant to substantiate that the cost has been incurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

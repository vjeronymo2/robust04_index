			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Jan (NA) -- Interior Minister  Carlos Ruckauf said today that the government does not fear new  violence or subversive outbreaks but admitted that security  measures will be reinforced.    In this regard, he said border controls will be intensified  to neutralize the arrival of illegal immigrants, and that  foreigners who violate residence regulations will be repatriated.    Ruckauf discarded the presence of activities linked to the  Shining Path guerrilla organization but warned that activities  by different clandestine organizations involved in bringing  illegal aliens to the country are being investigated.    The government also is studying the possibility of investing  about $40 million to re-equip provincial police and the Border  Police to stop any attempt at violence.    Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will determine where to get  the funds to purchase shields, rubber bullets, tear gas, and  anti-riot equipment. Quick deployment forces capable of  controlling outbreaks similar to the one in Santiago del Estero  will be created.    In this regard, Ruckauf noted the work by the intelligence  services that "worked well under a situation difficult to  predict."    Regarding the repatriation of 30 Peruvians, Ruckauf  explained  that the same measure will be implemented with other illegal  residents "even though Argentina continues its open-door policy."    Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said the deportation  of the illegal immigrants was made due "to the illegal  occupation of houses and the lack of work contracts justifying  their presence in Argentina."    Therefore, vigilance efforts will be intensified at the  borders with the use of modern computerized control systems that  will be obtained through international bids in the next 30 to 60  days.    Ruckauf rejected any possibility of new outbreaks of  violence, "but we will take all the necessary precautionary  measures just in case."</p>

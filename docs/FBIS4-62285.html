			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Gubarev article: "The Russian Atom and the </F> American Ultimatum"]    [Text] It is already clear that the G-7 countries, to  whose meeting in Naples Boris Yeltsin has been invited, has  prepared a surprise or, to be more accurate, an ultimatum for  him. The Russian president will have, together with his  partners, to advocate the shutting down of the Chernobyl AES  [nuclear electric power station]: Yeltsin's influence on  Ukraine, it is said, will be crucial.... He will then be  required to provide guarantees that Russian AESes where  high-power pressure-tube reactors are in use will also be  gradually withdrawn from operation. If Yeltsin does not agree,  the Western countries "will deny aid." A similar ulltimatum has  already been received by Ukraine: Economic aid to Kiev now  depends directly on the shutdown of the Chernobyl AES reactors.    The "softening-up fire" prior to the decisive attack on the  nuclear power industry of Ukraine and Russia was carried out at  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] session of experts  held in Vienna. It is common knowledge that a commission set up  by this international organization analyzed the condition of the  Chernobyl AES. And although commission members were unable to  prepare their findings prior to the Vienna conference and did  not present their conclusions, the IAEA's decision was  conclusive: It is essential to close down the reactors at  Chernobyl and shut down the station, because it is "too old."  The IAEA and other international organizations will help run  other Ukrainian AESes only if Chernobyl is shut down. The IAEA  is making precisely those recommendations in the runup to the  G-7 meeting in Naples. The IAEA leadership is in a hurry: Only  a little time remains before July, so they have decided not to  wait for the special commission's findings.    The Ukrainian delegation has naturally disagreed with the  IAEA. Western countries promised assistance, particularly as  regards modernizing the power units at Chernobyl, a long time  ago, but not a single dollar has been forthcoming. And to  dismiss the AES at Chernobyl as "old reactors" is, to put it  mildly, unjust. For the last two years the AESes of Russia and  Ukraine have operated more stably and reliably than those in  America, France, Sweden, and Germany. It is those countries  which are the leaders in terms of the number of times safety  systems have been activated. And the term "old" can only make  specialists smile. More than 150 nuclear power units, of which  around 50 are in the United States, are far "older" than the  high-power pressure-tube reactors. Consequently, when they were  designed and built, the safety requirements were quite  different: Not a single one of those units meets requirements.    What, then, has produced the attack on the former USSR's  nuclear power industry? The point is that in market relations  economics and politics are closely allied. Russia, for example,  has quit the arms markets. And now the United States sells  weapons in countries which previously looked to us.    Uranium is next in line. Here competition is very tough,  because selling uranium is a profitable business: It is small  wonder that our country has always been subject to restrictions.  The shutting down of reactors will enable Western and U.S. firms  to penetrate not just East Europe but Ukraine and Russia too.  Again, we are talking about billions of dollars.    Unfortunately, we ourselves are aiding and abetting our  Western competitors. Russia's nuclear power stations receive  scant finance. Loans to carry out maintenance and modernization  are lacking and wages are constantly paid late. Where else  could you find a country where the staff of nuclear power  stations such as the Kursk AES have received no wages for six  months and have declared a hunger strike in protest? Highly  skilled specialists in any other country are not just well paid  but are the state's pride and joy.... Perhaps we should accept  the "ultimatum" of the world's leading countries and close down  the AESes? But we must realize that we would then turn from  being an exporter to an importer of energy. And no one will  supply us with energy for free. So are we going to live by  candlelight?</p>

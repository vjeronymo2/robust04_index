			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: W Europe car sales up 12.9% West European new car sales rose year-on-year by an estimated 12.9 per cent in May to 1.09m, the biggest monthly increase this year. The slow recovery in the new car market achieved in the first quarter was halted in April by a fall of 2 per cent year-on-year. Provisional figures released yesterday by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea) suggest that the setback was only temporary, however, as sales rose sharply year-on-year in France and Spain and in several of the smaller European markets led by Scandinavia, Greece and Ireland. In the first five months of the year new car sales in west Europe are estimated by Acea to have risen by 5.6 per cent to 5.43m. Sales in the whole of 1993 fell by 15.2 per cent to 11.45m, the steepest decline in the post-war period.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- West European New Car Registrations*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 May      % Chg                       May      % Chg                1994   yr-on-yr                      1994   yr-on-yr  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany     300,390       +6.5    Switzerland     26,700       +1.1 Italy       178,870       +7.5    Portugal        20,550       +0.0 France      165,600      +26.2    Sweden          15,250      +39.9 UK          150,070      +10.0    Denmark         13,100      +70.1 Spain        87,710      +31.6    Greece          10,710      +49.4 Netherlands  36,680       +7.4    Ireland          9,580      +43.0 Belgium &amp;                         Norway           7,460      +49.2  Luxembourg  37,230      +21.7    Finland          6,320      +21.3 Austria      27,700      -12.5    Total market 1,093,920      +12.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Provisional figures. Source: European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The increase in orders for west Germany's manufacturing industry slowed in April to just 0.5 per cent over the previous month, compared to a 3.1 per cent increase in March. The main factor behind the slowdown was a reduction in export orders of 1.5 per cent, according to the federal statistics office, whereas domestic orders actually increased by 2 per cent. Net direct foreign investment into Hungary rose to Dollars 78m in March from Dollars 20m in February, the National Bank of Hungary said. The cumulative total of Dollars 186m in the first quarter of the year was down from Dollars 296m in the first quarter of last year.</p>

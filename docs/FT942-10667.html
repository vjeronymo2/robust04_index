			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Lebanon clash over reshuffle Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and President Elias Hrawi locked horns yesterday over a planned government reshuffle, Reuter reports from Beirut. The prime minister cancelled tomorrow's cabinet meeting, prior to greeting hundreds of supporters who flocked to his Beirut home in a show of solidarity. Last week, the two agreed to strengthen Christian representation in the cabinet but have since disagreed over the extent of the reshuffle and the new names to be brought in. Relations between the Syrian-backed government and the once-dominant Christian minority have been tense recently. The proposed changes appeared an attempt to improve them by bringing in more representative Christian politicians. Political observers said Mr Hariri wanted to bring four new ministers into the 30-member cabinet - two heavyweight Maronite Christian politicians representing influential Christian political parties, a Sunni Moslem and a Shi'ite Moslem. He also wanted to swap several portfolios, including interior, defence and information, among the present ministers. Mr Hrawi was pressing for a broader reshuffle, amounting to a reduction in Mr Hariri's supporters in the cabinet.</p>

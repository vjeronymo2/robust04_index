			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL FOOTBALL IS PLAYED AT BOWLING GREEN, TOO  </P> <P> Perhaps West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen should learn a little history before he  opens his mouth again in front of 200 reporters. In the Bowl Notebook on Dec.  30, Nehlen said he "thanked goodness (he) had a chance to go where they play  real football," while commenting on his departure from Bowling Green State  University.  </P> <P> Just to refresh Nehlen's memory, Bowling Green earned a bowl bid and a national  ranking with a 10-0 record 3 years before the Mountaineers did it for the first  time in their 97-year history.  </P> <P> KURT KEMPER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WALKING FOLK HERO;  </P> <P> HE'S READY WITH A 'BUNCH OF GUTS' FOR 2ND CROSS-COUNTRY TREK  </P> <P> Less than two years after he walked across the country to alert people to the  importance of cancer checkups, William Croker of Hawaiian Gardens will try to  do it again.  </P> <P> Known as Walkin' Willie, he has become something of a folk hero. A book and a  song have been written about him. Governors send him their autographs.  Tennessee has designated a day in his honor.  </P> <P> "What I do seems to capture people's imaginations," said Croker, who plans to  leave Feb. 6 from the Rossmoor Shopping Center in Seal Beach on a 76-day trip  to Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> "You do it with a dream and a bunch of guts. I can't describe it, but there's  something in me that drives the heck out of me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Presidential Meeting  </P> <P> Croker, whose mother, father and sister died of cancer, is repeating the walk  because when he reached Washington in the summer of 1987, President Reagan was  unable to meet with him. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) has promised Croker that  he will try to arrange a visit with President Bush when Croker arrives in the  capital April 22.  </P> <P> "It will not be over for me till I can meet the President," Croker said.  </P> <P> Still, Croker's efforts have hardly been in vain. "I believe these walks have  literally saved thousands of lives through communications I've had with the  media on the way," he said.  </P> <P> Wilson plans to introduce a resolution next month in the U.S. Senate declaring  April as National Cancer Awareness Month. Last spring, the third week in April  was established as Cancer Awareness Week in California after Croker made a  27-day walk to Sacramento and addressed the Legislature.  </P> <P> "Twice in two years, a transcontinental walk . . . and I'm 41 years old,"  Croker said, as if even he can't believe it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Videotapes Are Proof  </P> <P> But he has proof: videotapes taken on his 1987 trip. One shows him walking  along steamy interstates at 7 m.p.h., with traffic rushing by precariously  close.  </P> <P> "Pretty courageous isn't it?" Croker said while showing the tapes recently.  "Out in the rain on the interstate. That's how we got popular across the  country. Truckers would get on the CB and say, 'There he is again.' "  </P> <P> He has tapes of him jumping in a swimming pool after reaching Sacramento, and  tapes of him being interviewed by TV crews across the nation. There is one of a  bearded Croker ("I didn't have money for razor blades") meeting in Washington  with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).  </P> <P> He also has state proclamations and letters from politicians. "Look at the  proclamations, how they mention Walkin' Willie," Croker went on as he spread  them on a table. "They're making me an honorary citizen all across the country  . . . Illinois . . . the great state of Indiana . . . Rhode Island. I've been  made a citizen in 18 states. Autographed pictures from governors, letters from  every major U.S. senator. Here's a letter from Michael Dukakis."  </P> <P> And now there is a song that Croker says Larry Gatlin of the Gatlin Brothers  wrote. It starts:  </P> <P>  "Walkin' Willie, he's a hell of a man, he's gonna show the world where we  stand."  </P> <P> "They sent me a demo tape," Croker said. "Wait till they get that thing in  stereo."  </P> <P> Croker, who claims that no one can beat him walking, is also trying to promote  his sport.  </P> <P> "Everywhere I go now they want to get into this health kick of walking," he  said. "People have invited me back to start walkin' seminars."  </P> <P> A tall, bulky man with a receding hairline, Croker does not look as if he is on  a health kick. His stomach stands out like it did before he started his '87  walk. "That's why I'm beefed up," he said. "I lost 39 pounds the last time.  </P> <P> "I'm in the greatest shape of any human being in this world right now. I'm so  solid, I could leave right now and not have any pain or blisters. I walk every  day (about 20 miles). My legs are so strong. My feet are completely healed."  </P> <P> His feet were so blistered in 1987 that there were times when he took off his  shoes and blood poured from them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrival in April  </P> <P> He believes it will be tougher this time.  </P> <P> "I'll be facing windchill factors," he said. "I will have to face mountain  ranges you have never dreamed about. Inclines that are almost straight up. And  deserts. What I got to do ain't easy." He has timed the trip to arrive in  Washington in April, Cancer Awareness Month.  </P> <P> But he will attempt it because he believes there is not enough education about  early detection of cancer. When his mother died in 1970, Croker said the doctor  told him that if she had come to him a year earlier, she would have still been  alive. Croker remembers saying, "Doctor, as long as I live I'm going to do  something about it."  </P> <P> Croker will walk through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,  Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. Among the  cities and towns he will stop in will be San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas, Pecos,  Tex., Arkadelphia, Ark., Nashville, St. Louis, Chicago, Indianapolis,  Cincinnati, and Cumberland, Md.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trip Coordinator  </P> <P> He will be accompanied by a friend, Bob Dill, who will drive a motor home.  Hawaiian Gardens Councilman Don Schultze, coordinator of the trip, plans to  arrange the publicity in towns before Croker arrives.  </P> <P> "I've never seen a man that has the determination he has for a cause that he  gets absolutely nothing from monetarily," Schultze said of Croker.  </P> <P> "I've never made a penny from this," Croker said. "I've never asked for money,  but this time I'm gonna ask.  </P> <P> Schultze said it would take about $25,000 to cover the expenses of the walk. He  said that although he has received commitments of about $10,000 in donations,  "I think we'll end up with enough."  </P> <P> In 1987, despite fund-raisers in Hawaiian Gardens and donations from people  along the way, Croker still entered some towns with just $5.  </P> <P> Croker, who is married and has a 4-month-old daughter, works at a service  station in Lakewood for $5 an hour. He talked about his crusade one morning  last week while he was wiping down cars after they had gone through the  station's car wash.  </P> <P> "I don't look at it as incredible, 'cause I've been walking all my life," he  said. "Never had a car, never had a driver's license. People say, 'How do you  do it?' They can't believe good old hard work and dedication will get it done."  </P> <P> He knows what to expect: bleeding feet, numb legs and hands, incredible  exhaustion, and, unlike before, winter.  </P> <P> "This time around I'm scared," he said. "But I'm not going to quit."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DELAYS RESUMING TRIAL OF AILING MARCOS  </P> <P> The federal fraud and racketeering trial of Imelda Marcos, who collapsed in  court last week, will not resume until next week, but her attorney said Monday  that she is feeling much better and is "determined to go on and defend her  family's name."  </P> <P> "That's what she's living for," said Wyoming attorney Gerry Spence.  </P> <P> Spence, the flamboyant lead attorney who recently has been a target of  criticism from other members of the Marcos family, also said he has given no  thought to resigning.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't consider it. Mrs. Marcos wouldn't have it -- that would break her  heart," Spence said.  </P> <P> He would not discuss the family's criticism of his defense efforts, first  reported last week. He would say only that "the family supports their mother .  . . and she is my client. I'm going to defend her."  </P> <P> Earlier Monday, U.S. Dist. Judge John F. Keenan said he will suspend the  two-month-old trial for the week, resuming June 12, because "a little rest  wouldn't hurt" Marcos.  </P> <P> "A few days would do her good and there would be the likelihood of no more  interruptions," Keenan told reporters.  </P> <P> Marcos was rushed to New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center last  Thursday after she coughed up blood and fainted at the defense table as jurors  and the courtroom audience gasped.  </P> <P> Medical tests showed that she was suffering from erosive gastritis, bleeding of  the stomach lining, that doctors said could be related to stress.  </P> <P> The night before, Marcos had spent a sleepless night after considering family  recommendations to replace Spence as her lead counsel with longtime attorney  John Bartko of San Francisco. A day before, Spence had been rebuked publicly by  Judge Keenan for making potentially "misleading statements to the jury." The  lawyer also had been criticized by others in the defense camp for being  unprepared and disorganized in court.  </P> <P> On Monday, however, Spence said that his defense team "has never been closer."  He called the controversy that has swirled around him in recent days a way to  "take the heat off my client and put it on me -- and I'm sure willing to take  it."  </P> <P> Spence called Marcos "a remarkable woman" who has shown courage under great  stress.  </P> <P> "Imagine if you had been going for four years, the way Mrs. Marcos has, being  called a thief, being blamed for the poverty of her own beloved people, having  to face people who are more interested in her shoes than the truth. . . .  Wouldn't that cause you stress?" the lawyer said.  </P> <P> The last round of prosecution witnesses is expected to be called when the trial  resumes next week.  </P> <P> Kristina M. Luz, a Philippine journalist, also contributed to this story.  </P></p>

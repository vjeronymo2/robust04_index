			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Police Effort To Destroy Opposition"] </F>   [Text] "The state police is against democracy in Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and is  using all means possible to stay in power, which is a severe  blow to basic human rights as this involves methods of  manipulation with the public and police intervention in the  spheres of inalienable civil rights." Peter Gosev, leader of  the Democratic Party said at yesterday's press conference.    As arguments for this, Gosev stated frequent and  long-lasting  blocking of the work of parliament, not by the opposition, but  by the ruling party, which refuses to attend sessions or limits  debates on "inconvenient" subjects. He also spoke of increased  influence of political parties over the institutions of  democracy, through unscrupulous party interfering into judicial  matters, covering up for criminal charges against high state  officials, and not starting bankruptcy proceedings in certain  firms.    "The highest police officials are leading a politics of  destroying the opposition." Gosev said. In order to do this,  according to Gosev, they are increasingly using satellite  parties and individuals known to have been informants for former  intelligence services. He also said the interior minister was  turning into a Stalin-type policeman.</p>

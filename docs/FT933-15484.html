			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa expects sharply reduced losses for 1993 MR JURGEN WEBER, chief executive of Lufthansa, yesterday said the German state-controlled airline had broken even in the second quarter of the year and was on course for sharply reduced losses for 1993 as a whole. Looking ahead to the year as a whole, Mr Weber told the annual shareholders' meeting in Hamburg, that he expected losses at the Lufthansa parent company to drop to DM200m (Dollars 125m) this year from DM391m in 1992. In the first half, the parent company loss was likely to be DM250m, compared with DM542m lost in the same period last year. This reflected what Mr Weber described as the crisis in the world airline industry, where 'the whole sector is bankrupt'. He reiterated his complaint against Chapter 11 laws in the US - that allow insolvent companies to carry on trading with protection from creditors - which acted as a form of subsidy to the North American airline industry. He tempered the note of optimism on profits with a call to staff to maintain the group's battle to cut costs, a battle which he said was entering a second phase after saving more than DM1bn against budget last year. Further cost-cutting was the only way for the company to survive in increasingly competitive world markets, he said. The airline would press ahead with plans to cut 2,900 further jobs by the beginning of next year, taking the total reduction in jobs since last June to 8,400. At the end of last year the airline employed 48,251 people. He said the airline would need a further injection of capital next year, given that the airline's ratio of equity capital to total assets fell to 21 per cent last year from 26 per cent in 1991. Lufthansa intends to extend the global reach of its operations via the increased use of co-operation agreements with other companies. It is also likely to increase its 11 per cent stake in Deutsche Reiseburo, a German tour operator.</p>

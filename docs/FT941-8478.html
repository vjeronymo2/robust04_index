			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Standard response Sir, Am I alone in finding the spectacle of the chief executive officer of Motorola waving his latest gadget and complaining that it is 'unfair' that the Japanese are not buying it a trifle unedifying (World Trade News, February 17)? As Lars Ramqvist, the ceo of Ericsson, showed clearly in his Innovation Lecture at the Royal Society on Tuesday, the proper approach to selling to Japan is to make systems compatible with their standards. Motorola, by contrast, applied political pressure to get Japan to adopt the US standard alongside its own system and now whinges when the Japanese prefer to buy their own standard to one forced on them.

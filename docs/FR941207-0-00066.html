			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subtitle A provides for immediate assistance to correctional systems to contend with this growing inmate population crisis. Of primary importance is the recognition that there must be adequate conventional confinement space for violent offenders, both adults and juveniles, to serve a substantial portion of their sentences. This program, therefore, provides grants to assist correctional systems in managing a comprehensive approach which will provide for the confinement of violent offenders; help address the problems associated with overcapacity in correctional facilities through the improvement, development, expansion or modification of present facilities and programs; and support comprehensive programs and treatment that will assist in reducing recidivism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federal, State and Local Partnerships  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because crime is primarily a state and local issue, the Subtitle A grant program envisions a federal, state, and local collaboration to address the problems associated with the incarceration and punishment of violent offenders. State and local government officials were involved in the congressional hearings that guided this legislation, and will continue to be involved as the Department of Justice moves forward in establishing policy guidance, developing regulations, and implementing program guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, this grant program provides flexibility to states and local governments in utilizing federal funds to plan, construct, and operate correctional facilities in ways that best meet their needs and in the most cost-effective manner. Built into the program is the recognition that correctional systems can use grant funds in a variety of ways to ensure the greatest and most timely impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Subtitle A, corrections systems will have the ability to quickly bring on-line additional bed space in facilities which, although construction has been completed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not being utilized due to funding constraints. States and local agencies can also activate prison and jail expansion and juvenile corrections projects that have been planned, but not launched, due to lack of funds. The grant program further provides for the expansion of alternative correctional options for nonviolent offenders which will free secure bed space for dangerous offenders to serve their sentences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, corrections systems will have flexibility in using surplus federal property. Beds for violent offenders can be made available in secure facilities through the conversion of closed military facilities or other appropriate federal facilities to facilities for housing low-security inmates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle A also recognizes the benefits of regional prisons, particularly for adjoining localities. The economies of scale resulting from a multi-state compact prison are particularly beneficial for confining specialized groups of offenders, such as medical/psychiatric inmates, inmates requiring protective custody, and high security inmates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grant program balances appropriate accountability through various eligibility criteria, the availability of technical assistance, and the evaluation of programs implemented with these funds, with the flexibility states and local governments require and deserve based on their individual needs and expertise. Grant eligibility criteria specifically provide for the involvement of counties and local governments and the sharing of funds with these entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the federal role provides sufficient structure and definition in the eligibility criteria to meet the program's goals, while allowing for judgment by grant recipients to take into account the states' various unique situations, criminal and juvenile justice practices, and correctional systems. The program accounts for the different needs of the states and local entities, and reflects that there is no ``national standard'' approach that will suit all jurisdictions. The grant monies are available for the range of correctional needs such as system planning and facility development, as well as the construction, expansion, modification, improvement, and operation of a variety of correctional facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Violent Juvenile Crime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concern also continues nationwide over the escalation in violent juvenile crime. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, juvenile arrests for violent offenses increased dramatically over the five-year period from 1988 to 1992_47 percent_while adult violent crime arrests increased 19 percent. The estimated 129,600 Violent Crime Index arrests of juveniles in 1992 was the highest in our history, with 3,300 arrests for murder, 6,300 for forcible rape, 45,700 for robbery and 74,400 for aggravated assault. Moreover, during the past few years, there has been a marked escalation of homicides by juvenile offenders. Teenage homicides have more than doubled since 1984, and juvenile homicides involving firearms have increased 175 percent since 1983. Of particular importance is that the size of the current 14&hyph;17 year-old population, which has been responsible for much of the recent youth violence, will increase by about 20 percent in the next decade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent and Chronic Juvenile Offenders,'' developed by the Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, is the centerpiece of the Department's response to growing juvenile crime. The Subtitle A grant program is an integral part of the comprehensive strategy's intervention component. The program is based on the recognition that an effective model for the treatment and rehabilitation of delinquent offenders must combine accountability and sanctions with increasingly intensive treatment and rehabilitative efforts at every stage of the continuum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

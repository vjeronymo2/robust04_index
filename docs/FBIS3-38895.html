This was one of the results of the Diakron  poll released yesterday by Gianni Pilo, Berlusconi's polling  "wizard" at the Forza Italia convention. In addition, 75  percent fear for democracy in the country and 70 percent feel  that the leaders of the traditional parties are not capable of  dealing with the situation. Thus, just 17 percent of the  population has any faith in the old party system and 70 percent  want to see new men. Some 80 percent, on the other hand, are  confident and believe that the crisis will soon be over. Pilo  also quoted from a CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research]  poll which gave Silvio Berlusconi 52 percent of the vote and  recorded an increase in support for Forza Italia from 7.4  percent in September 1993 to 25.5 percent today.</p>

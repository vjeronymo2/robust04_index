			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Demchenko, IZVESTIYA correspondent: </F> ``Banks Do Not Want to Finance `Pure' Science''; the first  paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] An attempt to analyze what sums are being invested  in the development of science and development and introduction  of new equipment and technologies has been undertaken by the  Market Conditions Center of the Russian government. A total of  1,500 directors of enterprises with different forms of  ownership, representing 11 industrial branches, answered  questionnaire items related to innovation activity (work  director--Georgiy Ostapkovich).    The inquiry indicated that so-called branch science, the  scientific research institutes and design bureaus specializing  in the filling of orders of enterprises in definite industrial  branches, has almost completely lost orders directly from  enterprises and exists only under conditions of a constant  shrinking of budgeted financing. Virtually all the work on  improvement in the technology of production and the quality of  products has been shifted directly to the enterprises and less  than half the queried enterprises are at all concerned with this.    The principal direction in innovative activity at  enterprises  is the introduction of new types of production (about half the  queried directors). Work on the automation of production, the  introduction of new technologies and forms of organization of  activity were mentioned by three or four times fewer directors.  In the administrative sphere renovation most often involves  computerization (39%).    In the future a quarter of the queried directors intend to  invest sums on innovations. Joint stock companies are exhibiting  great activity in this field and the least activity is being  displayed by leasing enterprises, partnerships with limited  responsibility and production cooperatives. As the principal  sources of financing the directors mention their own resources,  as well as short- and long-term loans.    The directors of 173 commercial banks also participated in  the inquiry. More than half of them declared that they make no  loans at all for innovation projects, despite the fact that the  income received by the banks as a result of such loans is free  of taxation; 48% of the queried banks grant loans for  innovative projects directly to industrial enterprises and the  more actively the greater the statutory reserves of the bank.    The bankers, in answering the questions on the  questionnaire,  declared bluntly that financing for the renovation of production  facilities and production will be made available only after a  system for state insuring of credits for innovations has been  established and a clearly defined mechanism for the application  of a secure loan law has been introduced.    In commenting on the situation in this field, Garegin  Tosunyan, president of the Moscow Bank for the Development of  Science and Technologies (Tekhnobank), stated that hopes for the  financing of science in the absence of patent and juridical  protection of the results of individual work, as well as  management servicing scientific circles, is an illusion from  which it is necessary to escape as soon as possible. In his  words, specialists developing innovations most frequently turn  to the bank themselves asking for sums either for a particular  project or on a handshake: we will buy something, sell it, repay  the loan, and pay ourselves from the profit. Virtually not once,  said the banker, have we dealt with an engineer, scientist or  designer who was capable of looking at the extension of credit  problem from our point of view: how great are the chances that  the sums handed out by the bank today will be returned tomorrow  with a profit compensating for all the losses, including  inflation? To the question of specialists of the Tekhnobank  credit section from whence the various kinds of equipment  necessary for the new production would come, the most common  answer is: ``They promise they will supply us with it.''    It is interesting that there is at least one sphere of  production in which the banks themselves have recently begun to  exhibit innovative activity: the production of pharmaceuticals.  This market at present to a considerable degree is not filled  and the demand is very high and elastic: there are medicines for  which people are ready to give their last ruble. In addition  there are idle plants at which it is possible to master the  production of new drugs and an alternative marketing network. In  this field itself a management system is now being formed  serving the interests of developers and bankers and a system for  search for new drugs for the purpose of financing their  production.    With respect to the remaining branches, according to data  from the Market Conditions Center, the greatest innovative  activity is observed in ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy. The  situation with innovations in the light, food and printing  industries is the very poorest.</p>

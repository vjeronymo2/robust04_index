			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Kamal al-Janzuri, deputy  prime minister and minister of planning, has affirmed that the  state is aware of all the challenges noted in President Husni  Mubarak's speech before the joint session of the People's  Assembly and Consultative Council on Thursday, 11 November, on  the occasion of the beginning of the new parliamentary round.    The Consultative Council, under the chairmanship of  Consultative Council Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi, today met  to discuss the report by the committee formed to respond to the  president's statement. Dr. al-Janzuri spoke to the Consultative  Council in today's session. He said that the government was not  surprised by these challenges and has known where it was heading  ever since it set the 20-year plan and reached the stage of  economic and financial reform control, and embarked on trying to  confront all the challenges mentioned by the president in his  statement.    Dr. al-Janzuri clarified that by introducing production we  will manage to confront the problems of unemployment, slum  areas, and bureaucracy. He noted that without culture and  education, we cannot begin to confront these challenges. He  pointed out that in the 1993/1994 plan, an investment of 1.6  billion Egyptian pounds will be allocated to education, because  we cannot launch any reform projects without good education.  Dr. Kamal al-Janzuri affirmed that security and stability  cannot be realized while slum areas continue to exist in 11  governorates, specifically in 434 locations. He noted that the  initial estimates for improving these areas amount to around 4  billion pounds. He said that some projects for the  infrastructure have been set for southern Egypt, most important  of which is the dual railway line to Aswan. He said that the  infrastructure projects have a social dimension too.    He said that the 1994/95 plan will include a new vision of  production performance to avert the dangers coming from the GATT  agreement. He noted that Egypt imports foodstuffs amounting to  $3 billion a year and that after removing subsidies and without  the duty on food exports, this number will double.    He added that 1.6 million feddans of land cannot be  allocated  for fruits and vegetables at a time when half this land can be  allocated for planting oil seeds or sugar products. He noted  that Egypt imports edible oils amounting to around $0.5 billion  in addition to $700 million for the importation of sugar from  abroad.    Dr. al-Janzuri noted the regional challenges involved in the  Middle-Eastern market, saying that the achievement we aspire to  must pass through an inter-Arab dialogue before initiating an  Arab-Israeli one.    The deputy prime minister noted that inter-Arab trade does  not exceed five percent, while Arab trade with the West is 95  percent. He noted also that Arab investments in Arab territories  do not go beyond five percent, while they reach 85 percent in  non-Arab territories. He pointed out that facing up to these  challenges requires Arab cohesion. The Arab common market  started simultaneously with the EC, but we Arabs did not achieve  what we hoped to achieve, he said.    Dr. al-Janzuri added that the Egyptian people will witness a  breakthrough in production, less reliance on imports, and more  employment of their labor force in the upcoming three years of  [words indistinct]. This will further consolidate security and  stability, he said.</p>

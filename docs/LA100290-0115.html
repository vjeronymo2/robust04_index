			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PASSES AD LIMITS FOR CHILDREN'S TV  </P> <P> Legislation to limit commercials on children's shows to 10 1/2 minutes an hour  on weekends and 12 minutes on weekdays won final congressional approval Monday  as the House voted to restore some of the rules wiped away by deregulation of  the broadcast industry.  </P> <P> The bill, approved by voice vote, would require that broadcasters' efforts to  offer educational and informative children's TV programming be evaluated by the  Federal Communications Commission as a part of the periodic license renewal  process.  </P> <P> It also establishes a National Endowment for Children's Educational Television  programming, with an authorization of $2 million in 1991 and $4 million in  1992.  </P> <P> Identical legislation was passed earlier by the Senate and the bill is being  sent to the White House. President Bush is "strongly opposed" to the limits on  advertising for fear of violating broadcasters' First Amendment rights, an  Administration official said. But "being strongly opposed isn't the same thing  as a veto threat," the official added, noting that a veto is doubtful.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a separate voice vote, the House gave final approval to a bill  requiring built-in closed captioning decoders for the hearing impaired on all  new TV sets with screens of 13 inches or more.  </P> <P> The legislation, if signed by the President, would go into effect July 1, 1993.  It is expected to add between $5 and $15 to the price of a television set. The  bill also calls on the FCC to establish standards for captions to be  incorporated into emerging TV technology, such as high definition televisions.  </P> <P> The Administration has issued no opinion on the bill to require television sets  to include closed-caption equipment, the officials said.  </P> <P> A broad coalition of supporters of limits on advertising during children's  shows, including child advocacy groups, national education associations and  television industry executives -- predicted that the President would sign the  bill. They said that Bush, who has proclaimed himself the "education  President," would find it difficult to veto a bill requiring broadcasters to do  their part in teaching children.  </P> <P> New and creative shows are likely to be developed by programmers because the  legislation would require the FCC to consider, as a part of the broadcast  license renewal process, whether a station's "overall programming" provides  educational and informative shows for children, they said.  </P> <P> "This bill ensures there is not exploitation of children's programming," said  Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a key sponsor of the measure. "Each and every  TV station in the United States will have to demonstrate (that) it is serving  the educational and instructional needs of children."  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Broadcasters, which in the past has opposed legislation  to set curbs on advertising during children's shows, joined its critics this  time to support the bill. "We're pleased with the outcome," a NAB spokesman  said. "It's been a contentious issue, and we're glad to see it resolved."  </P> <P> Since 1984, when the FCC abolished guidelines limiting commercials on  children's shows to 9 1/2 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes on  weekdays, programmers have expanded the commercial time. According to a 1988  survey by the NAB, about one in five of the programs directed to children  averaged more than 12 minutes of commercials per hour.  </P> <P> President Ronald Reagan pocket-vetoed nearly identical legislation in 1988  after it cleared both congressional chambers.  </P> <P> Sue Edelman, executive director at Action for Children's Television, said that  the bill will make it easier for programmers to broadcast more creative shows  and curtail toy manufacturers from dominating the Saturday morning airways when  children are most likely to be watching television.  </P> <P> "It's difficult for people to get a program on television for children that  doesn't have a toy tie-in," she said. "There's not the money for it now.  Programs are produced out of (toy companies') advertising budgets, and not out  of (programmers') creative budgets."  </P></p>

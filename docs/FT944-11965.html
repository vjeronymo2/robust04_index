			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Salomon debt downgraded after losses Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded the debt of Salomon Inc, a week after the group's Salomon Brothers securities broking unit reported its second consecutive quarter of heavy losses. The downgrading of Salomon's senior debt rating, from single A minus to triple B plus, will make it more expensive for Salomon to raise funds in the capital markets, because issuers with lower ratings have to offer higher yields to convince investors to buy their debt. 'The immediate effect is a higher cost of funding for Salomon,' said Mr Michael Flanagan, securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical in New York. The loss of an A rating will also shrink the pool of potential buyers of Salomon's debt, because some institutions do not invest in securities listed below an A rating. S&amp;P also lowered its ratings on Salomon's subordinated debt and preferred stock.</p>

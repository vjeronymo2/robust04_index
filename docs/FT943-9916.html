			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / VW's Lopez adjusts his time for different desk job Putting Volkswagen back on its feet is not most people's idea of a part-time job, but the motor group's second-in-command, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, has found time enough for a spot of freelancing in the furniture trade. For the past six months he has been helping fit a new set of legs to Flototto, a small private company manufacturing office and school furniture. In October, VW's production director will make a personal appearance at a Cologne trade fair where he will share the limelight with the Gutersloh company's latest product: a desk. No ordinary desk, it is being touted as an adjustable workstation, developed, designed and manufactured according to the gospel of lean production and continuous improvement so vigorously promulgated by Mr Lopez since his stormy arrival in Germany from General Motors in March 1993. His involvement followed extensive consultations with Japanese and other experts in modern manufacturing techniques by company owner, Mr Reinhard Flototto. According to his spokesman, Mr Flototto needed someone who would support management in pushing through changes necessary to counter the effects of recession and structural crisis which had knocked up to 40 per cent off earnings in the office furniture sector. Mr Flototto, he said, had no qualms about approaching Germany's unofficial Archbishop of the Church of Continuous Improvement Processes, and signing him up for a 'co-operation agreement'. Since then the controversial Basque has worked in his spare time - on undisclosed terms - as patron of and participant in the Flototto project. Even his daughter, Maite, a trained industrial designer, has joined in briefly. Mr Lopez, who disdains sitting at his work station to do his day job at VW, preferring to stalk the factory floor, has contributed by participating in a series of workshops and discussions. According to Flototto, through-put times on the company's production lines have been slashed from a week to 45 minutes for some products. The application of just-in-time and lean production principles have allowed the furniture company to dispense with its main stockholding warehouse, which is earning Mr Flototto almost DM1m (Pounds 400,000) a year in rent. Mr Lopez's appearance at the October launch will earn the new desk - and Mr Lopez - a wealth of publicity. According to Volkswagen, his extra-curricular involvement was compatible with the group's endorsement of continuous improvement as a cure for many of the ills throughout German industry. The arrangement was private. There was no question of his not having enough to do at VW, a spokesman said. 'He has simply got an enormous amount of energy.'</p>

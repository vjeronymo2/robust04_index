			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Markets rise on signals from Bundesbank THE PROSPECT of a fall in Germany's official interest rates yesterday triggered sharp upward movements in European equity markets, sterling and the dollar. Operators in international financial markets seized on moves by the Bundesbank and a report in a leading German newspaper pointing to lower borrowing costs by the year-end as evidence that the German central bank was relaxing policy in response to a sharp slowdown in the German and international economies. Sterling and the dollar gained strongly in London, with the pound advancing by 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM2.47 and the dollar gaining 3 1/2 pfennigs to DM1.5195. In late New York trading the pound was quoted at DM2.4656 and the dollar at DM1.5184. When Far Eastern markets opened today, the pound was quoted at DM2.4585 and the dollar at DM1.5135. Equities in London also bounded ahead, with the FT-SE 100 index closing just below its day's high at 2,617, up 54.8, on hopes of lower UK interest rates. In Frankfurt, all but one of the 30 shares in the Dax index moved ahead for it to close 32.48 or 2.2 per cent higher at 1,511.55, just below the day's high. Equities in France posted still stronger gains, with the CAC 40 index closing 52.60 or 3.1 per cent higher at 1,731.26. Yesterday's surge of confidence in European markets followed a report in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the Bundesbank had told German bankers it wanted lower interest rates by the end of the year. The impression that the German authorities were encouraging lower rates was then reinforced by news that the Bundesbank was changing its method of supplying funds to the domestic money market. It said it would provide money to the market for the next 14 days by a variable rate repurchase agreement to replace fixed rate agreements expiring today. Markets were further heartened by a statement from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank vice-president, that growth in the M3 measure of money supply was not the be-all and end-all of monetary policy. 'We know there are other factors, such as currency inflows and the changed international competitive situation, which must be considered at the same time,' he said. According to Mr George Magnus, international economist of Warburg Securities in London, yesterday's events were 'an exciting development' and 'confirmation that some changes in Bundesbank policy are afoot'. Mr Gerry Holtham, chief economist of Lehman Brothers in London, was less certain. He said the markets had probably over-interpreted the Bundesbank's actions and warned against expecting too sharp a fall in German rates. The German domestic money market responded to yesterday's signals by aggressively pushing down the cost of borrowing over the months ahead. Mr Holtham said that by late yesterday the market was discounting a fall in German money market rates from 8.9 per cent to around 8.5 per cent in three months and a still steeper fall to around 7.8 per cent in six months' time. The Bundesbank's short-term intentions will be clear today when it fixes the rate at which it lends to the banks. It is also due to release the figures for money supply growth in September. Some bankers in Frankfurt suggested that the central bank initially would allow only a gradual fall in rates. But there was widespread agreement that the ground was being prepared for eventual cuts in the discount and Lombard rates from their respective levels of 8.25 per cent and 9.5 per cent set last month. The recent effective revaluation of the D-Mark has exacerbated Germany's mounting economic difficulties by reducing the competitiveness of its export industries, notably the heavy plant and vehicle manufacturers which traditionally export half their output. Mr Tietmeyer's remarks about M3 may also have been designed to soften the impact on financial markets of a sharp increase in money supply following the massive speculative inflows during last month's currency crisis.

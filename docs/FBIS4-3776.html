			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Healy in London] </F>   [Text] Two senior opposition Labour Members of Parliament  have launched outspoken attacks on Governor Chris Patten, in the  most serious sign yet that the all-party consensus in support of  his policies is starting to crumble. In an extraordinary  anti-Patten outburst in the House of Commons, Labour MP Andrew  Faulds challenged House of Commons leader Tony Newton to arrange  a debate on Hong Kong. Mr Faulds said it was needed to "comment  on the misguided and damaging conduct of the Governor of Hong  Kong, and to examine the latest report on China from the Foreign  Affairs Committee which is full of lunacies and produced by a  committee of ignoramuses". But Mr Newton rejected the request.    Then, during a recent visit to Beijing as part of a British  trade delegation, Manchester MP Ken Eastham told Chinese  officials: "Mr Patten, who was rejected by voters in Bath and  imposed on Hong Kong by the (British) Government, is a fine one  to talk about democracy. "Why was there no talk about democracy  during the past decade when Britain was in charge?" The trip  was organised by Chinese Consul- General in Manchester Xiao  Houde as part of a concerted campaign to undermine support for  Mr Patten among members of the Labour Party.    Both parliamentarians have been privately disowned by their  party leaders but other Labour MPs say they only reflected what  many of their colleagues privately believe.    Meanwhile, Mr Patten is finally cutting his links with the  city of Bath, which he represented for 13 years until losing his  seat in the 1992 general election. He has put his four-bedroom  home up for sale with an estate agent for 135,000 (HK$1.53  million).</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Leading Article: Prospects for Majornomics IT'S DEJA VU all over again, as the late Sam Goldwyn might have put it. This will certainly be a strong feeling among the finance ministers gathering in Washington for the Group of Seven this week. They will look at an IMF economic forecast - growth, but not just yet  - in which only the dates seem to have been changed since last year, and wonder why they should believe it this time. They will hear the familiar American call for economic stimulation, and will no doubt offend Mr Nicholas Brady by giving the usual answers about inflationary pressures. This provides a rather grey setting for Britain's triumphantly grey prime minister, Mr John Major. He would not ask for anything more stimulating, for nobody hates inflation more than he does. His view will be influential, for his prestige among his foreign colleagues is much enhanced. It is now based on achievement rather than promise, and enviable achievement at that: he is the one statesman in the world who has managed to retain popular support while disinflating the economy. His prestige certainly goes a long way, too, to explain the extraordinary surge in sterling last week - a natural response to the end of political uncertainty, but also something more. The historic parallel here is a little more distant: it is a decade since another likeable advocate of the free market first inherited a savage monetary squeeze, and then sought to revive the economy through massive public borrowing. The markets loved Mr Reagan, too. Irresistible promise The irresistible rise of the dollar from 1982 to early 1985 was propelled by the developing country debt crisis. For worried investors, the American promise of high real interest rates for lending to a sound, politically stable economy was irresistible. Foreign investors eagerly bought the bonds issued to finance a national deficit which had been denounced as ruinous and irresponsible. (Did Mr Peter Peterson, the most insistent prophet of doom, brief Mrs Thatcher during her US visit two weeks ago?) Foreign investors went on to drive up an undervalued equity market. What went up did in the end come down - but relatively smoothly, and years later. The parallels are quite striking. What is happening now, as then, is essentially a flight to quality. It was foreign demand for gilts which powered sterling last week, making fools again of those who forecast a funding crisis. The British are a self-deprecating race, so readers may find the idea of a flight into sterling bizarre. But if you compare British consensus and consolidation with German inflation and the threat of strikes, or Mr Major's secure position with that of President Mitterrand - or even President Bush  - it is not so implausible. For the Japanese, still the world's main savers, the appeal is especially strong. This line of thought leads on seductively. British equities look significantly undervalued, compared at least with Wall Street. A full replay of the Reagan experience would be a heady prospect for British investors. It is time, before optimism gets out of hand, to list the differences between Reaganomics and the choices open to Mr Major. Currency gains The most obvious is that while the dollar floats freely against the other leading currencies - and in the end sank pretty freely  - sterling's movements are constrained. Since investors tend to factor in currency gains with market gains, this should ensure that sterling securities are less internationally volatile than dollar securities, and so calm things down. More important, Mr Major does not share Mr Reagan's comforting beliefs that deficits don't matter, and can in any case be reduced by cutting taxes. He will pursue a more conventional path, again with less dramatic results. Finally, Mr Reagan had the luck to share a world boom; Mr Major's prospects are dimmer. All the same, they are favourable in many ways, and enviable in some. The pain of the recession has produced real gains in efficiency, so British competitiveness looks stronger (and German much weaker) than seemed likely when sterling's ERM central rate was first chosen. British employment costs are especially attractive within Europe, thanks to comparatively low social charges and favourable demographics. Substantial inward investment is likely to persist, providing jobs and future export growth, even if European growth is undynamic. This inward flow will help, too, to finance the British current account deficit - indeed, as the US government used to argue, a current deficit is the accounting counterpart of a foreign inflow. This is still the most awkward corner Mr Major faces; for although the current account should in theory be a mere memorandum item in a world of free capital movements, a big deficit can still frighten the markets. Revived demand at home, and the arrival of foreign capital equipment threaten such frights. But Mr Major has one unique bit of luck: due to a bureaucratic shake-up, the British trade figures will vanish altogether for half of 1993. Long live invisible trade.</p>

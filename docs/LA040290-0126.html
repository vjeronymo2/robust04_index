			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW YORK OVERNIGHT;  </P> <P> SYLVIA SIDNEY, THOUGH AILING, BUBBLY ADHERENT  </P> <P> SYLVIA SIDNEY AILING: Screen star of yesteryear Sylvia Sidney, 79, is in  intensive care in serious condition in a Connecticut hospital, according to  doctors. Her nephew, Dr. Albert Sabin, who found a vaccine for polio, has been  at her bedside.  </P> <P> Sidney, star of countless films and co-star to such stars as James Cagney and  Humphrey Bogart, has been in the hospital since last Sunday suffering from  pneumonia. She had been on a cruise to the Caribbean and returned to her New  York apartment before she became ill and was taken to the hospital, where she  fell into a coma. She awoke on Thursday to face Dr. Sabin.  </P> <P> "Oh, my God," said Sidney. "I haven't seen you in years. Let's have some  champagne." Dr. Sabin had champagne brought in and allowed some of it to touch  Sidney's lips. Then she fell asleep.  </P> <P> O'DWYER BACK IN POLITICS: Paul O'Dwyer, who'll be 83 in June, will be the  oldest commissioner on the New York City payroll next week when he is sworn in  as commissioner for the United Nations.  </P> <P> "I hope that I'll encourage people not to retire but to stay active," O'Dwyer  said.  </P> <P> O'Dwyer, younger brother of the late Mayor William O'Dwyer, served as City  Council president 16 years ago. During his legal career, he often went to bat  for unpopular causes and minority groups.  </P> <P> "This is an exciting time for me because I helped most of the nations now  emerging independently on their own," O'Dwyer said. "Now I'll be greeting their  leaders as they come to New York."  </P> <P> The commissioner's post is still held by Gilliam Sorenson, wife of former John  F. Kennedy speech writer Ted Sorenson. Gilliam will most likely go to work for  a U.N. agency.  </P> <P> ANNIE 2: "Annie 2" is coming back, rewritten and tightened up. The sequel to  the Broadway smash "Annie" is going through the same process as the original,  starting at a small theater and going through revisions.  </P> <P> "Annie 2," you'll recall, was put on the stage by Martin Charnin and Charles  Strouse in Washington, bound for Broadway. It opened in Washington in January  and bombed immediately.  </P> <P> Well, the author of "Annie," who penned "Annie 2," Tom Meehan, said it's back  and starts casting again April 23. Only this time it'll be done without Dorothy  Loudon, who gambled on it in Washington, and they've even ordered a new Sandy,  the pooch. The dog used to play Sandy in the sequel got his walking papers. But  Harve Presnell (Daddy Warbucks) and Maryann Seldes (Mrs. Christmas) agreed to  stay with the show, which will open at the Norman Terris Theatre in Chester,  Conn., in May for eight weeks.  </P> <P> HERE AND THERE: There's no telling about taste. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was asked  about broccoli in view of the presidential edict that there won't be any  broccoli served on Air Force One. He said, "I'm for broccoli, cauliflower and  escarole. Very big on escarole." . . . The TV film "Law and Order" was being  filmed on the steps of New York's Supreme Court the other morning and Michael  Moriarty was playing the role of the Manhattan district attorney being mobbed  by reporters. The scene caused quite a stir and caught the attention of  Assistant Dist. Atty. John F. Kennedy Jr., who stopped to watch the scene  played out. Then, it was back to work.  </P></p>

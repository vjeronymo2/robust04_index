			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases after two straight highs AFTER another new high on Thursday, index-linked selling by investment trusts and profit-taking by individuals left the Nikkei index moderately lower yesterday, after a brief rise over the 20,000 level on technical trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei, up 134.04 on Thursday to 19,967.27, shed 75.09 to 19,892.18, 2.3 per cent higher on the week, after a day's high of 20,126.09 and a low of 19,728.34 after Thursday's 20,041.16 and 19,721.01 respectively. Volume rose from 664m shares to 750m on options-related trading. Advances led declines by 568 to 490 with 125 unchanged. On Thursday, gainers outnumbered losers by 600 to 473 with 125 unchanged. The Topix index, which rose 9.48 to 1,568.70 on Thursday, fell 5.42 to 1,563.28. While activity by foreigners was subdued due to the Easter holidays, life insurers and public pension funds were seen purchasing stocks. Mr Chris Newton said: 'Sentiment among investors has improved enormously, but the market may face weakness after the government unveils its fiscal package next week.' Small stocks improved yesterday. The second section rose 1.8 per cent, while the over-the-counter market registered a 6 per cent gain. Profit-taking eroded securities companies. Nomura Securities lost Y40 to Y2,170 and Daiwa Securities fell Y10 to Y1,290. Banks were also lower with Industrial Bank of Japan retreating Y40 to Y2,650 and Fuji Bank losing Y10 to Y2,060. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y20,000 to Y1,03m. High-technology issues were also lower on profit taking. However, Fujitsu, the most active issue of the day, rose Y19 to Y706 on speculation that the company will benefit from instalments of personal computers at public schools. In Osaka, the OSE average, which Thursday improved 30.02 to 21,577.43, fell 1.03 to 21,576.40. Volume remained almost unchanged at 30m shares against 30.6m. Roundup TAIWAN, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were open yesterday after a mixed day for the region on Thursday. TAIWAN closed lower as turnover shrank, the weighted index ending 78.02, or 1.6 per cent down at 4,847.13, 2.1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover down from TDollars 56.6bn to TDollars 49.4bn. After a 12-month peak on Wednesday, Thursday's 1.8 per cent fall had hurt sentiment. In addition, there was concern that money market liquidity was tightening, and that the supply of margin loans could shrink. SEOUL firmed again after a setback on Thursday, the composite stock index closing 7.86 higher at 702.93 to end the week with a 3.2 per cent gain on the prospect of economic recovery. Turnover soared from Won589.9bn to Won921.1bn. KUALA LUMPUR ended mixed with the KLSE composite index down 1.99 at 655.24,, 0.6 per cent higher in the week, on renewed speculative buying of second and third-line stocks. Idris Hydraulic again led activity with 92.4 million shares traded. It closed up 13 cents at MDollars 2.85. BANGKOK saved its spurt until the last moment, as institutional buying of major bank shares in the closing minutes of trade pushed the SET index up 4.22 to 862.71, up 0.6 per cent on the week. On Thursday, AUSTRALIAN stocks rebounded at the close, with investors encouraged by lower-than-expected jobless figures. The All Ordinaries index added 10.8 to 1,665.7, 1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of ADollars 221.1m. Fairfax was the star performer, rising 4 cents to a ADollars 2.02 high after Publishing and Broadcasting, a private subsidiary of Mr Kerry Packer, said that it owned 10.45 per cent of the voting shares. BOMBAY, where the BSE index rose 97.24 on Wednesday in anticipation of an interest rate cut, lost it all when the cut did not take place. The index fell 97.77 to 2,310.91, virtually flat on the week.</p>

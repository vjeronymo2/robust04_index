			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Muhammad al-Ghazali: "This Is Our Religion"] </F>   [Text] We are fighting on two fronts: That of the  ungrateful toward Islam and that of the unlearned in Islam.  Each one is worse than the other. We want to present genuine  Islam, adding nothing and omitting nothing. Adding means more  human heresy and superstition and omitting means deleting some  elements of the revelation that might inhibit its desired impact  and give heretic tendencies the upper hand over correct  guidance. At any rate, we will not move an inch from that  stance. Unsound piety can only be rectified by authentic piety,  and exceeding the bounds and wastefulness can only be cured by  moderation.    The ungrateful can sometimes pursue detestable courses; they  might assail guides with their sharp tongues. Abu-Nuwas  [Abbasid poet] was a drunk. When a cleric advised him to  abandon this habit, he said: Tell him who claims to be  knowledgeable that he learned something and missed a lot.  Ignorant as he was, Abu-Nuwas did not say that God permitted  drinking or that the Koran has not prohibited drinking, as a  contemporary man of law has claimed. This saying is very true of  that man of law: I was one of Satan's soldiers. When I climbed  up in status, Satan became one of my soldiers.    More surprising is that such people are being called to cure  terrorism and deviousness. I saw on television images of  individual and couple dancing; these images are damned by chaste  and straight people. But the actors and actresses taking part  in these animal-like festivals have been recruited in a campaign  against the veil and descent clothing using the theory that  women who display their charms are ethical while others who wear  long dresses are evil.    Can terrorism be fought by actors and actresses? Since when  does the leadership of social reform grow in such surroundings?  Where are the thinkers, mentors, and men of knowledge? The  fire of temptation cannot be extinguished this way; it glows  further just like fire does when fed with oil.    The masses were enraged when these artists talked about  religion, although they were ignorant about its teachings. This  is not surprising, since man cannot give what he does not have.  It is ridiculous that his excellency "Sayyid, the Boy Servant"  [reference to comedian 'Adil Imam, whose film "The Terrorist" is  showing in Cairo] should be called to fight terrorism and assist  the police in their difficult task.    If the culture of some religious people is faulty, it is  established scholars, and not farcical artists, who can correct  it. If Charlie Chaplin of England managed with his wit and  movements to make people laugh, could this actor preclude the  role of literature, philosophy, religion, and major institutions  in guarding rights and welfare and enhancing the nation's  message?</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Gardner Merchant These are not easy times for leveraged buy-outs, but the omens are better than most for Gardner Merchant, whose sale to a consortium led by CinVen was authorised at an extraordinary meeting of Forte yesterday. Not only is contract catering a highly cash-generative business but Gardner Merchant starts out with a gearing of around 100 per cent, which is low for this type of exercise. Since it has been able to hedge its interest exposure to give single-digit rates for years ahead, debt service should be no problem. Less certain is the rate of growth. Gardner's management has delivered steady if unspectacular growth of 10 to 15 per cent for Forte over the years. It believes it can continue to do so in a market where public sector contracts, especially in the health service, are ripe for the plucking. Perhaps the combination of independence and incentives attached to the buyout will spur management to push up margins which are half those at Compass, its main rival. The art will be to avoid losing the reputation for service on which organic growth depends. If Gardner Merchant succeeds, Forte, which has retained a 25 per cent stake, may yet wonder why it disposed of a business that generated so much useful cash to fund its hotels.</p>

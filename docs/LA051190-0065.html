			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ALZADO, WHO MISSES THE VIOLENCE, TO TRY COMEBACK  </P> <P> Nineteen years after he first went to a pro football training camp, eight years  after his Raider debut and four years after retiring, Lyle Alzado is back.  </P> <P> Alzado, 41, announced Thursday that he will attempt a comeback with the  Raiders, hoping to recapture both his own glory and that of his team.  </P> <P> "It's a violent game," Alzado said. "I miss the violence. It's just that  simple."  </P> <P> Despite a yearlong training program, the 270-pound Alzado figures to face a  grueling battle to make it through training camp against players 20 years  younger.  </P> <P> "I know to make it, I have to dominate on the field," he said. "I intend to do  that.  </P> <P> "If they call me in at camp and tell me it's not working out, I could handle  it. My ego is not that bad. If they say goodby, I'll say goodby. But I think  I'll do it." STEVE SPRINGER  </P></p>

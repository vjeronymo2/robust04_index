Anders Bjoerck and Francois Leotard told a press conference  that they were agreed on the need for "rather determined  methods" to reopen the airport, which has been closed to air  traffic since the beginning of the Bosnian conflict and which is  needed for the supply of humanitarian relief.    On Tuesday the UN secretary general said he would approve  the  use of air power in Bosnia-Herzegovina if United Nations  personnel on the ground called for it.    The two defence ministers said they had agreed on other  "concrete proposals" that they could not for the moment reveal.    "We must not make threats without being able to implement  them," Leotard said.    He said the ministers had discussed "the hundreds of Serb  guns hidden around Sarajevo and in several villages" and the  danger for UN troops and Bosnian civilians in the event that  military action was taken.    Bosnia's separatist Serbs, who have surrounded Sarajevo and  held it under siege, with daily bombardments, for the past 21  months, have dismissed the likelihood of international military  action, pointing to previous threats to use force that have not  been followed up.</p>

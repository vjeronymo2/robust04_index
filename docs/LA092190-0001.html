			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET DEBATE  </P> <P> Under the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, the failure by the  federal government to enact a revenue and spending package that meets the  established federal budget deficit level by the beginning of October will  result in automatic spending cuts. These automatic cuts will be so severe and  so indiscriminate that it will be necessary to send federal personnel home  without pay for an indeterminate number of days.  </P> <P> Speaking on behalf of the 5,000 members of the FBI Agents Assn., I want to make  clear what the human cost would be. I also want to point out how unfair it is  to identify the costs of running an agency such as the FBI, as a part of  federal expenditure problems.  </P> <P> Tremendous cynicism and irreparable damage to morale will be the result of the  inescapable message that would come from the temporary dismissals -- that the  work we do is is ultimately non-essential. The men and women of the FBI are  very proud of our record for successful investigation of organized crime, drug  trafficking and money laundering, political corruption, white-collar crime,  including bank fraud and government contracting fraud, terrorism and foreign  espionage. We are also very proud of the work our records and laboratory  divisions do on behalf of state and local law enforcement efforts.  </P> <P> Aside from the interruption of ongoing investigations, the American taxpayer  should understand the FBI is anything but a bloated government agency. The last  10 years have seen a steady erosion in pay and benefits for the FBI. The  Administration's own official figures on federal pay show that the average pay  for an agent is 33.94% below that of those with comparable levels of training,  education and responsibility who work outside government.  </P> <P> If you agree with us that the war on crime, the war against drugs, the  uninterrupted investigation of the savings and loan scandal, and the protection  of our country's security from terrorism should go on unabated, then tell your  elected officials so. Give this message to your representatives and the  President (the White House Comment Line is 202-456-7639).  </P> <P> LARRY W. LANGBERG  </P> <P> National President, FBI Agents Assn.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

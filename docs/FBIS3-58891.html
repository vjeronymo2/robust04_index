"I have decided, as a free man, to resign my ministerial  duties.    "I believed, wrongly, that a man who is innocent has nothing  to fear.    "I believed, wrongly, that I could continue working in peace  while defending myself.    "I am having to face harassment, which is growing by the  day;  political harassment, as this affair has now become political;  and media harassment fueled by rumors, lies and slander.    "I am sickened. Now that this climate has been created, I  find that I can no longer continue to discharge my ministerial  duties in peace.    "I am quite clear in my mind. I do not want the government  to suffer. I do not want my party to suffer and, more  generally, I do not want the population to suffer because I am  unable to work under normal conditions in the service of the  people. Freed of these duties, I will be able to devote all my  energies to defending myself and revealing the truth. My  innocence will be proved.    "Before the special committee, I will attest that there has  been no wrongdoing, no unjust acts, that I have nothing to  reproach myself for. My conscience is clear.    "I thank all those who have supported me and who have  treated  me correctly. I thank the prime minister, Mr. Philippe Busquin,  my party president.    "I also thank with all my heart all those who trust in me; I  will continue to fight with them for the ideals we share.    "I will be back."</p>

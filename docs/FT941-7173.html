			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: French prepare to meet challenge of post-Gatt farming - David Buchan on the structural inefficiencies that must be addressed to improve competitiveness French agriculture must become 'the most competitive in Europe', says Mr Jean Puech, France's farm minister. Such an ambition may seem redundant for a country that is already the world's second largest exporter of farm products. But it is partly designed to lift French farmers out of any post-Gatt depression and offer them a new horizon. In fact, French farmers are already showing a positive response to the new world in European agriculture. 'Our farmers seem to have been greatly relieved to find that within the last few weeks of 1993 their income support cheques starting arriving from Brussels, showing that the reform of the common agricultural policy actually works, and that the eventual Gatt agreement was not nearly as bad as they originally feared,' says a senior agriculture ministry official in Paris. French banks report that in the first few weeks of this year farmers were starting to invest in fertiliser, tractors and new buildings, reversing their cutbacks of 1992-93. Mr Puech's statement is, however, also a recognition that while France may lead Europe in sectors like cereals and sugar, and has made great strides in pork and poultry, its competitiveness is variable in milk production and often downright bad in beef and sheepmeat. 'Up to now France has been more interested in markets and prices, rather than costs and charges,' explains a senior aide to Mr Puech. 'With the common agricultural policy and Gatt decisions on markets and prices, we are for the first time taking a serious look at how to reduce our costs and charges.' Among the structural inefficiencies in French farming pinpointed by both the ministry and the main farming union, the FNSEA, are: A fiscal system that taxes farm sales as well as farm incomes, and a land tax that bears disproportionately on farmers raising relatively small numbers of cattle or sheep on relatively large tracts of poor land. There is also a persistent social security problem. Most of the government's special FFr3bn (Pounds 345m) aid last year was to help older farmers, or their widows, to catch up on their social security insurance arrears. 'We still need several billion more francs here,' says the FNSEA. Over-lavish services and infrastructure offered by co-operatives that are no longer appropriate for their members in the new, leaner era. Grain co-operatives tended to dot the landscape with mini-silos, while the evidence is that many farmers would now prefer to make the longer haul with their harvest to a central silo if that would give them a better price or more efficient and rapid marketing. Likewise in livestock, farmers have relied on co-operatives to take their animals to market for them, while now many would prefer to save on this and take their animals directly to auction. The absence of a corporate structure to most farms. This is most sharply felt when it comes to inheritance - French law requires that all estates be equally divided among children. The upshot is that a new farmer has to buy out the stakes of his siblings, amounting to a heavy tax at the start of his career. A corporate system would allow the non-farming members of a family to retain their shares, which could in turn be used as collateral to buy a house or whatever elsewhere. Legal and tax problems for farmers in working part-time outside agriculture. The French 'fisc' does not tax favourably income from such outside activities, while the state accident insurance system gives farmers no cover outside their main business. In addition, there is more scope for local authorities in mountain and tourist areas to employ farmers to clear ski and hiking trails. Any remedies, financial or legal, for these structural inefficiencies are clearly within France's national prerogative in the framework of the CAP. Any fears that France might be about to exploit the current trend towards subsidiarity in the European Union, 'renationalise' parts of the CAP and give French farmers an unfair advantage over their EU partners, are unfounded, French officials insist. But the dividing line between fair and unfair aid, in the EU context, is not always clear. A case in point is the more than FFr300m aid that Paris gave its pig farmers, chiefly in Brittany, to help them cope with a crash in prices and a 47 per cent drop in their incomes last year. This aid was to restructure the pig producers' past debt. But, partly in response to British pig farmers' complaints, Mr Rene Steichen, the EU farm commissioner has expressed concern that it might encourage further future investment by the Breton pig producers. In fact, Paris may have other reasons to rein in this sector's rapid expansion. Brittany, with its proximity to ports and cheap imported grain, now produces more than half France's pork. Not only is there in areas such as that around Lamballe, known now as 'Pig Valley', a serious risk of environmental and disease contamination, but the success of the Breton pig producers in supplying the charcuterie industry in the Midi and the Pyrenees regions brought pig farmers from those regions up to Brittany last month to protest at the 'dumping' methods of their Breton counterparts.</p>

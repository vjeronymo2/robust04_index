			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Management: Singing in the mud, just singing in the mud - Emiko Terazono says Japanese construction companies are writing songs to brighten their image 'We will sail over the waves to the land of dreams in a white yacht,' croons a male pop vocalist. A top 10 hit? Not quite: the lyrics are from a company song for Taisei, the Japanese construction company. Taisei spent Y30m (Pounds 128,000) making Take Me To A Lively World, a six-minute ballad. The song was part of a 'visual identity programme' designed to soften the construction industry's 'three k's' image: kiken (dangerous), kitanai (dirty), and kitsui (difficult). Japan's labour shortage has highlighted the construction industry's labour shortage. As more Japanese youth are shunning three k industries, construction companies are forced to change their corporate image in order to attract young recruits. Taisei's song project was organised by a group of young employees, and the lyrics were also written by an employee. Taisei distributed 13,000 CDs to its workers, and the song is played in the mornings and afternoons inside the offices. It is sung by a professional Japanese pop group, and is included in the group's recent album. Mr Yasuhiri Hashimoto, for the company, said that the song would help more young people get to know the company name, and associate Taisei with a softer, trendier image. Taisei also changed its company sign to a modern art design to appeal to the younger age group. 'We also have to be aware of the impressions we give through the construction sites,' he adds. Taisei is trying to clean up the image of construction sites by beautifying the temporary walls surrounding them. The company also avoids using old or rusty machines, and workers are told to wash the dirt off the tyres of trucks going out on the roads. The job shortage is serious and getting worse. At the end of last year there were nearly five construction-related jobs per applicant, compared with the national average of just over one per applicant. Construction companies have been forced to increase wages to attract workers. Real average monthly wages in the industry rose 8.5 per cent from a year ago, six times as fast as the Japanese average. Other construction companies such as Obayashi and Kounoikegumi have also made company songs to be used for television commercials. Haseko, a condominium constructor, changed its corporate mark, which now uses a green triangle symbolising the environment, a red circle for humans, and a blue rectangle which stands for buildings. Changing names has also become popular. Kajima, formerly called Kajima Construction, dropped the 'Construction' from its name because its business also consists of architecture and design, development projects, and new businesses. One construction worker at Maeda Construction said that the three k image of the industry has hurt morale on the work sites. 'I don't think that trying to make things look good on the outside will solve everything and making songs does sound a little ridiculous, but the companies have started something,' he says. Meanwhile, smaller three k companies, lacking ideas and funds for renewing their corporate image, are having a harder time. Many small companies have fallen into financial trouble because of the shortage of labour, and some sub-contractors are finding that a backlog of orders is mounting up. Recruit, the publishing and job information company, says that its new job magazine is an answer to some of these needs. The new title, GAT'N, is a bi-weekly job information magazine dealing solely with blue-collar jobs. Recruit says it started GAT'N because many people thought blue collar jobs were only 'three k' and did not know what some of the companies really did. 'For example, we want more people to understand what a welder does, what skills a welder needs, and how much the job pays,' says a spokeswoman for Recruit. GAT'N currently has a circulation of about 140,000 issues a month around the Tokyo area. Recruit says it has received favourable responses from younger people, such as people with special skills, and high school and junior high school drop outs who felt that they had minimal job prospects.</p>

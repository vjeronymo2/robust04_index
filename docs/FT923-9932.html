			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas earnings dive MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially stretched US aerospace group, yesterday reported a 51 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, higher-than-expected costs on an important airliner production programme and a reversal of its recent success in lowering its debt-to-equity ratio. The news sent its share price sharply lower and the stock closed at at Dollars 36 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange for a loss of Dollars 3 3/8 on the day. Mr John McDonnell, the chairman, warned workers that in the coming months the group would be taking 'further steps to improve our competitiveness'. The group reported earnings of Dollars 38m, or Dollars 1 a share, compared with Dollars 77m, or Dollars 2.01 in the same quarter of last year, on revenues which dipped slightly to Dollars 4.89bn. All its three manufacturing segments suffered lower earnings, but the company said the main cause of the drop was higher research and development spending, principally for its proposed MD-12 jumbo jet. McDonnell Douglas cannot afford to develop this aircraft alone and has been seeking foreign financial partners, principally Taiwan Aerospace, but so far without success. The company also reported that costs on the MD-11, a wide-bodied aircraft which it began delivering just under two years ago, had not declined as rapidly as planned. The company had therefore raised its cost estimate for the total programme and reduced the rate at which it was reporting earnings. McDonnell Douglas' debt-to-equity ratio in its aerospace operations, which the company cut to .68 at the end of last year, went up to .78 at the end of June, as debt rose from Dollars 2.39bn to Dollars 2.84bn. It said this was due primarily to lower bookings for commercial aircraft, higher funding requirements for the controversial C-17 military transport it is developing for the Pentagon, and deferred vendor payments. Its commercial aircraft business had operating earnings of Dollars 20m on revenues of Dollars 2.15bn, compared with Dollars 53m on revenues of Dollars 1.8bn a year ago. R&amp;D spending rose Dollars 29m. The MD-11 programme incurred a small operating loss, while McDonnell's other civil aviation programme, the MD80/90, achieved higher operating earnings thanks to improved margins. Its military aircraft side earned Dollars 66m, down from Dollars 106m. Most of the drop was attributed to a Dollars 34m pre-tax charge for increased costs and higher reserves on the C-17 programme, which is well over its fixed price contract level. Revenues dropped 19 per cent to Dollars 1.74bn, mainly because of completion of the C-17's development phase. The group's firm backlog of orders stood at Dollars 26.4bn at the end of June, down from Dollars 30.4bn at the end of December and Dollars 33.1bn a year ago. For the six months it earned Dollars 90m, or Dollars 2.34 a share, down from Dollars 135m, or Dollars 3.51 a share, on revenues of Dollars 9.04bn, down from Dollars 9.2bn.</p>

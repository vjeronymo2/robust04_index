			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Big profit inspires Glaxo rise Profits from Glaxo, the leading pharmaceuticals group, were above the top of the range of analysts' forecasts and sent the bears scurrying for cover. Accompanied by a higher than expected dividend, the figures prompted a sharp bounce in the share price. The shares, which have lagged behind the All-Share index along with the rest of the badly mauled pharmaceuticals sector, bounced 22 to 697p. Turnover of 20m shares was the heaviest since full-year results in September. It was the larger than expected final dividend then that impressed investors and marked the shift in perception of Glaxo from a growth stock to a yield stock. Yesterday the company announced a Pounds 1.001bn interim profit and a 9p dividend. Analysts also commented on a very positive meeting with the company at which the management demonstrated that it was dealing effectively with the slowing down of Zantac sales growth. There was no disagreement over the quality of the figures, and most analysts upgraded their full-year estimates by around Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.95bn. However, disparity over the progress of Zantac saw a divergence in the 1995 figures. Bullish Smith New Court predicts Pounds 2.15bn but Nomura reflected the cautious stance with a forecast of Pounds 2.025bn. Glaxo raced ahead 37 at best but slipped back when New York opened. US investors have been long-term bears of the stock.</p>

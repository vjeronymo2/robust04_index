			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lunchtime olive branch Sir, Certain points in your article ('Fly in Jo'burg soup', February 9) need clarification. I was prepared to cancel the lunch if the ANC refused to attend because of Nigel Bruce's presence. The ANC knew this, as did Bruce. Bruce communicated only once with Pallo Jordan on the matter. He expressed his regret and also withdrew from the lunch. The olive branch was not extended to secure a place at a lunch, it was extended to heal a relationship.

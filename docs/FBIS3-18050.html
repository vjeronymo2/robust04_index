Until then there will be an actual "job gap" for "almost 7  million persons," Karl Proebsting, president of the Land  Employment Office, stated in an interview published by the  Cologne HANDELSMAGAZIN of the Federal Work Group of Medium-Sized  and Large Retail Trade Companies (BAG).    Even under the most favorable economic growth conditions, no  lasting improvement on the labor market is to be expected for  the second half of the 1990's. "A consolidation of unemployment  at an increasingly higher level threatens," he warned. "In  1995, at the latest, 4 million persons may be unemployed in  Germany, about 3 million of them in the old laender." In  addition to this registered unemployment, there is "an enormous  amount of covert unemployment." On the one hand, it is hidden by  the use of labor market policy instruments, such as job creation  measures, qualification, and working short hours; on the other  hand, more and more people are retreating from the labor market  because they are discouraged and without prospects.</p>

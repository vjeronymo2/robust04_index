			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.V. Dyubarskiy, candidate of physical and </F> mathematical sciences, scientific director, Department of  Optical Mirrors and Nonconventional Materials, and Yu.P.  Khimich, candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, chief  of laboratory for nonconventional optical materials, All-Russian  Science Center at State Institute of Optics imeni S.I. Vavilov;  UDC 681.7.062:681.7.03]    [Abstract] Research done on optical mirrors made of  nonconventional materials for telescopes and lasers is reviewed,  the aim having been highest possible precision for optimizing  the image quality and minimizing the beam divergence by limiting  the diffraction. The scientific-technical research program  included:    1. construction of physical and mathematical models for  comprehensive design analysis;    2. development and evaluation of promising new materials;    3. theoretical and experimental study of internal sources of  dimensional instability;    4. methods of forming diverse optical surfaces, including  eccentric aspherical and higher-order aspherical ones, methods  producing ultrasmooth surfaces, and methods of joining mirrors  to support structures;    5. development and deposition of reflective and protective  coatings;    6. means and methods of continuous inspection throughout the  manufacturing and testing cycle.    The only way to maximize the thermal stability of mirrors  made of conventional materials is to minimize their coefficient  _a_ of linear thermal expansion. The three conventional new  mirror materials ULE doped-fused quartz (developed in the  U.S.A.), Cerodur (developed in Germany), and Sitall  glass-ceramic (developed in Russia) are inadequate in this  respect, because they remain stable only within narrow  temperature ranges. Considering, however, that the thermal  strain under quasi-steady (slowly varying) conditions is  determined also by the thermal conductivity _l_ of the material  (namely the _a_/_l_ ratio), metallic materials (beryllium,  aluminum alloys, copper alloys) and nonmetallic ones (Si, SiC)  have been added to the list, especially since their critical  mechanical properties are either superior (modulus of elasticity  E) or comparable (E/k ratio, k- stiffness coefficient). Also  composite materials are considered, mirrors made of the SiC-Si  composite material combining light weight with high stiffness. A  new technology has been developed for manufacturing mirrors with  a structural-grade glass coating on a metal substrate, the  expansion coefficients of the two materials necessarily  matching. The technology ensures that the glass coating is  sufficiently hard and chemically stable, that its softening  temperature is sufficiently high and no crystallization occurs,  and that the adhesion of glass to metal is sufficiently strong.  The technology includes deposition of 3-5 mm thick glass plates  on the metal surface, followed by a heating-soaking-cooling  process according to a specific temperature-time cycle. Such  mirrors up to 1200 mm in diameter have already been built and  withstood temperatures down to -60C without fracture of the  coating. Special polishing and diamond grinding processes have  been developed which reduces the roughness of metal surfaces to  within 2-3 nm and 4-5 nm respectively, as measured with a  contact profilometer or on the basis of integral light  scattering. Also other reflective and protective coatings have  also been developed: a multilayer dielectric on metal mirrors  for 0.308 m or 1.064 m radiation, and metal-dielectric  ones on mirrors for 5.1 m or 10.6 m radiation. Another  aim  is reducing the weight of large mirrors, the first generation of  light-weight mirrors with glass on beryllium up to 1200 mm in  diameter having been built in 1985. These mirrors have an  asphericity not exceeding 180 m and a mean-square form  deviation in 0.63 m light not exceeding 0.02 (plane and  sphere) and 0.1 (higher- order asphericity). Their relative  aperture is 1:5 and their reflection coefficient is 0.92 for  visible light, 0.96 for near-infrared light, 0.93 for  far-infrared light. For cryogenic telescopes used in astronomy  are considered highly isotropic and technological low-cost  mirrors made of aluminum alloys with protective coatings which  can be cleaned by conventional methods. For optical cavities of  technological lasers are being developed mirrors up to 1000 mm  in diameter with reflective and protective coatings on  ultrasmooth surfaces, suitable for both continuous-wave and  pulse-repetition modes of operation at power levels up to 200  kW, multilayer compound mirrors with cooling as well as  monolithic mirrors without cooling.

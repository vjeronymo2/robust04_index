Thus two boys, the bus driver,  and the helicopter's two pilots are still on board. The  terrorists have declared they intend to leave Mineralnyye Vody  when darkness sets in. [passage omitted]    The terrorists promise to release the two boys remaining on  board, having set as a condition that Valentina Petrenko,  personal envoy of the Russian foreign minister, should be taken  on board. [passage omitted]    It is not excluded that after flying to Baku the terrorists  will try to land in the mountains where it is possible that  accomplices await them.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Polish bank's shares surge as trading starts SHARES in the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK), the first of Poland's nine main state banks to be privatised, rose steeply yesterday when the bank's shares began trading on the Warsaw stock exchange, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. A public offer of the bank's shares in April saw 1.7m shares, or 27.2 per cent, sold at a price of 115,000 zlotys each (Dollars 6.5). According to traders, some 175,529 WBK shares yesterday changed hands at 350,000 zlotys, reflecting the general rise in share prices on the Warsaw stock market in the past two months. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development owns 28.5 per cent of the WBK for which it paid 210bn zlotys when the bank was privatised. Bank Slaski, the next Hungarian state owned bank to be privatised, is to be offered to investors this autumn.</p>

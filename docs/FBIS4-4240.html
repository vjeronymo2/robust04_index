			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Committee Clamps Down on Drug Sector"] </F>   [Text] The State is clamping down on its medicine  standards with quality control inspections so that Chinese  pharmaceuticals can enter the world market.    Pharmaceutical firms and their products must pass  evaluations  by a national committee called State Pharmaceutical  Authentication Committee (SPAC).    The policy urges medicine enterprises to update their  techniques and facilities to keep up with the world development  trend. This will improve the quality of medicines and protect  public health, said Zhang Wenkang, vice-minister of Public  Health and also director of SPAC.    The administration has received many reports of fake and  substandard medicines in recent years, as well as deaths caused  by bogus products, said Liu Yonggang, former deputy director of  State Pharmaceutical Administration and a member of SPAC.    Some pharmaceutical factories have not reached State  requirements on production management. That severely hinders  product quality improvement.    SPAC will inspect pharmaceutical enterprises in line with  international principles of "Good Manufactory Practice for Drugs  (GMP)."    GMP is common practice in many advanced countries. It  stipulates production facilities, techniques and sanitation and  also product quality inspections.    And all the medicines must be certificated by the committee  in accord with the State Pharmaceutical Law.</p>

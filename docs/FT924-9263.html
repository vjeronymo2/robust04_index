			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Forever Yours Marie Lou You recognise the scene at once, yes? All-too-closely-knit Welsh family, locked into poverty. Papa Leopold fearsomely concerned with having the right kind of peanut butter (smooth, not crunchy), and a selfish animal in bed; weary mother Marie Louise - herself one of 14 siblings - pregnant with only her fourth child; daughter Manon imitating her somnambulistic Roman Catholic piety, sister Carmen finding a tacky kind of liberation as a Country-and-Western chanteuse. Not familiar? Well: the trouble is that this well-travelled 21-year-old play is by Michel Tremblay, French Canada's leading playwright. Forever Yours Marie Lou is one of his earliest plays, but like all of his work it is set in a social and linguistic milieu which is as specific as could be. As rendered in Welsh-English by the young Thin Language Theatre Company, it becomes almost a surrealist exercise, unmoored to anything in real history or life. There are two reasons why Marie Lou struck a resonant chord which echoes still for both French- and English-Canadian audiences. One is that it captured the 1960s turning-point as it felt in Quebec, where within half a generation that province stopped being a priest-ridden, wilfully 'backward' community and joined the thrusting modern world. Almost overnight the Quebec birthrate dropped from its traditional teeming high to Canada's lowest (below replacement-level): and to get a book that was on the Index - Joyce, Gide, Cocteau - from your local library you no longer had to ask for it in English. The other reason why the play has enjoyed so many productions is that its poetic structure is fresh and sharply original. Though most of the action takes place in the family kitchen/dining-room, it tacks continually between a 'now' where the orphaned daughters argue over their family past, and an earlier 'then' (at least ten years ago) when they were brutally subjected to it. In that same room we witness the old parental rows and feel the children's reactions and their older selves' bitter recall in ghostly interpenetration. The grownup sisters' dialogues should alternate fluidly with the horrid childhood scenes. Sadly, the Thin Language product was far too clumsy with that backward-and-forward switching to make it work. The script stammered painfully - where a dialogue from one time should smoothly override one from another, there were sudden, hiccoughing stage-waits. No dramatic rhythm or pace; often, no clear indication of where or when these things were happening. The stage-lighting might have helped but didn't, despite simple, well-meant efforts by the technicians. Though the storm-or-threatening forecasts prompted character-sketches along the right lines, they registered here as shallow, unlocalised stereotypes, never very funny or very moving. Native Forever Yours Mary Lou types might relish the cynical tones of personal indictment, loud and unsparing, with apologies only when caught out; but the Thin Language team recreates too little sense of a real, stifling mini-world to trigger sympathetic responses from the rest of us.

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SPECIAL YEARS;  </P> <P> 50 AND BEYOND: THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE;  </P> <P> GETAWAY GUIDE TO 'WOOPIE' WEEKENDS;  </P> <P> WELL OFF OLDER PEOPLE (AGE 50 TO 65) ARE VERY ACTIVE TREKKERS. NOT ONLY DO THEY  HAVE MORE DISPOSABLE MONEY, THEY ALSO HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND IT. AND SPEND IT  THEY DO.  </P> <P> It must be downright discouraging to the yuppies that the "woopies" are having  so much fun -- woopies being Well Off Older People, more singularly known as  mature travelers.  </P> <P> The travel industry has found these travelers, age 50 to 65, to be a distinct  market from the true seniors, those 65 and older. The mature travelers are very  active and not only have more disposable money but they have the time to spend  it. And spend it they do.  </P> <P> Today's active mature travelers are not fools. They'll gladly accept discounts  and other benefits offered them to travel mid-week to help fill a resort's  rooms. That means easier access to golf courses and tennis courts.  </P> <P> Mature travelers don't mind spending the bucks on travel, but they do demand  value. Here are some of the places you might find them in Southern California:  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOMEWHERE EAST OF TIBET  </P> <P> It was appropriate that Frank Capra chose Ojai Valley to serve as the location  shot for Shangri-la for his 1937 "Lost Horizon."  </P> <P> Somehow you do feel younger in sequestered and sophisticated Ojai. Many  discover that feeling on the lush fairways of the Ojai Valley Inn and Country  Club.  </P> <P> Reopened last year after a $36-million renovation and expansion, the  60-year-old resort now has 218 rooms and suites, modernized and updated but  maintaining the 1920s version of Mission architecture.  </P> <P> The 200-acre resort offers eight tennis courts (four lighted), two heated  swimming pools (one is a 60-foot lap pool), a spa, exercise rooms, and cycling,  jogging and hiking trails.  </P> <P> There are four indoor and terrace dining areas, a lounge, room service and such  appreciated amenities as no-smoking rooms, in-room mini-bars, and terry-cloth  robes. All this and attentive service has earned the resort a four-star rating  by Mobil Travel Guides for 1989.  </P> <P> The Ojai Luxury Golf Holiday runs three days, two nights at $298 per person,  double. It includes two breakfasts, two dinners from a choice of the inn's  restaurants and menus; unlimited course play, and free driving-range balls.  </P> <P> The Ojai Tennis Holiday costs $178 per person, double, for a three-day,  two-night stay, with luxury accommodations, two breakfasts, court fees, and  free tennis-ball-machine practice time.  </P> <P> There are also fitness holidays, honeymoon and anniversary package plans, and a  bed-and-breakfast rate. For information and availability, telephone toll-free  (800) 422-OJAI. Ojai is 73 miles northwest of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SEE THE SPA BY THE SEA  </P> <P> Down at San Diego's colorful cusp of Coronado, where the venerable Hotel del  Coronado is now in its 101st year of operation, a French ingenue, the Le  Meridien, is debuting for its first summer season.  </P> <P> Situated on 16 prime acres of bay-front property, Le Meridien has 300 rooms,  suites and villas, three swimming pools (one a 75-yard lap pool), six tennis  courts, a health club and spa, and two excellent restaurants (plus 24-hour room  service).  </P> <P> All this is situated amid a lush garden ambiance with lagoons, waving palms and  a low-rise resort setting with a dazzling view of downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> The resort would appeal to any vacationer, not only the mature traveler.  Likewise, all would enjoy the free daily introductory clinics in golf, tennis  and other sports, such as wind surfing.  </P> <P> Ah, but for those women who modestly admit to mature years, Southern  California's newest resort also offers Le Meridien Spa and Clarins Institut de  Beaute.  </P> <P> In addition to a full program of such spa treatments as special baths, herbal  wraps and massages Le Meridien is the first spa in the United States to offer  the highly regarded skin-care treatments and products of France's Jacques  Courtin-Clarins.  </P> <P> (And, this being an equal rights article, mature men also are welcome to all  spa and beauty treatments.)  </P> <P> With its range of sports and spa activities, Le Meridien has a number of  special package plans. They start from the two-night Bed and Breakfast at $144  per person, double, that includes a luxury room and two breakfasts.  </P> <P> Spa programs also vary -- from a One Day Rejuvenator with a low-cal spa lunch,  Swedish massage, Clarins facial, herbal wrap and fitness class for $124 up to a  four-day, three-night package that offers up to 14 spa services, plus  accommodations and spa meals for $822 per person, double occupancy. For  informationtelephone (800) 543-4300.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A MOST CONGENIAL SPOT  </P> <P> You could spend a bit of time in Camelot with a one-night (or longer) package  at Griswold's Claremont Center, where the Lerner &amp; Loewe musical is  encamped until mid-June.  </P> <P> Long popular with mature travelers, Griswold's attractive Candlelight Pavilion  features Broadway musicals in a spacious dinner theater; dinner shows are  offered Wednesday through Sunday, with Saturday and Sunday lunch matinees.  </P> <P> Griswold's has a package that includes a deluxe room, dinner and show for $60  per person, double occupancy. And there's plenty of time left to enjoy a swim  in the pool or stroll in the 17-acre landscaped acres.  </P> <P> To work up an appetite for dinner (choice of three entrees), there is browsing  and shopping in more than 30 specialty shops and galleries in Griswold's Old  Schoolhouse, part of the hotel-theater-restaurant complex.  </P> <P> There's fine dining at the Indian Hill Restaurant and Lounge or at the  Smorgasbord Restaurant and scrumptious bakery. For more information and  reservations telephone (714) 626-1254 or (213) 275-3642. Griswold's is about 32  miles east of Los Angeles at 555 West Foothill Blvd., Claremont.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL  </P> <P> Murrieta Hot Springs Resort and Spa in Temecula has finally shaken off the  lethargy and suspect reputation that dogged it some years ago. Today the  47-acre spa resort has great appeal to the mature travelers who can't swing La  Costa nor open the Golden Door due to budget restrictions.  </P> <P> Murrieta has finally joined the mainstream of resort life by adding meat and  poultry to its menus (as well as wine and beer). Its previous all-vegetarian  cuisine is still available.  </P> <P> The resort has 14 tennis courts, three swimming pools, access to a fine Robert  Trent Jones-designed golf course, plus an array of spa, health and beauty  programs. No new accommodations have been added, but older rooms have been well  renovated.  </P> <P> A good way to check it out is through one of the several mid-week package  plans. The three-day, two-night Golf Getaway provides accommodations, 36 holes  of golf, cart, two breakfasts, two saunas, and 10% off optional spa and beauty  treatments. It runs $124 per person, double.  </P> <P> There's also a similar midweek tennis program that offers unlimited court time,  a half-hour lesson, two breakfasts and saunas plus the 10% discounts for $99  per person, double.  </P> <P> Spa programs range in length from one to seven days and provide a variety of  options from the resort's 15 health and beauty services. For more information,  telephone toll-free (800) 458-4393. The resort is about a 90-minute drive south  of Los Angeles, just off I-5 north of Temecula.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THERE'S A SMALL HOTEL  </P> <P> Santa Barbara is most everybody's favorite weekend town. There are loads of  fine resorts: Fess Parker's Red Lion Inn, Four Season's Santa Barbara Biltmore,  Harbor View Inn and King's Inn are a few of the larger digs.  </P> <P> Mature travelers looking for something more intimate might enjoy the charming  18-room Villa Rosa, at 15 Chapala St., minutes from the beach. Each large room  in this Spanish Colonial-style inn is different and decorated in a distinctive  decor.  </P> <P> This accommodation is sort of a cross between a small hotel and a  bed-and-breakfast inn, operated with style and panache by Mark and Beverly  Kirkhart. Off-season rates, in effect for another two months, run $80 to $160  per couple and include continental breakfast, afternoon wine and cheese,  evening port and sherry. For information, telephone (805) 966-0851.  </P> <P> Too often overlooked in these days of larger flashy resorts is the 52-room  Montecito Inn, built in the 1920s by entertainers Charlie Chaplin and Fatty  Arbuckle. The inn is located at 1295 Coast Village Road, and besides having a  pool, sauna and whirlpool, it offers complimentary use of bikes to guests. For  information telephone (800) 843-2017.  </P></p>

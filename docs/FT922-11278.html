			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television Horizon is devoted to 'Iceman', the body which was found last September by German hikers on the border between Austria and Italy. Being the seventh body found on the mountain that year, it was removed in a routine fashion and only identified later as being 5,300 years old. Artefacts included a flint knife, copper axe, yew bow, and 14 viburnum arrows. There is immense excitement in the world of archaeology (8.10 BBC2). BBC1's new sitcom Side By Side (8.30) sounds like another study of English class attitudes. Gareth Hunt plays a successful plumber whose DIY home improvements, such as the 'Acropolis' in his garden, irritate his neighbour. Panorama reports on an apparently chronic water shortage in southern Britain. The south has suffered its lowest rainfall for 200 years. The programme asks whether nature alone is to blame, and what can be done (9.30). Most of ITV's evening is occupied by a two-hour drama about a jazz musician who turns detective when he becomes involved in a murder mystery: The Jazz Detective runs for an hour before News At 10 and an hour after.</p>

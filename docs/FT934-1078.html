			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Telekom takes a strategic bet on Matav - The Dollars 875m winning bid for a stake in Hungarian telecoms The acquisition by a consortium led by Deutsche Telekom, the German state telecoms company, of 30 per cent of Hungarian operator Matav dwarfs earlier east European privatisations. Deutsche Telekom and partner Ameritech, the US regional operator, are paying Dollars 875m for the stake. To put the figure in context, Hungary's previous largest foreign sale was the Dollars 150m purchase by General Electric of the US of 50 per cent of Tungsram, the light bulb producer. The price paid for Matav, which values the company at Dollars 2.92bn and was at the high end of expectations, reflects the fierce competition between the three groups which put in final bids. Stet International, the Italian state group, displayed deep pockets with by far the highest bid in the first round and set a benchmark for the ultimate offers. Telekom knew that it had to come close to Stet on price and at the same time watch out for the powerful partnership of France Telecom and US West, the regional Bell company, two groups with long involvements in Hungary. While the three contenders may have egged each other on, executives at each are adamant that they never went beyond an economic valuation of Matav. The intensity of the bidding war reflects the underlying attractions of Matav to international telecoms companies. 'They wanted it incredibly badly,' says Mr Michael Phair of NM Rothschild, advisers to the Hungarian government on the transaction. The enthusiasm shown for Matav was especially striking given the uncertainties that surrounded its privatisation. Telekom's investigation of the Hungarian company's accounts turned up Dollars 200m of variation in estimates of indebtedness. In up to 25 of Hungary's 54 local telephone areas rivals can bid for concessions early next year and Matav risks being left with the least lucrative regions. Even where conditions are firm, they are not the most generous. The regulatory framework links tariffs to producer prices, which currently lag well behind consumer prices. And the Hungarian state, in contrast to the South American telecoms privatisations, retains control of a majority of shares and the post of chief executive. Matav also requires a large amount of investment. Even after a vigorous three-year development plan, Hungary has only 1.5m main lines, or 15 for every 100 inhabitants, and over 700,000 are on the waiting list for phones. The government is insisting on 15 per cent line growth annually. Tremendous suppressed demand for telephone services promises strong growth in basic traffic, in contrast to the stagnation experienced in western markets. But the development plan calls for Dollars 4.2bn in capital expenditure to the year 2002. 'The Hungarians are asking a lot, asking a high price, high development and service targets, and not even giving total control,' says Mr Paul Grosse, Deutsche Telekom's executive director for international finance. So what is the attraction? Participants note that Matav is the first telecoms company in eastern Europe to be privatised. Mr Grosse believes that an early entry may open other markets in the region. Industry analysts point out that other countries in the region are looking carefully at the Hungarian experience. But an acquisition in Hungary probably precludes too much of a commitment to neighbouring countries. Nor, as industrial investors who entered eastern Europe in 1990 can attest, is being first always such a boon. Budapest investment bankers have a motto: 'Pioneers get shot'. Investors have drawn much attention to Hungary's potential to act as a regional hub for communications. The theory is that the country in the region which first establishes modern international connections will attract traffic and gain a lasting advantage. Hungary is well-placed for that role, connected to the Trans-European Line and able to funnel international calls from Romania and Ukraine. Matav has also beaten its Polish counterpart in providing an optical fibre link between western Europe and Moscow. However, there is doubt about regional hubs. As much as anything the theory was designed to appeal to the Hungarian authorities. Hungary has given up its territorial claims in the Carpathian basin but still hopes for regional economic dominance. Geography does have something to do with Matav's particular appeal to Telekom. 'Telekom wanted this deal, they wanted Hungary, they wanted a success in eastern Europe,' says Mr Grosse. Eastern Europe is a natural hinterland for the German company and Hungary finds it politically more palatable to see German ownership in a strategic company than it would Polish or Czech. Hungary is also sufficiently distant from Germany to give credibility to Telekom's pledge to develop the country as a regional nexus. But, above all, the price paid for Matav reflects not so much the company's individual virtues as the more general uprating of emerging markets and within them the telecoms sector. Telecoms investors are betting that at least Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will show some of the economic dynamism that has lifted Latin America and South-eastern Asia. Telekom's bid hinges on a projection that Hungary will pull out of its four-year recession and GDP will grow at an average of 3.5 per cent. With these assumptions, the price is not so out of line. It implies a valuation of nearly Dollars 2,000 per line, which is comparable, after adjusting for inflation, with the price paid in Latin American telecoms privatisations.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BIDDERS FOR MATAV  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Consortium       Lead partner          Nationality       US partner  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MagyarCom        Deutsche Telecom      German            Ameritech Euro Telecom     Stet Intl             Italian           Bell Atlantic Hungary Duna Telecom     France Telecom        French            US West Intl  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Consortium       Adviser               Indicative bid    Final bid                                             (Dollars)    (Dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MagyarCom        Goldman Sachs              420m-500m         875m Euro Telecom     JP Morgan                  800m-850m         910m Hungary Duna Telecom     CSFB                       450m-500m         830m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

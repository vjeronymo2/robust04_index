			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (9): Sell-off date approaches - UK parcels post EXPRESS parcel companies are generally cautious about their future. Most leading UK operators report a small improvement which they expect to continue through the year. Others, however, are enjoying double-digit growth but do not say whether they are discounting or from what base they calculate their growth. Rate cutting remains rife and there is still a lot of overcapacity. As recovery develops overcapacity will shrink but some executives say that there are still too many companies. Parcelforce estimates 1992 sales of UK express services at Pounds l81bn of which some 43 per cent is accounted for by next day services while other guaranteed services command another 20 per cent. Parcelforce itself has seen its next day volumes grow by 50 per cent during 1992-93. There is much interest about the fate of the two public operators, Red Star and Parcelforce. Red Star, which has made notable progress towards returning to profitability, is expected to be sold by the late summer. The timing for Parcelforce is less certain. At Parcelforce, it is a case of 'business as usual', says Malcolm Kitchener, managing director. 'Our overall strategy is geared to improving both cost and quality in all areas of our business. This involves investment in new depots such as Pounds 15m at Liverpool into new vehicles and other technology such as in-cab communications systems. Restructuring is also part of the programme with 50 depots due to be closed as part of a rationalisation programme to save Pounds 16m a year.' Red Star reports that business is flat and has been for four or five months. However its budget for this year allows for some growth from the late summer onwards. Of the two, Red Star is considered the more saleable and a more manageable unit. Reducing costs is one of the key ways in which operators are combating the recession. TNT has rationalised its management and cut its use of subcontractors to save some Pounds 6m a year in the UK. It is concentrating on next day services and reducing two and three day operations which have been losing money. Tom Bell, TNT's UK general manager, says that 'order sizes are getting smaller but being sent more frequently. The use of premium services has fallen from more than 50 per cent to 42 per cent in 1992.' He forecasts between two and four per cent growth this year. 'There is no shortage of volume in the market but it is extremely cost conscious,' says Colin Millbanks, chief executive of Parceline. 'Cost is now the main deciding factor with customers in choosing an operator. They are much more prepared to trade off quality against price.' Parceline had achieved a strong financial performance with borrowings down and net profitability up,' adds Mlllbanks. Over the past two years the company has invested some Pounds 2m in developing the parcel management system building on its bar coded technology. Quality is being improved, with BS5750 accreditation of the line-haul operation and its national hub being pursued. Investment in new technology has been one of Securicor Omega Express's key policies through the recession. The company claims to be the UK's largest overnight carrier with an estimated 15 per cent of the market. It has a throughput of l6m parcels a week and employs 3,000 vehicles and more than 8,000 personnel through 154 branches. Some companies have made considerable change in the UK during recession. Lynx, NFC's parcel arm, decided to take the opportunity of Federal Express's withdrawal from domestic operations in Europe to buy their hub at Nuneaton. This has warranted a change from depot-to-depot trunking to a new hub-based line haul network linking the 34 depots nationwide. 'We have improved hub efficiency by 50 per cent which has made a significant difference to our operations,' comments Kevin Appleton, Lynx sales and marketing director. 'We also installed a freight handling centre so we can provide a full range of services from a Jiffy bag to a pallet.' Over the past six months Lynx has won more than Pounds 6m of new business in the automotive, pharmaceuticals and electronics sectors. UPS, after much speculation, last July bought Carryfast, claimed to be the UK's largest private package delivery company to be integrated in its UK domestic operation. 'Integrating Carryfast has been undertaken gradually since the purchase,' says Peter Quantrill, UPS's UK chief executive. This integration involves merging Carryfast depots with UPS's International depots where appropriate. To date four out of 15 have been integrated. Quantrill comments: 'Our first quarter was up on 1992. Discounting is rife, an inherent sign of the current market. It is encouraging to be ahead and we will be looking for further growth through the year.' The last 18 months have proved a particularly challenging time for Elan, which was bought out of DHL in August 1991. The company has since moved from losses into profit by concentrating on its speciality overnight service. It offers delivery before 10am, 12 noon and 5pm as well as a palletised service for shipments up to one tonne. It continues to progress well and won Pounds 3m of new business in the first quarter of 1993. This encouraging growth in revenue comes on the back of record trading volumes for Elan at the end of last year, says Brian Draper, Elan's managing director. 'It more than justifies our recent Pounds 1m investment in new trucks and our investment in IT systems.' 'Recovery has been filtering through since Christmas,' says Peter Gent, Interlink's chief executive. 'There is improvement in volumes but not price. There does not appear to be any pattern of recovery, or a pattern we can follow, but we are moving about 5 per cent more than this time last year.' A combination of cost control, better quality of customer service and limited investment in enhancing existing technology systems has been adopted by most operators to cope with the recession. Few have introduced new services in the domestic market as their ranges were satisfactory for most needs. Some trimming of depot networks has been undertaken by some operators but trying to balance outgoings with revenue has been the main challenge. As the economy improves and trade expands the impact of rate cutting could linger and keep revenue flows below what they should be. It is at this time that some trimming of capacity might occur as quality of service to match price as the key deciding factors on which operator to use.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (19): Key facts for visitors CURRENCY: The peseta remains in the EMS but has undergone a series of devaluations which has resulted in a 20 per cent drop in its value against the D-Mark in the past year and a half. All the leading banks - found concentrated around Placa Catalunya and Passeig de Gracia - operate 'cambios' for changing money, based on the official rates of the Bank of Spain that day with varying commission structures. On Las Ramblas and around the cathedral independent cambios offer 'no commission'. However their rates, except for extremely large amounts, generally make it preferable to pay the commission at the banks. Leading credit cards such as Visa, Access/Mastercard and American Express are accepted at most shops, restaurants and hotels. TELEPHONES: The international dialing code for Barcelona is 343. To make an international call dial 07 and wait for a high pitched tone before continuing. To dial anywhere else in Spain you need to add a regional code such as 91 for Madrid or 95 for Seville. Public telephones operate both with coins and with cards, which can be bought at newspaper kiosks which can be found on most streets in the centre. International calls are much more expensive than in most EC countries, while local calls within the city are extremely cheap. TIME: Spanish time is one hour ahead of Britain (Greenwich Mean Time) and six hours ahead of New York, except in the four weeks in early autumn from late September when the Spanish clocks go back at the end of summertime to the same time as Britain. HOTELS: Being a city which is increasingly designed for the business tourist, the easiest time to find a hotel room is in August when prices drop by about 50 per cent. Package tourists generally stay on the Costa Brava and visit the city for the day. The busiest times are when a big trade exhibition is taking place at the Fira, which last year registered 1.6m visitors. The biggest were for food at the end of February, consumer electronics in the middle of September and tourism in the second half of April. Plenty of hotel rooms are now on offer, but it is worth booking in advance at these times of the year if you have a specific hotel in mind. RESTAURANTS: The city has thousands of bars. Many of these serve a lunchtime menu which includes bread and wine and can vary from the excellent to the grim. In the top bracket there are a number of restaurants with one Michelin star, but only one, Neichel on the Avinguda de Pedralbes, which has two. It is worth booking a few days in advance for the more expensive restaurants, although the recession has reduced pressure on places. CLUBS: The Circulo Ecuestre, Balmes 169, is one of the best-known among the business community. It is for members only but the British Chamber of Commerce (317-3220/3120) holds a lunch there on the first Thursday of every month which is open to visiting businessmen and women who contact the chamber in advance. One of the most popular business lunching spots, almost the equivalent to a club amongst the financial and commercial elite, is the restaurant Finisterre (Avinguda Diagonal, 469). TIPPING: The guidelines on tipping are not clearly established. In the top bracket restaurants and hotels 5 per cent is considered correct. In bars and taxis there is no obligation to tip. AIRPORT: The redesigned and expanded national and international airport of El Prat del Llobregat is seven miles from the centre of the city to the south. Iberia has just announced that it is to become the centre of its European operations. Air Europe and SAS have both recently entered the market. Iberia operates a shuttle service to Madrid which runs from early morning to late evening. The airport itself provides information on flight arrivals (Tel: 478 5000) but it is necessary to call each airline for information on departures (Iberia in Barcelona: 301 3993). TO AND FROM THE AIRPORT: It normally takes between 15 minutes and half an hour to get to the airport from the centre by car. An airport bus runs every 15 minutes from Placa Catalunya, at a cost of Pts 400, which takes half an hour. The times to be wary of are when the morning and evening rush hours combine with some other event, for example one of Barcelona Football Club's important games of the season, or the beginning of a long weekend in the middle of the skiing or mushroom-picking seasons (the latter in the autumn). Trains run regularly from Sants station. PUBLIC TRANSPORT: The centre is well-served by the metro system which is also cheap. A tarjeta, a ticket for 10 journeys costs Pts 560. The same applies for the buses, which have a separate tarjeta. Within the city itself it is sometimes preferable to use the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat, the regional suburban network, when for instance, you need to go further up the Tibidabo mountain than the metro. An old, well-preserved tram operates from the end of the line at Avinguda del Tibidabo for the last leg to the top. The city has 11,300 black and yellow taxis. A green light on the roof and a sign on the windscreen saying 'Libre' or 'Lliure' indicates they are free for hire. Six trains depart daily to Madrid from Sants station which take eight or nine hours and cost Pts 3,800 to Pts 11,000 one way. The overnight sleeper to Paris from the newly-renovated Estacio de Franca leaves at 2100 and costs Pts 14,800.

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Loyalists in Ulster announce 'ceasefire' LOYALIST paramilitaries in Northern Ireland last night said they would enforce a qualified 'ceasefire' to coincide with the start in less than two weeks of formal talks on the province's political future. An unexpected statement issued in Belfast by the so-called Combined Loyalist Military Command said the suspension of operational hostilities was a genuine attempt to assist the talks initiated by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary. The statement said loyalist groups retained the right to take 'defensive or retaliatory action' - assumed to mean in response to action by the IRA. Although the gesture comes from organisations abhorred by the government and the province's constitutional parties, it gives a further fillip to Mr Brooke, who defied the expectations of many in winning agreement last month for round-table talks. Loyalist murder gangs in Northern Ireland have been behind far more killings in the province this year than the IRA. Mr Brian Mawhinney, a minister at the Northern Ireland Office, had earlier announced that talks would start on April 30. They will cover alternatives to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement as well as devolution in the province. Details of the three or four-man negotiating teams are expected to be announced shortly by the four political parties involved - the Democratic Unionist party, the Ulster Unionist party, the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party and the Alliance party. The ceasefire move follows meetings between leaders of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association, which is still legal in the province. The UVF, sometimes using its flag of convenience, the Protestant Action Force, has been behind 11 murders in recent weeks. One incident last month in which two teenage girls and a young man were shot dead in County Armagh horrified all sections of the community. British and Irish ministers will hold a meeting a week to-morrow under the 1985 agreement. Then the workings of the agreement will, in effect, be suspended for about 10 weeks while talks take place.</p>

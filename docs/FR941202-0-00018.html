			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.50&blank;Possession, Use, Calibration, and Checks of Dose Calibrators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is an editorial change in this section. The phrase in the proposed rule ``over the range of its use between  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' has been replaced by ``over a range from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.900&blank;Radiation Safety Officer <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two additional board certifications have been recognized in this section of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the public comment period, the Commission became aware of the need to recognize certifications by the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine (AOBNM) and the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR). A letter dated August 16, 1990, from Richard E. Cunningham (Director, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NRC), to Paul J. Chase (Chairman, AOBR and Vice President, AOBNM), stated that the NRC intended to include certifications of (1) AOBR in &sect;35.900, and (2) AOBNM in &sect;&sect;35.900, 35.910, and 35.920 in the next amendment to 10 CFR Part 35. Therefore, the certifications by AOBR and AOBNM have been added to this section of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.910&blank;Training for Uptake, Dilution, and Excretion Studies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 35.920&blank;Training for Imaging and Localization Studies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One additional board certification has been recognized in both sections of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the previous section, the Commission became aware of the need to recognize certification by AOBNM. Therefore, the certification by AOBNM has been added to both sections of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.930&blank;Training for Therapeutic Use of Unsealed Byproduct Material <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two additional board certifications have been recognized in this section of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comment stated that certification by the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) should be recognized in all applicable sections of 10 CFR Part 35. Under the existing regulations, the Commission has recognized AOBR certification in &sect;&sect;35.910, 35,920, 35.940, 35.950, and 35.960.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following receipt of this comment, the Commission requested additional information from AOBR concerning training and certification criteria for therapeutic use of unsealed byproduct material. After reviewing supporting documents provided by the American Osteopathic College of Radiology (AOCR), the Commission has determined that AOBR certification is equivalent to certification by the American Board of Radiology (ABR). Therefore, recognition of certification by AOBR has been added in &sect;35.930 of this final rule for certification granted after 1984 because all candidates certified by AOBR since 1984 will meet the NRC's training requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the public comment period, the Commission also became aware of the need to recognize in &sect;35.930 certification by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. This is in addition to the recognition reflected in &sect;&sect;35.900, 35.910, and 35.920 of the proposed rule. A letter dated June 3, 1992, from John E. Glenn (Chief, Medical, Academic and Commercial Use Safety Branch, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NRC), to Gilles D. Hurteau of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, stated that certification by the latter is acceptable for approval, among other things, as an authorized user in &sect;35.300. Therefore, certification by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada has been added to this section of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.981&blank;Training for Experienced Nuclear Pharmacists <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section was not included in the proposed rule, but has been added to the final rule in response to numerous comments. This section has been patterned after the provisions in 10 CFR Part 32 for ``grandfathering'' an ``authorized user.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ``grandfather'' an experienced nuclear pharmacist, the licensee needs to apply for a license amendment identifying that individual as an authorized nuclear pharmacist. The licensee must receive the license amendment before allowing that individual to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A licensee seeking to ``grandfather'' a nuclear pharmacist must ensure that the individual has completed a structured educational program as specified in &sect;35.980(b)(1) on or before (the date of publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and is currently working as a nuclear pharmacist. However, the individual does not need a preceptor statement (&sect;35.980(b)(2)) and the individual's training, specified above, does not need to be within 7 years preceding the date of application (&sect;35.972).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ericsson's nine-month sales slide ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, made a pre-tax profit of SKr63m (Dollars 10m) for the third quarter of the year. This contrasts with a SKr268m loss for the same period of 1991 and a SKr442m pre-tax profit for the second quarter. Sales rose slightly in the third quarter to SKr9.71bn from SKr9.57bn. For the nine months ended September, net sales dropped by 6 per cent to SKr30.02bn. Ericsson blamed this on continuing low investment volumes in important markets like Spain and the divestment of its cable and telephone operations in Latin America. The company reported 22 per cent growth in order bookings for the nine months to SKr37.72bn. This was due mainly to a strong increase in public telecommunications and radio communication orders. Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, said the higher orders would make a full impact on net sales next year and he added that the forecast for the whole of 1992 of a low profit remained unchanged. Mr Ramqvist claimed that Ericsson was strengthening its position as 'a world-leading, independent supplier of telecommunications systems'. Yesterday, the company announced it was extending its partnership with Texas Instruments, the Dallas-based high technology company.</p>

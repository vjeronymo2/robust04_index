			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Union vote may have to be re-run A BALLOT for the position of general secretary of the Association of University Teachers may have to be re-run after the question of technical irregularities was raised in the way elections were held last year. Mr David Triesman, who was narrowly elected to the job in December, said last night that the AUT 'must plainly consider re-running the election' if it could be shown there had been irregularities. However, a new ballot would be 'a regrettable distraction' for the union, he said.</p>

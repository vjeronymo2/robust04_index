			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR ROCKS, ROLLS COSTA MESA, 33-13  </P> <P> Corona del Mar High School's football team trotted through a gauntlet of  cheerleaders and song girls while Queen's "We Will Rock You" blasted over the  loudspeakers.  </P> <P> And rock they did.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar rolled over winless Costa Mesa, 33-13, improving its record to  4-1. But Sea King Coach Dave Holland said he still is not satisfied.  </P> <P> "I thought we were kind of out of sync offensively," he said. "We weren't real  intense. We made some mental errors but we were OK in the second half."  </P> <P> At the end of the first half, the Sea Kings had built a 12-0 lead, scoring on  each of their first two possessions. With 5:39 left in the quarter, sophomore  quarterback Todd Kehrli threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver  Weston Johnson and senior wide receiver Jerrott Willard opened the second  quarter with a 28-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> With 2:21 left in the half, Kehrli marched the Sea Kings to the half-yard line  but the Mustangs stopped them with 12 seconds left.  </P> <P> Although Corona del Mar began the third quarter with two consecutive penalties,  the team ended it with three touchdowns. On second and 28, Kehrli hit tight end  Jeff Jackson with an 11-yard pass, then threw a 70-yarder to Weston Johnson for  the score. Costa Mesa incurred two consecutive penalties on the Sea Kings' next  possession, moving the ball to the 1, where senior running back Brian Lucas  barrelled through. Then with 2:12 left in the quarter, Lucas took the ball  again and swept to the left for a 26-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Lucas finished with 115 yards in 17 carries and two touchdowns, Kehrli  completed six of 13 passes for 138 passing yards.  </P> <P> But the Mustangs were not finished. Senior running back Tony Hoover wriggled  over the line to put Costa Mesa on the scoreboard with 8:58 left. Less than  three minutes later, Sea King Jason Hughes fumbled on the 13-yard line, and  Mustang running back Fernando Ospina recovered. After being sacked for the  eighth time, quarterback Duby Ospina threw an 18-yard pass. Mustang David  Phillips and Sea King Weston Johnson struggled for it in the end zone, and  Phillips emerged victorious.  </P></p>

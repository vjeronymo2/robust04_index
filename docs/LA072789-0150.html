			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: DEVO WILL PERFORM IN FIRST BENEFIT CONCERT  </P> <P> Are they not (charitable) men?  </P> <P> The answer, says Jerry Casale, co-founder of Devo, is that the veteran new-wave  band has long wanted to rock for a good cause. But somehow, from its debut in  1978 until the present, Devo never has played a benefit concert.  </P> <P> That will change Labor Day weekend, when Devo headlines the two-day Ocean Aid  concert at Irvine Bowl in Laguna Beach. Proceeds from the Sept. 3 and 4 benefit  will go to environmental groups dedicated to safeguarding Southern California's  shores and coastal waters.  </P> <P> "We were never asked to play a benefit when we were enjoying enough commercial  success" to be a major draw, Casale said this week from the North Hollywood  rehearsal studio where Devo is writing songs for its next album. By the time  big rock benefits like the Amnesty International tour began to roll around,  Devo was no longer the mass attraction that would put it on a benefit  organizer's A list. "We wanted very much to play and we asked to, but we  weren't a big enough fish to fry," Casale said.  </P> <P> So when the organizers of Ocean Aid called last month, Devo quickly agreed to  appear.  </P> <P> On the surface of it, an idealistic gesture such as playing an environmental  benefit might seem anomalous for Devo. This is the band, after all, that posed  the musical question, "Are we not men?" and answered with its own jaundiced,  satiric theory of De-evolution, which held, in essence, that mankind isn't  evolving, but regressing on its way to hell in a handbasket.  </P> <P> "We weren't actually celebrating it," Casale said of Devo's dismal view of  human nature. "We were more freaked out by it. We've never just complained.  We've always offered ideas and solutions in interviews and elsewhere. I'm  unfortunately afraid that we were right pretty much. The world is Devo.  Everything is very, very critical."  </P> <P> While Devo hasn't been a big draw nationally since the early '80s, the band has  a strong base in Orange County, where it sold out nine performances last  December and January at the Coach House -- more than 3,400 tickets. Total  capacity for the two Ocean Aid shows is 5,000. Besides Devo, the lineup for the  benefit features San Diego techno-pop band Red Flag; Caterwaul, a  self-descriptively named I.R.S. Records act from Los Angeles; and the Dr. Dream  Team: a cadre of acts signed to locally based Dr. Dream Records that includes  Oingo Boingo offshoot Food For Feet and three Orange County bands -- Eggplant,  Swamp Zombies and Imagining Yellow Suns. Tickets, priced from $18 to $22.50, go  on sale July 31.  </P> <P> Casale said the shows may give Devo fans a preview of some of the songs that  will wind up on the band's next album. After last year's dance-pop oriented  comeback album, "Total Devo," Casale sees the new material sounding "more like  primitive early Devo. We wanted to get back to something more essential, less  Baroque and ornate. I think too many machines entered Devo's life." Next time  around, Casale said, the sound will emphasize more guitars, "and real drums."  </P> <P> Ocean Pacific Sunwear Ltd., the Tustin-based company that sponsors the annual  Op Pro Surfing Championship in Huntington Beach, is the prime mover and  financial backer behind Ocean Aid.  </P> <P> "A lot of people in our office are in the water every day as surfers. We see  first hand what's happening to the ocean" said Jerry Crosby, executive vice  president of Ocean Pacific and organizer of the Ocean Aid Foundation, formed to  distribute funds from the benefit to area environmental groups.  </P> <P> Crosby's goal is to raise $40,000 to $50,000 at this year's benefit, with an  eye toward expanding Ocean Aid's scope in future years. The benefit will be  promoted heavily next week at Op Pro, which is expected to draw more than  100,000 spectators.  </P></p>

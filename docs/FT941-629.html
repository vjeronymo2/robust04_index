			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Argent to float with more than Pounds 150m value Argent Group, a private property concern which has pursued an aggressive expansion programme over the last three years, is to float this summer with a market value of more than Pounds 150m. Shares will be offered to the public as well as placed with institutions. The group intends to use the proceeds to 'take advantage of development opportunities beyond our current scope'. Argent said development would only be undertaken if the building was pre-let or sold. Argent is the private vehicle of brothers Michael and Peter Freeman. Between 1991 and 1993 the group bought 15 of its 16 properties with the help of its joint venture partner, Warburg Pincus, the US venture capital concern. The group's properties have recently been valued at Pounds 195m and pro forma net assets are estimated at Pounds 115m.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Observer: Chemicals complex What alchemy is brewing at Yorkshire-based fine chemicals company MTM, now progressing towards a rescue refinancing with its banks? Almost a year after being ousted as chairman, MTM's Richard Lines has just sold his 7 per cent share stake to one of Sweden's more controversial businessmen -  Egyptian-born Refaat El-Sayed. Meanwhile, it's not gone unnoticed that Lines has found an office in Stockton-on-Tees, across the corridor from another ex-ICI man and member of the Teeside speciality chemicals mafia, Michael Marshall, who was deposed as executive chairman of yet another chemical company, Ellis &amp; Everard, last July. Like Lines, Marshall is sitting on a tidy personal fortune, as is MTM's new chairman, Ken Schofield, who made a lot of money selling his own company to Hickson and then turning it round. The similarities don't end there. All three are first and foremost deal-makers no doubt imbued with a touch of mutual rivalry. They first mixed 30 years back when Lines was Marshall's boss at ICI, and both sold chemicals to Schofield, then at Manro. So what, if anything, might all this wealth and knowledge have to do with MTM? El-Sayed and Lines will say nothing of their intentions. But it is hard to imagine that anyone is better qualified to know what a bombed-out company like MTM is really worth than its founder Richard Lines, or MTM's current boss, the well-regarded Schofield. Sounds like the ingredients for an explosive recipe.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS  </P> <P> All the news is overwhelming about the homeless and homeless children. What's  happening to all that money -- the millions of dollars that is confiscated from  drug raids? There's enough money there to build shelters and keep the homeless  fed. Put those millions to good use. Now is the time. It's a disgrace for any  city to have these families sleeping in the streets.  </P> <P> JACK DIAMOND  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

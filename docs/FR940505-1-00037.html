			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA began its selection process for mobile source control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies with those measures that were required in all states by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and those measures being implemented by the State of California and local agencies. EPA considered the impact of these measures as well as the expected benefit of national mobile source rules in process. For example, the California Low Emissions Vehicle program (LEV) relies on advanced emission control technologies, clean gasoline, and an on-board diagnostics system which achieve substantial reductions beyond those which will result from federal cars. As described above, EPA then developed mobile source control strategies such that generally equal, proportional reductions would be achieved in all stationary, area and mobile source categories. EPA developed strategies which, if implemented, would result in cleaner vehicles and engines via further improvements in technology or mobile source users selecting alternatives with lower polluting characteristics. EPA also developed strategies which rely on declining emission limits for other remaining mobile source categories, both to provide sufficient reductions for attainment and to assure that  each category of emission source was contributing to the solution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1990, passenger cars, other highway vehicles, nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines and equipment, and the transportation facilities used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interstate commerce produced from 53 to 63 percent of the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and from 70 to 94  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the total inventory of oxides of nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP areas covered by this proposal. In order to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment of the ozone standard in these areas, EPA is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations which assure significant reductions in mobile source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions_beyond those already expected from the continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turnover to newer, cleaner vehicles and engines. The mobile source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category covers a very broad range of sizes of equipment, types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels, uses and operating modes, and extent of current pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control. Therefore, there is no one measure or even one uniform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of measure which is proposed across the category to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reductions needed for the attainment plans (see section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.1.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ozone attainment responsibility also falls on mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources that may operate on a national (or even an international)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale. Many of these mobile sources have not previously been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled and must now undertake for the first time challenging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution abatement assignments. For example, EPA is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that locomotives and large ships work to reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from their respective activities in the FIP areas (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections III.D.4.e.(3). and (4).). Airline operators, though to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some extent previously regulated for air quality purposes, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be asked to make further emissions reductions from aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other airport activities (see section III.D.4.e.(2).).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, high quality inspection and maintenance (I/M)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs for vehicles remain the single most cost effective and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important measure for achieving mobile source emissions reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the FIPs, EPA is proposing a program which follows closely the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model for meeting the performance standards for all I/M programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide, and which EPA could effectively implement. EPA and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State of California are continuing to hold discussions on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different enhanced program design which would meet the national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced I/M performance standard if implemented by the state. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an agreement is reached, appropriate legislation and regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are adopted, and an approvable SIP revision is submitted, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraw or rescind the FIP I/M program (section III.D.2.c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One reason that vehicle emissions continue to be such a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of total VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions_despite increasingly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent emission standards for vehicles_is because of high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). This VMT increase reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the simple facts that more cars are on the road today than ever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before, and more people are driving more miles than ever before.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to encourage a reduction in VMT, and in the number of cars  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the road, EPA is proposing two programs designed to decrease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth in VMT by targeting single occupant vehicle use. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed measures will require increases in average occupancy in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal vehicles in Sacramento and encourage shifts to carpooling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and public modes of transportation in all the FIP areas (sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.F.2 and III.D.2.g). Various other strategies could be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve decreases in VMT. As discussed below and elsewhere in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's NPRM, EPA resources, and statutory authority have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constrained our ability to propose these possibly more effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In designing these FIPs, EPA has attempted, wherever possible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to structure the proposed FIP rules so that responsible state and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local agencies can adopt the rules as part of their SIPs or accept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA delegation to implement the federal rules (section III.J.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the proposed New Source Review (NSR) regulations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento FIP area tracks the existing rule format and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminology shared by the 5 Sacramento area air pollution control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> districts, rather than following the design of EPA's existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal NSR regulations (section III.F.4.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the emission reduction targets in Sacramento and Ventura  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are formidable, the overwhelming reductions needed for ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment in the South Coast appear to require that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual pollution source within the FIP area eventually abate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its emissions almost completely. For practically every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controllable source category, this ultimate degree of control is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond a level now foreseeable with existing technology and control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress recognized that this unique South Coast attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge required sustained commitment to seek and apply new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological solutions. EPA's proposed FIP employs the special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, which allows for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitments (rather than fully adopted regulations) as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast ozone attainment demonstration. The South Coast FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes these commitments and outlines some of the federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities currently underway to support the development and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercialization of new control technologies or pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevention techniques (see section III.B.5.d.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

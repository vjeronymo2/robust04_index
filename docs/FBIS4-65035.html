			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Currently No Need To Join </F> Partnership for Peace"]    [Excerpt] At present, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky sees no  need to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program. As the  chancellor explained after the cabinet meeting yesterday,  Austria is already practicing this partnership in numerous areas.    Bilateral cooperation agreements in the military sphere  concerning the training of peacekeeping and humanitarian  measures have been concluded with Eastern European states. In  addition, Austria participates in various NATO committees.  Thus, Austria is more advanced in this development than Sweden  and Finland, which have now signed a partnership agreement with  NATO, Vranitzky stated. At present, Austria wants to concentrate  primarily on the referendum and Austrian measures linked to  membership of the European Union [EU]. "In a later phase"  Austria will again deal specifically with this partnership. The  decisions by Sweden and Finland do not force Austria to change  its planned procedure, particularly because both states  explicitly stressed that they are not joining the Alliance,  Vranitzky emphasized. A definite answer cannot yet be given  concerning Austria's participation in a European security  system. The outcome of the 1996 EU intergovernmental  conference, during which basic decision on the structures of a  future security system will be made, must be awaited. Of  course, Austria is basically interested in such a system.    In addition to passing laws, Vranitzky wants to discuss the  adaptation measures for EU membership that are required in  Austria with those that will be affected by them. Thus, next  Monday [16 May] Vranitzky will meet with trade union  representatives of those areas where structural problems are  expected to occur. This will particularly affect the food  sector, the mills, and the sugar industry. Not only financial  support but the safeguarding of jobs will be discussed.</p>

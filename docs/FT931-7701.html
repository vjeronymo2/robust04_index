			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Landlords to picket GrandMet AGM over 'excessive' pub rents LICENSEES of pubs owned by Inntrepreneur Estates, the Grand Metropolitan/Courage joint venture company, will picket GrandMet's annual meeting in London today to protest against 'excessive' rents charged on their long-term leases. Some of the landlords have acquired GrandMet shares so they can carry their protest into the meeting with questions to Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, of the food, drinks and retailing group. Mr Martin Moore, landlord of The Bridge in Uckfield, East Sussex, said yesterday: 'Hundreds of licensees are being pushed towards bankruptcy because of rents and other charges which are just too high for pubs to bear in a recession.' Mrs Trisha Boyce, of Alcombe, Somerset, organised the National Association of Inntrepreneur Licensees to fight the terms of the leases. It is seeking, for example, to challenge some provisions of the agreements in court. She said that her association, formed five months ago, now had more than 800 members. Inntrepreneur, established two years ago in the Pounds 2.36bn pub-for-breweries deal between GrandMet and Courage, owns about 6,850 pubs. The estate is managed by GrandMet and most of its beer is supplied by Courage. GrandMet's policy has been to convert the tenanted pubs in the estate to long-term assignable leases. The group said that 4,700 pubs, about 65 per cent, were now leased. 'The leases are popular,' it said. 'Last year, during some of the worst trading conditions ever, 1,372 were signed.' Government orders required 1,900 pubs to be freed from the exclusive supply contract with Courage last November. This triggered rent reviews. Higher rents were charged to reflect the licensee's freedom to obtain beer supplies from any brewer. But rents were freely negotiated and where disputes arose they could be settled by arbitration, GrandMet said. Those protesting were a very small minority of leaseholders - 'probably less than a hundred'. Inntrepreneur achieved a trading profit of Pounds 162m in 1992, but after interest charges recorded an loss of Pounds 28m. GrandMet said yesterday that Inntrepreneur was trading well and its operations were in line with forecasts. Background, Page 22</p>

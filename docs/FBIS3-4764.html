			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The preparatory  committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of  the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification  (Pomminnyon) in an article contributed to its organ "Materials  of Pomminnyon" called for an extensive struggle to open a new  horizon of reunification.    The article titled "For Setting Correct Orientation of  National Reunification Movement at Present" analysed the world  situation and the tense situation on the Korean peninsula and  said "the situation calls for firmly upholding the banner of  national independence and great national unity".    What is decisive in forcing the way through this situation  is  always the internal factor, the article said, adding:    Under the grave situation as today, the independent forces  of  the whole nation must unite more closely under the banner of  independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity  and thus decisively frustrate the national splittist moves of  the outside forces, the United States and Japan, and make active  efforts to greet the independent reunification in 1995.    Turning to the key points of the reunification movement in  South Korea at present, the article pointed out that they must  be "rejection of the outside forces, the United States and  Japan, implementation of the North-South agreement and  attainment of reunification in the form of confederation." The  outside forces obstructing the implementation of the  inter-Korean agreement must be glaringly exposed, the article  added.    It continued:    The proposal for reunification through confederacy  epitomized  in the words of one nation, one state, two systems and two  governments is the only reunification formula. Efforts to  attain a national agreement on this most reasonable proposal are  an immediate task the fulfilment of which brooks no further  delay.    Clarifying the main tasks of the present national  reunification movement -- "rejection of the outside forces, the  U.S. and Japan, implementation of the inter-Korean agreement  and reunification through confederacy," -- the article called  for redoubled efforts to open a new horizon of reunification.</p>

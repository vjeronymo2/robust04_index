			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Management: No less than rebirth - Companies must do more than just restructure, argues Christopher Lorenz The world's most innovative multinational, 3M, has for years had a target that 25 per cent of its annual revenues must come from products which did not exist five years before. It has just replaced it with an even tougher goal: 30 per cent in four years. As one of the means of achieving this, 3M is sticking steadfastly - despite recession - to its traditional policy of giving staff 15 per cent 'bootlegging time' to work on projects of their own choice. They can go to several alternative sources of internal funding if their own divisions fail to see the potential of the new ventures they create. But this risk is minimised by keeping 3M business units as small and entrepreneurial as possible. Anchored in an unusually creative culture, these and other measures have helped 3M re-invent itself repeatedly over the past 91 years. From its beginnings in abrasives, it has added layer after layer of related skills in order to move into adhesives (from Scotch tape to Post-It notes), chemicals, video tape, computer disks and other products. At the age of 54, Hewlett-Packard has a creative culture almost as developed as 3M's. It reminds staff constantly that it needs to operate 'with the nimbleness of a start-up'. It tends to succeed: over half the value of its orders in 1992 were for products launched since 1991. Motorola performs almost as well. In many ways it is the most impressive of the three. While 3M and HP have sustained their creativity since birth, 73-year-old Motorola has only recently transformed itself into a model of creativity and innovation, in mobile communications and other fields. As recently as the 1970s it was sliding into oblivion, like many companies of its age group. Few mature large companies now in that painful position have much hope of emulating Motorola's rebirth. At best, they may merely delay their decline. This is not for want of trying. Vast numbers of western companies are undergoing drastic change, or about to do so. In the US they include Digital Equipment, General Motors, IBM, Kodak, Sears and Westinghouse. European examples include Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, Siemens and several British banks. But far too many companies are focusing almost exclusively on better management of their existing assets, in the form of 'restructuring' (through downsizing and delayering) and the 're-engineering' of processes such as product development and order fulfilment. These are only two of four overlapping steps necessary for the complete regeneration of a company. The other two, in the jargon of two California-based academics, are 'reinventing strategy' (Gary Hamel) and 'reinventing the organisation' (Richard Pascale). The latter - a very complex undertaking - will be examined in a later article. It amounts to transforming companies from sluggish consensus-machines, like GM and IBM, into what Pascale calls 'engines of inquiry', like 3M, HP or - these days - Motorola. On step three, the 'reinvention' of strategy, a packed audience wastreated by Hamel to a trenchant analysis last month at the annual conference of the Strategic Management Society. Restructuring was necessary, since it made companies smaller, said Hamel. So was re-engineering - it made them better. But without the reinvention of strategy, they would not become different. So far, Westinghouse had become smaller but not better, and Xerox better but not different. By contrast, their main respective rivals, General Electric and Canon, had become better and different. In mathematician's terms, companies were constantly encouraged by investors to improve the efficiency of their current operations and resources - 'to attack the denominator'. They were not being stimulated to 'increase the nominator': to create new products, markets and even industries. As a result 'more and more clusters of unimaginative, denominator-focused competitors are engaged in successive rounds of downsizing,' said Hamel. 'We have an epidemic of corporate anorexia.' Nor was it enough to play catch-up, as the western motor industry is constantly trying to do with the Japanese, and as vast tracts of industry have done in the wake of more innovative western companies over the past 30 years. The only way a company can get ahead is to foresee the next round of competitive advantage and evolution in its industry, and to create it. Hamel continued: 'The biggest rewards ultimately go to companies which transform their industries, change the rules of the game, redraw industry boundaries and establish fundamentally new competitive parameters.' Thus the primary goal must be to become the architect of an industry's transformation - not just once, like Canon, CNN, Intel or Virgin, but repeatedly, like 3M and HP. To do that, as Hamel pointed out, companies have to challenge not just the orthodoxies of the incumbents in an industry, but also their own - which is far harder. It remains to be seen whether Microsoft, Intel and Wal-Mart (in US retailing) are up to the task. Hamel sees three key barriers to 'reinventing strategy': Perceptual: the lack of 'genetic variety' in top teams. Too many come from the same industries, companies, disciplines and cultural backgrounds. This blinds them to new opportunities. Political: the most powerful people are usually those whose knowledge is most out of date. Practical: it is difficult to reinvent strategy in an ill-defined, still emerging industry (such as digital communications) or sub-sector (such as electronic publishing), where existing industry boundaries are shifting. Part of the answer, Hamel suggested, is to concentrate on a set of core competences which will be valuable no matter which way the industry evolves, such as Apple's user-friendliness or Sony's skills in miniaturisation. Then, like Motorola with its ambitious 'Iridium' project for a global, satellite-based cellular communications network, one can have a hand in creating the future. Significantly, that project was the brainchild of a middle manager whose immediate bosses turned it down, but who took it to top management and won their backing. He could easily have worked for 3M. This is the first of several articles on corporate creativity.</p>

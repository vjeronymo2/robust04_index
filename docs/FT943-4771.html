			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach buys two London bus companies Stagecoach Holdings, the acquisitive Perth-based bus operator, has succeeded in buying two of the 10 companies that run London's red buses for Pounds 25.3m in cash. Stagecoach, which was floated on the Stock Exchange in April last year and had originally put in bids for all the London bus companies, said it had acquired East London Bus and Coach Company for Pounds 15.8m and South East London and Kent Bus Company for Pounds 9.5m. In the year to March 31 the two companies had a combined turnover of Pounds 82.7m and posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m. The acquisitions are expected to enhance group earnings in the current financial year as improvements in the operating margins of the new subsidiaries and the benefits of economies of scale are achieved. East London and Selkent, the second and third London bus companies to be privatised, will represent slightly more than a fifth of Stagecoach's expanded turnover and will give Stagecoach a significant presence in the London region which represents about 20 per cent of the UK market. Following the acquisitions the enlarged group will have around 11.5 per cent of the UK bus market. Commenting on the two acquisitions Mr Brian Souter, executive chairman, said: 'In the period since flotation we have set out a clear acquisition strategy designed to provide shareholders with longer-term enhanced earnings. Stagecoach was previously concentrated on provincial operations but we have succeeded this year in building a major presence in large urban areas where we believe our proven operating strategies can succeed equally well.'</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: IT ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER SECOND TIME AROUND  </P> <P> Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, explaining Eddie Murray's sub-par season last year,  said it takes awhile for hitters to adjust to the pitchers in a different  league. Also, he said players tend to try too hard, trying to justify the deal  the club made for them.  </P> <P> "A guy's second year is always better," he said.  </P> <P> Sounds good, but look at the first-year accomplishments of the following  players after switching leagues:  </P> <P>  -- Dick Stuart, Pittsburgh to Boston: In 1963, he hit a career-high 42 home  runs and led the American League in runs batted in with 118.  </P> <P>  -- Frank Robinson, Cincinnati to Baltimore: In 1966, he won the American  League triple crown and led the Orioles to the World Series championship.  </P> <P>  -- Al Oliver, Texas to Montreal: In 1982, he led the National League in  hitting and RBIs.  </P> <P>  -- Dave Kingman, New York Mets to Oakland: In 1984, he had a career-high 118  RBIs.  </P> <P>  -- Kirk Gibson, Detroit to the Dodgers: In 1988, he was the National League  MVP and hit a homer for the ages in the World Series.  </P> <P> And how did they do in their second seasons? Not as well.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Name the members of the all-switch-hitting infield for the Dodgers  in 1965.  </P> <P> Signals over: If you think Morning Briefing sometimes makes bad mistakes, how  about this one: "ALLENTOWN, Pa. AP -- The Associated Press reported erroneously  on April 11 that hummingbirds should be fed four parts sugar to one part water.  The proportion should be reversed."  </P> <P> Add forgettable quotes: According to Tom Verducci of Newsday, after San Diego  swept a series from San Francisco, Mark Parent of the Padres sent this message  to the Giants: "You guys aren't ever going to be competing with us this year.  And pretty soon we'll be sending the same message to the Reds."  </P> <P> Cincinnati took two out of two from San Diego. In the first game, Parent struck  out in the ninth inning with the potential winning runs aboard.  </P> <P> Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: Jack Nicklaus was quoted by Tom Callahan in the  Washington Post as saying: "I remember the first time I broke 70. I was 13,  working in the drugstore with my father. We slipped away to play nine holes  before dinner, and I had 35 on the front nine. I begged him to go on. No, he  said, Mom had dinner cooking. But if we ate fast, and were careful of her  feelings, we could be back in 35 minutes.  </P> <P> "Later, needing an eagle on the last hole for 69, I hit a driver and a 2- or  3-iron, and made a long rainbow putt. I think that's when my father decided I  had a better future as a golfer than as a stock boy."  </P> <P> Same old story: From Phoenix Sun forward Tom Chambers, looking to the NBA  playoffs: "As long as Magic (Johnson) is running the show, the Lakers are the  team to beat for the whole thing. When it comes down to it, who would you  rather have the ball (than him) down the stretch in a big game?"  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Wes Parker, 1b; Jim Lefebvre, 2b; Jim Gilliam, 3b; Maury Wills,  ss.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Chuck Person of the Indiana Pacers, sending a message to the  Philadelphia 76ers: "If we play them in the playoffs, Charles Barkley better  call Michael Jordan and get a box of Wheaties."

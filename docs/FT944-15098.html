			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Two Europeans slain in raid on Algerian oil site Gunmen burst into an oil camp in eastern Algeria on Tuesday night and killed the only two Europeans there, officials and diplomats said yesterday, Reuter reports from Tunis. The deaths of the two men, a Frenchman and an Italian, bring to at least 66 the number of foreigners killed in civil strife between Moslem fundamentalists and the army-dominated authorities. In Rome, the Italian foreign ministry said a Somali was also killed at the camp near Tebessa, operated by Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil company. But in Algiers, an Italian embassy spokesman said he could not confirm this. The two Europeans worked for Schlumberger, a French company, which named the Frenchman as Philippe Hetet, 36, and the Italian as Mauro dell'Angelo, 30. The company said in Paris: 'There were four employees at the site. They were attacked by a group of armed men. Two of the employees were killed.' The first foreigners were killed in September last year, shortly before the fundamentalist Armed Islamic Group (GIA) warned non-Algerians to leave the country or be killed. The GIA, one of several groups battling to overthrow the authorities, sees foreign workers as supporting the government and the economy. Italy's foreign ministry said the attackers burst into one of the oil company's buildings, set fire to it and told the Algerian nationals to flee. They then killed the others. Last week, gunmen shot dead a South Korean businessman near his home in Bordj el-Bahri, about 25km east of Algiers.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Fund managers try to cut risk AS STERLING sank further yesterday, foreign exchange dealers were not the only professionals active in the market. Fund managers and corporate treasurers with exposure to sterling have had a busy couple of days. 'It was a case of trying to minimise the risk in a portfolio,' said Mr Terence Prideaux of Kemper Investment Management, a US investment house. 'Given the size of the currency flows, any prudent investment manager would have had to explore the question of currency exposure.' Another fund manager said: 'You knew, as soon as 15 per cent interest rates were announced, that it wasn't sustainable.' Dealers reported activity from a wide range of fund managers, particularly Swiss and US. While some fund managers moved assets between markets, others tried to hedge currency exposure within their existing portfolios. 'The main focus was hedging currencies against the D-Mark,' said Mr Axel Benkner of DWS, the German fund management group. Corporate treasurers, while still assessing the long-term effects of recent events on their businesses, were also active in moving against potential short-term exposure. 'There has been a fair amount of activity' among corporate treasurers, said Mr Tony Rice, group treasurer at British Aerospace. 'Those of us with dollar exposure have had to sit on our hands for a while.' Even in the spot foreign exchange market - the world's most liquid market - trading became difficult as the margin between buy and sell prices on the dollar-sterling rate, normally 3-10 basis points, hit 50 basis points. Some treasurers decided that discretion was the better part of valour. 'We were reluctant to deal in a disorderly market,' said one corporate treasurer at a UK company. The recent level of volatility pushed prices up, making it uneconomical to hedge using options. Instead, activity has been concentrated in the forward foreign exchange market and even in the spot market, contributing to the pressure on the pound. In spite of tumultuous market conditions, foreign exchange traders found themselves with a one-way bet as the Bank of England proved an unlimited buyer of sterling throughout the day. As the Bank intervened in the market, offering to buy sterling in minimum amounts of Pounds 30m - compared with a normal market size of Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m - it found banks and corporate treasurers willing to sell. 'Every bank around the world had taken a position against sterling,' one broker said.</p>

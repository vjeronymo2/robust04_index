			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Milk row may force Tesco to buy from Continent Tesco, the UK supermarket chain, yesterday threatened to source a significant proportion of the company's dairy products from the Continent if the government does not change plans for opening up the Pounds 3.3bn British milk market that are leading to large increases in price. The threat, made by Tesco's trading director Mr John Gildersleeve, came as Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, rejected calls from the Dairy Trade Federation for a referral of the planned milk market to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents British dairy companies, will apply for a judicial review of the milk market liberalisation on Monday. Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, one of the UK's largest dairy groups, said he was disappointed at Mr Waldegrave's decision. Northern claims market changes could wipe Pounds 15m off its profits this year. Avonmore Foods, the Irish dairy group, made a profits warning yesterday and Unigate has also told the City to expect its results to be affected. Mr Gildersleeve called the deregulation plans 'a retrograde step of the worst order, which is inflationary and leading to price increases of 20 per cent'. He was speaking at the launch of Tesco's Best of British promotion, aimed at encouraging shoppers to buy home-produced goods. The Milk Marketing Board, the government's statutory purchaser of milk in England and Wales, is due to be abolished at the beginning of November when the market is liberalised. It will be replaced by Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative, which has already signed up 65 per cent of supplies. Milk Marque's price auction for allocating supplies to dairies has led to a jump in price of between 10 per cent and 18 per cent for different types of buyers. Mr Gildersleeve said he would have no choice but to buy products from outside the UK, which would reverse much of the government's efforts of recent years in encouraging supermarkets to buy British in a bid to reduce the Pounds 5.6bn food and drink trade gap. Tesco used to buy fromage frais from France, but in the past couple of years had turned to British suppliers, Mr Gildersleeve said. But if there is to be a 20 per cent price increase he said he would be forced to go back to buying from the Continent. Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, DTF president, said imports would flood into the new market. 'For Milk Marque to suggest that its pricing strategy will provide the industry with security and stability in the open market is totally irresponsible,' he said.</p>

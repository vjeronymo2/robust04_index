The project  followed the construction of six bridges along Cambodia's  national Route-5 from Phnom Penh to the border with Thailand.    The federal minister for development cooperation, Gordon  Bilney, said the latest bridge project matches Australian  engineering expertise with Cambodia's development priority. The  bridge rebuilding is part of a nearly $17 million worth of  development projects Australia is funding in Cambodia this year.    Mr. Bilney also announced the $600,000 grant for credit  scheme in Cambodia aimed at helping people at the village level  start small businesses and agricultural schemes.</p>

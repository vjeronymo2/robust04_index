The cash will go the International Fund for Ireland [IFI]  over the next three years, on top of 72 million pounds the EU  [European Union] has provided since 1989.    The IFI was set up by the British and Irish Governments in  1986 to promote reconciliation as well as providing social and  economic aid for the North.    But the latest money from Brussels is being billed as a  special response to the efforts of the two Governments to end  violence.    Commission President Jacques Delors said yesterday's  initiative should be seen as "an expression of practical support  for the peace process in Northern Ireland" in the wake of the  Downing Street Declaration.    The 36 million pounds will be used for projects aimed at  bridging the religious divide.    The Commission emphasised that the 36 million pounds was in  addition to assistance to Northern Ireland already assured under  the EU's regional and social funds.    The IFI is managed by an independent board appointed by the  two Governments. It also receives contributions from America,  Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Reading between the budget lines: Andrew Hill combs the Community draft text for hidden meanings OFFICIAL publication of the EC's new budget plans will begin a new round of that traditional Brussels game, Hunt the Nuance, with industry and competition officials leading the chase. The quarry is the controversial plan to use budget funds to improve industrial competitiveness. The Commission is calling for an annual increase of Ecu3.5bn by 1997 in the amount it spends to help industry adapt to change and increased competition from outside the EC. That money will be channelled through a number of existing programmes: some 40 per cent will be targeted through research and development, 30 per cent through training programmes, and the rest through 'trans-European networks'  -pan-European infrastructure projects in, for example, the telecommunications and transport sectors. In outline, this seems relatively uncontroversial. The direction of research policy will be made more responsive to the demands of industry; social funds will be used not only to cure long-term and youth unemployment, but to prevent it - by retraining workers for new tasks; efficient trans-European networks will help the internal market, and should aid cohesion between the rich north and poor south of the Community as infrastructure is improved. There is even a measure of consensus on this between Brussels' industry and competition camps, often said to be at loggerheads. They agree there are risks inherent in the plan; both sides accept the need for EC research and development programmes to be guided more from the bottom - that is, industry; both say that the developments are an advance for EC industrial policy, although competition officials, unsurprisingly, concede only that the proposals mark a 'half-step' forward. Agreeing an acceptable package has not been easy, however, particularly for Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, who would have opposed the budget had his fellow-commissioners not made amendments at the 11th hour. Summing up his concerns, he said: 'I would never have agreed had I thought it (the budget) could be a vehicle for an intrusive industrial policy designed to pick winners or prop up lame ducks. I'm finally satisfied that it can't be used for that purpose.' In particular, Sir Leon believes he has fought off the possibility of the Ecu3.5bn being earmarked for a separate 'industrial reconversion fund', and has limited the chance that regional funds could be used as instruments of industrial policy. He and his advisers are also pleased that they have preserved the 'horizontal' nature of EC industrial policy, with funds theoretically available across all industrial sectors and the whole Community. The text makes no reference to specific sectors - such as motors textiles, electronics or defence - which might benefit from the extra cash. Sections on research and development will refer to backing specific technologies, rather than industries; the training funds should be available through centres or for specified training programmes. But these may be artificial victories for the competition camp. Senior industry officials claim there was never any intention to set aside a fund, nor to specify the destination of the new money, for example. As with any piece of Commission prose, the key lies in the interpretation of the text, a task which had begun before the budget was agreed. The direction of the debate is unlikely to please the pro-competition lobby. On Monday, Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, pointed out that although specific sectors would not be mentioned in the budget's provisions, it was obvious that certain industries - he singled out cars - could legitimately claim support for retraining workers. He and his senior officials are pleading for more attention to economic reality and slightly less to what they claim are sometimes inflexible competition rules. Advocates of a robust competition policy argue that too much flexibility could encourage laziness. As became clear in Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, will also press for full exploitation of the policy. In spite of his protestations, there are still fears that the richer member states - in particular, France and Italy - will be most expert at lobbying for central support. Industry and competition advocates agree that the debate is far from over. Indeed, it is likely to become even more heated in the coming months, both because the criteria for spending the extra cash have to be thrashed out in Brussels and because the squeals from a recession-hit European industry are probably going to get more strident as the hunters close on their prey.  -------------------------------------------------         THE RISE IN EC SPENDING (Ecu bn)  -------------------------------------------------                     1987   1992   1997 Agriculture         32.7   35.3   39.6 Regional aid         9.1   18.6   29.3 Industry &amp; other     1.9    4.0    6.9 Foreign policy       1.4    3.6    6.3 Administration       5.9    4.0    4.0 Reserves             0.0    1.0    1.4 Total               51.0   66.6   87.5  ------------------------------------------------- Source: European Community  -------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Defence faces successive cuts Lower procurement and employment costs will contribute to reductions in previously published plans of defence spending. Outlays for the next three years will be Pounds 23,490m, Pounds 22,700m and Pounds 22,790m respectively, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announced. This settlement - which implies reductions below earlier plans for the first two years of Pounds 260m and Pounds 520m respectively - will be delivered in part through the planned sale to a private sector housing trust of married quarters for service personnel.</p>

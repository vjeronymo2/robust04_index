			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: KPMG to conduct audit probe on Euro Disney The Euro Disney banks have appointed KPMG, the accountancy and consulting group, to conduct an investigative audit of the troubled leisure company in preparation for the negotiations over its emergency financial restructuring. KPMG in Paris yesterday confirmed that it had been appointed by the steering committee which represents the 60 international banks that hold Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.5bn) net debt. A team of auditors and consultants from KPMG's French subsidiary has already started work on the audit, which is provisionally scheduled for completion in January. The audit has been commissioned by the steering committee, which includes 11 of Euro Disney's banks and is headed by Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Banque Indosuez. It is intended to produce a thorough analysis of Euro Disney's present financial situation and its future capital requirements. The banks last month decided to commission the audit after a meeting in Paris at which representatives of Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, presented their analysis of the Euro Disney's finances. A senior French banker on the steering committee said the banks were keen to commission their own audit because of the 'dramatic nature' of Euro Disney's difficulties. The group, which recently disclosed a FFr5.3bn net loss for the year ended September, has such severe cash-flow problems that it is expected to run out of money by the end of this year and turn to Walt Disney for support. Once the audit is completed the steering committee will begin full scale negotiations with Euro Disney and its US parent. The Disney camp has already said that it hopes the banks will agree to halve Euro Disney's debt to roughly FFr10bn through the combination of a debt-for-equity swap and a rights issue. However, the final composition of the rescue package will be influenced by the impact of Euro Disney's share price on the value of the rights issue. The shares yesterday fell by FFr0.85 to FFr34.55 on concern about an interview with Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chief executive, in Time magazine in which he said that Euro Disney's future viability would be determined by the outcome of the rescue negotiations.</p>

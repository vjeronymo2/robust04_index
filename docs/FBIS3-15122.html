			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Round the Clock Non-Stop" </F> rubric: "Revival of Federal Information Center?"]    [Text] The reorganization of the president's apparatus and  staff is being completed. The way MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS sees  it, today will witness the signing of an edict on the creation  of an Administration for Information Support of the Russian  Federation President's Staff. A likely appointee to the  position of the administration's head is Petr Filippov. (He is  now in charge of the analytical center for socioeconomic policy).    The administration's structure calls for three departments:  a department for work with the press, a department for work  with television, and an analytical department. Some 40 people  will be on the payroll.    Quite possibly, accusations of open propaganda and agitation  will be showered on the future administration. Indeed, it sets  as its goal not just a mechanical transfer of information to the  mass media, but also its analysis and interpretation.    MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has managed to learn that the  immediate plan of the future administration's work includes  summing up and analyzing all information coming from the  regions. Also planned are regular conferences in Moscow of the  heads of regional press services with representatives of the  president.</p>

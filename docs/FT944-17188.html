			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Japanese aftershock A strong undersea earthquake shook northern Japan yesterday, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. It was thought to have been an aftershock from the 8.2-magnitude quake last Tuesday, which killed at least 10 people in the Russian-occupied Kuril Islands, just north of Japan, and caused 228 injuries in northern Japan from broken glass and falling objects. Television reporters speaking from towns in Hokkaido said there were no signs of damage.</p>

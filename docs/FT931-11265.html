			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Holliday gears up for future growth - As the chemicals company approaches its flotation Richard Gourlay looks at its history and prospects THE FLOTATION this March of Holliday Chemical Holdings, the synthetic dyestuffs and speciality chemicals company, has conjured up a memory of the past. With the cost of debt tumbling for companies strong enough to part banks from their cash, equity is becoming an expensive way of raising capital. As a result, a subtle change of attitude towards high gearing may be emerging. After three years in which high debt levels have been as acceptable in the City as smoking before the Queen, gearing  - the financial engineers' best friend  - may be about to stage a come back. Mr Michael Peagram, chairman and chief executive of Holliday, is pondering exactly these issues with his advisers but jokes that he would hate his company to have net cash in the bank. He can only afford the luxury of this debate as he approaches a flotation, which will value the company at about Pounds 140m, because of Holliday's impressive history. Over the five-year period since Mr Peagram, a doctor of Chemistry, led a management buy-out of Holliday Dyes &amp; Chemicals, sales have risen five-fold to an estimated Pounds 100m in 1992. Operating profits over the same period have grown to about Pounds 13.6m, partly as a result of five acquisitions. But Mr Peagram is also at pains to point out that the company has grown organically every year by 10-15 per cent and last year by 20 per cent. This organic growth is the secret to Holliday Chemical's appeal and the reason, City observers say, why Mr Peagram's acquisitive ways are likely to receive a warm welcome among investors. According to Mr David Ingles, chemical analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, the Holliday management has developed a knack not only of spotting and acquiring companies, but running them efficiently and imaginatively. Often these companies have performed noticeably better under Holliday than their previous owners. Examples include the acquisition from Hickson International in 1987 of James Robinson and William Blythe, the metal salts company, bought in 1991 also from Hickson. As the company has grown, Mr Peagram says he has stuck to a strategy of building large shares of niche markets and avoiding direct competition with the major chemical companies. Holliday's transition into quoted life will be facilitated by the fact that Mr Peagram and a number of the group's companies have already been in the public arena. He was managing director of Croda Chemicals Division until 1985 when he took a 25 per cent stake in Holliday Dyes and Chemicals, a loss-making company with sales of Pounds 8m. Two years later, Peagram led a management buy-out of Holliday backed by institutions including 3i. The transaction left Mr Peagram with a 28 per cent stake. This stake is likely to be reduced to approximately 20 per cent. The flotation should raise about Pounds 60m, half of which will go to the existing investors; some Pounds 30m would be used to substantially reduce debt to about Pounds 19m, against equity of about Pounds 41m. This is where the debate begins over the shape of Holliday's balance sheet. Raising about Pounds 60m would lead to relatively high gearing - about 50 per cent. Mr Peagram says this is not high when viewed in the light of the nine times interest cover. However comfortable the market might be with this level of debt  - and it does still focus on balance sheet gearing, not just interest cover - Holliday could face problems with further expansion. Mr Peagram has said he is not interested in acquisitions smaller than about Pounds 10m. But if Holliday paid Pounds 20m for a company, and took a goodwill write-off equal to about Pounds 10m, gearing could easily rise above 100 per cent. Mr Peagram says he is aware of this problem. Holliday's balance sheet is already weakened by write-offs taken at the time of earlier acquisitions, he says. If he wanted to make such an acquisition, he would have to convince the City he was telling a good story. The solution of raising more money at flotation, however, goes against the grain with Mr Peagram. That said, Holliday does not anticipate making any acquisitions imminently. 'There is not a lot that we are not able to do now,' says Mr Peagram. 'We probably will raise more at various times but there is no acquisition contemplated.' He says that even if he was so-minded, an acquisition would not be physically possible until the back end of the third quarter because the flotation has taken up so much time. Mr Peagram is also aware that some City observers will compare Holliday with another speciality chemicals company that grew rapidly through acquisition but fell heavily from grace last year  - MTM. While MTM's problem stemmed from the fact that large amounts of profit were an illusion, Mr Peagram is well prepared to highlight other differences. He says he likes to sleep at night and has adopted very conservative accounting policies; among the techniques MTM employed was the capitalisation of project development costs. He would be reluctant to sell any of his companies; the MTM stable was forever changing. Holliday's board is relatively unchanged; at MTM, board seats changed frequently. And Richard Lines, MTM's founder and chairman, had a very clear objective, says Mr Peagram: 'He wanted to have a billion dollar turnover.' Mr Peagram says his objectives are altogether more modest  - just as long as he is not forced to head a company that has no debt.</p>

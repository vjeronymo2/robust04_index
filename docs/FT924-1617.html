			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Political Notebook: No place for heroism FOR the Conservative MPs leaving Westminster today, it is enough to have survived. The events of the past few months have left them nothing to celebrate. But they can feel relief that a government that for several weeks was on the verge of disintegration has recovered a semblance of poise. Labour has little reason for cheer. As Mr John Major has floundered, Mr John Smith has failed to sound a distinctive voice above the Tories' disarray. If the voters have despaired of the government, they have yet to embrace Mr Smith's ill-defined alternative. Government and opposition are at one that the political mood in the new year will be shaped by the economy. Ministers believe that this time the green shoots are taking root. They are probably right. But the upturn will be painfully slow, weakened by the debt overhang in the housing market, further hefty rises in unemployment, and a gloomy international environment. By the time the recovery takes hold, inflation may again be a problem. Sterling's devaluation has already shown up in a sharp rise in import costs. So Mr Smith will have a target to shoot at. The tortuous passage of the Maastricht legislation will make his task easier. Mr Major can be confident that the bill eventually will be passed (assuming Yes in the second Danish referendum) but the process will be debilitating and distracting. Wiser minds at Westminster believe both leaders face precisely the same problem. The prime minister lacks a programme for government. The Labour leader has yet to construct a platform for opposition. To take Mr Smith first. His aides offer a half-convincing rebuttal of charges of inaction. He has not used the past few months to draw up a detailed blueprint for a general election still four years away. One of Labour's mistakes last time was to commit itself to an elaborate set of policies too early. It fought the April election on a tax policy that might have been saleable in an economic boom but proved fatal during a recession. But as Mr Roy Hattersley put it in a speech to the parliamentary press gallery yesterday, assaults on the government are an enormously enjoyable but equally inadequate raison d'etre for the main opposition party. Labour must convince the voters that it stands for an exciting alternative. If Labour is not the party of modernism, it is nothing. Mr Smith has not been idle. The launch today of his Social Justice Commission may provide the backdrop for a radical rethink of the social policies which have left Labour tagged as the party of lost causes. Early in the new year, the leadership will have the conclusions of the Plant Committee on electoral reform and of the working group examining institutional links with the trades unions. But there is a lacuna. Labour lacks an identity. Mr Neil Kinnock told the voters what it no longer stood for. Mr Smith's caution - particularly over breaking the links with the unions - has left them uncertain about what replaces the discarded ideological baggage. He needs also to learn another lesson of the 1992 election - that the electorate needs time to get used to Labour's alternatives. They must not be surprised or frightened by them during the election campaign. So on to Mr Major. He has always been an arch-pragmatist, a manager rather than an ideologue. Success at the Edinburgh summit has given a much-needed boost to his confidence. But the disintegration of its economic strategy has left the government's policies without a binding thread. No longer can Mr Major see his place in history as the prime minister who eradicated inflation. Like Labour, the Conservatives have plenty of ideas for new year policy launches. A burst of deregulation, additional bricks for its newly emerging industrial strategy, and a series of training and education initiatives are among them. But after two years, Mr Major has still to give definition to his government. It is not so much the absence of any particular policy that might be dubbed the 'big idea'. More a sense - among Conservatives as well as observers - that the government has yet to find a replacement for the discarded ideological certainties of the 1980s. Many at Westminster think there are greater forces at work. In their different ways, Margaret Thatcher and Neil Kinnock were heroic political leaders. She changed the political landscape. He dragged his party kicking and screaming on to the new ground. But the last two years have extinguished that brief flicker of hope during the late 1980s that Britain might yet recover some of its past greatness. Perhaps Mr Major and Mr Smith are proof that there is no longer a market for heroism in British politics.</p>

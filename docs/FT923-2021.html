			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Food and Wine: Luxury in the old style - Grand Hotels In the first of a series on the world's great hotels, Nicholas Lander enjoys the old-fashioned opulence of the Crillon in Paris. There, with the city at his fingertips, he tries hard not to feel the pinch THE PROSPECT of spending a weekend at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris was beginning to interfere with my work. I wrote the hotel's name and address down on a piece of paper and put it on the corner of my desk, only allowing myself to look at it after a good day at the word processor. I had mentioned where we were staying to the Frenchwoman responsible for the export of French food and wine to the UK. Far too sophisticated to say 'Ooh la la]' she nevertheless offered me some good advice. 'Pinch yourself while you are there, just to make sure it is happening to you.' But before turning to this very particular hotel's charms, let me begin with one or two negatives. Do not think of going to stay at the Crillon if you want to do some laps in the pool, burn off the calories on a jogging track or in a gymnasium. Such American-isms do not exist at the Crillon. Nor is the Crillon for you if when you enter your bedroom you like to fling your hat and watch it disappear into a far distant corner of the bedroom. Their bedrooms and suites are extremely comfortable but constructed on the archi- tectural principles of 18th century Paris rather than 20th century Houston. Instead, go and stay in the Crillon for what it has offered since it was transformed in 1909 from a private house belonging to the Crillon family into an hotel for the paying public - its location, its interior and the comfort and charm it exudes. And, if you do not stay, do eat in the restaurant, Les Ambassadeurs, where the combination of a stunning dining room and the youthful partnership of General Manager, Herve Houdre, 34, and chef Christian Constant, 38, can produce a most memorable meal. The Crillon, on the north of the Place de la Concorde, looks out on to a magnificent slice of Parisian life. To the west is the Eiffel Tower, due south the National Assembly, and the Obelisk of Luxor behind which you can see the bateaux mouches plying along the Seine. To the east the Tuileries and beyond the Musee d'Orsay and Notre- Dame. Paris, it seems is at your fingertips even if, when you are in the Place de la Concorde, you realise that you have to share it with countless others. The entrance and interior of the Crillon are equally impressive. In the late 18th century when the Crillon was finally finished much greater emphasis was given to the large public rooms, which were to impress by their size and splendour, than to the bedrooms, reserved for more private conquests. Today the mirrors, brass and marble brilliantly reflect the light from a string of chandeliers while a log burning fire adds a homely touch and smells more redolent of the French countryside. Les Ambassadeurs is immediately on your right as you walk in. On our first night it looked impressive and romantic with tall white candles burning on each table; it was as dignified for breakfast on the Sunday morning in spite of the highly polished bowl of All-Bran occupying pride of place on the central buffet table. Michelin gives the restaurant two stars, the highest rating of any hotel dining room in Paris. What is particularly exciting about the food is the confidence Christian Constant, the chef, shows in searching for, and finding, new and adventurous combinations of foods and flavours. A crustacean lasagne with lobster butter that even looked perfect; a circular arrangement that mixed slices of firm, young potato, lobster and chives. A thick piece of cod topped with thin slices of chorizo, the spicy Spanish sausage, on a puree of flageolets and a fillet of sea bass with cous-cous, all showed a sureness of touch and a sense of style. With the desserts Constant's team show the same flair and an eagerness to experiment with geometrical forms. There were minor quibbles - the service was not faultless and the wine list in the restaurant not quite as exciting as the food - but the overall impression the Crillon emanates is one of magnificent luxury. Some time after our return we still pinch ourselves just to remind ourselves that we did stay there. Hotel de Crillon, 10 Place de la Concorde, 75008 Paris. Tel: 44-71-15-25. Fax 44-71-15-04. Double room from FFr2,900 (Pounds 305) a night.</p>

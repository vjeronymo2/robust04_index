			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Engineering companies freeze pay MORE THAN half of pay deals reported so far this year by large engineering companies in the Sheffield area have involved a wage freeze. In addition, only one fifth of agreements involve increases above 3 per cent. The figures, collected by the Sheffield association of the Engineering Employers Federation, cover 50 deals. One company negotiated a 10 per cent pay cut in order to survive, 27 agreed a standstill and three settled for under 2 per cent. Another 10 deals resulted in rises of between 2 and 3 per cent, six between 3 and 4 per cent and the remainder between 4 and 5 per cent. Even though an upturn is being more widely reported by companies, most capacity is under-used and some companies are on short-time working. Smaller businesses are also showing pay restraint. Haines Watts, an accountancy firm specialising in small and medium-sized businesses in the Leeds-Bradford area, yesterday said a survey of its clients showed that half of them were either freezing pay or settling below 2 per cent. None of the small and medium-sized businesses expects pay to rise above 5 per cent this year, although 59 per cent expect turnover increases above this level and 73 per cent forecast higher profits. Most anticipate using the extra resources generated for investment. The government has been criticised by the International Labour Organisation in Geneva for its lack of consultation with trade unions over employment policy. In a report which will be submitted to the organisation's annual conference in June, its Committee of Experts says it 'remains deeply concerned at the serious difficulties in establishing the tripartite consultations on employment policy measures' required by the ILO convention ratified by Britain in 1966. The committee insists that although 'the results of the consultations are not binding on the government', it is 'obliged to ensure that tripartite consultations are effective'. The report also requests the government to consider amending the 1988 Employment Act that prevents unions from disciplining members who refuse to take part in lawful strikes and other industrial action, or who seek to persuade fellow members to refuse to participate in such action. The committee says it considers that these provisions remove the right of unions to express their dissatisfaction with such members. On the contentious issue of the banning of unions at the government's GCHQ communications centre in Cheltenham in 1984, the report says it 'firmly hopes high-level talks will lead to a positive outcome'. The government has told the ILO that it is ready to consider any proposal compatible with the safeguarding of security at GCHQ that would not risk disruption through 'conflicts of interest' among the staff.</p>

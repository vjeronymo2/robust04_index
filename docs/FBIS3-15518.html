He said in an interview  with Interfax on Saturday that the president's chair will be  under siege. According to Dudayev, it will be difficult for the  Russian president to keep his post in the context of such a  situation.    "The scenario also provides for temporary neutralization of  Viktor Chernomyrdin with his further discrediting and pushing  out of the political life," the Chechen president added. He  said this proved that the government led by Chernomyrdin had  been subjected to unfair criticism from the very first days of  its work. According to Dudayev, only this government could  withdraw the Russian economy from the crisis.    He said the position of former Prosecutor General Aleksey  Kazannik was that of a very honest courageous man who realized  that all perspectives would be in vain if once to compromise and  to sacrifice the lawfulness.</p>

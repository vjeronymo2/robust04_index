			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ugur Akinci: "Dual Containment and Turkey"] </F>   [Text] One of the central tenets of the Clinton  administration's Middle East policy is the "dual containment" of  Iraq and Iran. The idea of containment itself is, of course,  nothing new. First proposed by George F. Kennan back in 1947 --  then U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union -- in a Foreign Affairs  article he wrote under the pseudonym "Mr. X" ("The Sources of  Soviet Conduct"), the concept of "containment" was originally  meant to restrain, isolate and ultimately weaken the Soviet  Union through constant political and economic pressures.  Containment, for the following 47 years, remained the backbone  of U.S. foreign policy vis-a-vis the Communist Bloc, all the way  down to the Reagan administration. The dissolution of the USSR  in 1989 is regarded by some as the ultimate victory of the  containment policy. There are many in the conservative camp who  believe that the tight military containment forced upon the  Soviet Union by Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)  program was the straw that broke Moscow's back. But a recent  study by Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein published in  The Atlantic Monthly (February 1994) suggests otherwise. The  authors claim that the Soviet Union's defense budget did not  rise or fall in response to U.S. military spending in the 1980s.  They think Gorbachev decided to throw in the towel despite the  Reagan buildup and SDI. Thus, further research seems to be  needed to ascertain empirically if containment indeed was the  prime reason why the USSR collapsed, i.e. if containment really  worked.  <H5>  Containment Is Out, Dual Containment Is In </H5>   "Partnership for Peace" has now replaced containment in  dealing with the new Russian Federation, but the policy of  containment has reemerged in a new policy area -- the Middle  East. As first formulated on May 18, 1993 by Martin Indyk, the  special assistant to President Clinton for Near East and South  Asian Affairs, in a speech he gave at the Washington Institute  for Near East Policy, "dual containment" envisions the  containment of Iran and Iraq simultaneously to secure the chief  U.S. national interest in the Gulf -- i.e. free flow of oil at a  reasonable and stable price.    One can argue that dual containment is not new either. Ten  years of war between Iran and Iraq crippled both countries  simultaneously. And by selling arms to both sides, the United  States helped Iran and Iraq, in effect, contain each other.    Yet, what was a de facto dual containment did not become an  overt U.S. policy until Iran and Iraq pushed the pause button in  their war of attrition and turned their lethal attention onto  their neighbors. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs  (March/April 1994), Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national  security advisor, gave the concept his official blessings by  presenting it as the only realistic way of coping with such  "backlash states" as North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Libya.    "The basic purpose (of dual containment) is to counter the  hostility of both Baghdad and Tehran," Lake says. "In Saddam  Husayn's regime, Washington faces an aggressive, modernist,  secular avarice; in Iran, it is challenged by a theocratic  regime with a sense of cultural and political destiny and  abiding antagonism toward the United States.... (Iran) is the  foremost sponsor of terrorism and assassination worldwide....  The most effective message (to Iran) is a consistent one: No  normal relations until these actions end."    Yet dual containment has its own internal contradictions.  First of all, as pointed out by Professor F. Gregory Gause III  of Columbia University, the United States paradoxically needs  Iran's help to contain Iraq and Iraq's help to contain Iran.  The Shiite opposition groups in Iraq, like al-Da'wah, are  Iranian time-bombs that can go off if Iraq gets too weak. So  Iraq cannot be "over contained." But, again, if the power  balance gets tilted too much against Tehran, then radical  factions like Hezbollah would get a blank check for stepping up  terrorist activities and would damage the substantial business  interests the U.S. oil and aircraft companies (e.g. Boeing) have  in Iran.    The second weak point of this line of thinking, as Indyk  himself also recognizes, is the fact that dual containment --  just like the anti-USSR containment -- has to be "multilateral"  in nature. The support of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states is crucial yet  problematic. GCC states like Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, for  example, insist that Iraq's territorial integrity must be  protected at all costs because an unchecked Iran is as great a  threat for the Arab monarchies as Saddam's tanks.    Turkey, in this regard, occupies a curious position on the  U.S. State Department's chessboard. Turkey by now made it  abundantly clear that it does not want to contribute to the  containment of Iraq because the U.N. embargo hurts Ankara more  than it does Baghdad.    Both Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister  Murat Karayalcin in their recent visits to Washington made it  clear that, if it were up to Turkey, it would be back to  business as usual with Iraq, and that is, of course, not the  best way to contain anybody.    The recent warm overtures made by Iran to Turkey, as  reported  in the TURKISH DAILY NEWS by Adnan Caglayan, also makes it clear  that if the United States wants to contain Iran, seeking  Ankara's voluntary cooperation is probably not the most  efficient way to attain it since, for Ankara, stopping the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is much more vital an issue than  making sure Tehran or Baghdad never get nuclear weapons -- an  American concern.    In this context, it is curious that the party that  contributes to the containment of both Iraq and Iran by  jeopardizing their ties with Turkey is the PKK, which the United  States officially labeled a terrorist organization.    The oil pipeline between Iraq and Turkey that Ciller wants  to  keep open, for example, has been sabotaged three times within  the last six months by the PKK. By turning the buffer border  zones between Turkey, Iran and Iraq into an uninhabitable  no-man's-land, the PKK inadvertently created the conditions of  isolation that contribute to the containment of both Iraq and  Iran. One can argue that by evacuating over 700 villages in the  Southeast, the Turkish security forces contributed indirectly to  the dual containment of Iran and Iraq as well.    Washington's "take-no-prisoners" approach toward Baghdad and  Tehran precludes Turkey from developing normal ties with Iraq  and Iran. Turkey, spending 6 percent of its Gross National  Product to combat the PKK (according to official figures), is  not in a position to champion dual containment by hardening its  already-fragile relations with Iran and Iraq. But the United  States can probably do better, especially in the case of Iran.    By normalizing its trade relations with Vietnam, and  continuing to treat China as a Most Favored Nation despite  China's embarrassing human rights record, the United States has  already shown that it can be quite pragmatic when it wants to in  its dealings with adversarial nations.    Showing that sort of flexibility will free Turkey's policy  planners to go ahead with normalizing their relations with both  Iran and Iraq. Otherwise, the PKK will continue to be  Washington's best friend in the region, creating an increasingly  volatile southeastern buffer area that will end up "containing"  Turkey more than it does Iran or Iraq.</p>

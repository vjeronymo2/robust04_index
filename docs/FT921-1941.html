			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Markets: Should we contemplate a triple whammy? - The Election and You / Labour and privatised stocks 'WHAT we're saying to people with water shares is that they will be bought, when the time comes, at their proper value.' Roy Hattersley. BBC Radio 4, March 18. 'No we won't. The public control that we want is to ensure (the utilities') high standard of security of supply and safety of supply.' Neil Kinnock. ITN News, March 18. PERHAPS not surprisingly, these are worrying times for shareholders in the privatised water and electricity companies. Even without Labour's apparent policy confusion, evidenced above by quotes on the same day, the shares have tumbled as the stock market comes to grips with the possibility of a Kinnock victory. But what are the risks for shareholders in the utilities and should these shares now be sold? The answer, according to the experts, is probably not. Although there will be violent short-term gyrations in sympathy with the polls, long-term investors who have not yet got out should sit tight. Nigel Burton, who researches utilities for stockbroker SG Warburg, said: 'It would be silly to sell them now. They've gone down too far and, even if Labour wins, they still offer good value and they've still got good dividend growth'. Peter Hyde, water specialist at Kleinwort Benson, added: 'If you're petrified about a Labour victory and you're a short termist, you should sell. But over the longer term, I don't see much problem holding on to them.' Labour has steadily toned down its policies towards the utilities, even in the last six months. Talk of re-nationalising BT or British Gas has long gone, and the two sectors Labour remains committed to restructure are the electricity industry, sold off in 1990, and the water companies. Nevertheless, the stock market is worried for three reasons, a possible 'triple whammy'. A Labour government might re-nationalise the water and electricity companies, possibly paying too little for the shares. Labour will insist on tougher regulation and tighter price controls. This would mean lower profits for all the utilities, not just water and electricity. 'The dash for gas'. Labour says it is determined to protect Britain's coal industry and is opposed to coal imports and gas-fired power stations which are now being built. Although Labour would be good for miners, its policies could push up costs for the electricity companies, depressing profits. Labour's manifesto, published this week, pledged to restore 'public control' of the National Grid, which is owned by the regional electricity companies. The provision of water, the party said, is 'so fundamental it is a priority for return to public control.' But public control is not public ownership. Even if Hattersley wants to, Labour may not be able to afford to buy back the water companies. Buying back effective control, 51 per cent, of the 10 water companies would cost about Pounds 4bn at today's prices. But the new government would then have to pay its share of the water companies' Pounds 28bn capital investment programme. Given Labour's other spending plans, and high borrowings it would inherit from the Tories, the markets believe Labour's occasional threats to re-nationalise are merely symbolic gestures. Labour's public control will probably be achieved through tougher regulation. Frank Dobson, Labour's energy secretary, has been attacking electricity companies and its regulator all year. He says prices and profits are rising too quickly. Labour has also criticised directors' salaries. Labour has not yet decided how to tackle these issues. If the party wins, it will likely start a review of utilities' pricing and regulation. It is committed to forcing electricity companies to become more energy efficient, which usually means more spending and lower profits in the short term. Any review would be bad for utilities' share prices, especially because it would create uncertainty. Some analysts expect a 10 per cent fall in water stocks if Labour wins. But others say the fears are overdone. According to this view, the Tories have already toughened up on the utilities. For example, John Wakeham, energy minister, has been trying to keep politically sensitive electricity prices down ahead of the poll. Either way, the longer term impact of any regulatory changes may not be as damaging as the market's pessimists expect. The water companies, for example, are expected to lift dividends by 4-6 per cent this year, in real terms. Modest regulatory tinkering by Labour could still leave dividends rising faster than inflation. The irony, of course, is that electricity and water flotations were partly designed to create stable, if unspectacular, shareholdings. With three weeks to go to the election, and opinion polls rather than prudence driving the market, these shares have been turned into high risk, high reward stocks. But only very rich speculators should buy now in hope of a Conservative victory.</p>

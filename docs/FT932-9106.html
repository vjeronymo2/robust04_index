			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Lecturers' union scorns threat to national talks NATIONAL PAY negotiations for lecturers in further education colleges were called into question yesterday. The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (Natfhe) is balloting its members on a possible one-day strike in protest against proposed new contracts which could involve longer working hours and shorter holidays. The ballot will be completed on Monday, and a strike could follow on May 20. But Mr Roger Ward, chief negotiator for the College Employers' Forum, which was set up to negotiate on behalf of college principals, said yesterday: 'I want to emphasise that we are not refusing to negotiate. A growing public debate is taking place about the future of national bargaining, but we cannot formally do anything about that until after May 20.' Natfhe has been offered a national negotiating agreement but has not yet signed it. A strike might persuade employers to attempt negotiations on a local basis. Mr Geoff Woolf, Natfhe general secretary, described that suggestion as an 'empty threat'. He said: 'It's in both sides' interests to have national negotiations. The vast majority of principals want some things dealt with at a national level.' He said that Natfhe's national executive committee would endorse the national agreement on Friday. The dispute arises from the attempted introduction of new contracts following the transfer of the colleges from local education authorities to become bodies directly funded by the government. The employers' forum wants to replace the 'Silver Book' agreement which has governed contracts for lecturers in the sector for the past two decades. Mr Woolf said any Natfhe action would be 'a strike against their intention to worsen our conditions'.</p>

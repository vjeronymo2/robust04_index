			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Wessex ahead 9% and sees scope for further cost cutting Wessex Water drew the industry interim reporting season to a close yesterday with a 9 per cent increase in profits and 10 per cent dividend rise. The pre-tax return improved from Pounds 53.4m to Pounds 58.2m for the six months to September 30 on sales 5 per cent ahead to Pounds 114.1m. Mr Nick Hood, chairman, said the profits performance reflected tight control of operating costs through job losses and initiatives such as abolishing company cars for all employees, including the board. Operating expenses in the core utility business fell by 4 per cent, leaving Wessex with its lowest costs in three years. The regulated businesses returned operating profits 11 per cent ahead to Pounds 52.9m. The interim dividend is increased from 4p to 4.4p, on earnings 5 per cent ahead to 20.1p. Mr Hood said he was confident there was plenty of scope to improve earnings through further cost-cutting. This would allow Wessex to sustain dividend increases above the rate of inflation. Mr Hood warned, however, that political interference, such as increasing regulation or windfall taxes, in the regime established by the industry regulator could damage the incentives water companies have to improve services and earnings. 'If we are interfered with, we could be damaged and the person who would suffer at the end of the day is the customer,' Mr Hood said. Wessex' share of profits from Wessex Waste Management, the joint venture with Waste Management Industries, increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 4.6m. Most of the improvement was due to acquisitions, although prices were increased by about 3 per cent. Mr Hood said he was confident the waste business would move forward. 'Each month that passes confirms my belief that we made the right choice in our diversification.' The market was not convinced, however. Wessex shares fell from 289p to 282p after the results, reflecting some disappointment with the non-regulated business. 'The results were OK,' said one analyst, 'but it did not look as though the waste business was really motoring'. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 117m and a total dividend of 13.2p this year, giving a yield of just below 6 per cent, leaving the shares looking fairly valued at present.</p>

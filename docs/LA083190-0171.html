			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> RUSSIAN ART OF 1800S TO TOUR  </P> <P> The first collection of 19th-Century Russian paintings to be exhibited outside  the Soviet Union will be displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art starting in  October, museum officials said.  </P> <P> "This exhibition will forever change our idea of Russia and our idea of  19th-Century art," said Richard Brettel, museum director. "These are sweeping  masterpieces, some better than anything done by the American or French  Impressionists."  </P> <P> The exhibition, which will be displayed in Dallas through December and then in  Omaha, includes 98 paintings culled from several museums across the Soviet  Union. Gordon Dee Smith, president of a Texas-based nonprofit group called  Inter Cultura, which fosters international cultural dialogue, said the  exhibition "will stun art experts."  </P></p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Fimbra plan on home bonds A PROCEDURE to help people in financial difficulties after taking on investment bond home income schemes - designed for elderly people to borrow against the value of their homes while continuing to live in them - to register complaints was announced by the Securities and Investments Board yesterday, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. People who invested in such schemes on the recommendation of members of Fimbra, the regulatory body for independent financial advisers, will be able to take complaints direct to Fimbra. Previously, related complaints - for example, about the insurance company whose bond was sold or the solicitor dealing with the mortgage documents - would have gone to separate regulatory organisations. In the simplest home income plans, the house is remortgaged to buy an annuity which pays an income until death. The capital is kept by the insurance company when the owner dies. There have been few problems with these plans. Investment bond schemes are much riskier. The homeowner invests in an insurance bond, the value of which can fluctuate with the market. The value of some such bonds fell at the same time as interest rates rose and house prices dropped - creating substantial losses for the investor. Many pensioners were sold these policies, even though they were virtually banned by the regulators, which have encouraged victims to report those selling them. Investors losing money as a result of unsuitable advice from a Fimbra member are entitled to compensation under the Investors Compensation Scheme as long as the advice was given on or after August 28 1988, when the scheme came into existence.</p>

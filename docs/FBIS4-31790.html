			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 10 (CTK) -- New National Property Fund  (FNM) Chairman Roman Ceska today said he considered his most  important task to be the stabilisation of the "unbearable"  situation in the fund. He told CTK he did not think that his  appointment could jeopardise the fund's activity. "I do not  believe that people will leave the fund due to my appointment,"  he said, adding that his primary task will be to put an end to  long-lasting feelings of uncertainty among the fund's employees.    In his opinion, an FNM chairman should devote all his time  to  management, not politics. He described his predecessor Tomas  Jezek as a "remarkable political figure."    Ceska was born in Plzen, western Bohemia, on January 29,  1964. After finishing studies at a grammar school in Plzen he  left for Prague where he graduated from the Prague School of  Economics. He started working in the Czechoslovak Academy of  Sciences Economic Institute in 1990, and when the Privatisation  Ministry was created he became an advisor to then minister Tomas  Jezek. After the parliamentary elections in 1992 Ceska was  appointed deputy privatisation minister.</p>

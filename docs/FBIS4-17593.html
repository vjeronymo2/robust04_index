			<p>BFN     [Text] In Sevastopol the Russian and Ukrainian negotiating  teams have agreed, according to the commander-in-chief of the  Russian Navy Felix Gromov, that 100 of the Black Sea Fleet's 143  war ships will belong to Russia and the remaining 43 to Ukraine.    The negotiating teams led by Defense Ministers Pavel Grachev  and Vitaliy Radetskyy, met on April 21 and 22. It was agreed,  in principle, that Ukraine would own 164 vessels, or 18.3  percent, of the Fleet, and Russia -- the remaining 669 of the  Fleet's 833 ships and support boats.    In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX Gromov said the  vessels' age, cost and class were taken into consideration. On  its own suggestion Ukraine would have more ships than previously  planned (more than 18.3 pct of the Fleet's total strength) but  its ships would be of a lower class, whereas Russia would have  more first and second class vessels -- destroyers and large  antisubmarine boats.    The antisubmarine cruiser Moskva with the deadweight of  18,000 tonnes, is the Fleet's biggest ship. It is to belong to  Russia. The biggest ship Ukraine is to have, is Getman  Sagaidachni with the deadweight of some 4,500 tonnes.    Gromov said that under the Yeltsin-Kravchuk Massandra  agreement the Fleet's aircraft are to belong to Russia.</p>

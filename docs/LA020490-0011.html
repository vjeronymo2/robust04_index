			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLUE LINE TO PUT RAIL SERVICE BACK ON TRACK;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: THREE DECADES AFTER THE RED CARS STOPPED RUNNING, THE LONG  BEACH-TO-L.A. LINE WILL BE ROLLING BY JULY 16.  </P> <P> Three decades after the Big Red Car trolleys were put out of business by autos,  buses and Southern California freeways, Los Angeles transit officials later  this year will start operating a new rail line in an effort to help unsnarl  traffic congestion and avoid gridlock.  </P> <P> The tracks, rail yards and shops are built, the overhead power wires are hot,  and the first of the big blue-and-white passenger cars are being tested on  short stretches of the 22-mile, $871-million Long Beach-Los Angeles Light Rail  Line.  </P> <P> Trains will officially start running between the two cities July 16. The fare  will be $1.10 one way, and the trains will run every 10 minutes, carrying an  estimated 20,000 riders a day, if all goes as planned.  </P> <P> Not since 1961 has Los Angeles had a commuter rail system. That was the year  the Pacific Electric Co. shut down the last of the Big Red Cars that once  trundled along 1,100 miles of track, linking places like San Bernardino to Los  Angeles and the beach cities.  </P> <P> Officially, the new route will be called the Blue Line and will be the first  operational system in a proposed $5-billion, 150-mile commuter rail network  planned for Los Angeles County. The second leg of this network -- the  $3.4-billion Metro Rail subway -- will be called the Red Line and will run  north from Union Station to the San Fernando Valley sometime in the late 1990s.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is the planning and funding  authority for the ambitious return to commuter rail and is building the Blue  Line. The Southern California Rapid Transit District is building the first leg  of the 17-mile Metro Rail subway and will operate all of the trains in the  network, including the Blue Line.  </P> <P> The commission is paying the RTD $10 million to start up and run the Blue Line.  In addition, the commission estimates operation and maintenance costs will run  $20 million a year, financed by fares and local transit-tax dollars.  </P> <P> Officials report that construction of the Blue Line is more than 90% complete,  5% over budget and, for the most part, on schedule. However, there are a couple  of hang-ups:  </P> <P> * Temporarily, the line will end at Pico Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles  instead of going underground into the Blue Line terminal in the Metro Rail  station at 7th and Flower streets. Work on the underground station by the RTD  is reported to be a year behind schedule.  </P> <P> * On the south end, work on the three-mile loop through Long Beach -- and the  last four of the route's 22 stations -- will not be completed until fall. So  the line will temporarily end at Anaheim Street, officials said.  </P> <P> And there are still some serious problems to be ironed out between the  commission and the RTD over who will be in charge of both passenger security  and fighting the war against graffiti, once the trains start running. Each  agency claims it is better suited for those tasks.  </P> <P> While the commission has been building the rail line, it has handled security.  The RTD is scheduled to take over the Blue Line in May, when it will begin  full-scale operational tests. However, it has not been decided whether the RTD  will police the line with its own forces or will have help from the commission.  </P> <P> The Blue Line runs through some of the poorest neighborhoods in the city,  crossing through turf claimed by drug-dealing gangs. Because of this, officials  from both agencies agree that special efforts are needed to keep the line  graffiti-free and safe for the thousands of passengers they hope to attract.  </P> <P> Problems with spray-can-wielding vandals began even before the cement had dried  on many of the stations along the route through South-Central Los Angeles. And,  officials said, thieves were stealing construction materials and doing an  estimated $350,000 damage.  </P> <P> "Security is a big problem," said Ed McSpedon of the Rail Construct Corp., the  commission subsidiary in charge of construction. The commission has budgeted $1  million for graffiti control and contracted with the Los Angeles County sheriff  to police the right of way. It wants the sheriff to continue as the primary law  enforcement agency after trains start rolling, McSpedon said.  </P> <P> The commission hired crews to clean off the gang marks, stepped up law  enforcement and adopted the successful anti-graffiti policies used by the New  York and Washington transit systems. In those cities, no trains are allowed to  run with any graffiti on the cars.  </P> <P> "We want to leave no doubt in the public's mind about their security and safety  on this system," McSpedon said.  </P> <P> RTD officials echo the same thoughts, but they say they need no help to keep  the situation under control. The district is beefing up its 69-member transit  police force to take over security. RTD officials dividing the authority with  the sheriff would only cause problems.  </P> <P> "We simply cannot expect to achieve a cost-effective, on-time, safe and  reliable start if we continue to debate questions of basic approach," RTD  Executive Director Alan Pegg said, referring to the dispute. Pegg said security  is "an essential element of the operational phase," and he wants no  interference from the commission.  </P> <P> Officials from both of the big transit agencies say the trains will run as  scheduled, and the security of the passengers will be assured. They do not say  how they intend to resolve their differences.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, contractors are putting the finishing touches on the rail system,  hooking up the automatic signals, testing the crossing gates at 26  intersections. The RTD has hired half of the 220 managers, operators and  maintenance experts needed to run the Blue Line and is training them for the  May takeover.  </P> <P> The Blue Line trains will run along the Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way  north out of Long Beach across the Los Angeles River to Willowbrook Avenue. The  tracks follow Willowbrook through Compton and Watts, then bend north to  Washington Boulevard and follow that thoroughfare downtown to Flower Street.  The line runs along the center of Flower Street and goes underground at 12th  Street, tunneling into the 7th and Flower Street station.  </P> <P> The 22 open-air stations along the fenced route have raised platforms to allow  passengers to step directly onto the trains. There are no gates blocking  platform access, nor will there be any ticket or station agents. Everything  will be handled automatically, officials explained. Each station will have fare  vending machines and money changers.  </P> <P> Security will be provided by remote TV cameras, call boxes and roving police  patrols. Undercover officers will ride the trains, McSpedon said. Passengers  will be checked randomly to see if they have purchased fare tickets or have  valid passes.  </P></p>

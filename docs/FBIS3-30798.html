Accepting full  responsibility for every word in the letter, Karadzic emphasizes  that an explosion in which few people were killed and injured  took place at the market, while everything else surrounding this  incident was stage-managed.    There were very few goods in the market, and those were in  only a few stalls. Eyewitnesses did not observe over 300 people  at the market directly prior to the explosion, but only a  handful. It would not even be logical for more than 300 people  to be present at a small market that was lacking in goods.    Karadzic also pointed to a very indicative fact: The Muslim  side rejected an investigation that would be carried out by the  UN experts with the participation of Serbian and Muslim experts.  Interviews with survivors, as well as pathological findings on  the causes and times of deaths, would have revealed the entire  fake. Namely, all the witnesses, even the Muslims in the Muslim  media, have stated that this was an unusual bomb because the  characteristic whistling noise was not heard prior to the  explosion.    Karadzic, among other things, warns that the television  footage clearly shows that manipulation with bodies has taken  place in this tragedy. As he says, in the footage one can see  the bodies of casualties who had died hours earlier as well as  plastic body parts. We must not allow, Karadzic says, that one  warring side would deceive the entire international community,  including the most important forces -- the United States and  Russia, and their presidents -- and lead them to false  conclusions. This is a great shame, he says.    Karadzic appealed to Clinton and Yeltsin: We beg you to  discover the real truth by all means available to your powerful  countries.</p>

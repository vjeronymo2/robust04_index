			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Painting a picture of pragmatism: The once-secretive IMF is breaking with tradition and courtingthe press NEW recruits at the International Monetary Fund were once expected to attend a seminar entitled 'How to avoid the press'. Those days of obsessive secrecy seem to have passed. At the weekend fund officials broke with tradition by inviting the media to a seminar on the 'design and implementation of IMF-supported programmes'. The message was that the modern IMF is not a hard-nosed institution interested only in devaluation and austerity. On the contrary, it is a pragmatic organisation working in partnership with member governments to find mutually acceptable solutions to diverse economic problems. Officials said balance of payments viability was still the primary objective of most programmes. But this goal was now almost inseparable from the related objective of sustainable economic growth. Balance of payments viability meant that a country could finance current account deficits on private capital markets while repaying the IMF and other official creditors. Economic growth was an essential goal as otherwise balance of payments improvements could be sustained only by compressing consumption and investment - something unlikely to be politically acceptable for long. Low and stable inflation, meanwhile, was seen as one of the pre-conditions for steady growth. IMF staff were anxious to stress several points: There is no blueprint or rigid IMF model for achieving these objectives. 'Our policies are never off-the-peg, they are always tailor-made,' officials stress. Policies are not 'imposed' on governments. The IMF's role was to help governments design and implement their own policies. Income distribution is no longer ignored. Officials are 'aware that programmes will have an impact on poor groups' and often advocate stronger social safety nets. There is no political bias. The IMF was involved with Hungary and Romania before the collapse of communism and is willing to help socialist countries today. On technical aspects of programmes, officials denied any bias in favour of devaluation. This was sometimes the only way to shift resources towards export markets, but the likely cost in terms of higher inflation was no longer ignored. Recently, for example in Poland and Czechoslovakia, the IMF had advocated rigid exchange rates or 'nominal anchors' as a device for curbing inflation. On fiscal policy, officials said the IMF was wrongly caricatured as always favouring tax increases as a means of cutting budget deficits. Its focus had shifted to tax reform; it favoured measures to broaden tax bases and often recommended cuts in tax rates. Staff, however, conceded that many countries had common problems and so programmes were often similar. High inflation and balance of payments crises typically reflected public-sector imbalances - usually excessive budget deficits financed through rapid credit creation. Such mistakes could only be corrected through deflationary policies. But the IMF was increasingly trying to address the structural causes of macro imbalances. Budget deficits arose, for example, because governments tried to maintain spending despite stagnant economies. The solution often lay in tackling the structural causes of poor growth. These included chronically overvalued exchange rates, artificially low prices for key commodities (which discouraged their production), and pegged interest rates leading to credit rationing. Officials said programmes continued to be tightly monitored, with member governments expected to meet quarterly targets for a range of financial indicators. But they tried to draw the sting of conditionality, stressing that targets were flexible: if slippage occurred for factors beyond borrowers' control, disbursements would not be halted. The extent to which the new pragmatism is reflected on the ground, in the IMF's 50-odd economic programmes, may be doubted. But the seminar at least helped clarify the IMF's economic aspirations. Sceptics may detect a whiff of revisionism. Officials stressed continuity of policies, but a decade ago the IMF was putting far less emphasis on economic growth, structural reforms and social safety nets. Staff also conceded that the IMF's record could be improved: academic studies indicate Fund programmes often do little or nothing to raise growth or living standards.</p>

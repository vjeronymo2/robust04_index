			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> PANEL SAYS SCHOOL SHOULD BE CLOSED  </P> <P> Faced with declining enrollment, a committee formed by the Fountain Valley  School District has recommended that at least one more campus be closed by the  end of the school year, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> In a detailed report, the committee argued that Fountain Valley Elementary  School, the district's oldest elementary school, should be closed in June and  its students divided among three other schools. The recommendation was  presented by the special panel Thursday night. District trustees are expected  to vote on the matter in January, after a public hearing.  </P> <P> The elementary school was targeted for closure last year because it had the  lowest enrollment in the district. But under pressure from disgruntled parents,  trustees opted to close another elementary school instead.  </P> <P> Seven schools have been closed since 1979 because of dwindling enrollment.  Experts blame soaring home prices that have kept young families out. The  average price of a single-family home in the Fountain Valley area is more than  $220,000.  </P> <P> "The price range for homes here is really out of reach for the younger family,"  said Cheryl Norton, a member of the committee and senior manager with the  district. "The community is aging and the children in the neighborhoods are all  grown up."  </P> <P> The district, which serves most of Fountain Valley and part of northeastern  Huntington Beach, was one of the fastest-growing school systems in Orange  County 20 years ago. Families with young children were moving in as fast as  housing tracts in the two cities could be built.  </P> <P> But since 1973, when enrollment peaked at just over 12,000 students and 19  schools, the district has experienced a continuous decline. There are now about  5,000 students and 12 schools.  </P> <P> "It is very discouraging for the district to have this happen," said Roger  Belgen, a 17-year member of the school board. "We started out with a variety of  neighborhood schools to give that close-knit feeling. We're losing that element  now because we are losing the children."  </P> <P> With the exception of Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley is the only city in  Orange County experiencing significant drops in enrollment. Officials expect  that trend to continue until 1992, when the number of students entering  kindergarten is expected to equal the number of students graduating from high  school.  </P> <P> Although a decision on the school-closure recommendation isn't expected for a  few weeks, trustees are bracing for protests from parents of the school's  students.  </P> <P> "We dealt with it last year, and then their complaint was that our projections  of declining enrollment were wrong," Norton said. "So we waited a year to see  if things changed, and they haven't. So we are back to our original  suggestion." ALLISON SAMUELS  </P></p>

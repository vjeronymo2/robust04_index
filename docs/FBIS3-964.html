			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The issue of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola's [UNITA] participation in the country's  government has not been resolved because UNITA has not yet  responded to the government's offer. Last night, a source close  to UNITA described as interesting the government's offer, adding  however that UNITA was going to propose some amendments. The  source declined to comment on the nature of such amendments,  saying only that UNITA will today continue its meetings with the  mediators and the observers to discuss the matter.    Meanwhile, another source has said that UNITA continues to  avoid a definitive settlement to the problem and is only making  general considerations concerning the government's offer. It is  believed, though, that the mediators and observers want concrete  answers from UNITA and will likely exert pressure on it today to  obtain them. We will have to wait and see.</p>

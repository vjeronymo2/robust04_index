			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> Jutta Vogel; place and date not given: "Woerner Is Already  Drinking Beer Again"]    [Text] [Vogel] Mr. Woerner, how are you?    [Woerner] I feel better, my health is improving. The  doctors tell me that "things are looking up." That is what I  think too. I have gained 18 pounds and have recovered my  appetite. Yesterday, my wife brought me a bottle of beer and  the tomato soup that I am so fond of.    [Vogel] You have worked every day since your last  operation.....    [Woerner] Unfortunately, it was a question of duty for me.  If one assumes a task, then one must carry it out, irrespective  of whether one is well or not. The doctors warned me that I  would have to pay the price. I hope it has not caused me too  much harm in the long term.    [Vogel] Have the NATO alliance partners shown you enough  consideration?    [Woerner] To this day I have had the full support of the  alliance foreign ministers. I am pleased about that, grateful,  and happy.    Following the last foreign ministers meeting in Istanbul, I  received a letter from British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.  He wrote to me on behalf of all his colleagues. "Look after  yourself, and make sure that you are fully fit by the time the  summer break is over!" U.S. Secretary of State Christopher also  phoned me.    [Vogel] What gives you so much strength?    [Woerner] Without the support of my dear wife, without the  enormous sympathy displayed by an incredible number of people, I  would never have succeeded. I also read the bible every day.  My life has acquired an entirely different meaning. My  relationship to God plays an important role.    [Vogel] Today, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev will sign  the Partnership for Peace with NATO. Do you regret that you  will not be there?    [Woerner] Yes, very much so, it has always been "my baby"  since my first visit to Moscow four years ago. It is very dear  to my heart.    The former foe will now come as a friend, and I cannot be  there. That does leave a bitter feeling. I invested so much  energy in this partnership. The relationship between NATO and  Russia will also play a key role in the future.    [Vogel] What significance will this new cooperation between  Russia and NATO have?    [Woerner] It represents a great step forward on the way to  genuine partnership.    [Vogel] Can the Russians now influence NATO decisions?    [Woerner] We will, of course, hold consultations with the  Russians on important security policy questions, especially in  those areas where Russia can make a special contribution.  However, we have not given the Russians a veto right. We will  also continue talking to our partner states.    [Vogel] Is this the first step toward full membership of  NATO for Russia?    [Woerner] No, not at all. There should not be any  misunderstandings in this respect. The impression should not  arise that we want to carve up the world together with the  Russians, to grant the Russians the right participate in  decisionmaking. I do not envisage Russia's full membership of  NATO being possible in the foreseeable future.    [Vogel] When will you be back at NATO headquarters in  Brussels?    [Woerner] I want to get back as quickly as possible. I am  being looked after by fantastic doctors. I owe my life to them.  I am optimistic, but, of course, no one can say exactly how my  condition will develop. I want to be fit again by the end of  the summer break.</p>

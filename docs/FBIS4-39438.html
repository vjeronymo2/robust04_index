			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian </F> Federation Security Council, by Andrey Apostolov; place and date  not given: "Oleg Lobov: Bulgaria Is Not Interested in Most  Modern Russian Weapons Systems"]    [Text] [Apostolov] The issue of Russia's joining the  Partnership for Peace program is current. The reactions of  certain high-ranking Russian representatives show that there is  not a uniform attitude toward this issue at the top.    [Lobov] The Security Council includes the president and the  ministers of defense, foreign affairs, and internal affairs, all  of whom participate in adopting important decisions, including  the decision on the Partnership for Peace. One should not be  hasty in anything related to this program. Russia is too big to  be pressurized. Its power is equal to that of NATO. It is no  accident that when one says that the United States could destroy  the world 16 times over, one immediately adds that Russia could  do it 24 times. However, this is not the most important issue.  We must understand precisely what we would get out of the  Partnership for Peace. If Russia has to scrap its arms -- this  naturally is no partnership. One cannot rationalize in a  simplistic manner: We offered our hand (to Russia), you  rejected it, therefore you are the bad guys. All issues must be  clarified -- this includes the arms systems issue, the rights  that Russia will have, and so on. The document must be very  precise and clear. When the documents will be signed is not the  most important issue.    As far as the different attitudes are concerned -- this is a  natural phenomenon. The minister of defense has his own  opinion, and the same applies to the president and the foreign  minister. It is precisely those different views and opinions  that are being discussed at the Security Council, with a view to  working out the most precise position and a uniform point of  view. The Security Council still has not expressed its position  on the Partnership for Peace program, and is preparing it now.    [Apostolov] Mr. Lobov, what attracted your interest in  Bulgaria -- our weapons technologies or the possibilities of our  military-industrial complex? Will you purchase, sell, or  discuss joint production?    [Lobov] We were briefed on the possibilities of the military  industry, and naturally, with its problems. We have no  intention of purchasing anything.    [Apostolov] Would Russia sell Bulgaria its most modern  weapons, for example, the SU-34?    [Lobov] The Bulgarian side did not express any interest in  this aircraft.    [Apostolov] What about other systems that are more modern  than the MIG-29?    [Lobov] No, the Bulgarians did not request such weapon  systems.    [Apostolov] Mr. Lobov, the ratio between the Russian and  Turkish naval forces in the Black Sea has changed in the last  few years from 2:1 to 1:1.    [Lobov] Yes, this is so, and we must analyze this issue. We  must think what could happen in the future against the  background of a Black Sea Fleet that is divided between Russia  and Ukraine. If the navies of Bulgaria and Russia must be  strengthened -- then it must be done, and we are prepared to  help Bulgaria as partners. After all, if we sign the Partnership  for Peace we become partners, is this not so? Our navies must  be strengthened. There is a war being waged near our borders.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Asda Property up to Pounds 4.4m Trading profits from sales of residential property helped Asda Property Holdings to increase pre-tax profits for the six months to end-June from Pounds 2.47m to Pounds 4.43m. Profit from trading properties rose by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 2.5m in the period, the bulk of which came from sales of residential investments. The company's remaining residential portfolio amounts to Pounds 3m and will be sold in the near term. Net rental income was Pounds 6.3m, up from Pounds 5.2m, reflecting acquisitions made in the second half of last year and lettings of vacant property. Interest charges rose from Pounds 2.88m to Pounds 3.15m, but last year's figure included Pounds 300,000 capitalised interest. This year's charge reflects the one-off Pounds 300,000 cost of unwinding interest rate swaps. Turnover amounted to Pounds 15m (Pounds 11.2m). Earnings per share were 3.4p (2.5p) and the interim dividend is increased to 0.75p (0.7p). Asda was a net seller of property in the first half, disposing of Pounds 10m assets against purchases totalling Pounds 3.5m. Mr Tony Roscoe, managing director, said that prices being sought in spring and early summer were unrealistic, but that the market had slipped back since the summer and Asda had again started to buy. Since the half-year end, the company has spent Pounds 17m, including Pounds 8.5m on a portfolio of 28 shops acquired from a high street retailer and Pounds 3.9m in a half share of a retail warehouse park in Cwmbran, South Wales. Mr Roscoe said that the retail portfolio required active management. Some of the shops would be refurbished and retained, while others would be sold.</p>

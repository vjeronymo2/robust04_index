			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bus market recovery helps Trinity rise 32% to Pounds 6.2m A strong recovery in the UK bus market and firm demand from overseas operators helped Trinity Holdings, the specialist vehicle manufacturer, to increase first half pre-tax profits by 32 per cent to Pounds 6.25m (Pounds 4.76m). The company said UK bus registrations, which have increased by 15 per cent in each of the last two years, rose more sharply in the first six months and were currently 25 per cent ahead of last year. Trinity, which has 40 per cent of the new bus market, was helped by Pounds 33m of orders from Badgerline and Stagecoach. Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman, said the average age of buses in the UK was 14 years, against nine years before the deregulation of the industry. Consequently there was plenty of scope for growth as operators renewed their fleets. Mr Hollyhead added that with export demand also strong, the company was 'on target to increase group output by 15 per cent this year and aim to continue that rate for the foreseeable future.' Significant orders had been received from the far east and forays had been made into the African market. A Malaysian joint venture was proving promising. Mr Hollyhead was confident that the overseas market would account for about 40 per cent of group turnover. 'The developing countries want to build transport systems as good as in the west, the potential for expansion is enormous.' Turnover in the first half, increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 71.6m (Pounds 62.7m). Earnings advanced to 8.1p (6.2p) and the dividend was 2.25p (2.0p). Trinity's order book for buses, refuse trucks, fire engines and airport maintenance vehicles, was up 15 per cent on the year at about Pounds 85m. Mr Hollyhead said the planned investment to increase production capacity would be met out of the Pounds 9m cash surplus. COMMENT The premium rating attached to Trinity's shares after barely two years in the market would appear to be justified. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m in 1993 are likely to be nearly doubled in 1995. Earnings per share are forecast to grow from 10.7p to 16.9p in that time - the latter representing a p/e of 19.5. With the UK bus market recovering and overseas markets growing strongly, the management's forecast of 15 per cent organic growth per annum in the next few years is plausible. While this should help to guard against any downside, the shares may find it hard to maintain momentum.</p>

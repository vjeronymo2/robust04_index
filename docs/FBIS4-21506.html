			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Parliament Concerned About </F> Pesticide Exports to Albania Under PHARE Programme"; as released  by Brussels Textline database]    [Text] The Parliament adopted a resolution of the EPP Group  amended by the Greens on exports of pesticides by the European  Union to Albania under the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid  Program to Poland and Hungary] programme. It invited the  European Commission and all bodies responsible for the  implementation of the PHARE programme to intervene immediately  to withdraw toxic pesticides from the market and asked that a  study be undertaken making it possible to identify those  responsible for the destruction of the ecological balance of the  regions concerned. It is demanding that the Commission prepare  a report with the detailed description and amount of aid granted  to date to Albania by the Community in the framework of the  PHARE programme, particularly with regard to the agricultural  dimension. It is also asking the Commission to submit  Commission projects to it on forthcoming aid to be granted. On  behalf of the Commission, Sir Leon Brittan indicated that the  stock of pesticides in Albania currently amounted to 3500  tonnes. Some 500 tonnes, of which 214 tonnes benefiting from  PHARE programme support, are products of high quality that meet  Community standards and from the countries of the European  Union. The rest was not manufactured in the Community or  supplied with its aid. Albania using little pesticide, only 60  tonnes could be placed on the market, the remainder reexported  to the producers or destroyed, which is proving to be difficult  for part of it, the destruction technology not yet being safe.  The cost of destruction would amount to almost 2.7 million  Ecus. The Commission and the Albanian authorities are currently  studying these two possibilities, said the Commissioner. Mr.  Graefe zu Baringdorf (German Green) regarded as scandalous that  the estimated cost of destruction amounted to 2.7 million Ecus  whereas the aid supplied to the agricultural sector under the  PHARE programme is only 3 million Ecus.</p>

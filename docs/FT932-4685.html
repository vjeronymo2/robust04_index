			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Dunedin hoping to raise Pounds 50m Dunedin Fund Managers is hoping to raise Pounds 50m for a new investment trust specialising in Japanese equities. The Dunedin Japanese Investment Trust will be run by the same team that currently runs the group's Japanese unit trusts. For the first five years of the trust's life, Dunedin will donate 35 per cent of its 1 per cent annual management fee to the charity Barnardos. UBS will be the issue's sponsors and the money will be raised via a placing and open offer, which is expected to open in early July.</p>

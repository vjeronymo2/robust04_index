			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Shota Shotovich Chipashvili, Academy of </F> Natural Sciences corresponding member, State Prize laureate,  deputy director of Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of  Problems of Information Science, by Anatoliy Pokrovskiy, date,  place and occasion not specified: "What Is Behind the `Nuclear  Briefcase'?"]    [Text] This ordinary-looking attache case lately has  been and is giving rise to many different rumors. It is  understandable that in troubled times of cardinal changes in  upper echelons of state authority, all of us would like to be  sure that neither amateurish decisions, nor absurd chance, nor  some maniac's evil will will be able to set in motion the  nuclear ruin of mankind.    At one time this "nuclear briefcase" was created for  our country's supreme leadership, permitting the final decision  on use of strategic nuclear forces to be kept constantly under  supreme control.    This is where our conversation began with Sh. Sh.  Chipashvili, Academy of Natural Sciences corresponding member,  State Prize laureate, deputy director of the Russian Academy of  Sciences Institute of Problems of Information Science.    [Chipashvili] Of course, public interest in the  "nuclear briefcase" can be understood, and the press also  constantly "stirs up" this topic. All this is explainable by  political aspects and the state level of those persons for whom  the "briefcase" is intended.    Doctor of Technical Sciences M. S. Loginov, the head of this  work who is presently alive and well (he received the Hero of  Socialist Labor title for it), can tell much of interest about  the fascinating story of this item's creation and introduction.    But from a technical standpoint, this is just a portable  personal subscriber device, which is a diminutive particle of an  enormous iceberg--the unified, comprehensive, automated system  for command and control of the country's entire Armed Forces,  created under the direction of General Designer Academician  Vladimir Sergeyevich Semenikhin.    [Pokrovskiy] It follows from your words, Shota  Shotovich, that the public at large knows little about such a  global program and Academician Semenikhin's role in the  country's history?    [Chipashvili] You are absolutely right, especially  as the successful solution to this enormous national problem led  to our country's attainment of strategic military inviolability.    One would like to believe that in the final account all  aspects of this work gradually will find worthy, truthful and  sufficiently complete coverage in the open press.    This is especially important now, when there is  indiscriminate discrediting and smearing of everything  previously achieved. This often is done by those who do not have  a sufficiently realistic impression about much from our past,  and in the best case have become casually familiar with very  superficial or inferior information, on the basis of which  amateurish or opportunistic conclusions and generalizations  subsequently are made.    [Pokrovskiy] Just what is the Armed Forces automated  command and control system?    [Chipashvili] You asked a very difficult question.  It is impossible to portray the entire problem as a whole in a  popular manner in a newspaper article, even in general outline.    But I am sure you will bring in for cooperation many of  Academician Semenikhin's companions-in-arms who are now alive  and well, and the impressive panorama of the solution to an  enormous national problem gradually will come out in the pages  of your newspaper.    To begin with, let us recall what kind of situation shaped  up  for the country's defense capability approximately in the early  1960's.    By this time atomic and hydrogen weapons had been created  and  were being upgraded constantly. This entire program is linked  above all with the name of Academician Igor Vasilyevich  Kurchatov and the collectives he headed.    Diverse means of delivering these weapons (for ground, air  and sea basing) had been created and were being developed. The  main program here is connected with the name of Academician  Sergey Pavlovich Korolev and his collectives.    Thus a fundamentally new and at the same time paradoxical  situation began to form both in our Armed Forces and in the  armed forces of leading world powers.    On the one hand, the stockpiling of enormous arsenals of  mass  destruction weapons seemingly was making the powers strong and  was creating the illusion of an enemy's instantaneous defeat  with the surprise of being first to attack.    On the other hand, the looming threat of a more and more  powerful enemy surprise first strike was forcing the sides to  build up nuclear potentials.    The potentials of mass destruction weapons grew and the  military threat to the sides increased.    This paradox could be resolved only by completing the  triad--by creating an automated system for command and control  of all kinds of strategic weapons which not only ensures  one-hundred percent probability of a retaliatory strike, but  also makes it more powerful because of a correction to initial  plans, i.e., being first to attack becomes tantamount to suicide.    This last enormous amount of work was headed up in the final  account by Academician Semenikhin as General Designer.    Initial interpretation of the entire upcoming enormous task  of creating the Armed Forces automated command and control  system was accomplished in the mid-1960's under the direction of  Doctor of Technical Sciences V. V. Konashev, who later became  Academician Semenikhin's first deputy and closest  companion-in-arms and a Lenin and State Prize laureate. But all  necessary preconditions were not yet ripe in the country as of  that period for beginning wide-scale practical work on such a  very large Soviet automated command and control system.    [Pokrovskiy] But this meant that not only scientific  and technical problems, but also very complicated organizational  problems had to be solved...    [Chipashvili] Specifically very complicated ones.    Fortunately, in those times not everything was as bad as  certain indiscriminate slanderers of our past now try to  represent it.    I can attest that the party CC Defense Department, the  Military-Industrial Commission, and heads of all sector  ministries which had been set in motion directed all this  enormous, comprehensive work in solving the problem of creating  the Armed Forces automated command and control system at the  proper level, on a large scale and in a businesslike manner.    In all his posts (both in the party CC and in the Ministry  of  Defense), D. F. Ustinov devoted much attention to this problem  and was its active proponent.    The Ministry of the Radio Industry was the leading ministry  for the problem as a whole and bore full responsibility to the  country's leadership. Deceased Minister P. S. Pleshakov put much  of his energy and health into creating the Armed Forces  automated command and control system, and therefore conferral of  the Hero of Socialist Labor title on him for this system was a  deserved assessment of his personal contribution.    Directorates subordinate to Marshal of Signal Troops A. I.  Belov acted as the general client from the Ministry of Defense.  Broad military, scientific and technical erudition,  understanding and support of risky new solutions, readiness to  assume responsibility at any level in the interests of the job,  a constant desire to become personally familiar in practice with  results achieved, and all this with precise, businesslike  exactingness--these personal qualities of Marshal Belov played a  role of deciding importance in the success of work on the Armed  Forces automated command and control system.    General K. N. Trofimov, Marshal Belov's closest assistant  and  a person of profound erudition, great experience and highest  morals, who was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labor title for  this work, was a match for the Marshal. Unfortunately, he died  tragically in a helicopter crash during a flight between Armed  Forces automated command and control system sites.    General Staff Representative General V. P. Shutov, a  champion  of new principles of operational work based on modern  information technologies, who was awarded the State Prize and  who was an active, creative participant of the work, died with  him.    The military science of command and control took a very  perceptible quality leap with creation of the Armed Forces  automated command and control system. The leading scientific  research institute of the Ministry of Defense, together with  institutes of branches of the Armed Forces and military  academies, created new battle management algorithms and  successfully introduced them in the system. General B. I.  Strelchenko, chief of the leading institute and a doctor of  military sciences, was awarded the State Prize.    An enormous volume of work was done to construct hardened  rooms for command and control sites throughout the country's  territory. This epopee needs a separate narrative.    Thousands on thousands of specialists worked far from home  for many years on the industry's test benches and at Ministry of  Defense sites. The organization headed by A. V. Myshletsov, who  was awarded the Lenin Prize, was the leading organization in  this process.    Specialists of different departments, different profiles,  different ages and different nationalities made up those  unified, friendly collectives, which were united by a sincere  desire to successfully realize what had been conceived.    There was an enormous number of institutes, design bureaus  and plants which took part in this work of many years and, by  the way, in many former republics of the USSR. The memoirs of  chief designers of branch automated command and control systems  and of individual unique technical systems and articles will be  interesting. The most prestigious prizes and high government  awards were deservedly bestowed on the majority of these  companions-in-arms of Academician Semenikhin.    The Council of Chief Designers, which included the immediate  scientific-technical and organizational directors of all  functional automated command and control systems, which were  joined in the unified Armed Forces automated command and control  system, functioned constantly under Academician Semenikhin's  direction. Very much of interest also could be told both about  this Council and about Academician Semenikhin's closest kindred  spirits and colleagues.    [Pokrovskiy] Everything you enumerated indicates that  journalists still owe a great debt and must cover this  little-known page of our history more fully.    [Chipashvili] It is desirable that Academician  Semenikhin's companions-in-arms and colleagues who are alive and  well and who possess the full scope of historical information  publish their memoirs about the very useful and instructive  experience of creating such an enormous automated command and  control system. For work on the Armed Forces automated command  and control system essentially permitted forming a powerful,  world-class domestic school on all aspects of comprehensive  automation of the process of command and control of  heterogeneous structures.    It should not be forgotten that unified thematic and  engineering solutions on a world level were worked out in  developing and realizing the Armed Forces automated command and  control system which, in addition to their direct purpose, are  suitable for use at the present time in creating automated  systems for management of regions, sectors and the entire  national economy of the country as a whole. What has been built  up must not be lost!    [Pokrovskiy] We have been speaking all the while of the  problem as a whole. Couldn't you tell briefly about something  more specific?    [Chipashvili] Insofar as I can, I will try.    Everything that was realized in creating the Armed Forces  automated command and control system was rather revolutionary  both for the Armed Forces and for the country's science and  engineering. But even against this background, the development  and creation of the data exchange system for the Armed Forces  automated command and control system on a fundamentally new  conceptual and scientific basis was such a revolutionary and  risky measure that it still generates a feeling of surprise,  admiration and pride in our science and engineering.    Based on his own experience of creating automated command  and  control systems for individual branches of the Armed Forces,  Academician Semenikhin understood well that data transfer  questions were assuming ever greater importance in the problem  of command and control.    Based on this, Academician Semenikhin gave constant, steady  attention to the problem of creating a data exchange system as  the basis of a unified Armed Forces automated command and  control system.    Specialists realized from the very beginning that it was  impossible to create such a comprehensive Armed Forces automated  command and control system with the old approach to questions of  data transfer--not only would requisite characteristics not be  achieved, but the number of communications channels also had to  be so enormous that it would exceed the bounds of what was  reasonable. Ever larger staffs and command and control  facilities must turn into enormous communications centers, with  all ensuing consequences.    And proposed ideas of creating a data exchange system for  the  Armed Forces automated command and control system based on  principles of switching individual portions of information  through special automated centers seemed so unusual,  unpredictable and risky for that time that far from everyone  (even specialists) was agreeable to making the fate of the  entire Armed Forces automated command and control system  dependent on the possibility of realizing these new ideas.    It should be recalled here that all this occurred long  before  the accumulation of world experience and the appearance of  international recommendations on a similar problem, which  subsequently resulted in the enormous labor of large collectives  of highly qualified specialists from different countries. Our  developers not only had to develop very complex data exchange  procedures for the first time on their own, but also ensure  fulfillment of unprecedentedly high demands on the quality of  data transfer with the use of essentially all types of  communications channels, often of very poor quality, over  enormous territories.    Despite all these difficulties, a large-scale territorial  data exchange system was developed and realized for the first  time based on a fundamentally new ideology, with unique  indicators of functioning reliability and of the validity and  probability of communicating data, a system which became a  highly reliable, unifying foundation for all systems and  subsystems of the Armed Forces automated command and control  system.    When actual quantitative indicators of functioning of the  data exchange system had been generalized for the first time,  even the developers were pleasantly surprised. It was for a more  understandable report to state leaders that the famous  comparison which Academician Semenikhin very much loved was  calculated: Reliability of data transfer over the data exchange  system allows the distortion of no more than one out of the  total number of characters in 165 volumes (i.e., 5.5 sets) of  the "Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya" [Great Soviet  Encyclopedia].    The data exchange system also is being operated successfully  at the present time, and many of its characteristics have not  been surpassed to this day not only in domestic, but even in  world practice.    Academician Semenikhin was very proud of the results of work  on the data exchange system and highly esteemed its chief  designer, his deputy, Russian Academy of Sciences Corresponding  Member I. A. Mizin, who was awarded the Lenin Prize for this  work.    [Pokrovskiy] I had occasion to meet Vladimir  Sergeyevich and prepare his interviews and articles for PRAVDA.  Of course, the talk in them was not about military, but peaceful  use of computers, particularly about the unified computer  system. For some reason I did not have occasion to hear high  praise of it.    [Chipashvili] Insofar as I recall, Academician  Semenikhin appeared in PRAVDA, including also under a pseudonym,  following guidelines of that time about maintaining secrecy.    With respect to the second part of your question, I would  not  like to enter into polemics, but I will express my view of the  situation briefly.    No matter what was said there, all defense equipment without  exception was of domestic origin. All this was done by our  brains and our hands. In places we were ahead, in places we were  not... On the average it was parity--in the modern world it is  impossible to break ahead abruptly.    But everything that shoots, crawls, swims and flies is all  domestic. And when computers began to be developed rapidly, all  onboard computers [vychisliteli] (or "kompyutery," as you like)  were and are only domestic.    And we were not somewhere behind in the area of fixed  computers. The problem appeared when the question arose of mass  production of computer equipment for command and control systems.    [Pokrovskiy] Since political points have appeared in  our conversation, how do you assess the effect of the Armed  Forces automated command and control system on higher politics?  The fact is, results of work on the Armed Forces automated  command and control system could not remain unnoticed in other  countries...    [Chipashvili] The system's capabilities for giving  political and military leaders timely information for making  important decisions on a retaliatory strike and the real-time  realization of these decisions with any effect of the attacking  side all led to the suicidal nature of the idea of a first  strike.    [Pokrovskiy] What would you like to say in  conclusion?    [Chipashvili] Just one thing. Large-scale,  epoch-making problems also require corresponding directors, and  as a rule they become inseparable from one another in history. I  would like to express the assurance that Academician Semenikhin  as a person and his work to create the unified Armed Forces  automated command and control system will find worthy coverage  in our press and literature.</p>

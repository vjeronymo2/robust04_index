			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT DRUGS?';  </P> <P> CHURCHES DEMAND WAR ON 'EPIDEMIC'  </P> <P> In an atmosphere charged with the excitement of a political convention, 1,200  church members packed an Anaheim auditorium Thursday and won commitments from  the mayors of Orange County's two largest cities to do more to combat drugs in  their communities.  </P> <P> Mayors of Anaheim and Santa Ana promised the crowd that they would take to  their city councils a resolution declaring the existence of a "drug epidemic"  and calling for coordinated action by local police, prosecutors, judges,  educators and elected officials to eradicate it.  </P> <P> To the delight of the crowd, Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter and Santa Ana Mayor  Daniel H. Young put their promises in writing on a blackboard wheeled out to  the school auditorium stage by Father John Lenihan of St. Boniface Church in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> The emotional 90-minute meeting began with members of 15 Santa Ana and Anaheim  churches standing and roaring as Lenihan called out the names of each of their  parishes, which have banded together to form the Orange County  Congregation-Community Organizations.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on the stage, Hunter clenched his jaw and Young folded his hands and  glanced down at papers in front of him.  </P> <P> Then the audience heard a report from Stan Martin of St. Joseph's Church in  Santa Ana, who outlined problems found by the interfaith federation during 6  months of research: a lack of detoxification beds for drug addicts; too few  police officers and prosecutors assigned to combat illegal narcotics; a  shortage of jail space, and too little money spent on anti-drug programs in  schools.  </P> <P> "We can't find the money to deal with the drug epidemic that is destroying our  families and killing our children," Martin told those assembled. "We want a  coordinated, strategic campaign -- today, not tomorrow. What's being done today  is not enough."  </P> <P> The meeting then turned somber as group members gave testimony about their own  family experiences with drugs.  </P> <P> Martha Maciel of St. Joseph's parish wept as she told the story of her brother,  Thomas, who died at age 28 in an Orange County Jail cell in 1984. It was the  last of several such visits that began after "Tommy" began using drugs at 14.  </P> <P> Maria Alaniz, a mother of three from Anaheim, told of her 6-year-old already  talking with friends about other children using marijuana.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I had a problem," she said.  </P> <P> "But it shook me that my 6-year-old already had to be involved in that  conversation."  </P> <P> Maria Alcala of St. Boniface parish drew a thunderous ovation when she asked  the mayors why politicians seem so concerned about building new freeways.  </P> <P> "What are we doing about drugs?" she asked. "Isn't that more important?"  </P> <P> Hunter quickly made it clear that he agreed with Alcala.  </P> <P> "There are too many weak-kneed . . . milquetoast politicians who are going  around the county telling you that traffic is the No. 1 problem," Hunter said.  "I agree with you. We need to stop drugs."  </P> <P> Hunter told the crowd that, as a former police officer, he is familiar with the  problems caused by drug abuse and drug trafficking in communities. "There are  people today in state prison because of Fred Hunter," he said.  </P> <P> Part of the solution to the drug problem, Hunter said, is that "punishment must  be swift, it must be sure, it must be severe. . . . If one marijuana cigarette  is found in a car, take that car. If a dope pusher is selling cocaine, take  that house."  </P> <P> Santa Ana Mayor Young, who followed the fiery Hunter to the podium, told the  crowd that he was "saddened by the testimony and not naive to it." He recited a  list of Santa Ana city programs aimed at fighting drugs, but acknowledged,  "It's not enough."  </P> <P> The congregations were brought together with the help of the Orange County  Sponsoring Committee, an umbrella group of religious and lay community leaders  that began organizing county neighborhoods in the 1970s.  </P></p>

Herve  Leveille, secretary general of this group, says that all sectors  involved in the crisis have failed and that the people must take  initiatives to solve the crisis. Leveille invites the Haitians,  among others, to participate in this congress, which will center  on the country's situation, a congress which can ease the  crisis. A total of 123 citizens from the nine departments are  already willing to participate in this congress, according to  Leveille. Let us listen to his statements. [sentence as heard]    We are now going to talk about the postponing of the  national  conference instead. The technical office of the Committee of  Actions for National Reconciliation [Comite d'Actions pour la  Reconciliation Nationale, CARENA] advises that the national  conference will now take place on 6 and 7 February in accordance  with the wishes of the various sectors of national life that  will participate in this conference. It takes this opportunity  to invite the various sectors of national life to participate in  the sessions of the national conference preparatory work that  will take place at the Holiday Inn on 20 January with the  following sectors: the Catholic Church, the Protestant Church,  voodoo members, employers, workers, the people's sector, and the  socioprofessional sector. The date of 21 January will be devoted  to political parties, the executive power, the Senate of the  Republic, and the Chamber of Deputies. The Court of Cassation,  the Haitian Armed Forces, and the Supreme Audit Court will  participate as observers in the working meetings that will go  from 1000 to 1300 and from 1500 to 1800.    The technical office of CARENA takes this opportunity to  renew the expression of its patriotic greetings. This note is  signed by Fritz Buissereth, coordinator in charge of the  technical office. He is the new CARENA spokesman. The note is  also signed by Ady Jeangardy, coordinator in charge of  communications, and by Bruny Raphael, coordinator in charge of  administration.</p>

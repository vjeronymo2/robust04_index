			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Etam attacks Oceana stakebuilding ETAM, the 250-store women's fashion chain, has attacked the attempt by Oceana Investment Corporation to increase its stake to 25.1 per cent as a prelude to a possible full bid. Oceana, investment vehicle of a South African retailing family, launched a Pounds 22m tender offer for 18.5 per cent of Etam's shares yesterday. But in a letter to shareholders, Etam said the offer of up to 185p per share was an attempt to gain back-door control at a low price. Although the maximum offer is nearly 25 times 1990-91 earnings per share, on halved pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.5m, Etam said it was only 11 times the figure achieved when taxable profit exceeded Pounds 17m, as it did in each of the three years to January 1990. Oceana was aiming to profit from the benefits to come of Etam's Pounds 78m investment over the past four years and the upturn in the retail cycle. In adverse trading conditions, the group had increased market share by appealing to a broader range of customers. The board, which holds 10.2 per cent of the equity, would be refusing the offer and it urged other shareholders to do the same.</p>

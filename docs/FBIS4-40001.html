			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- At a news conference  by leaders of the "Ukraine" democratic association on 9 June,  Dmytro Pavlychko, elected as the association's chairman on 1  June, stated that at present the forces of the "right" had their  candidates in 73 of the 113 constituencies where the elections  to the Supreme Council of Ukraine are to be held on 24 July, all  of whom will be granted the association's material and moral  support. He admitted that to do this will be difficult as the  national democrats have been accused by the "leftists" in the  course of the pre-election campaign of causing the country-wide  economic crisis and the impoverishment of the people, and a  similar situation might recur. Dmytro Pavlychko underlined that  he only agreed to take charge of the association after the  People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh, NRU] pledged it had no  intention of seceding from the bloc.    Dmytro Pavlychko, Oleksandr Lavrynovych (people's deputy,  Rukh), Pavlo Movchan (people's deputy, "Statehood" grouping),  Volodymyr Klymchuk (chairman, Liberal Democratic Party of  Ukraine), and others who took part in the news conference  emphasized that to the national democrats, today "the issue of  primary importance is parliamentary elections, rather than that  of the presidential election in Ukraine," as the forces of the  "right" oppose a presidential election altogether.    As for supporting a particular candidacy, it was stated that  so far, the national democrats lack a common point of view and  it is likely that they will continue to lack one in the period  before 26 June [presidential election date]. In Oleksandr  Lavrynovych's words, the decision to support a particular  candidacy will be made by NRU regional branches. Dmytro  Pavlychko told the news conference that as the result of  analyzing the candidates' pre-election platforms, there is no  candidacy among those nominated that would satisfy the forces of  the "right" entirely. "By way of politically dreaming," in  Dmytro Pavlychko's words, the current situation is optimal: that  is, Leonid Kravchuk is president and all his opponents in the  pre-election contest, except for Leonid Kuchma, are members of  the government.    It was stated at the news conference that the "Ukraine"  democratic association will seek the agreement of Ivan Plyushch,  Volodymyr Lanovyy, Valeriy Babych, and Petro Talanchuk to  withdraw their candidacies in favor of Leonid Kravchuk, as "it  is Kravchuk alone who can hold out against Kuchma" on the  condition that all democratic forces unite.    It was announced at the news conference that Levko  Lukyanenko  [former head of the association] left the leadership of the  association "for personal reasons" and he will not stand in the  elections on 24 July. Mykhayo Horyn [chairman of the Ukrainian  Republican Party, URP] added that Levko Lukyanenko would pursue  a political career in the URP.</p>

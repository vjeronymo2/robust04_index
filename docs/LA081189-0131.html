			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GEIGER COUNTERS TO CHOCOLATE ROSES;  </P> <P> TRADE FAIR AT UCI FEATURES FIRMS OWNED BY MINORITIES AND WOMEN  </P> <P> In 1981, Doug Watt was an IBM service technician ready for a risk. He quit his  job, opened a company called Best Business Machines in Laguna Niguel, and  looked for business.  </P> <P> Last month, Watt signed a $50,000 maintenance contract with UC Irvine, and by  the end of the year he expects his company to sell $900,000 worth of business  machines and service. Next year, sales should top $1 million, he said.  </P> <P> While Watt's success is not uncommon in Orange County, one thing sets him  apart: He's an American Indian.  </P> <P> Watt was one of 55 vendors who gathered Thursday at UCI to peddle their wares  at Spotlite '89, the university's second annual business trade fair for  minority- and women-owned businesses.  </P> <P> The event, Orange County's largest gathering of minority vendors, drew buyers  from throughout Southern California to view products ranging from chocolate  roses to Geiger counters.  </P> <P> Most of the buyers represented companies or institutions that are required by  the government to purchase some portion of their goods and services from  minority-owned businesses. Among the shoppers were representatives from  McDonnell Douglas and the University of California system.  </P> <P> UC Irvine, probably the largest buyer at the show, leads California  universities in purchases from minority businesses, according to Mel Davis, the  university's small-business coordinator.  </P> <P> In 1989, the university has spent 12% of its $30-million purchasing budget to  buy laboratory equipment, sheets and towels, and more from minority businesses.  About 7% has gone to minorities and 5% to women.  </P> <P> Officials from UC Riverside attending the fair also said their campus spends 5%  to 15% of their purchasing department's budget with minority businesses.  </P> <P> "Just about everything here is something that we might buy," said Russ Lewis,  UC Riverside's purchasing manager. "We've bought water purifiers, (book)  binders and other things from companies that are here."  </P> <P> Vendors at the show noted that sales only begin there; the real negotiations  start after the booths are taken down.  </P> <P> "We sell mostly to large groups like the university or corporations, so people  don't make orders here," said Arlene Roach, senior account representative for  Extend-A-Life, a 6-year-old Pasadena-based company which sells  earthquake-survival kits. "They just want to ask questions about things."  </P> <P> Other companies sold tools made by Latinos, graphic design by blacks and  radioactive sensors by women.  </P> <P> One of the show's biggest hits was a display of chocolate roses, chocolate  false teeth, chocolate tool kits and even chocolate surfboards by the Chocolate  Florist in Irvine.  </P> <P> "Several people today have bought chocolate computers," said Pat Pardoen, who  opened the shop 1 1/2 years ago. "But mostly, they just look at the stuff and  can't stop laughing, they like it so much."  </P></p>

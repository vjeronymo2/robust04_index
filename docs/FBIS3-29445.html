			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It is known that with Japan and the United States  being locked in confrontation over automobiles and mobile  phones, the U.S. firm Motorola has asked the Japan Mobile  Communications Company [JMCC] to set numerical targets for the  purchase of its mobile phones. In response, JMCC has rejected  this request by claiming that "making any commitment to our  future purchase of mobile phones runs counter to free  competition." This is the first time that Motorola, Inc. has  asked for numerical targets, in taking advantage of the recent  Japanese-U.S. mobile-phone friction, which has its roots in the  "1989 Japanese-U.S. agreement." It has become clear that  Motorola, Inc. has a strategy of pressing Japan not only to  increase the number of ground relay stations serving it but also  to increase the purchase of its mobile phones.    JMCC has decided to invest 30 billion yen in building more  ground relay stations for Motorola's mobile-phone service in  Japan over the next two or three years. The U.S. mobile-phone  company expects the number of its subscribers to grow to 450,000  by the end of 1996. Motorola, Inc. has asked JMCC to place  orders for 225,000 sets of Motorola-made mobile phones within 45  days after Japanese subscribe to Motorola's mobile-phone  service. The U.S. mobile phone company also has asked JMCC to  increase the ground relay stations available to it "two years  earlier than planned."    Motorola, Inc. is posed to press Japan for the simultaneous  expansion of market access and purchases, but JMCC is resisting  this pressure, asserting, "The Japanese mobile-phone market will  be liberalized in April, and we cannot accept the request of  Motorola, Inc."    Motorola's request, which was made just before 15 February,  which is the deadline set by the U.S. Government for a survey of  the Japanese mobile-phone market, was an "ultimatum." For this  reason, the growing opinion is that the breakdown of the  Japanese-U.S. framework talks has influenced the United States  to "confirm Japan's violation of the Japanese-U.S. agreement."</p>

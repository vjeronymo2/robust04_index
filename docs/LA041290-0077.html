			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE EXHIBIT FUND-RAISER SET  </P> <P> The California Wine Patrons, still $50,000 short of its goal for funding of the  Hernando Courtright California Wine Exhibit in Los Angeles, announced it will  kick off a final fund-raising campaign in May, seeking 50 more wineries as  supporting members.  </P> <P> Raoul Balcaen, president of the Patrons, said the initial funding campaign  raised $800,000, allowing the exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of  Science and Industry to open last Dec. 4.  </P> <P> He said letters will be sent to wineries that have not yet joined the exhibit  as sponsors, seeking support based on the wineries' case production.  </P> <P> The exhibit covers 2,500 square feet of space in a lower level of the museum.  It is aimed at educating consumers about the wine industry.  </P> <P> Included are computer-based interactive exhibits that look at wine making,  pairing wine with food, wine aromas, and the various microclimates of the state  and what makes them unique.  </P> <P> There even is a computer that examines what the body's blood-alcohol level  would be under various levels of consumption of table wine.  </P> <P> For information on the wine exhibit fund-raising campaign contact: Raoul  Balcaen, 221 Woodruff Ave., Los Angeles 90024.  </P></p>

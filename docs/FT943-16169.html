Mr Hossack added: 'Whatever plug is fitted to appliances will effectively dictate the plug and socket system that the country uses. There would be no incentive for the consumer to fit the new harmonised system when rewiring if he had to cut off the plug supplied with the appliance.' The new regulations are strongly supported by the UK plug and socket industry and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents on safety grounds.

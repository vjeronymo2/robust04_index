			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Museums for fun - Christmas shows WHATEVER one thinks of it as a political nostrum, 'back to basics' is sound advice for anyone intending to give the family something to see and think about this Christmas. I recommend London's Big Three; the British Museum, the National Gallery, and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Of those three, the BM surely must come first especially if it some time since you saw the old lady of Bloomsbury. In which case, you have yet to catch up on the shimmering splendour of the Hotung Gallery. This vast gallery of the Far East extends along the length of the north facade, from the colourful ceramic statues of Chinese sages to the drowsy eroticism of the Amuravati temple sculptures. Five of the BM's galleries have been refurbished recently with a gift the Sacklers. They redisplay spectacular collections from ancient Mesapotamia, Anatolia, Nubia, and Egypt. Early Egypt was opened this autumn, and offers ghoulish visitors the well-preserved corpse of Predynastic Man. However, Egypt is 'done' in GCSE, so it may not be the great novelty. Redress the balance by inspecting the spine-chilling Great Death Pit of Ur from 2500 BC, with the jewellery which adorned dozens of ritually slaughtered priestesses and the harps to which they might have listened. Who could fail to respond to the gold statuette of the Ram in the Thicket? Replicas of the Royal Game of Ur are on sale. Games-players must see the The Art of the Chess Piece (until January 9, free). For the first time since their discovery in 1853, it reunites all 78 of the Lewis Chessmen, the famous 12th-century ivory pieces found in the Outer Hebrides. Private collectors have lent 50 rare chess sets, some charming, some comical, some kitsch. Also at the BM this winter, Old Master Drawings from Chatsworth (until January 9) is full of beautiful things and free. But unless your child is K. Clark in the making, the clear choice is Deities and Devotion; the Arts of Hinduism (until April 10; adults Pounds 2). This beautiful exhibition sets out to explain Hinduism. The gallery is painted in hot red and yellow, hung with superb textiles, and stuffed with images of elephants and spritely monsters. For the family trail and workshops, phone 071-328-8511/8854. The National Gallery is putting on magic shows with someone called The Great Xar. He or she is billed to appeal to all ages and the illusions relate to pictures in the collection. Daily from December 28 to January 3 in the Sainsbury Wing lecture theatre; entry free, no booking (071-839-3321). At the Victoria and Albert Museum there is no more beautiful exhibition in London than Gates of Mystery; the Arts of Holy Russia (until January 3; open Tuesday to Sunday). It is perhaps not one to risk on children since a flop will cost you dear, with entry charges to the museum and then to the show. Yet the V&amp;A always does well by children. From now until January 9, activities include Beatrix Potter story-times, drawing workshops, drama, and a gallery trail based on Christmas card imagery. The first Christmas card, sent by the V&amp;A's first director, Sir Henry Cole, in 1843, will be on display and entries can already be submitted for the best home-made card, to be exhibited in the museum. . For details; 071-938-8638. Another sure success is the National Army Museum in Chelsea (free; 071-730-0717). The Waterloo Gallery has strangely effective models and one of my favourite curiosities, the battlefield made by the unlucky Captain Siborne in 1830. A manic achievement, it is 410 sq. ft. with 75,000 tin soldiers. A new gallery, the Victorian Soldier opens on November 26 and shows one of the museum's particular strengths, its Crimean collection, as well as many other conflicts. You will see Lord Raglan's telescope, breeches holed by the Boer, the stuffed remains of Crimean Tom who was heard miaowing in the ruins of Odessa and brought back to England. War might not be the obvious choice for a Christmas jaunt, yet this splendid museum certainly gives the family something serious to talk about.</p>

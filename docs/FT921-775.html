			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bank Austria set back by foreign loans BANK Austria, Austria's largest bank, yesterday announced a 13 per cent decline in 1991 operating profits and a charge of Sch7.5bn (Dollars 640.5m) against earnings, mostly to cover losses from foreign loans. Mr Alfons Haiden, chairman, traced the earnings drop to the costs of last year's merger between Landerbank and Zentralsparkasse, which led to the creation of the bank. He also cited a weak Austrian stock market and growing competition in the Austrian financial sector. Operating profit fell to Sch3.31bn from Sch3.88bn in 1990, the year before the merger. Partial operating profit, which does not include trading income, declined 9 per cent to Sch2.06bn from Sch2.25bn. The dividend is being held at 14 per cent. The bank's biggest headache was the disastrous investments made by the US and UK branches of the old Landerbank. For 1991, Bank Austria had to take charges of Sch700m for troubled loans in the US and Sch2bn for those in the UK. The acquisition of the UK leasing company Soverign generated a deficit of Sch1.2bn.</p>

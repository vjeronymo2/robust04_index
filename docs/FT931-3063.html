			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Observer: Howe'zat? In case you were wondering why Lord Howe was not around to watch the British Budget, the answer is that he was away in Luxembourg receiving a prize for his distinguished services in pursuit of European unity. The prize is awarded by FVS Foundation of Hamburg in memory of Joseph Bech (1887-1975) who was foreign minister of Luxembourg for 33 years, and was twice prime minister while continuing his foreign office duties. Even Lord Howe, who, as Sir Geoffrey, was chancellor of the exchequer then foreign secretary under Margaret Thatcher, can't compete with that. But he was very pleased to receive the prize, though slightly sorry about the date.</p>

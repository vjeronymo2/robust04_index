			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Nordic bourses hopeful after extremes of 1992 - But there are reasons why analysts are only cautiously optimistic Nordic stock exchange performance diverged strongly in 1992. The region produced the worst performer in Denmark, which registered a 26 per cent fall on the FT-Actuaries index, as well as two of the more notable 'winners', with Sweden up 16.63 per cent and Finland up 12.85 per cent. Norway came in between these extremes with a decline of 10.67 per cent. These, however, are just the local currency figures. A different picture emerges when performance is assessed in dollar terms, highlighting the effect of the devaluations which Finland, Sweden and Norway were forced to carry out last year. On this basis, Sweden dropped 8.6 per cent and Finland by 10.78 per cent, and the falls in both Oslo and Copenhagen were further exacerbated. Common factors were shared by all four markets. These included weak international demand, high unemployment, financial sector problems, falling real estate prices, and generally high interest rates. But whereas bourses in Finland, Sweden and Norway registered considerable gains after these countries floated their currencies, Denmark held firm at the price of high interest rates, and share prices suffered accordingly. There were other special factors, such as weak shipping markets, which had a negative influence on both the Norwegian and Danish stock markets but virtually no effect in Sweden and Finland. In 1993, investors will have to stay selective, particularly in Sweden and Finland where share prices have already rallied strongly over recent months. Most analysts are cautiously optimistic about the outlook in all four countries, although much will depend on what happens to the world economy and domestic interest rates. One important negative influence is likely to be the weakening state of demand in Germany, the most important export market for both Denmark and Sweden. In Denmark, the market's short-term concerns will be political, following Mr Poul Schluter's resignation as prime minister over the Tamil refugees scandal. But a second Maastricht vote is also looming on the horizon and the hope is that a 'yes' vote will be as positive for the market this year as last June's 'no' was damaging for sentiment. In 1992, share prices on the Copenhagen stock exchange never recovered from this blow, although the real damage was done later in the year when currency turmoil forced Denmark to raise its interest rates and competitor countries to devalue. That left Danish exporters uncompetitive and put the domestic economy under considerable strain. There were other negative influences: losses in the banking sector, for example, and the collapse of one of the country's main insurers, Hafnia. This year, financial sector problems are expected to continue, but the corporate sector should benefit from recent restructuring and lower import prices, and domestic demand is expected to pick up. The biggest worry will be the outlook for exports, if the krona remains at its current level. Helsinki was due for a revival in 1992, after its poor showing in recent years; but this only manifested itself late in the year, once interest rates started to move down decisively following the decision to float the markka in September. For much of the year, sentiment was overshadowed by recession and the banking crisis, helping to drag the Hex index to a five and a half year low of 548 on September 4; after that share prices surged by more than 50 per cent by December 30. While this suggests that the revival may not have much further to go, a number of positive influences are still working in Finland's favour. They include an improving economic outlook - GNP is set to grow by some 1 per cent this year - the recent removal of restrictions on foreign share ownership and more equitable tax treatment of capital gains. Stockholm's Affarsvarlden General index, more broadly based than its FT-Actuaries equivalent, ended 1992 at 912, exactly where it began. But that disguised three distinct phases: a rise to 1,000 on May 11; a tumble of 36 per cent by October 5; and a recovery which produced a 42 per cent increase from the bottom by the year-end. The feeling is that the index may struggle to make further headway in the near future, given the dire state of the domestic economy, the continuing banking crisis and the fact that much of the projected rise in profits for the big exporters has already been discounted by recent rises. A devaluation of just 5 per cent in the value of the Norwegian krone meant the impact on share values in Oslo was less spectacular than in either Stockholm or Helsinki, and the country's total index fell by 10 per cent to 372 during the year. Weak freight markets, which brought the shipping index down 34.9 per cent to 308 in 1992, were a big factor. The banking sector, which took a severe pummelling in 1991, only fell a further 1.1 per cent in spite of its continuing problems, but the insurance sector was depressed by the poor performance and eventual collapse of Uni Storebrand, the country's leading insurer. In 1993, the shipping sector should benefit from a stronger dollar and improved market conditions. It is also expected to be the year in which the long-running crisis in the Norwegian banking sector finally starts to turn. This has left market analysts confident of an improvement in share prices, although they may not materialise until the second half of the year when interest rates should be lower.</p>

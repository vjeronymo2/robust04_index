			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Russia's privatisation auctions delayed a month RUSSIA will begin auctioning off shares in state-owned enterprises not this month but next, starting with the sale of 40 per cent of the stock of a producer of transistor radios and television sets. Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, deputy chairman of the Committee for Managing State Property, said that legislation requiring notice of between two weeks and one month for share auctions made it impossible to hold trial auctions in November as planned. The first auction of shares will be held on December 15, using Elex, a radio producer based in Vladimir outside Moscow, as a guinea pig. Elex, which has already sold 60 per cent of its shares to its managers and 7,000 workers, says it is profitable and would like to attract foreign investors. The authorities claim only 10-20 per cent of state-owned enterprises are potentially bankrupt, as opposed to bigger figures quoted by the opponents of mass privatisation.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: MTM cuts deficit to Pounds 11.9m MTM, the chemicals company which in April sold most of its assets to reduce debt, yesterday announced a reduction in losses from Pounds 28m to Pounds 11.9m pre-tax in the six months to end-June. The deficit bore exceptional charges of Pounds 9.64m (Pounds 9.34m). MTM has been reorganised under a reshuffled board since its shares collapsed last year when a Serious Fraud Office enquiry was launched hard on the heels of the company making two profit warnings in March 1992. Mr David Swallow, the new chairman, said the company, which has Pounds 10.8m in cash after the Pounds 100m sale of assets to rivals BTP, planned to invest in new categories of 'science-based' businesses. He said: 'The figures have limited relevance to the company's on-going position with the exception of MTM Agrochemicals which remains within the group.' Turnover of Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 56.5m) included Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 45m) from discontinued operations. Turnover on continuing operations - MTM Agrochemicals - rose to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 11.5m). That business contributed an operating profit of Pounds 296,000 compared with losses of Pounds 10.3m in the previous period, which reflected provisions for permanent diminution in assets following a revaluation. Mr Swallow said that seasonal fluctuations in demand for MTM Agrochemicals meant the second half would not match the first: 'However, the board continues to expect the business to break even for the year as a whole.' Total operating profits were Pounds 1.51m (loss of Pounds 9.45m). The Pounds 9.64m exceptional charge represented a Pounds 31.3m loss on disposal of discontinued operations, including Pounds 25.4m of goodwill previously written off, partly offset by a Pounds 21.7m provision made in 1992. Net interest payments were Pounds 3.77m (Pounds 4.78m). Losses per share emerged at 60.6p, down from 157p. Following a Pounds 28.9m debt into equity swap, net liabilities of Pounds 23.5m in the December 31 balance sheet had become net assets of Pounds 20m, or 77p per share, by the half-way stage. There is again no interim dividend.</p>

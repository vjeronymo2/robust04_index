			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Zhang Jianming [1728 0494 7686]] </F>   [Text] In order to turn Guizhou Province into an important  southern energy base, and hasten the economic development of the  people in its mountainous areas, national government  organizations have turned their thoughts and plans toward giving  every assist and support for speeding up construction of  Guizhou's energy, transportation, and telecommunications bases,  and toward getting on with a number of accelerated development  projects that need to be finished.    Guizhou is the coal bin for all of the nine southern  provinces, and rapid development of its coal reserves will go a  long way to solving the coal shortages in the other provinces.  The new projects selected for construction are the 2.4 million  ton Panbei coal-dressing plant, the 900,000 ton Dawan shaft  mine, the 1.8 million ton Jinwa mine, and the 4 million ton  Feitian mine at Zhijin. The decision has also been made to  expand the Dahebian coal mine from 600,000 tons to 1.2 million  tons, and the Tucheng mine from 1.2 million to 2.4 million tons.    Guizhou has complementary advantages in coal and hydropower,  which makes it a major source of energy for the south.  Construction of the 1,200MW Anshun power plant will get underway  next year, and ground breaking for the Hongjiadu power plant  with 540MW of installed capacity is in sight. Early-stage  preparations are also being made for the 680MW Sanbanxi power  plant, 600MW Duyun power plant, 2,000MW Goubitan power plant,  and the 840MW Silin power plant.    On the transportation scene, accelerated construction of the  Nan Kun rail line, work on the Xiaoyunshang to Shuicheng, and  Huangtong to Zhijin lines, and early preparations for the Duyun  to Maolan line are all going on at the same time. In addition to  that, construction will soon be underway on the first-class  highways from Shanghai to Wanding (passing through Yuping,  Guiyang, Anshun, Xingyi in Guizhou and into Yunnan), and from  Chongqing to Nanning (passing through Zunyi, Guiyang, Duyun, and  Mawei in Guizhou, and on into Guangxi). National authorities are  also interested in construction of airports, such as the  Longdongbao international airport now being built, and which, it  is hoped, will be open to traffic in 1996, and small airports in  other places for which early preparatory work is underway.    Progress has been slow on construction of telecommunications  in Guizhou. It was decided that in the "Eighth 5-Year Plan," two  major cable lines would be built through Guizhou, one from  Nanning to Kunming (passing through Xingyi, Anlong and Ceheng in  Guizhou), and from Fuzhou to Chongqing (passing through Tongren,  Kaili, Duyun, Guiyang, and Zunyi in Guizhou). These two lines,  and the line from Guiyang to Xingyi that Guizhou will build  itself, will greatly improve telecommunications to most places  in Guizhou, and efforts are being made to get an 800,000-user  stored program controlled telephone system with telephone  connections to all counties and towns in the province in place  by the end of the century.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fatinah al-Dajani: "Prince Hasan: We Are </F> Willing to Sign Peace Treaty After Settling Outstanding  Questions With Israel"]    [Text] London -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hasan Bin-Talal  has said that Jordan is willing to sign a peace treaty with  Israel when all outstanding questions related to border  demarcation, refugees, water, and security, in addition to the  final status of Jerusalem, have been settled. He added that  peace arrangements have to be made on all tracks, including the  Syrian and Lebanese tracks.    He proposed several mechanisms to solve some problems like  setting up a border committee to demarcate the border and  setting up a center for resolving disputes in the Middle East.    In a lecture delivered at the Royal Armed Forces Institute  for General Studies in London yesterday, he pointed out that the  Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli working committee set up to examine  issues that concern Jordan "could be upgraded to ministerial  level."    He said that "last year's events opened the door to peace in  the Middle East, and mutual recognition between the PLO and  Israel gave the region an unprecedented opportunity to resolve  the Arab-Israeli dispute." He added that the historic agreement  on Gaza and Jericho "is another step in the right direction."    He went on: "We have reached the stage in which the concept  of peace should be negotiated in detail." He pointed to the  existence of "numerous issues which should be negotiated before  reaching a comprehensive peace. And Jordan will be willing to  reach a peace treaty when the questions included on the agenda  we have reached with Israel have been discussed and resolved in  a manner acceptable to all parties." He pointed out that among  these issues are "the border, refugees, security, and water,  which are the essence of peacemaking."    He said that it is difficult to reach arrangements regarding  these questions before the border and security questions have  been resolved. Because it is illogical to talk about Jordanian  and Israeli concerns and interests before determining what  "Jordan" and "Israel" are. He described the settlements as a  time bomb which the organizations opposed to peace and settlers  can use to obstruct the peace process. He said that "peace  cannot be achieved in these conditions."    He pointed out that Jordan had made several proposals to  tackle the border and security problems. They included setting  up a border committee to try to demarcate the border in a bid to  achieve a lasting regional peace. As for the refugees, "we are  negotiating within the boundaries of international law."    He said that the final status of Jerusalem is one of the  issues attracting great interest and preoccupying the world as a  whole. He urged "clear separation between the religious and the  political" with respect to the city, because Jerusalem belongs  to all religions, hence no single state should have full  sovereignty over it.    He added: "We have made detailed proposals on this  separation, because we believe that a suitable solution to the  Jerusalem issue is necessary in the search for peace."    He added that Jordan has also implemented several  confidence-building measures, including opening banks in the  occupied Palestinian territories, signing an economic agreement  with the Palestinians, training Palestinian police, and setting  up a Jordanian-Israeli-U.S. committee to examine questions that  concern Jordan.    He called for drawing up a framework for cooperation and  security in the Middle East along the lines of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, in order to achieve a  lasting peace in the region. He added that that conference does  not represent an alternative to the peace process but  complements it. He called for establishing a free zone for  trade in the Middle East allowing manpower, goods, capital, and  services to move freely. He said that securing a Middle East  free trade agreement (MEFTA) would give the region the  opportunity to play a constructive role in the world economy.  He also said that a program similar to the GATT in Europe might  be the best way to handle the economic burdens of the  Arab-Israeli dispute and to establish a sound trade and  investment system.    He stressed that "peace should be comprehensive and just, so  that it will be a lasting peace. And everyone should be given  the opportunity and the tools to play a role in building a new  Middle East system." He said that the Arab-Israeli conflict has  had an impact on the region as a whole and resulted in the  accumulation of debts and demographic pressures on states with  limited resources. However, he pointed out that Jordan will do  its utmost to help the self-rule areas.    Asked about economic integration and its threats to the  Middle East region in view of the Israeli superiority, he said  that, in view of the lack of a concept and a mechanism for these  matters, they should be discussed in the framework of the  multilateral talks concerning the Middle East.    Answering a question put to him, he said that the dispute in  Yemen reminds us of the strategic importance of the Red Sea.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN SEMINARS FOR CHILDREN  </P> <P> Three children's gardening workshops will be held Saturday at the Ralph M.  Parsons Discovery Center of the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The first of the workshops, called "Seeds for Summer Gardens" will begin at  1:30 p.m. Due to limited space, 125 children will be admitted to each workshop  on a first-come, first-served basis.  </P> <P> Each workshop will last half an hour.  </P> <P> Each child will be provided with enough of "Jack's Magic Bean," a Dutch  climbing pole bean from the Rosemary Clooney Herb Garden in Long Beach, to make  a tent-shaped bean-vine teepee. "Giant Greystripe Sunflower," "Jack o'Lantern  Pumpkin" or "Crackerjack Marigold" seed will be offered for embellishment.  </P> <P> Each child will propagate seeds for warm weather growing to transplant later  into his own garden.  </P> <P> Admission to the Discovery Center is included with the admission price to the  museum, and costs $3 for an adult, $1.50 for seniors over 62 years and students  over 12; 75 cents for children ages 5 to l2, and free for children 5 years old  and under.  </P></p>

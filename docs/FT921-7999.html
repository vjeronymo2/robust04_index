			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Greek deputy PM quits over economy MR Athanassios Kanellopoulos, Greek deputy prime minister, resigned yesterday after criticising the government's economic policy as ineffective, Reuter reports from Athens. One of the most senior members of the ruling conservative New Democracy party, he was the fifth cabinet member to resign or be sacked in the past year. Mr Kanellopoulos said in a newspaper interview earlier this month that the government's economic policy was unfair and unimaginative, prompting strong reaction from other government officials.</p>

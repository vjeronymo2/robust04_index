			<p>BFN     [Text] Cologne -- ERNK's [National Liberation Front of  Kurdistan] European Mission issued a statement in which it  indicated that despite the PKK's [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  capabilities it has so far not resorted to assassinations but  from now on it will not be a mere spectator to developments, and  said: "The businessmen, parliamentarians, policemen, officers,  mayors, circles helping the state and their kin will definitely  be targets from now on."    ERNK's European Mission issued a statement in connection  with  the murders of Kurdish businessmen Savas Buldan and his friends,  and Muhsin Melik, a leading HADEP [People's Democracy Party]  official.    Indicating that the state is murdering the Kurdish patriots  because it is helpless in the face of the Kurdish national  liberation struggle, the statement said: "Following Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller's statement that `I have a list of those  helping the PKK,' the counter-guerrilla group, which runs the  state, stepped up its sinister operations, which can be  described as the massacre of civilians. As indicated by the  incident involving Serif Avsar in the past, the president  [Suleyman Demirel] is directly involved in these murders."    Stressing that the press is making enormous efforts to  distort the causes of these murders, the statement said: "For  the sake of the credits they obtain [from the state], the  Turkish press and television, primarily HURRIYET and MILLIYET,  have assumed the ignoble duty of covering up the murders of  civilians by knowingly lying."    Indicating that in the murder of Muhsin Melik and Savas  Buldan and of others before them, one should discern the policy  of genocide being pursued by the Turkish Government against the  Kurdish nation, the statement said: "After this developments,  the Kurdish people and its vanguards have acquired the right to  retaliate in kind."    Indicating that despite its capabilities the PKK has not  resorted to assassinations so far, the statement said: "Despite  its capabilities, the PKK has tried to act with sensitivity and  responsibility on this issue. However, at this stage it can no  longer remain a mere spectator to this state terrorism against  our people. Therefore, it is resolved to demand an accounting  for the murdered Kurdish patriots. Similarly, our people should  use their right of self-defense. If the state is massacring us  in Kurdistan, then we must retaliate in kind in the cities.  Businessmen, parliamentarians and their kin, policemen and  officers and their kin, circles helping the state and their kin  will henceforth definitely become targets. Similarly, mayors  and their kin, and those who are hostile to the national  liberation struggle will also become targets."</p>

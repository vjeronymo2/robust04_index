			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 8 Jan -- The opening of the Russian  parliament, the Federal Assembly, which is scheduled to take  place in three days, may be called the final result of the  election marathon of last November and December.    The first sessions of the chambers will be held on 11  January. They will sit separately because the Constitution does  not provide for a ceremony of a joint opening session of the two  parliamentary chambers. The chambers may sit together to hear  messages from the president and the Constitutional Court and  speeches of the leaders of foreign states, as well as on the  occasions when the president of the country takes the oath of  allegiance. [passage omitted]    In accordance with the Constitution of the Russian  Federation, the Russian president is to open the first session  of the upper chamber of the parliament.    The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from well-informed  sources in the Kremlin that there are no plans for a "big  opening speech" by the president in connection with the  beginning of the parliament's work. It will most probably be  just a message to the elected deputies, wishing them success.    According to the same source, Boris Yeltsin is planning a  long program speech at a joint session of the two parliamentary  chambers a little later, shortly after the Federal Assembly  begins its work. It has been revealed that economic, political  and social aspects of reform in Russia will be touched upon in  that speech. At the moment it is still unknown in what form the  president is going to convey it to the deputies; that is,  whether it will be a message or whether he will deliver the  speech in person.</p>

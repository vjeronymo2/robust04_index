The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 6, 1994, the NASD put into effect a rule prohibiting the execution of a short sale in NM securities at or below the current inside bid when that inside bid is below the previous inside bid. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  In part, the NASD's rule provides an exemption for qualified Amex options specialists and Registered Options Traders (``Traders'') for which the Exchange has also established rules to provide for this exemption for those members. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange now seeks to extend the exemption to certain short sales of a company that is involved in a publicly announced merger or acquisition with the issuer of a stock underlying an option that is eligible for the exemption pursuant to Amex Rule 957 and the NASD's short sale rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34277 (June 29, 1994), 59 FR 34885. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34632 (September 2, 1994), 59 FR 46999. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange's proposal recognizes that when an NM security becomes involved in a merger or acquisition, specialists and traders may need to hedge positions in options on the NM security by buying or selling shares of stock of the other company involved in the merger or acquisition, whether or not the other company's stock has listed overlying options. Indeed, where there are no options on that stock, buying or selling the stock itself may at times be the only feasible way for a specialist or trader to hedge a position in options on the NM security, given the risk arbitrage relationship that is likely to exist between the two stocks. The proposed rule change will facilitate hedging by options specialists and traders by allowing them to sell short shares of the ``other'' company involved in the merger for hedging purposes and designate those short sales as exempt from the NASD's short sale rule. The Exchange believes that its proposed rule change will enhance the ability of specialists and traders to perform their market-making functions, which will contribute to the liquidity of the market for options, as well as the market for stocks of both companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act. Specifically, the Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex believes that the proposed rule change will not impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Observer: Still kicking Britain's high-minded music critics seem to have been caught off-guard, if not downright disappointed, by the fact that the 76-year-old Frank Sinatra can still thrill a Royal Albert Hall packed with folk looking for something more than a trip down memory lane. Ready to gloat at the dimming of the ol' blue eyes, the critics seemed to have their worst prejudices vindicated by the presence of banks of autocues, not to mention an in-ear hearing aid. On his first night in London of this heavily flagged European tour, Sinatra managed to introduce his wife, seated in the audience, twice over, and later tried to leave the stage by the wrong exit. But even his detractors could not but be awed by the vast stage presence, and the, as ever, impeccable sense of timing. An ageing voice jarred more in the spoken asides than when he sang. Anyone with the temerity to argue Sinatra should have put his feet up long ago might care to compare his current rendering of 'Witchcraft' with that of a 1957 recording, re-released on CD - the considerably more youthful version, bland, even banal, certainly with none of the beguiling quality that so captivates today.</p>

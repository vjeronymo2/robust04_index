			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 19, IRNA -- A Persian daily said  Tuesday that the oppressed nations of the world have no  alternative but to turn their back to the existing international  bodies and try to form a centre which could really demonstrate  the will of the nations.    `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' in its editorial commented on the siege  of Gorazde and criticized the United Nations, the U.S. and the  majority of European governments for showing green light to the  Serbs.    Turning to the developments in Gorazde, the daily said that  the aggression took place in the very presence of U.N. Forces  who were stationed in the town as protectors of peace and  security but did nothing to prevent the Serbs.    It lashed out at the U.N. for not condemning the Serbs for  their explicit breach of its approvals and stressed that such an  indifferent attitude further emboldened the Serbs to continue  their aggression.    The criminal Serbs not only did not abide by any war  regulations and attacked the defenceless people, but even  deployed chemical weapons which are internationally banned, said  the paper.    It criticized the dual standards shown by the Security  Council in connection with crisis in Bosnia and said that while  the Council would hastily issue a statement for the death of a  Zionist it would fail to show any reaction towards the genocide  in Gorazde.    The daily stressed that this proved once again that the  Security Council has no desire to enforce its approvals or the  internationally respected regulations when interests of the  oppressed nations are at risk.    The daily said that the U.S. statesmen, including President  Bill Clinton, did not interfere in the issue because their  interests were not involved. It also proved that the new world  order, masterminded by the U.S., is nothing but giving a wider  dimension to aggression in order to plunder nations and increase  Washington's influence.    The daily touched on the call by President Alija Izetbegovic  for the resignation of U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and said this was the least measure expected in  return for the procrastination the world body.    The proper measure, said the article, is that the United  Nations be dissolved since it is a tool in the hands of tyrant  and oppressive powers who are supporting the criminals.    The reality is that the oppressed nations have no way but to  turn their back to the present international gatherings and try  to establish a centre that would serve as a real forum for  demonstrating the will of the nations, the daily noted.    The takeover of Gorazde is the cry of death of the United  Nations, it concluded.</p>

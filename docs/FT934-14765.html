			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UN to secure Bosnian bridge BRITISH engineers are preparing to begin repairs to a key bridge in Bosnia to open up relief routes before winter in what the United Nations has described as its biggest and most dangerous humanitarian operation to date. The team of engineers will spend six weeks repairing the bridge over the River Neretva, which at one point runs through the city of Mostar. Moslem and Croat forces are locked in a battle for control of the region's strategic river valley. Repairs to the bridge would reopen an important lifeline into central Bosnia. Colonel Bill Aikman, spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force, said once the area around the bridge was secured 'we are going to defend it'. He said he would not preclude the calling in of air strikes if his team were attacked. The UN's Spanish battalion today will start to advance on the valley, accompanied by engineers, to secure the bridge, partially destroyed by Bosnian Croat forces in May. Despite threats and numerous violations, Nato fighter aircraft policing a ban on flights over Bosnia, in force since last October, have never launched a single air strike. General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb military commander, has brazenly flouted the no-fly zone. While leaders of all three ethnic communities on July 30 agreed to allow the free passage of aid convoys, Serb and Croat forces have repeatedly blocked the delivery of aid to besieged Moslem enclaves.</p>

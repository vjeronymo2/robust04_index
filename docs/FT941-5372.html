			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: British Rail The merchant bankers advising the government on the piecemeal privatisation of British Rail will have to earn their fees given the complexities of the task. After all, British Rail is a Pounds 3bn-turnover business which will shrink further when divided between Railtrack and various franchise operators. Moreover, the railway network has a poor record, having steadily lost market share to other transport systems for years. It now accounts for just 7 per cent of all passenger miles travelled in the UK and has a similarly small share of the freight market. The goodwill attached to British Rail's name is unlikely to be large. Cast in a rosy light, Railtrack, which will own the track and signalling, could yet emerge as a privatised transport utility stock with a passing resemblance to a ports company or the airports operator, BAA. Its permitted rate of return will be the critical determinant of its saleability. But attracting franchise operators with sufficient capital to exploit the network is an altogether different proposition. Some quoted bus companies, such as Badgerline, have expressed a tentative interest. But they await the results of shadow franchise schemes to give a clearer idea of the relative financial attractions. The Office of Fair Trading has also to determine whether bus operators can run franchises in the same catchment areas. The tasks of co-ordinating different franchisees' operations could be colossal. The franchising director will have to possess the judgment of Solomon to arbitrate between them.</p>

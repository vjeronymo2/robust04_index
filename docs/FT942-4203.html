			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US crop forecast hits wheat prices Wheat prices at the Chicago Board of Trade fell yesterday after the US Department of Agriculture increased its monthly estimate of the US harvest now in progress, and failed to make the expected cuts its projections for crops in China and the former Soviet Union. The USDA's estimates ran counter to private estimates that show China and former Soviet crops under stress from long-term dryness. The department's figures also failed to reflect new data from Oklahoma, where the winter wheat harvest is nearly one-third complete and yields are down substantially from last year, analysts said. Maize and soyabean futures prices rose, as traders continued to focus on unusual dryness in the Midwest. Mr Bill Biedermann, a market analyst with Allendale, was puzzled by the USDA's failure to adjust its crop prospects for the countries that have historically been North America's biggest wheat customers. 'We've been concerned for 30 days about dryness in China and in what used to be Russia. Now the government is saying there is no change in those (wheat) crops from May to June,' he said. The USDA maintained its wheat production estimate for Russia at 38.5m tonnes, though it lowered output for the former Soviet Union to 74.3m tonnes, from 74.8m a month ago. China's crop is projected to be near last year's record, at 105m tonnes. The agency boosted its US winter wheat production estimate to 1.67bn bushels, above market projections for 1.638bn and up from its own estimate of 1.65bn a month ago. The total US wheat crop, including spring wheat, is now estimated at 2.37bn bushels. Analysts said the report, which was based on crop conditions as of June 1, did not reflect new information that the wheat harvest now in progress in Oklahoma, a major winter wheat state, had been disappointing. Farmers in south-western Oklahoma are reporting surprisingly low yields in newly harvested fields. Mr Tom Diel, executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission, says yields are ranging from 20 to 25 bushels an acre, making the USDA's projection of 30 bushels look optimistic. Mr Diel expects, however, that yields will improve as the harvest moves north. 'I'm hoping for a 154 to 155m bushel crop this year,' he says. That would be down about 6 per cent from last year's wheat harvest of 163m bushels.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US trade office sees difficult 1993 A 29 PER CENT rise in the US merchandise trade deficit last year is likely to be followed by a 'potentially difficult' 1993, thanks to the sluggish or negative growth of America's trading partners and increasing US imports, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative, now headed by Mr Mickey Kantor. The US will meet the difficulty with a policy of market-opening measures 'backed by rigorous enforcement of US laws', says the office's annual report on US trade priorities. The report follows trade policy addresses by President Bill Clinton and Mr Kantor, his top trade negotiator, who promised a more 'activist, less passive' trade policy. Superficially there appear to be few changes. Completion of the Uruguay Round remains the top US priority; but the administration will stress in-creased market access through lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers in manufactured and agricultural goods and services. The report mentions the need for market access for telecommunications and audio visual services, areas which put the US and EC on a collision course. The administration insists it will act 'firmly to protect our interests should implementation of the European single market. . . discriminate against US firms or create barriers to US exports'. In the coming year the administration plans to boost the importance of the 'new' issues in trade policy - competition policy and technology policy. 'Issues related to the interaction of trade and environment will be given urgent attention,' and lobbyists expect some environmental provision will be demanded within the Round. The administration remains concerned about the excess supply of steel in the world and supports efforts to negotiate a Multilateral Steel Agreement and the establishment of 'an effective mechanism' to resolve disputes. 'Without the ability to subsidise domestic producers and with the elimination of both tariff and non-tariff barriers, steel trade would be conducted in a more efficient manner.' The trade representative is still consulting Congress about the extension of the fast-track negotiating authority in order to complete the Uruguay Round, the report says.</p>

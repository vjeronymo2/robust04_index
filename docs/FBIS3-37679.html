			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Athens, 18 Feb -- Talks between Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who arrived here yesterday, and Klaus  Kinkel, head of the German foreign policy department, ended in  the early hours. The parties discussed the development of the  situation around the Bosnian conflict in connection with the  positive response to a personal letter from Russian President  Boris Yeltsin from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and  Radovan Karadjic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and also from the  Bosnian Serb parliament. The point is that the sides agreed to  withdraw their heavy guns from a 20-km zone after receiving a  promise that Russian forces would take part in the peace-keeping  operations in the Sarajevo vicinity.    During an intensive dialogue lasting nearly three hours, the  ministers got in touch by telephone from the residence of the  German ambassador in Athens, where the talks took place, with  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher. The parties are aware of the need to  undertake a joint initiative shortly to advance the process of a  settlement around Sarajevo and of the Bosnian conflict as a  whole.    In addition to this, the ministers had an in-depth  discussion  of the state of Russian-German relations in connection with  President Boris Yeltsin's forthcoming visit to Germany,  scheduled for late spring. K. Kinkel invited A. Kozyrev to  visit Germany in order to prepare for the visit, and the Russian  foreign minister will go there at the beginning of May.    Today sees the start of A. Kozyrev's consultations with the  European "troika" -- the former, present, and future presidents  of the Council of the European Union; that is, the foreign  ministers of Belgium, Greece, and Germany -- and also, in all  probability, telephone consultations with British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd and Warren Christopher.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan will have to  shoulder about 15 percent of the United Nations' budget for 1995  to 1997, up from the current 12.45 percent, following a routine  rate revision, Foreign Ministry sources said Thursday [13  January].    Japan will either shoulder 15 percent from 1995, or 13.5  percent in 1995 and raise it to 15 percent by 1997, the sources  said.    The new rates for the U.N. members' contribution for 1995  through 1997 will be decided at the U.N. General Assembly next  fall after a working group on the financial contribution  compiles a report by around August, they said.    It has already been decided that a new method of calculating  the new rates will be adopted, they said.    The U.N. members' contribution rates to the world body's  budget are revised every three years based on each country's  economic indicators such as gross domestic product, per capita  national income and foreign debt.    The U.N. budget, compiled for two-year periods, stands at  2.58 billion dollars for fiscal 1994 and 1995.    Japan's U.N. budget share of 12.45 percent currently ranks  second after the United States, which provides 25 percent.    The U.N. is in serious financial difficulties because many  member countries are in arrears with their contributions and due  to expanded peacekeeping activities.</p>

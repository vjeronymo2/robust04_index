Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from January 7, 1994, through January 21, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2859). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By March 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (Project Director) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Carolina Power &amp; Light Company, Docket No. 50-261, H.

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This change could involve a reduction in personnel radiation exposure by utilizing alarming dosimeters. This change does not involve any plant systems or components which could increase the probability of an accident. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This change could reduce the possibility of an accidental overexposure by alerting personnel when their maximum allowable exposure has been received. This change does not involve any plant systems or components. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Due to the nature of this proposed change, it is not related to any plant system.

The proposed changes implement Generic Letter (GL) 90-09, and would affect the surveillance requirements of TS section 4.7.8 and the bases for these requirements, section 3/4.7.8. Specifically, the amendment would change the existing inspection periods, visual inspection acceptance criteria, and functional test requirements. Additionally, there would be changes to the bases to include reference to GL 90-09, and other editorial changes would be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amended surveillance requirement adds a table that addresses the maximum number of snubber failures that can be tolerated prior to reducing the inspection interval. This number is a function of the population size of a particular type of snubber. The revised requirement will allow the inspection intervals to be compatible with the 24 month fuel cycles, and provisions are included to extend the inspection interval up to 48 months. A provision is included to allow an evaluation to determine operability to justify continued operation with a snubber that is unacceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the amendment request is to provide for alternative inspection intervals that take the size of the population of a snubber type into account. The proposed change provides the same confidence level and allows snubber inspection and corrective action to be performed during refueling outages. This allows the plant to avoid a mid-cycle outage due to a small number of snubber failures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change allows for a small percentage of snubbers in each category to fail the required visual examination without adjusting the inspection frequency. If a statistically significant percentage of snubbers fail, the visual examination inspection interval is reduced based on the percentage of failed snubbers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change has no direct or indirect impact on reactivity management activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change is not expected to have an impact on equipment failures. Any snubbers that fail to meet the visual examination acceptance criteria are either functionally tested in the as-found condition to verify continued acceptability, or an evaluation is performed to demonstrate the acceptability of continued operation with an unacceptable snubber. No new equipment is being introduced and no systems are operated in a configuration that has not been evaluated, so no new failure modes are introduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The affected transients are the design basis earthquake and the spectrum of event initiating transients, with the capability of imposing significant dynamic loads or otherwise which impact the structural integrity of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The snubbers are installed to ensure the structural integrity of the RCS and required support systems. Their failure is passive in nature. The probability of a transient initiating event occurring is unrelated to the existence or condition of equipment that is designed to perform a mitigating function. The snubbers are installed to ensure an acceptable system response to a dynamic load, and their availability does not impact the frequency of occurrence of earthquakes or other transients resulting in significant dynamic loading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised testing provisions are designed to allow some flexibility while still maintaining a high probability that the installed snubbers will be capable of performing their intended function when required. The revised surveillances appropriately consider the size of the population of a particular type of snubber, and are sufficient to ensure the consequences of an accident will be unchanged when the revised requirements are implemented. By maintaining a statistically high level of confidence in the function of the plant's snubbers, the system response to transient initiating events will be as designed and thus, the off-site dose projected to occur of any affected transient will remain acceptably low. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously stated, the revised surveillance provides a high confidence that the affected systems will remain intact and functional. Evaluation of the effects of operating with a degraded snubber is required to ensure that adequate margin exists to support continued plant operation. If this evaluation cannot adequately justify continued operation, the appropriate action statement will be applied. These provisions are sufficient to assure that the probability of an equipment malfunction will not increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consequences of equipment malfunction will not increase. Sufficient redundancy exists to accommodate the complete failure of one train of required equipment. The requisite electrical and physical separation are sufficient to ensure that the redundant train remains unaffected. This redundancy is adequate to ensure that the undetected failure of a snubber will not have a severe impact on overall system response to a transient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The possibility of a new or different type of accident is not created by this change. No new or different equipment is being introduced, and no system will be operated in a different configuration without first having the effects of the new configuration evaluated. The new configuration would be system and/or plant operation with a snubber installed that has failed its visual examination. The required evaluation must be sufficient to provide confidence that continued operation is acceptable; otherwise, the provisions of the action statement will be observed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No reduction in the margin of safety will occur as a result of this proposed change. As previously described, the controls in place will provide a high confidence the affected systems will continue to be functional. No significant increase in the rate of occurrence of undetected inoperable snubbers is expected to occur, and the allowable failures prior to applying an increased test frequency is still a small percentage of the total snubber population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Technical Specification requiring Operability of the PORVs and their block valves does not alter plant operation or configuration in any way. It is current practice to maintain these valves in an Operable condition to meet the requirements of existing Specification 3.1.8, which is applicable when below 430 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. The effect of the proposed changes is to extend the applicability of the Operability requirement for these valves. The addition of PORV Operability requirements when at Hot Standby and above would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Replacing the requirements to vent the PCS through a 1.3 square inch vent with a vent capable of relieving 167 gpm at a pressure less than the Appendix G limits will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an overpressurization event occurring. The 1.3 square inch vent area in Technical Specification 3.1.8 was intended to be a means of protecting the Primary Coolant System (PCS) from exceeding the limit of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, curve following an overpressure transient. Analysis has shown that manual vent valves PC-514 and PC-515 will provide a relief capacity of 167 gpm at a PCS pressure of approximately 115 psig, well below the minimum 331 psig limit (Appendix G curve limit for a 40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F/hr heat-up). This relief capacity will protect the PCS against a pressure transient caused by a maximum charging/letdown imbalance coincident with a 40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F/hr PCS heat-up rate and a 60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F/hr pressurizer heat-up rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two other pressure transients, a High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) pump start and a Primary Coolant Pump (PCP) start, are also precluded. With the PCS in a vented and depressurized state, the PCS would be below 212 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F Existing technical specifications require both HPSI pumps to be rendered inoperable below 260 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F and, with the system depressurized, normal operating procedures prohibit a PCP start due to insufficient pump net positive suction head (NPSH). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the 1.3 square inch requirement can be replaced with a requirement to have a vent capable of relieving 167 gpm at a PCS pressure less than or equal to the Appendix G limit with no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an overpressurization event occurring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of PORV Operability requirements when at Hot Standby and above will not alter plant operation or configuration. It will not alter any equipment or analyses. Therefore the addition of these PORV Operability requirements will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new technical specifications requirements for PCS vent capacity will provide an equivalent or better, overpressure protection as compared to the existing requirement. No analysis has been found that shows that the existing 1.3 square inch vent area will protect the PCS from exceeding the Appendix G curve limit. However, analysis has been developed which shows that manual vent valves PC-514 and PC-515 will provide adequate relief capacity, maintaining PCS pressure within the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, limits. Furthermore, two other pressure transients, a HPSI pump start and a PCP start, are also precluded by either existing technical specifications or normal plant operating procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another related analysis has shown that relief valve RV-3164, the Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI) pumps, the LPSI pump seals, and the system piping of the shutdown cooling system have the capability of providing adequate overpressure protection to the shutdown cooling system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of the manual vent valves do not introduce a vent path where a vent path had not previously existed. Therefore, the possibility of an accident of a new or different type, than previously evaluated in the FSAR, will not be created. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The margin of safety will not be reduced by the proposed Technical Specifications changes. The extension of PORV Operability requirements has no effect on any margin of safety. The previous requirement assumed that a vent with an equivalent flow area as the original PORV would provide the same relief as the PORV itself and gave no consideration to how that flow area should factor in system losses or vent location. The new technical specification requirement offers a means to ensure the PCS will be protected against all achievable overpressure transients for the system configuration, with analyses to support it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

For an inoperable isolation valve in the exhaust duct, the exhaust duct will be isolated within 8 hours by one isolation valve secured in the closed position.

Operation of the Cook Nuclear Plant in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The purpose of the hydrogen and oxygen monitors is to measure the concentrations of these gases in the WGHS to ensure that the gas mixture is non-flammable. We can accomplish this purpose and ensure safe operation of the WGHS by operating the system in the proposed manner. During the equipment replacement interval, we will be assuming that the hydrogen concentration is above the flammable limit (4%). The limiting factor then is the oxygen concentration at which hydrogen and oxygen become flammable. The existing hydrogen monitor will be in continuous operation to verify the hydrogen level. The information provided by the oxygen monitor being replaced is not essential to the safe operation of the WGHS since it is redundant to information provided by the remaining oxygen monitor. The only difference between the two (2) oxygen monitors is that the one being replaced provides an automatic isolation of the waste gas decay tank when the oxygen concentration reaches 3%. The isolation of the waste gas decay tanks will be performed manually during the replacement. In the event the remaining oxygen monitor becomes inoperable, we will follow the currently approved T/Ss. Since operation of the WGHS in the manner we have proposed will ensure that the purpose of the oxygen and hydrogen monitors is fulfilled and safe operation of the WGHS is maintained, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously analyzed incident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the Automatic Gas Analyzer (QC-31) tag number to QC-1400 will not reduce in any way requirements or commitments in the existing T/Ss.

During the replacement of the monitors the waste gas holdup system will continue to operate normally. The proposed method of operation will ensure that the oxygen and hydrogen gas mixture is non-flammable. For this reason, operating the explosive gas monitoring system in the proposed manner will not place the plant in a new or unanalyzed condition. Therefore, we believe that this change will not introduce a new or different kind of accident than previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed editorial change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated, because these changes will not place the plant in a new or unanalyzed condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The remaining oxygen monitor will be available to maintain the oxygen concentration below the limit required for hydrogen flammability in oxygen. In addition, the oxygen grab samples will provide redundant information and will serve as a check of the monitor's readings. If the remaining monitor becomes inoperable, we will follow the actions of our current T/Ss. During the equipment replacement period, we will be assuming that the hydrogen concentration is above the flammable limit (4%). This will then make the oxygen level the controlling parameter in a possible flammable combination of oxygen and hydrogen. The existing hydrogen monitor will be in continuous operation to verify the hydrogen level. These proposed interim measures will not significantly affect our ability to maintain the hydrogen and oxygen concentration within the limits to prevent flammability. Therefore, we believe that operation of the system in this manner does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed editorial change will not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety, because all accident analyses and nuclear design bases remain unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

TS 3.4.4.e currently permits fuel handling operations to continue during refueling for up to 7 days with one circuit of the emergency ventilation system inoperable provided all active components of the other emergency ventilation system circuit are operable. The proposed revision would permit fuel handling operations to continue during refueling beyond 7 days with one circuit of the emergency ventilation system inoperable provided the remaining emergency ventilation system circuit is operable and in operation. The licensee stated that the proposed revision is consistent with recently issued Amendment No. 47 to the Nine Mile Point Unit 2 TSs and with the NRC's Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1433. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 [NMP1], in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Emergency Ventilation System responds to a release of radioactivity to the secondary containment by maintaining a negative pressure in secondary containment and by providing a filtered elevated release. The proposed change to LCO [Limiting Condition for Operation] 3.4.4.e would allow continuation of refueling beyond seven days with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable provided the operable emergency ventilation circuit is in operation. A plant specific PRA [Probabilistic Risk Assessment] was performed to evaluate the probability of a fuel bundle drop event resulting in a need to start the Emergency Ventilation System with a concurrent failure of the Emergency Ventilation System that would result in an unfiltered ground level release under the current Technical Specifications and the proposed change. The results of this assessment indicate that the probability is not significantly increased. In addition, the order of magnitude of the probability of such a release, under the current or proposed Technical Specifications, is very small, i.e., 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> -6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . This amendment requires no physical changes to NMP1. Therefore, the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not significantly increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section XV.C.3 of the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] evaluates a fuel bundle drop accident. The radiological consequences of this accident are within the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100. The UFSAR radiological evaluation takes credit for the operation of an emergency ventilation circuit in mitigating the consequences of this accident. During refueling with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable for more than seven days, the proposed Technical Specification change would require that an operable emergency ventilation circuit be placed in operation. With an operable emergency ventilation circuit operating prior to a fuel bundle drop accident, the radiological consequences of this accident remains bounded by the current UFSAR evaluation. Therefore, from a radiological perspective, the proposed Technical Specification change is bounded by the current radiological evaluation in the UFSAR. Therefore, the Technical Specification change does not significantly increase the consequences of a previously evaluated accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amendment does not involve any accident precursors or initiators. During an accident involving the release of radioactivity to the secondary containment atmosphere an operable emergency ventilation circuit would already be running and performing its safety function. The operating status of a running emergency ventilation circuit, which was manually started, would be unaffected by the receipt of an automatic start signal due to the detection of high radiation in secondary containment. Accordingly, the proposed Technical Specification change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current Technical Specifications, LCO 3.4.4, provide a margin of safety by requiring both emergency ventilation circuits to be operable during a refueling condition. With one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable, the current Technical Specifications allow continuation of refueling for up to seven days, at which time refueling must be stopped. This Technical Specification requirement ensures that an emergency ventilation circuit will be available to provide a filtered release to the environment during an accident which could result in the release of radioactivity to the secondary containment atmosphere. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to LCO 3.4.4.e would allow continuation of refueling beyond seven days with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable provided the operable emergency ventilation circuit is in operation. By placing the remaining operable emergency ventilation circuit in operation, active single failures associated with its startup have been eliminated. These eliminated failures include automatic initiation instrumentation, relaying logic, breaker operation, fan startup and valve operation. With an operable emergency ventilation circuit in operation, its safety function is being performed. In addition, the status of the operating emergency ventilation circuit is indicated in the control room. Therefore, the running, operable emergency ventilation circuit provides a level of safety comparable to two non-running, operable emergency ventilation circuits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the above analysis, the margin of safety is not significantly reduced by allowing refueling to continue beyond seven days with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable since the operable emergency ventilation circuit is in operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes are consistent with Amendment No. 47 for Nine Mile Point Unit 2 and with the Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1433. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, as determined by the analysis above, this proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The NRC staff's review is presented below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) because the proposed changes merely delete the specification of emergency diesel-generator minimum engine speed while retaining or substituting the specification of electrical frequency to be attained by the emergency diesel-generator. The diesel engine and generator are directly coupled and must rotate at the same speed, therefore, speed and frequency are directly related and specification of acceptance values for both parameters is redundant. Furthermore, electrical frequency, not engine speed, is the parameter of interest with regard the ability of the system to power emergency loads. The proposed changes do not affect the adequacy of the surveillance test or the reliability of the system to power emergency loads, and do not involve any physical changes to facility structures, systems, or components. Therefore, since the reliability of the emergency diesel-generators will not be reduced, the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated is not increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) because no physical changes to facility structures, systems, or components are involved and they do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.

The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because the changes would not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

They ensure that the operability of the AC sources is demonstrated with reasonable assurance. Also, the reliability of the EDGs will be enhanced by reducing the potential for numerous unloaded EDG starts during an LCO [limiting condition for operation] period. The proposed changes could reduce the number of required unloaded EDG starts from nine to one.

The proposed changes affect EDG testing frequency only, they have no impact on any accident analysis. The proposed changes provide assurance that the EDGs will be able to power their respective safety systems if required.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant at an uprated power of 2536 MWt. The licensee's engineering analyses and evaluations confirm that the plant can be operated at an uprated power. The increase in the rated power from 2436 MWt to 2536 MWt corresponds to a 4.8 percent increase in rated steam flow. The increase in rated power remains below the plant design power level of 2550 MWt which was the basis for the original plant safety evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes affect the operating parameters of the reactor, operational restrictions, setpoints for safety systems, analytical results, and test requirements. There are also administrative changes. The changes in each of these categories are summarized as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reactor Parameters: The effect on reactor parameters is limited. Higher power is achieved by control rod pattern adjustments to increase reactor thermal power in a more uniform (flattened) power <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution to increase steam flow without increasing core recirculation flow. This requires an increased reactor dome pressure for adequate turbine inlet pressure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operational Limits: The increased thermal power requires a change to the limitation on operation in the high power low flow portion of the power/flow map to limit thermal hydraulic instabilities and power oscillations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Setpoints: The increased reactor pressure has a direct impact on the high pressure scram setpoint and the safety relief valve setpoint. Additionally, the bypass for the turbine stop valve closure and control valve fast closure scram will be changed in proportion to the increase in thermal power. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis Results: Analyses of uprated power transients and accidents requires changes to various TS and their Bases. Operational parameters and assumptions used in analyses were revised to reflect their use as initial conditions. Revised radiological analyses changed dose results. The results of the accident analyses requires revisions to properly reflect plant capabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing: A number of changes to testing requirements result from power uprate. The increase to reactor pressure has a direct effect on hydrostatic leakage testing pressure. The test pressure for High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) pumps will be revised to reflect safety relief valve setpoints assumed in analyses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative: Administrative changes (i.e., adding references, revising references and correcting associated errors) will also be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No changes to the Radiological Effluent Technical Specifications were identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Operation of the FitzPatrick plant at a thermal power of 2536 MWt will not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The James A. FitzPatrick nuclear power plant was reviewed for operation at a rated power of 2550 MWt at the time of its operating license, [***]. This review was based on the original design of the plant. Since that time, a number of safety issues of a generic and plant specific nature as well as plant modifications have changed the originally reviewed design. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generic criteria, methodologies and evaluation scope required to uprate BWRs up to 5% were prepared by General Electric and submitted to the NRC in LTR-1 [NEDC-31897P-A, ``Generic Guidelines for General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate"]. This was supplemented by the submittal of generic evaluations in LTR-2 [NEDC-31984P, ``Generic Evaluations of General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate'' and Supplement 1] to determine: which NRC and industry generic communications were applicable to power uprate and how they should be treated; analytical evaluations that could be generically approved; bounding evaluations of components and equipment, and; the effect of power uprate on safety margin. These generic evaluations are supplemented by plant specific evaluations. The Power Uprate Safety Analysis Report (PUSAR) describes the dependence placed on References 1 and 2, the additional analyses that were performed, the results of these additional analyses and overall conclusions on the safety impacts of power uprate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The plant systems and components will be within design limits at power uprate conditions with minor modifications. At uprated power, the power plant will not be operated in a manner that is different from current operations except for limited changes to operating parameters such as primary system pressure, steam flow and feedwater temperature. Setpoints are revised as necessary to reflect new operational conditions and analyses. The ECCS-LOCA [emergency core cooling system-loss-of-coolant accident] analysis using current practices demonstrates compliance with design and regulatory acceptance criteria at uprated power. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The radiological consequences of accidents have been evaluated using more current methodologies with consistent assumptions and continue to meet acceptance criteria. Compliance with NRC dose criteria using current methodologies is discussed in Section 9.2 of the PUSAR. The effect of power uprate on dose analyses now discussed in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] were qualitatively assessed recognizing that power uprate increases doses in direct proportion to the 4.1% increase in thermal power. An increase of 4.1% to the calculated doses currently identified in FSAR Chapter 14 indicates that a reevaluation using the original methodology would have demonstrated compliance with current NRC dose criteria. A review of Table 14.4-2 indicates that, with the 4.1% increase, offsite doses would be substantially less than NRC allowable values. A review of Table 14.8-1 indicates that, with the 4.1% increase, control room doses would be substantially less than NRC allowables except for the main steam line break (MSLB). However, the MSLB dose would drop well below allowables once the proposed change on allowable coolant activity (reduces the limit by more than a factor of ten) is accounted for. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Thus, based on the above analysis and supplemental analyses performed by the NRC staff, the increase in power level discussed herein and associated Technical Specification changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation at uprated power involves no changes to the manner in which the plant is operated. There are changes to operational parameters and setpoints but analyses of these identified no new failure modes or accident scenarios. The effects of transients and accidents fall within design capabilities. Systems and components are capable of operating and performing their safety functions at uprated power. No mechanisms for creating a new or different accident were identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The power uprate will not result in significant increases to primary system temperature and pressure due to postulated operating transients or accidents. These and other margins of safety have been discussed in the PUSAR, where it is demonstrated that there will be no reductions in the margin of safety because the plant will still meet its design and regulatory acceptance criteria. For example, the core will continue to be operated with the same margin to the safety limit minimum critical power ratio. Fuel thermal limits will continue to meet NRC acceptance criteria. Plant systems and equipment are designed for uprated power conditions and have been evaluated for their capability to perform at uprated conditions. They will continue to perform within design limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

It does not require any surveillances for the associated data recorders. However, Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.1.a specifically states that ''...pathways shall be monitored and recorded ....'' which requires the recorders to be operable for the gaseous effluent monitoring system to be considered operable.

FitzPatrick Technical Specifications (TS) would temporarily waive the 2-year maximum surveillance interval for the Type C test (local leak rate test) of the shutdown cooling isolation valves (10MOV-17 and 10MOV-18). The waiver would permit deferring this test until the next refueling outage, currently scheduled for the end of November 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TS 4.7.A.2.e(5) and 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix J require the containment isolation valves to be leak-rate tested during each refueling outage, but at intervals of not greater than 2 years. As a result of the extended 1991-1993 refueling outage, and the length of the current operating cycle, tests of all containment isolation valves are due prior to the start of the next refueling outage. Two mid-cycle outages were scheduled, in part, to accommodate the testing of these valves, except for the shutdown cooling isolation valves. The shutdown cooling isolation valves cannot be removed from service during a non-refueling outage to accommodate a leak-rate test since its associated system is needed to remove reactor decay heat. The reliability of the isolation valve design, and the very low probability that the shutdown cooling system penetration would result in a pathway for leakage to the reactor building, as discussed in the application, is provided as justification for this one-time schedular extension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change is limited to a one-time schedular extension in the shutdown cooling isolation valve Type C test. The change does not introduce any new modes of plant operation, make any physical changes, or alter any operational setpoints. Therefore, the change does not degrade the performance of any safety system assumed to function in the accident analysis. The extension will not result in a significant increase in valve leakage considering that: (1) the valves are infrequently stroked, and then only when the reactor vessel is at low pressure, (2) monitoring the normal operating status of the RHR [residual heat removal] system assures the absence of gross valve leakage, and (3) the valves were replaced with valves of an improved design which has been confirmed by past Type C tests to exhibit satisfactory leak rate performance. For these reasons, the change does not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident evaluated since any leakage through the shutdown cooling penetration will not significantly increase for reasons discussed in the previous paragraph, and such leakage is negligible compared to the main steam line break accident analyzed in the FSAR [final safety analysis report]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not introduce new accident initiators or failure mechanisms since the change does not alter the physical characteristics of any plant system or component.

Moreover, any potential incremental benefit of performing the tests within the two year requirement would not be sufficient to offset the increased occupational radiation exposure associated with testing, and the risk to plant safety associated with the removal from service of the primary method of decay heat removal.

Therefore, no new actuations or functions have been created; and because the existing and proposed functions provide for accident mitigation considerations that are not the source of an accident, the probability of an accident is not increased. The deletion of the 6.9-kilovolt shutdown board normal-feeder undervoltage relays actually reduces the potential for inadvertent shutdown board blackouts as a result of short-duration voltage transients or instrument failures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The setpoints and time delays for loss-of-power functions have been modified based on the guidelines developed by the Electrical Distribution System Clearinghouse as evaluated and determined through detailed analysis by TVA. This design is documented in TVA Calculations SQN-EEB-MS-TI06-0008, 27DAT, and DS-1-2 and is available for NRC review at the SQN site. The assigned values are conservative settings that will ensure adequate voltage is supplied to safety-related loads for accident mitigation and safety functions under normal, degraded, and loss-of-offsite-power voltage conditions with appropriate time delays to prevent damage to electrical loads and minimize premature or unnecessary actuations. The identification of loss-of-voltage conditions is enhanced by the design changes to ensure the timely sequencing of loads onto the D/G and the initiation of AFW pump starts for accident mitigation. Because there are no reductions in safety functions resulting from the design logic, setpoint, and time-delay changes to the loss-of-power instrumentation and offsite dose levels for postulated accidents will not be increased, the consequences of an accident are not increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4 exclusion deletion, and response time measurement clarification incorporated in the proposed change do not affect plant functions. These changes reflect the requirements that SQN has been maintaining and serve to clarify the requirements to provide consistency of application and easier understanding. The AFW footnote addition and bases revision only clarify operability conditions that are consistent with the plant design for the AFW pump and loss-of-power instrumentation. Because there are no changes to plant functions or operations, these revisions have no impact on accident probabilities or consequences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described above, the loss-of-power instrumentation ensures adequate voltage to safety-related loads by initiating D/G starts and load shedding and provides for AFW pump starting, but is not considered to be the source of an accident. Although the design logic, setpoint, and time-delay actuation criteria have changed, the output functions to various plant systems that actuate for load shedding and D/G starts remain the same. Therefore, actuation criteria have been affected, but not safety functions, and the TVA evaluation has confirmed that the new design enhances the ability to maintain adequate voltage to support safety functions. Since safety functions have not changed and the new loss-of-power instrumentation design continues to support operability of safety-related equipment, no new or different accident is created. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4 exclusion deletion, and response time measurement clarification, as well as the AFW operability clarifications, do not affect plant functions and will not create a new accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed loss-of-power TS changes support design logic, setpoint, and time-delay requirements that have been verified by TVA analysis to provide acceptable voltage levels for safety-related components. In determining the acceptability of these voltage levels, the minimum voltage for operation as well as detrimental component heating resulting from sustained degraded-voltage conditions were considered. This design ensures that safety-related loads will be available and operable for normal and accident plant conditions. The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4 exclusion deletion, response time measurement clarification, and AFW operability clarifications provide enhancements to TS requirements and do not affect plant functions. Therefore, no safety functions are reduced by these changes and there is no reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied.

The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee has been informed of the public comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By March 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (Project Director) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket No. 50-265, Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2, Rock Island County, Illinois <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of application for amendments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> October 29, 1993, as supplemented by letters dated December 22, 1993 and January 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brief description of amendments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The license amendment dispositions Unreviewed Safety Questions (USQ) related to proposed plant modifications associated with reactor vessel water level instrumentation.

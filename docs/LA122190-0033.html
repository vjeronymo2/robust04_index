			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DE PALMA DAMPS THE 'BONFIRE';  </P> <P> MOVIES: A RICH NOVEL IS TURNED INTO AN OVERSTATED, CARTOONED FILM FOR DULLARDS.  </P> <P> Brian De Palma opens his calamitous version of Tom Wolfe's dense novel "The  Bonfire of the Vanities" (at selected theaters) with a glittering,  dusk-through-dawn shot of Manhattan from a point of view of a Chrysler Building  gargoyle.  </P> <P> It's not the last of the movie's visual excitement; unfortunately, it's not the  last of its monsters either. In a disastrous misjudgment, De Palma decided that  Wolfe's panoramic morality play about a privileged WASP overreacher needed  pointing up for dullards like us in a movie audience.  </P> <P> So what was rich, journalistic and precisely observed is now overstated,  under-textured and cartooned, in playwright/screenwriter Michael Cristofer's  witless screenplay. Certainly Wolfe's canvas might lend itself to a broad  approach, but broad like "Dr. Strangelove," not broad like the Three Stooges.  </P> <P> With the exception of the three principals -- a game but miscast Tom Hanks as  the patrician broker Sherman McCoy, Melanie Griffith as his mistress, Maria  Ruskin, and Bruce Willis as the boozy journalist responsible for Sherman's  plummet from power -- De Palma has packed the screen wall-to-wall with harpies,  gargoyles, grotesques and caricatures. He's also made Wolfe's memorable Jewish  judge, Myron Kovitsky, black, the better for Morgan Freeman to deliver the  movie's stern but soothing homilies to an almost-rioting black courtroom  audience.  </P> <P> Both De Palma's tamperings and his approach may infuriate those who savored the  book's brilliant high comedy, while the movie's callow vision of life among the  haves -- and have-nots -- is enough to make non-"Bonfire" readers wonder why  anyone would have read 10 pages of anything this sophomoric, much less 659 of  them.  </P> <P> In rough outline, Hanks' Sherman McCoy feels himself a true Master of the  Universe, one of those Norse-god-like plastic toys, as he contemplates his  assets: top-dog position at a hallowed Wall Street brokerage house, a Park  Avenue apartment and a wife, daughter and mistress.  </P> <P> All will be ripped away from him after a hit-and-run accident in the Bronx,  when Sherman's Mercedes apparently hits and injures a young black man at a dark  freeway on-ramp. Conscience-stricken, Sherman wants to report it, but since the  also-married Maria is a clandestine fellow passenger, she persuades him not to.  </P> <P> When the victim falls into a coma and the car's ownership is traced, Sherman  becomes the center of a political cat's cradle reaching from the Bronx to Wall  Street to Park Avenue.  </P> <P> The Bronx D.A. (F. Murray Abraham) wants Sherman's WASP neck, the better to run  for mayor. Harlem's self-styled religious leader, Rev. Bacon (John Hancock),  spokesman for the young victim's mother (Mary Alice), wants Sherman as an  example of white arrogance. His too-chic and too-thin wife Judy (Kim Cattrall),  the injured party, wants Sherman's child and his bank account. And Maria wants  whatever moving part is left over.  </P> <P> While Sherman's term of office as one of Manhattan's Masters was relatively  short-lived in the novel, it was written with such authority that his patrician  family, his business savvy and his enormous success had real believability and  meaning. By introducing Sherman, as De Palma does, just as his foot hits the  roller skate at the top of the stairs, we have no sense of what he stands to  lose. Certainly the loss of that wife or that child would come under the  heading of a blessing. And in spite of Hanks' touch with both the film's comedy  and pathos, and Sherman's birthright isolation from the real world, Hanks still  seems too boyishly untried, not world-worn enough.  </P> <P> In much the same vein as Sidney Lumet's insightful "Q&amp;A," Wolfe suggested  that shaky ethnic alliances had held the city together for generations and that  they might be fraying out in front of New Yorkers' oblivious noses. The movie  goes for the fury without the artful distinctions among these warring factions.  </P> <P> In 1987, Wolfe's book was prescient, before Howard Beach, before Tawana  Brawley, before even the yo-yo-ing fortunes of The Donald. When Wolfe drew a  character like Rev. Bacon and his theory of ghetto "steam control," Bacon was a  rich and complex key to the city's ferment.  </P> <P> Now however, Bacon is simply an easy send-up of Al Sharpton, never seen without  his back-up gospel chorus of five women in gold satin robes. He's been  transformed the same way that Peter Fallow, the book's dim alcoholic English  tabloid hack, has been turned into the wryly American Bruce Willis -- by taking  all the good stuff out. And so it goes, character by character, throughout the  movie.  </P> <P> Willis, for the relatively little that's demanded of him in terms of  characterization, is very good. If you think his amazing physical business at  the opening is easy, think again. Griffith, who's able to capture every nuance  of Maria's devious mind and every inch of her stunning body, is equally fine.  (The film's R rating is for strong language.) In contrast, most of the rest of  the cast has been cattle-prodded into wretched excess, beginning with Abraham  and Cattrall.  </P> <P> De Palma has pushed the look of his movie into cartoony excess too, so that we  are forever peering at characters from the jowls up or from the bald spot down  or as they are goggling into the camera like TV pitchman Ernest.  </P> <P> This can hardly be laid at the door of the splendid cameraman Vilmos Zsigmond,  who is just giving the boss what he wants. To be fair, De Palma also wanted the  amazing five-minute opening action sequence that introduces Willis' Peter  Fallow, arriving dead drunk for his awards ceremony.  </P> <P> As Fallow is poured out of a limo, through the entrails of the World Trade  Center, out of his jacket, into his tuxedo and up on to the awards dinner  platform, he is caught in a tour-de-force of Steadicam sinuousness that may  one-up a similarly fluid sequence in "GoodFellas."  </P> <P> In the "GoodFellas" sequence, director Martin Scorsese used one long,  uninterrupted shot, winding through a nightclub's backstage off-limits to show  us his young gangster's comic worldliness; it was the character showing off,  not the director. "Bonfire's" opening sequence is drop-dead but gratuitous, a  hint of what is to come.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bonfire of the Vanities'  </P> <P> Tom Hanks: Sherman McCoy  </P> <P> Bruce Willis: Peter Fallow  </P> <P> Melanie Griffith: Maria Ruskin  </P> <P> Kim Cattrall: Judy McCoy  </P> <P> Morgan Freeman: Judge White  </P> <P> Saul Rubinek: Jed Kramer  </P> <P> F.

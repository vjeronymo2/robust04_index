			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Stampede to reform Japan JAPANESE voters, having endured 38 years of one-party rule, are suddenly bewildered by breakaway parties, reform groups which may become parties, and old parties with new policies, all of them claiming to be the flag-bearer of reform. The 'Shinto Sakigake' was formed yesterday by 10 MPs from the ruling Liberal Demcoratic party who say they are still fond of the LDP, but would prefer to establish a new party to leave behind the 'staleness' of the past. Shinto means new party, but sakigake can mean harbinger or forerunner or initiative or pioneer. Japanese journalists translating the name into English have decided to call the party the New Party Harbinger. The New Party Harbinger is led by a former provincial mayor, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, who defected from the LDP on Friday night, but has suggested that he is prepared work with the LDP in a coalition after the July 18 election. More confusing is that Mr Takemura says he will work with the Japan New party, established by another former provincial governor, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, though that party adamantly opposes the LDP. But the New Party Harbinger is not prepared to work with a new pro-reform party to be formally launched tomorrow by Mr Tsutomu Hata, former finance minister. The New Party Harbinger apparently thinks Mr Hata's group too closely resembles the LDP. The difficulty in telling these parties apart is that each is running on a pro-reform platform and has yet to explain such issues as housing policy, measures to stimulate a flagging economy or how the Japanese health system should be improved. Mr Hata, whose rebel faction brought down the government in a no-confidence motion on Friday, is talking of a coalition with the Social Democratic party, formerly known as the Japan Socialist party, which is still strongly flavoured by Marxist-Leninist ideology. The SDP still supports the totalitarian North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung in preference to the South Korean government, and has changed its name only in English - after much bickering, the party remains known as the shakaito or socialist party in Japanese. SDP officials say Mr Hata would make a suitable prime minister, and yet he has closer ties to South Korea than North, supports trade liberalisation and wants a better balanced relationship with the US. The SDP remains deeply suspicious of the US. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, opened the LDP's campaign headquarters yesterday with a speech suggesting that he, too, is pro-reform, though he lost the no-confidence motion last week because he agreed to block reform proposals. To confuse voters further, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former prime minister, said he would form a political reform league within the LDP. Mr Kaifu appears to have no intention of leaving the party, and is being pushed to the fore because, unlike many colleagues, he is untainted by scandal and is generally trusted.</p>

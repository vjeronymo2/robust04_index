			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis today raised the issue  of the abominable assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis to UN  official Joe Clark, who expressed his regret for the incident.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the  government will wait for the official results of the police  investigations before proceeding with diplomatic steps in the  next few days. Mr. Kasoulidhis added that the government wants  to have a strong case, as he described it, so that no one will  draw conclusions by reductio ad absurdum.    Joe Clark, the UN Secretary General's special representative  in Cyprus, said that the assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis  does not fall within the framework of the UN secretary general's  mission in the Cyprus issue. Mr. Clark, who was responding to  questions from correspondents after his meeting with President  Kliridhis this afternoon, said that he discussed the whole issue  with the president of the Republic and with some of Mr.  Kliridhis' advisers. Despite the continuous and persistent  questions from the correspondents, Mr. Clark refused to make any  comment on the assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis. He also  refused to comment on a letter addressed to him today by Greek  Cypriot political correspondents. The letter noted that from  now on they will not be visiting the occupied areas to cover the  proximity talks for security reasons.    The question of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' assassination was  also  discussed by Joe Clark and Rauf Denktas at their meeting today.  However, Joe Clark refrained from giving any details and said  that it is a question of a human tragedy, making no reference  whatsoever to the political dimensions of the issue.</p>

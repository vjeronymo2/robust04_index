			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Mitova] </F>   [Text] Sofia, 31 January -- Within the next few days, the  government will decide what to do with the 500 metric tons of  uranium concentrate that is stockpiled in two stores in the  Rhodopes. The general view is that the material should leave  the country in the very near future.    According to one of the proposals to unload the material,  the  Russian firm of Tekhnosnabeksport, acting as an agent, would  acquire the concentrate at $17 per kilogram, and then sell fuel  rods filled with the uranium to the Kozloduy Nuclear Power  Station for $27.20 each. The price reportedly includes the cost  of shipping, safeguarding, and storing the rods.    In the view of experts specializing in this market, which is  monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the  uranium concentrate will be sold for $26.59 per kilogram.    On the free market the prices are lower, ranging from $18.44  to $19.35.    The cost of producing uranium in Bulgaria ranges from $202  to  $73, and is on average 4.5 times higher that free market prices.    Before the uranium industry was shut down, Bulgaria produced  about 250 tons of concentrate per year, which satisfied 35  percent of its own needs. These 250 tons can be used to  generate 8.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.    There are two possibilities for supplying the Kozloduy  Nuclear Power Station with nuclear fuel. The first is to buy  uranium rods filled with Russian fuel, and the second is to fill  the rods with Bulgarian material.    Experts claim that then a kilowatt-hour of electric power  would be 166 times more expensive.    The Council of Ministers will designate the organizations  that will engage in putting the uranium concentrate onto the  international market. One of the possibilities is the state  company Rudmetal, another is the private Intersteel company,  which belongs to Multigroup.</p>

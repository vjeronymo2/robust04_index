			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Italian wave of crime boosts security industry FACED with a rising wave of theft, Italians are estimated to be spending an annual L3,500bn (Dollars 2.8bn) on security protection, according to a study by the research institute, Ispes. This expenditure comes despite Italy possessing one policeman for every 240 inhabitants, the highest proportion in Europe. The biggest cost is absorbed by L1500bn spent on the production and installation of electronic security systems, with a further L500bn going on safes, strengthened windows, barriers and reinforced doors. Each year an average of 200,000 reinforced doors are installed. Private security firms are in growing demand. Italy now has 1,106 registered security companies supplying some 30,000 full-time guards at a cost of lire 1,400bn per year. These figures are not surprising given the way robbery from banks and institutions as well as private households has increased. Between 1975-90 the number of household burglaries has tripled to over 211,000; while the booty stolen from banks and financial institutions now totals L72bn a year. In the case of car theft, it is reckoned that some 240,000 cars are stolen a year against 158,000 in 1983. This staggering figure and the consequent replacement through insurance perhaps helps explain why Italy continues to have such high car sales. Italians spend almost L150bn on car anti-theft devices.</p>

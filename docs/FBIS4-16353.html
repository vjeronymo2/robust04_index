			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Admiral Kasatonov, who is in St. Petersburg,  spoke today at a news conference during which he gave a fairly  frank appraisal of the events in Odessa as a state, anti-Russian  action.    [Begin Kasatonov recording] What happened is the result of  political games, first and foremost. [end recording] [passage  omitted]    What happened in Odessa between 8 and 11 April on the  territory of the 318th Division can be viewed as a state,  anti-Russian action by Ukrainian armed forces. That is how the  former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, and now first deputy  commander in chief of the Russian Navy, Igor Kasatonov,  appraised the Odessa incident today.    [Begin Kasatonov recording] Women and children were taken  outside in the middle of the night. They were lined up like in  the worst times, 50-odd years ago, when Odessa was occupied.  Some were taken away, a child was injured. [end recording]    As Admiral Kasatonov reported at the news conference, the  Russian side is now trying to the best of its ability to resolve  the conflict. But the Ukraine Fleet command has already issued  an ultimatum saying that all sailors and officers who have not  taken an oath of allegiance to Ukraine have to leave the  territory of Black Sea Fleet units immediately. New commanders  from the Ukrainian armed forces have already been appointed to  the garrisons in Ochakov, Nikolayev and Izmail.    But nevertheless a solution must be found. Otherwise, as one  of the major western politicians said, the military conflict in  Bosnia will seem to the world community to be an innocent row  between two adoloscents who have fallen out in comparison with  the possible consequences of the Odessa incident, if two great  powers -- Russia and Ukraine -- do not find mutual  understanding.</p>

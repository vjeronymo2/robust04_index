			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "bba": "FBI Following Up Danish Trail in Bombing </F> Case"]    [Text] Telephone numbers and addresses found on Egyptians  being held in Denmark connect those jailed with the bombing of  the World Trade Center (WTC), in which six died, and over 1,000  persons were injured.    The bombing of the New York WTC may have connections to  Denmark. The Arhus police four months ago arrested three  Egyptians and charged them with attempted arson and purchasing  chemicals for fabricating bombs. [see item 94WT0004B in 7  January Terrorism Report] In searching their residence, the  police found telephone lists with names and addresses of some of  those charged with attempted murder in the United States.    "Therefore, we asked the FBI for help in clearing up our  case. FBI colleagues have been in Denmark, and we have developed  information. We don't know, however, whether those being held in  this country have any concrete connection with the attempted  murder case itself," said Arhus Deputy Police Chief Villy  Sorensen.    ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE yesterday wrote that a fingerprint of  one  of those jailed in the Arhus case is on an "object" found in  connection with the follow-up investigation of the New York  bombing incident.    "I won't comment on this," said Sorensen. He confirmed,  however, that those being held in Arhus and those charged in the  U.S. bombing attack are members of the same Islamic  fundamentalist organization.    According to the deputy police chief, there is nothing to  indicate that the individuals being held in Arhus were in New  York when the bomb exploded in the WTC basement.    Nor have U.S. authorities requested that the jailed  individuals be handed over for prosecution in the United States.    Two of those charged in Arhus -- ages 30 and 36 -- are  asylum-seekers, while the third, a 41-year-old man, has  permanent residence in Denmark after having lived here for 10  years. The two asylum-seekers have told Danish authorities they  are applying for asylum in Denmark because they are being sought  in Egypt.</p>

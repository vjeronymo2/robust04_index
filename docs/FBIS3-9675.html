			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "D.K.": "Karadzic: Greek and Yugoslav Soldiers </F> Should Come to Bosnia-Herzegovina"]    [Text] Banja Luka, 27 Mar -- After attending the meeting  of the Communal Committee of the Serbian Democratic Party of  Banja Luka and holding a longish talk with businessmen from the  region, Radovan Karadzic commented for our newspaper on the  Muslim spring offensive and the sending of Turkish troops.    "The Muslim spring offensive has begun and their offensive  is  taking place along all lines, and particularly on the Trebava  battlefield near Doboj and toward Kupres. This offensive must  stop. If the Muslims fail to atop their offensive, we would then  have to launch a counteroffensive, and then we are no longer  going to talk about territories. The Muslims can get  territories for their state through negotiations, but if they  nevertheless decide in favor of fighting, then the factual state  will be decisive, as we cannot give back the territories for  which young Serbian men are losing their lives. Therefore, it  should be clear to the Muslim side and the international  community that it is either war or peace here. If there is war  by the will of the Muslims, then the Muslims must pay the price  of that war," Karadzic said and added the following:    "As regards the sending of the Turkish troops into  Bosnia-Herzegovina, there is is another dangerous precedent  involved here and I am afraid that this is the eclipse of the  United Nations. I am afraid that the United Nations are quickly  going in the direction of self-abolition, self-discredit, just  as the case was with the League of the Nations before the World  War II. If the arrival of Turkish troops leads to the  escalation of the war, the UN secretary general and the Security  Council will directly bear responsibility. We demand, and will  do so officially, for FRY forces to be included in the  Blue-Helmet forces. For, Russia is not a counterpart to Turkey,  that is, Turkey is not a Russian counterpart. Russia is a  counterpart to the United States, and Turkey is an interested  Balkan country, so, apart from Greek soldiers, Yugoslav ones  should join the forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina."</p>

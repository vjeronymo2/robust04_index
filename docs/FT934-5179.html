			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / People: Lehman Brothers International Ruth Lea, Mitsubishi Bank's ubiquitous chief UK economist, is moving to Lehman Brothers International in the new year as its chief UK economist. Lea, 46, has arguably become one of the City's best-known economic pundits with the British public because of her frequent appearances on television and radio and her ability to explain and analyse economic developments in layman's terms. By her own admission, Lea 'loves talking'. Perhaps her most memorable quote so far, made on Black Wednesday when sterling was kicked out of the ERM, was: 'The ironic thing is that we may get an economic recovery because the government's policies have failed.' Lea, who has been with Mitsubishi for five years, will join the economics team headed by Lehman's chief economist Gerald Holtham. She will take over Peter Spencer's job which became vacant 18 months ago when he moved to Kleinwort Benson. Before joining Mitsubishi, Lea worked at the DTI for four years and before that spent five years at the Central Statistical Office. She also spent four years at the Treasury in the 1970s.</p>

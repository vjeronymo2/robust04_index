			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Petrofina shares tumble on North Sea fears - Shareholders have also been worried by the sharp drop in profits For a long time, as one Belgian stock market analyst pointed out recently, the oil company Petrofina was 'a sort of sacred cow'. It was one of the largest stocks on the small Brussels bourse and beyond criticism, at least at home. Since the summer, however, shareholders in Petrofina have had much to criticise, starting with the announcement that profits had fallen from BFr9.5bn (Dollars 300.6m) to BFr4.2bn. That was on August 6, when Petrofina shares stood at BFr10,950, broadly the same level at which they started the year. Meanwhile, the shares have not climbed back to five figures. Worse still, bad news from the North Sea has driven the price down further this month. During the last week, Petrofina has rallied from its low point of BFr7,150, but the shares were still wallowing at BFr7,780 yesterday. The sharp decline since September was prompted by a press release from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate on October 8 indicating that, for safety reasons, it was considering closing the Ekofisk field's oil processing and storage tank before the 1995-96 winter season. Petrofina and Phillips Petroleum of the US, which heads the Ekofisk consortium, were aghast at the publicity given to the alleged safety problems, and hit back with claims that the oil field would be producing well beyond the year 2000. The war of words is likely to come to a head today or early next week, when Phillips will issue its formal response to the Norwegian authorities. There is no doubt that the future of Ekofisk is important to Petrofina. Some 30 per cent of the 10-platform complex is owned by its Norske Fina subsidiary, and the field accounts for about half of the group's crude oil production. But there are also other deeper-rooted reasons why Petrofina is out of favour with investors. Mr Marc Debrouwer at the broker, Petercam, says: 'Up to now a decline in profits in one division has been offset by increases in the others, but the problem with 1992 is that two main divisions - refining/marketing and petrochemicals - are experiencing a downturn, and at the same time we are seeing problems with exploration and production.' For other oil analysts, it is Petrofina's commitment to chemicals production  -which accounted for BFr95.3bn of the group's BFr599bn net turnover last year - that is helping to depress the share price. In addition, it has relatively low exposure to downstream activities, the part of the oil sector which some observers believe will be first to recover. As Ms Wendy Anderson of County Natwest in London explains: 'It doesn't have the oil reserves, it doesn't have the exposure to refining, and it's heavily exposed to petrochemicals. What redeems it? Not very much, I'm afraid.' Petrofina's share price has been supported in the past by the presence of a large and apparently committed shareholder, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company which directly and indirectly controls about 28 per cent. Recently, it has been supported by the intervention of a mystery buyer, possibly another European oil company. But since the collapse in the share price, the mystery buyer has vanished and the sacred cow been duly slaughtered. There are mixed views about how Petrofina's share price could be revived. Some analysts are calling for a cut in the full-year dividend, in spite of the possibility that such a move might be misunderstood by the market. Others pin their hopes on the possibility of links with new industrial partners, or on the outcome of long-running talks with private Saudi Arabian investors interested in buying part of Fina, the group's US affiliate. But most agree it will take a more lasting recovery in one or more of the company's three main sectors to put a firm floor under Petrofina's flagging share price.</p>

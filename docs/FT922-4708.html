			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: NFC plans new share scheme to boost employee ownership NFC, the transport, freight and distribution company, is to offer its workers an innovative package of incentives to buy shares as part of a drive to prevent its level of employee ownership from falling below 45 per cent. Mr James Watson, chairman, believes the continuing UK recession is partly to blame for the fall in employee share ownership. When he announces the interim figures on June 17 he will warn that there are no tangible signs that the recession is coming to an end. For the first time since the company was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1989 employees are to receive one bonus share for every share purchased plus an option to buy a further share. Mr Watson said: 'The normal practice of UK companies is to offer options to executives only, but that is not NFC's culture which is based on everyone in the business being able to share in its success.' Managers will have to make an investment up front in NFC before they are granted options. The new scheme, approved at an extraordinary meeting on Saturday, will replace the existing share saving programme which offered employees two free shares for every five purchased. Mr Watson said it was designed to prevent the level of shares held by employees and their families from falling below 45 per cent. Since 1989 the level of shares held by solely by employees fell from 30 per cent to 19 per cent. Mr Watson hopes that the new scheme, which will come into effect next year, will account for the bulk of profits set aside for profit sharing. A maximum of 15 per cent of the profits may be put aside for profit sharing, although the annual figure depends on the performance of the company. Last year employees received about 120 free shares from profit sharing. The new scheme is designed to give a greater reward to those who save for shares. Mr Watson said: 'The new share schemes are essential if we are to maintain into the 21st century the high level of employee share ownership.'</p>

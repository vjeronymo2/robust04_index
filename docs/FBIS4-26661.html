			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The newly-established  Import and Export Bank of China (IEBC) is negotiating with big  machinery producers to provide export credits for three  hard-currency-earning items.    These are the production of the rocket for launching the  Hong  Kong communications satellite "Asia-Pacific Number Two", a  70,000-ton cargo ship ordered by Norway and a Pakistan-ordered  training aircraft.    Export credits needed for the three projects are estimated  at  some 500 million yuan (about 60 million U.S. dollars).    According to IEBC President Lie Zuhua, the bank has met  strong demand from domestic big machinery producers for export  credits since its founding two months ago.    So far it has received formal applications for export  credits  for over sixty items, involving a total of 10 billion yuan.    "The strong demand shows the huge potential the domestic  machinery industries hold for export," said Lie. "But it has  also placed our bank in a bind."    Although the bank was set up to boost China's exports of  machinery products by providing low-interest rate loans to the  producers, its credit line for the whole of 1994 is limited to  between 2 billion yuan and 3 billion yuan.    The bank has a registered capital of 3.38 billion yuan. But  the funds will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance in  several batches during the next couple of years.    The fund gap will be filled by bonds issued to domestic  financial institutions and on the international capital market.    Lie said that preparations are in hand for the first issue  of  one billion to 1.7 billion yuan worth of bonds this year.    The bank is not likely to issue bonds overseas this year,  Lie  noted.    China exported large machinery worth of 27.7 billion U.S.  dollars in 1993, a quarter of China's total exports.    To cope with the huge demand for export credits, Lie said,  the central authorities may in the future allow foreign banks to  provide export credits to Chinese exporters. The lending amount  will be decided in the light of the government-controlled  external debt limit.    The Import and Export Bank will then provide credit  guarantees for the domestic exporters.    The IEBC president noted that as a policy-oriented bank, the  new financial house will not be run for profit.    In fact, the interest rate on one-year loans by the bank  only  stands at 9.54 percent, compared with the 13.98 percent rate for  the same period loans from commercial banks.    To offset the loss, IEBC will gradually expand its business  in export credit insurance, credit guarantee and other more  lucrative areas, Lie said.</p>

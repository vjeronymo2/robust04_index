			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Walker weeps in Old Bailey witness box Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker property and leisure group who is charged with fraud, yesterday broke down in tears in the witness box at the Old Bailey as he told how he tried to save his company from liquidation. Mr Walker was explaining how in late 1990 he put 'every penny' of his family's money into the company to enable a crucial bond issue to go ahead. He and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, are both accused of fraudulently inflating the company's profits. Both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts. Mr Walker said the bond issue was necessary after the takeover of the William Hill betting shop chain left Brent Walker short of funds. However, problems on the Japanese stock market had meant that institutions there withdrew backing of Pounds 150m. His bankers then insisted he personally had to raise Pounds 100m if they were to continue supporting the company, he said. The Walker family put in Pounds 30m and after receiving an assurance from the Serious Fraud Office that it had dropped its investigation into Brent Walker he attracted a further Pounds 65m from associates. 'I got to Pounds 95m and the banks said they would cough up the rest. Every penny we had went into keeping that company alive - work money, boxing money, dividend money, everything,' Mr Walker told the court. He paused before continuing: 'And now I stand here accused of . . .' Mr Walker then told the judge: 'I have got to have a break, if you don't mind', and left the witness box in tears. When he returned Mr Walker told how the banks, led by Standard Chartered, finally forced him out of the company. At a board meeting in April 1991, with the banks attending, he was told their support depended on his being removed as chief executive. 'That caused a lot of anger, and a lot of harsh words were said,' Mr Walker told the court. The Brent Walker company solicitor warned the banks their tactics were putting other directors under duress and could be challenged in the courts, he continued. However, the banks would not relent. Mr Walker said: 'I was fired. I was told by the banks to be escorted to my desk, only take my diaries and remove myself from the building and that I was not allowed back in the building again.' The judge ordered the proceedings to stop late in the morning, saying Mr Walker was 'very tired' and needed to recuperate. The trial continues.</p>

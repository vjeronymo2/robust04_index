Policy-makers in Guangzhou will take five  measures to control prices, according to the Director of the  municipal Planning Commission, Mr. Guo Xiling, speaking at a  planning meeting today.    First, every effort will be made to maintain a balance  between supply and demand and the implementation of preferential  policies and other measures for the supply of vegetables, the  area under cultivation of vegetables and the stability of food  prices and supply of industrial products.    Second, state-owned stores will function as main marketing  outlets so as to adjust the relationship between supply and  demand and control prices. Departments handling grain will be  required to take the lead in bringing prices down to normal.    Third, the regulatory fund for main foodstuffs will be  increased and the reserves system for important goods improved  in order to maintain stability of prices.    Fourth, price control will be strengthened in order to stop  illegal price hikes and fund collection.    Fifth, legislation for prices will be drawn up and the  management system for prices improved as quickly as possible.    Retail prices in the city last year increased by 24 percent  while the municipal government has called for the growth of such  prices this year to be held to within 15 percent.</p>

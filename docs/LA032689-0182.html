Brooke Meadows, who led SDSU against Oregon  with 20 points, was also selected to the all-tournament team, as were McCartney  and Kasperski.  </P> <P> The score was tied, 34-34, at halftime, and SDSU didn't trail in the second  half until McCartney's two free throws gave Oregon a 65-64 lead.  </P> <P> Perry, playing her last game for SDSU (25-9), collected 10 rebounds. Perry, who  broke tournament records by making 14 of 14 free throws Friday against Murray  State to give her 23 in a row over two games, did not go to the line against  Oregon.  </P> <P> Julie Evans added 14 points for SDSU.  </P> <P> McCartney scored a game-high 23 points for Oregon (22-10), and Kasperski added  22. Oregon shot 57% from the field, SDSU shot 45%.  </P> <P> The Aztecs led by as many as nine in the first half, 16-7, before Oregon came  back to take its first lead, 29-28, on a Kasperski layup 3:13 before halftime.

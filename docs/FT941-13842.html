			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Belgium acts on resignation The Belgian government yesterday replaced Mr Guy Coeme as deputy prime minister, after his resignation last week in the wake of a corruption scandal over a deal to buy army helicopters, Reuter reports from Brussels. The francophone Socialist party (PS) picked Mr Elio di Rupo, 43, formerly a regional minister, to succeed Mr Coeme. Mr Coeme and two regional PS politicians resigned on Friday over allegations that the Italian company Agusta paid bribes to secure a contract in 1988. All three have denied wrongdoing.</p>

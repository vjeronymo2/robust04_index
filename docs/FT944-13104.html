			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures pushed ahead strongly to reverse a four-day run of declines but activity remained low, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,042 at the official 4:10 close, up 49 points. This was a 14-point premium to the cash market and right in line with current fair value. The upsurge mostly followed the rally in German bonds and the better tone on Wall Street, and traders have begun to speculate on an immediate move for the contract above 3,050. The best of the day was 3,047, reached towards the end of business. Some of the more optimistic traders were beginning to see the recovery as an overture to the long awaited Christmas rally. The disappointing aspect of the day was the lack of genuine business with institutional activity negligible and most of the day's turnover generated by locals, independent traders. There were 11,044 contracts, broadly in line with the previous day's 10,594. This was substantially below last week's average of 13,500. Traded options fell significantly short of the previous day with 20,877 lots against 53,080. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for just over 11,000 lots. British Airways was the most heavily traded individual stock option with 1,377 lots.</p>

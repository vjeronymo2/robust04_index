			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: SIMPLE BATTER PREPARATIONS FOR MAKING SPECTACULAR-LOOKING  POPOVERS  </P> <P> Popovers look spectacular, yet are really very simple to prepare. They're an  American cousin to English Yorkshire pudding -- the same batter, baked in a  buttered popover pan or custard cups rather than in a roasting pan of beef  drippings.  </P> <P> The shell-like structures, hollow in the center, are simply leavened by the  steam produced during baking. It's not unusual for the batter of eggs, milk,  flour and salt to triple in volume.  </P> <P> To prepare popovers, measure the ingredients accurately and combine, beating  with an electric or rotary mixer (Step 1) until smooth and the consistency of  whipping cream. Note, however, that overbeating the batter prevents the  popovers from rising properly.  </P> <P> Ladle (Step 2) or pour the batter, filling the prepared cups about 3/4 full.  Place in an oven preheated to 450 degrees.  </P> <P> This initial high oven temperature converts the moisture in the batter to steam  and the popovers begin to rise (Step 3). Lowering the oven temperature to 350  degrees after the first 25 minutes slows browning and dries the interior of the  popovers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popovers Can Collapse  </P> <P> Do not open the oven door during baking. A draft of air will cause the rising  popovers to collapse.  </P> <P> For extra crisp popovers, loosen them from the pan when the total baking time  has elapsed, tilt at an angle and pierce the sides of the popovers with a  wooden skewer. Turn the oven off and allow the popovers to stand with the oven  door slightly ajar for eight to 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Popover are best served immediately. Well-prepared popovers are large in volume  and have a crisp, nicely browned exterior (Step 4). The interior cavities  should be moist, but not soggy.  </P> <P> BASIC POPOVERS  </P> <P> 4 eggs  </P> <P> 2 cups milk  </P> <P> 2 cups flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon melted butter  </P> <P> Beat eggs lightly with electric mixer or rotary beater. Add milk, flour, salt  and melted butter. Beat just until smooth.  </P> <P> Fill eight (3/4-cup) greased popover pan cups about 3/4 full. Bake at 450  degrees 25 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue to bake 20 minutes  longer, until puffed and golden brown. Makes 8 popovers.  </P> <P> Note: Oven-proof glass custard cups may be substituted for popover pan.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

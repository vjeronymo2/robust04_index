			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Recession takes toll on Dutch chemicals group DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit dwindled to Fl 6m (Dollars 3.4m) in the first quarter of 1993 from Fl 100m in the same quarter of 1992. Recession in Europe and particularly in Germany led to a decline in demand for caprolactum, a feedstock for nylon, while industry-wide overcapacity forced down the price of ethylene and its down-stream derivatives. Another negative factor was the strength of the guilder compared with other currencies. At the same time, financial expenses rose by Fl 5m to Fl 37m as a result of additional loans taken on in 1992. Sales in the first quarter were down 14 per cent at Fl 2.1bn under the combined influence of reduced prices, lower sales by volume, currency effects and divestments. DSM said it had faced the roughly the same situation in the 1993 quarter as it did in the final 1992 quarter, with a deepening recession in Europe outweighing faint signs of recovery in the US.</p>

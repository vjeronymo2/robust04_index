			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: Low life in high places - Autumn Fiction LEPORELLO by William Palmer Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 15.99, 339 pages A PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATION by Philip Kerr Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 329 pages CITY OF GOLD by Len Deighton Century Pounds 14.99, 323 pages HIGH COTTON by Darryl Pinckney Faber Pounds 14.99, 309 pages WILLIAM Palmer has come late to full-length fiction - he is getting on for 50, with only one previous novel under his belt - but late is better than never when he writes as well as he does in Leporello. As the title suggests, it is a re-working of the Don Giovanni story, seen through the eyes of his cowardly servant. Ostensibly Leporello's autobiography, it is really just an excuse for a marvellous romp through the brothels and gaming houses of 18th century Europe. A beautifully-executed romp, too. beginning with Leporello's initiation into sex at a very early age and continuing via murder, mayhem and all sorts of skulduggery to employment with the Don and a new career as gentleman's gentleman and pander to the aristocracy. Leporello takes to the work with enthusiasm, living the high life, enjoying the leavings from his master's table and sometimes also from his bed. What more could a simple country boy want? It all ends in tears, as these things usually do, but not before a wonderful time has been had by all. The author writes in the spirit of Tom Jones and Fanny Hill, with a sure touch and a masterly grasp of his subject. Why he has taken so long to blossom into print is something of a puzzle; but if he can carry on as he has begun, the rest of us will have plenty of cracking good entertainment ahead. No such starting problems for Philip Kerr, still young for a writer and already turning them out at the rate of one a year. His latest thriller, A Philosophical Investigation, follows a serial killer through the streets of London. The killer in question is highly intelligent and obsessed by Wittgenstein. The job of tracking him down has been given to lady chief inspector 'Jake' Jakowicz. We are a few years into the future here, with computer technology so advanced that the Lombroso system (named after the 19th century Italian who thought criminals could be identified by shape of skull) can screen individuals for homicidal tendencies and isolate them accordingly. But 'Wittgenstein' has hacked into the system, calmly erasing his own details before taking the names of his peers and murdering them one by one. It is an ambitious story, a slightly uneasy blend of futuristic technology and highbrow philosophy, in which readers will have to cope not only with Wittgenstein but also with George Steiner, Malraux, Marcuse, Manicheanism, Tourette's Syndrome and much else besides. It is also a satire of sorts, with TV presenter Anna Kreisler (Chrysler = Ford: geddit?) stripping naked on camera in return for a telephoned pledge of a million dollars for charity. It is a little heavy in places, a good basic idea marred by ponderous execution and a less-than-perfect ear for dialogue. But it is also highly inventive, which is more than can be said for most books of the kind. Len Deighton has finally given up on that awful wall in Berlin and, for his latest story, is falling back on an earlier generation of Germans. The City of Gold is Cairo just before Rommel's arrival, a hotbed of corruption, intrigue and double-dealing, with a German spy at large somewhere and Rommel informed in advance of the British army's every move. Throw in Greek brothel-keepers, White Russian princes, beautiful English girls, Jewish gun-runners and deserters from both sides and you have the makings of a splendid mole-hunting novel, just the sort of thing Deighton is good at. He carries it off well enough, too, although one must quarrel with him over the opening chapter in which a detective escorts a British soldier under arrest for murder to Cairo on the train. The detective explains to his prisoner that he is going to Cairo to catch the German spy. He then has a heart attack and drops dead, leaving the prisoner to unlock his handcuffs and assume the detective's identity. A younger, hungrier Deighton would never have offered his readers anything so implausible, not even in jest. Darryl Pinckney's High Cotton is billed as a novel but reads suspiciously like an autobiography - that of a young, middle-class black American of cultured background. The narrator grows up in a white Indianapolis suburb and knows nothing of race riots, crack, ghettoes or any of the usual black American experience. He thinks of himself instead as one of the Also Chosen. The narrator goes to Columbia university, travels in Europe, gets a variety of temporary jobs in New York. And all the time he is conscious of his colour, without ever being aggressive about it. When taxis refuse to stop for him and white female joggers keep their distance, he understands perfectly and feels only mildly resentful. He writes more in sorrow than anger, putting his faith in the power of understatement rather than wearing his irritation on his sleeve. He has written a very graceful, elegant, thought-provoking book. But, however hard one tries, it is still difficult to think of it as a novel.</p>

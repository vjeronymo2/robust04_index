			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (4): Hard lesson from Germany - Seoul avoids haste over reunification THE two Koreas are agreed on one subject: they both want to avoid North Korea being rapidly absorbed by the South. It is ironic that officials in Seoul, who once hoped for a quick downfall of the Pyongyang government, now have an interest in preserving it for at least another decade while the two Koreas gradually integrate. 'We may once have wished for the North Korean government's instability, but then we saw what happened between East and West Germany. We have learned our lesson,' said Mr Yu In Teak, who is a director of analysis at the National Unification Board, the cabinet-level agency responsible for relations between the two Koreas. The South Korean government sent dozens of study teams to Germany in the wake of its reunification. It convinced Seoul that a rapid takeover by South Korea of the north, if it suddenly collapses as its economic problems mount, would be disastrous. 'Our economy couldn't cope with a quick unification. We would face bankruptcy,' said Mr Tae Hwan Ok, the director of research at the Research Institute for National Unification, the government advisory agency on the unification issue. Mr Ok estimates the cost to South Korea of supporting the North at between Dollars 30bn-Dollars 50bn annually during the first decade if unification occured soon. He said that unification should take not place until at least 2020 if Seoul wanted to avoid adverse economic consequences. Although Mr Ok's analysis is more pessimistic than most, other studies have concluded that South Korea would pay a heavy price for early unification. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) conservatively estimates that South Korea would have to spend between Dollars 15bn-Dollars 26bn annually in the 1990s to improve North Korea's industrial base and infrastructure and provide social services. A report by the Korean Development Institute (KDI), the government-affiliated think tank, concluded that even if unification were postponed until 2001, the Seoul government would need to spend Dollars 240bn during the following decade to support an unreformed North Korea. 'Unification presents us with more difficult problems than it did to Germany,' said Mr Ok. South Korea's population is only twice the size of the North's, while West Germans outnumbered East Germans by 4:1. North Korea's industrial structure is much worse than East Germany's, while the rebuilding of its road and rail network will take longer because of North Korea's mountainous terrain. The most important difference between Korean and German unification is that South Korea is poorer than West Germany. While Bonn spends about 10 per cent of its budget on unification, the costs involved in a rapid absorption of North Korea would consume more than half Seoul's budget of Dollars 44.5bn. Consequently, taxes would have to be raised, while the country's debt would increase as Seoul sought foreign loans to finance the restructuring of the north. The overseas expansion of the South Korean business groups, or chaebol, would be blunted as they concentrated on developing industries in the north. There is concern about the psychological gap between the two Koreas. The isolation of North Koreans, who have almost no access to information from abroad, means that 'the difference in attitudes between North and South Koreans has become immense,' said Mr Yu. The daunting task that awaits South Korea has persuaded officials that gradual unification is the only course. They claim that the public feels the same way. 'Reunification is a sensitive and volatile issue because there is a strong emotional urge to see our country become one again,' argued Mr Kim Hakjoon, the chief press secretary for President Roh Tae Woo. 'But the German example has given the people a more realistic attitude toward reunification.' The government believes the pace of economic integration will accelerate once the issue of North Korea's nuclear programme is resolved. 'North Korea will not be able to withstand the diplomatic pressure being exerted from all sides to open its nuclear facilities to full inspection. We expect the nuclear issue will no longer be an obstacle by the end of the summer,' said Mr Kim. Economic co-operation would consist of growing inter-Korean trade, participation in infrastructure projects such as development of the Tumen River basin, and the establishment of South Korean light manufacturing factories in North Korea. This should improve North Korea's industrial base and lead to higher living standards, which are one-fifth of those of South Korea on a per capita of gross national product basis. The KDI predicts that if sufficient economic progress is made in North Korea, then unification in 2001 would cost the Seoul government about Dollars 90bn by 2010. The opening of the North Korean economy would be accompanied by moves toward a confederal linking of the two Koreas. Controls would be maintained on labour movements between the two halves of the peninsula during this transition phase, while the two currencies would remain separate but traded at a fixed rate. Political co-operation would eventually lead to de jure unification after the turn of the century. The success of this plan outlined by Seoul depends on the North Korean government reforming itself in step with the economy, while the population remains patient with the slow improvement in their living standards. Economic reform would not unleash the popular uprisings that characterised the eastern European bloc in 1989-91 because the North Korean internal controls are comprehensive and the population docile, said Mr Yu. Some independent analysts believe that Seoul's plan of gradual rapprochement is unlikely to succeed. Mr Aidan Foster-Carter, director of the Leeds University Korea Project and author of the EIU report, Korea's Coming Reunification, said that North Korea would probably collapse economically and politically by 1995 much as East Germany did in 1989. He predicted that Kim Jung Il would not last long as North Korea's leader after the death of his father, Kim Il Sung. Although his successors would be more reform minded, the changes needed to revive the North Korean economy and keep the population satisfied would be too great to undertake on a gradual basis. The inability of the North Korean system to respond to the economic crisis would leave no alternative but for Seoul to absorb the country at once. Mr Foster-Carter said that South Korea had several advantages over Germany. The strong role of the state would make it easy to co-ordinate government and corporate investments in North Korea, while the potent appeal of Korean nationalism and Confucian values would encourage Koreans to share the burden of unification without much protest. Against all the odds, Seoul would be able to handle an early unification due to these sociological factors, he concluded.</p>

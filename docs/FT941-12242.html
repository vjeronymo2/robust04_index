			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Top executives at Italian bank arrested Milan magistrates yesterday issued arrest warrants for the top management of Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank and one of the country's leading financial institutions, on charges of corruption. The warrants were for Mr Roberto Mazzotta, the chairman, Mr Carlo Polli, the deputy chairman, and two senior executives, including the head of Cariplo's pension fund. This is the biggest single judicial action against the senior management of a large Italian bank since the corruption scandals first broke two years ago. It also underlines the way in which magistrates are beginning to direct their attention to the activities of financial institutions. Yesterday's move brings to 13 the number of senior bankers from seven different banks and savings institutions who are under investigation for various offences ranging from fraud and corruption to conspiracy to bankrupt. The latest charges mainly relate to activities involving the sale and purchase of property by the Milan-based Cariplo's pension fund during the period 1985-92. Milan magistrates are reportedly investigating allegations that up to L1bn (Pounds 39m) had been paid over to the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties in illicit funds camouflaged by phoney property deals. Mr Mazzotta, 54, is a former Christian Democrat deputy and one-time minister of regional affairs. Mr Polli was a Socialist senator in the outgoing parliament. Both were regarded as political appointees - a reminder that top management in Italy's publicly-owned financial institutions have long owed their appointments to the leaders of the governing political parties. Yesterday Mr Mazzotta was reported in London. Mr Polli, however, was arrested along with the two other Cariplo executives. Apart from Cariplo, executives at the following financial institutions are involved in corruption allegations: San Paolo di Torino; Popolare di Novara; Banca Commerciale Italiana; Banca di Roma; Cassa di Venezia; and Carimonte Modena.</p>

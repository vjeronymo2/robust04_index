			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Two investment trusts move from Invesco Leveraged Opportunity Trust and Consolidated Venture Investment Trust, two investment trusts nominally managed by Invesco MIM will now be managed by JO Hambro. Invesco MIM said it would waive its contractual rights to compensation for the termination of the contract. It subcontracted investment management of the two trusts to Growth Investment Managers, the director of which, Mr Christopher Mills, had been a close business associate of Lord Stevens, Invesco's former chairman and chief executive. Since Lord Stevens' resignation from Invesco last summer, several top ranking officials of the company, who were closely associated with him have also resigned. In December, Mr Nicholas Johnson, managing director of Invesco's European operations, resigned. Mr Johnson and Mr Mills are both listed as directors of Leveraged Opportunity Trust in its latest report and accounts. Leveraged Opportunity, which invests in the 'stub equity' portion of leveraged buy-outs, has net assets of Pounds 15m while Consolidated Venture, which invests mostly in US-based venture capital situations, has net assets of Pounds 30m. Analysts estimate the move will lose Invesco MIM about Pounds 450,000 per year in investment management fees.</p>

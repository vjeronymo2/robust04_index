			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Observer: Breaking the mould If Unilever's Charles Miller Smith really has joined the race for the chief executive's job at Barclays, as is being suggested in some quarters, then it casts an interesting sidelight on the succession at Unilever itself. Unilever is headed by a triumvirate consisting of two chairmen - by tradition, one English and one Dutch - and a third director, known colloquially in Unilever as the Pope in Waiting. Both chairmen, Mike Perry and Floris Maljers, are 59, which makes them due to retire in another two or three years. The third - let us call him the PIW - is another Dutchman, Morris Tabaksblat. Since it would hardly do for both chairmen to retire at once, a likely solution is for Maljers to go next May. Tabaksblat then steps up as Dutch chairman, leaving a slot for the next PIW, who would by tradition be British. This is where Miller Smith comes in. At 53, he is a relatively high flier at Unilever, having been finance director and now running the foods business in southern Europe. But he is not quite as high a flier as his super-cool predecessor as finance director, Niall FitzGerald, who is now Unilever's detergents supremo and is still only 47. The smart money within Unilever is on FitzGerald for PIW. There would be an odd advantage to this. The tradition of having British and Dutch chairmen is rooted in the Anglo-Dutch merger of Lever Bros and Union Margarine half a century ago. This was originally a way of preserving the balance between the two sides. But in today's Unilever, it is daft that German or Indian directors should be barred from the top on grounds of nationality. And FitzGerald is not a Brit, but an Irishman. The PIW job would set him on course to be the first non-British/Dutch chairman of Unilever (one previous chairman, David Orr, was from Ireland, but north of the border). Curious that such a narrow distinction should make a difference. But that's tradition for you.</p>

The purpose of the proposed refuge is to protect and manage up to 2,300 acres of land to ensure the biological integrity of Key Cave, which has been designated by the Service as critical habitat for the endangered Alabama cavefish and as a priority one maternity cave for the endangered gray bat. A Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the proposed refuge has been developed by Service biologists in coordination with the Tennessee Valley authority, the State of Alabama, the Soil Conservation Service, The Conservation Fund, the Wildlife Enhancement Council, and Monsanto, Inc. The assessment considers the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects of establishing the refuge. The assessment also evaluates three alternative actions and their potential impacts on the environment. Written comments or recommendations concerning the proposal are welcomed and should be sent to the address below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Land acquisition planning for the project is currently underway.

The cave lies on the northern shore of Pickwick Lake in a limestone karst area that contains numerous sinkholes and several underground cave systems. The area's sinkholes form an integral part of the groundwater recharge to the caves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed refuge would consist of about 1,500 acres of land acquired in fee title, with an additional 800 acres of sinkholes in the cave's recharge area protected through conservation easements with willing landowners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major wildlife values are the two endangered species which inhabit Key Cave: the Alabama cavefish ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Speoplatyrhinus poulsom <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the gray bat ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Myotis grisescens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Key Cave is used as a summer maternity cave by the gray bat. Because of its highly specific habitat and roost requirements, fewer than 5 percent of the available caves in the animal's range are suitable for gray bat occupation. The flightless young bats roost in Key Cave from late May to mid-July, and thousands could die from a single human disturbance or act of vandalism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alabama cavefish has been found to exist only in Key Cave. Just nine specimens are known to exist in scientific collections. No other populations of this species are known. Based on its apparent distribution, the number of specimens collected, and the number of individuals observed, this small fish appears to be the rarest of American cavefish and one of the rarest of all freshwater fish. Its habitat in Key Cave is threatened by human disturbance, groundwater degradation, alternations in the area's drainage and hydrologic patterns, lowered groundwater levels, and diminished organic matter inputs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Gray Bat Recovery Plan and the Alabama Cavefish Recovery Plan identify land acquisition as the primary means for protecting Key Cave, and both list that protection as a priority one task. Because the proposed Key Cave refuge is identified as critical habitat for the Alabama cavefish and as a priority one maternity cave for the gray bat, land acquisition would be sought under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John R.

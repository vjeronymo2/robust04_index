			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Management: Outsiders welcome - US companies are developing workforce diversity In a lecture room in the Bank of Boston, an executive is pretending to declare his homosexuality. He is taunted, laughed at and ignored for half an hour by his co-workers. When this role-playing exercise is over, he talks about how it felt to be an outsider. The employees are taking part in a diversity training course, which aims to attune them better to the feelings of others. The bank's management hopes that when they return to the office, the trainees will show more willingness to work not only with homosexual colleagues, but with any co-workers who are different from them. Through diversity training and other programmes, US corporations are attempting to grapple with the opportunities and challenges of an employee base which is increasingly heterogeneous. Throughout the 1990s, minorities, white women and immigrants will account for 85 per cent of net employment growth in the US, according to the DCI Armory, a group of specialists in diversity. To prepare for the changes, some 60 per cent of leading businesses in the US are offering or planning diversity training courses, says Myron Block, a diversity consultant for consultancy Harbridge House. The US private sector first had to deal with a more diverse workforce in the 1970s, when the federal government enforced the hire of minorities. Corporate concerns are different now from 20 years ago, however. For many companies, compliance with the law remains the main priority, but an increasing number say greater diversity makes good business sense. 'Diversity is a competitive edge issue,' says Darlene Siedshlaw, executive director of diversity for the telecommunications group US West. 'There is no question that the marketplace is more diverse than it has ever been. It adds to our bottom line to have a diverse workforce to serve that marketplace.' If a marketing force is too homogenous, for instance, it risks commiting big errors when addressing diverse audiences. 'By having Hispanics on our staff, it helps us to realise things about their culture,' says Leslie Mays, director of diversity development for footwear manufacturer Reebok. 'For instance, we have discovered that Hispanics are usually very brand loyal. The brands they use when they're growing up are what they usually use later on. So we know that when marketing to that group, we should target a young audience.' Telecommunications group AT&amp;T points to language barriers it can encounter. 'We use Spanish speakers to sell our services to the Latino market, and Mandarin speakers to sell to the Chinese-American market,' says Joeann McPhearson, district staff manager of AT&amp;T. Diversity can be important for other reasons. With the rise in popularity of ethical investments, some investors screen companies before deciding where to buy shares. 'A diverse workforce attracts more shareholders,' says McPhearson. But if diverse groups often show more creativity - at least if the problems relate to their diversity - they can also be difficult to manage. Studies show, for example, that diverse groups can take longer to accomplish tasks. 'Diversity can create more interpersonal conflict and slow things down,' says Susan Jackson, associate professor of psychology at New York University. 'Companies need to learn how to minimise these conflicts to take better advantage of diversity.' Diversity training has become an important tool for corporations facing these challenges, but the nature of the courses varies greatly. Some rely on lectures to illustrate the history of black liberation, or the nature of sexual harrassment, for instance. Black actor Bill Cosby's video on bigotry in the workplace is popular. Other formats encourage employees to open up about their personal prejudices. 'People in our training courses analyse their heritage and the messages they got when they were growing up,' says Block. Open conversation may not always be a good idea. 'It opens a can of worms on the legal front,' says Jackson. 'If an executive admits to sexual harrassment during a training course, for example, can he be fired?' Many executives question the value of diversity training on its own, not least in its effects on other employees. 'Standalone diversity training is not enough to bring change to any corporation,' says Siedshlaw. 'It can even be harmful. In the 1980s, we felt a lot of backlash from white males who felt excluded from the diversity initiatives. Now, we have a programme on the difficulties of being a white male in today's society and it's a big success.' The most successful companies in dealing with diversity, researchers say, are those that make diversity part of their corporate culture. Increasing attention is paid to companies' diversity profiles. 'We review trends in our employment profiles every month to make sure we're not losing diversity,' says Mays. To ensure that the company maintains a diverse employee base, Reebok, along with a growing number of companies, makes diversity part of the criteria managers are judged by. 'We look at the diversity of the group they manage before they came in and after they have been there for a while. And we talk to them about how they helped position different people for career advancement.' With more companies seeking minorities and women, recruitment for these groups can often be fierce. 'We've had to change the way we recruit college graduates,' says Siedshlaw. 'If you just go to the placement office, you will limit yourself, because people of colour are less inclined to use the office. You need to go to campus organisations, the Society of American Indians, for instance. We've had excellent results with the new programme. Over the last two years, 50 per cent of new hires were people of colour.' AT&amp;T even adapted its redundancy programme and abandoned seniority as a criterion for lay-offs. 'If we had just fired the people who had been at the company the least time, we would have been left with a more homogenous workforce,' McPhearson explains. To make sure recruits want to stay once they are hired, many companies have encouraged constituency groups, to act as liaisons between employees and management. Digital Equipment, for example, has a number of these groups, including the African Heritage, Asian Leadership and Gay Plus.</p>

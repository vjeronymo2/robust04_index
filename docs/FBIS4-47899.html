			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Burundi Leonard Nyangoma, the minister of the  interior and security, has been fired [declare demissionaire].  [passage omitted]    After the prime minister announced the dismissal of Mr.  Nyangoma, the Front for Democracy in Burundi [Frodebu] recalled  that its view is that, by virtue of the constitution, the head  of government is no longer in office. Frodebu is therefore  saying that the decisions of the prime minister are null and  void.</p>

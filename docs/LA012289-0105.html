			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> 2 ARRESTED, 2 SOUGHT IN JEWELRY STORE ROBBERY  </P> <P> Police were seeking two men Saturday who remained at large after their  suspected accomplices in the armed robbery of a Lancaster jewelry store were  arrested.  </P> <P> Lawrence Frank, 28, and Richard Brown, 25, both of Los Angeles, were arrested  Friday on suspicion of robbing at gunpoint a jewelry store in the 43700 block  of N. 15th St. West in Lancaster, said Deputy Dan Cox of the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Witnesses said four men held up the store Friday, Cox said. After taking an  undetermined amount of jewelry, the robbers fled in two vehicles -- a white car  and a black van, Cox said.  </P> <P> Shortly after the robbery, officers from the California Highway Patrol spotted  the black van heading south on the Antelope Freeway near Sand Canyon Road and  began pursuing it, Cox said.  </P> <P> The van, traveling at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h., eventually rear-ended a car  and plowed into a guardrail on the eastbound Ventura Freeway near Van Nuys  Boulevard, Cox said.  </P> <P> Two men jumped from the van and ran onto surface streets in Sherman Oaks, Cox  said. Police cordoned off the area and used helicopter and canine teams to find  the men.  </P> <P> Frank and Brown were being held at the Antelope Valley station in lieu of  $50,000 bail each, Cox said.  </P></p>

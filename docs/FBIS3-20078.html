			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by news </F> announcer Josef Broukal in the television studio in Vienna --  live]    [Text] [Broukal] Our colleague Langer [who compiled a  report on the compromise reached by the foreign ministers of the  European Union on the blocking minority that aired prior to this  interview] just said that no one is really happy with this  compromise. Are you happy with it?    [Mock] I am satisfied because it was the right step in the  right direction for the first time in three weeks. One must not  forget that there has not been any progress at all during the  past three weeks. Today we had the possibility of really  holding discussions with individual colleagues. I was able to  talk to my three colleagues from the Scandinavian countries.  Then we met Foreign Secretary Hurd and the Spanish foreign  minister. I would say there is a fair chance that a solution  will be found this week or next week. Hurd advocated the  British position, but he indicated clearly that he wants a  solution, even in the form of a compromise.    [Broukal] Mr. Foreign Minister, this is precisely what we  have tried to find out here all afternoon -- namely where is the  compromise? As far as we understand the matter, it is said that  in the future Great Britain cannot prevent anything, unless it  says that it wants to prevent something. That means, how long  will this period be during which Great Britain can say: No, we  are not satisfied, we must still hold discussions? Is there a  day as of which this objection is no longer valid, because only  this would be progress?    [Mock] This will certainly be discussed in Brussels tomorrow  or the day after tomorrow -- whether or not there will be a  specific point in time. However, I may give you a positive  example. In Austria's social partnership [talks between  representatives of employers and employees] there is no specific  period for negotiations and, nevertheless, negotiations are  always held until a result has been achieved with the agreement  of all four parties. This is a system of which the world is  envious.    [Broukal] This means -- if I try to translate what you just  said -- with its resistance Great Britain has achieved  [recognition] that its objections cannot simply be ignored.    [Mock] Correct. I believe that this must be granted, if  there is not more behind it.    [Broukal] If I ask you to take a bet now: What are the  prospects that Austria can continue with its schedule for  membership in the European Union as planned?    [Mock] The working hypothesis still remains that we will be  able to stick to our schedule and hope become a member of the  European Union on 1 January 1995.    [Broukal] Thank you for your visit to the studio, Mr.  Minister.</p>

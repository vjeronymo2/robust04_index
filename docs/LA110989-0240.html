			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: NEWPORT SHORES-NEWPORT CREST: FOCUS;  </P> <P> LIFE AND DEATH DRAMAS IN TRANQUIL NEWPORT SHORES  </P> <P> While other parts of Newport Beach are typified by ease and elegance, many  life-and-death dramas take place each day at Hoag Hospital, the dominant  landmark of the Newport Shores-Newport Crest neighborhood.  </P> <P> On a typical day at the 471-bed facility, located on a bluff overlooking  Newport Harbor, an average of seven babies are born and at least 100 people  receive emergency treatment. The Hoag Chemical Dependency Center is here, along  with centers specializing in the treatment of heart disease and infertility.  </P> <P> The hospital has functioned in a state of constant change and expansion since  it opened as a 75-bed facility on the site in 1952. The most recent addition,  the George and Patty Hoag Cancer Center, is under construction and scheduled  for completion next year on a portion of a 22-acre adjacent site purchased in  1984. Dubby Evins, president of facilities design, says plans for that acreage  will triple the size of the hospital during the next 20 years.  </P> <P> Hoag Hospital functions as the main hub of the non-residential portion of the  Newport Shores-Newport Crest area, coexisting with numerous professional  buildings and other large businesses such as the Hughes Aircraft Newport Beach  facility on 16th Street, just south of the hospital.  </P> <P> Several large condominium developments are on the bluff west of the hospital,  including Newport Crest. But the portion of the neighborhood along West Coast  Highway below the hospital is more typical of the relaxed, waterfront  atmosphere associated with other portions of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> On a typical weekday morning, rush-hour traffic streams along West Coast  Highway while a number of cars pull into Cappy's Cafe -- as though lured by the  smell of breakfast sausage and ham steaks frying on the grill. The aroma drifts  out the door toward the parking lot as customers pile out of their cars and  head in for a leisurely breakfast with friends or alone with the newspaper. The  restaurant is a favorite among locals and others in the know.  </P> <P> T.K. Brimer, who owns the Frog House surf shop nearby, sleeps too late to be  part of the breakfast crowd at Cappy's, however. Brimer's employees open the  shop every morning at 9, usually after testing the early morning surf.  </P> <P> "I'm a night person," Brimer says. "I don't get in to work until around 9:30 or  10, and if the surf's good, I head right out and surf for an hour or two. The  only reason I have this shop is so I can surf. It's no big moneymaker."  </P> <P> The big moneymaker in the neighborhood is the city-owned oil field behind Frog  House, on marshland near the Santa Ana River. The 16 pumps churn out an average  of 60,000 barrels of oil per year from ocean-floor wells one to two miles  offshore. The wells provided more than $500,000 in revenue for the city last  year. And when the price of oil is higher, revenue from the wells hits the  million-dollar mark, according to Newport Beach utilities director Robert J.  Dixon.  </P> <P> The oil field is across a canal from a residential area where Howard and Betty  Jo Chace have lived since 1963, when they purchased their canal-front home new  for $38,000 on land leased from Signal Landmark Corp. Fortunately for them, the  Chaces were among those who decided to buy the property their home is built on  for an additional $38,000 when Signal Landmark made the land available for  purchase in 1976. Only 76 of the original 398 homeowners decided to purchase  then.  </P> <P> When Signal Landmark offered the property for sale again in 1982, the asking  price had nearly doubled, resulting in numerous lawsuits that are now reaching  the settlement stage. "People were shocked at the increase," Howard Chace said.  "I wouldn't take less than $500,000 for this home now."  </P> <P> Although the neighborhood was originally a tract-home development, some owners,  like the Chaces, have added their own embellishments to the street and  canal-front portions of their homes, giving many of the houses a unique look,  in spite of uniformity in size. The slow-moving canal frequented by egrets and  other sea birds gives the area a peaceful atmosphere distinct from other,  faster-paced portions of Newport Shores-Newport Crest.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 5,469  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +15.3%  </P> <P> Median Age: 39.4  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix: White (non-Latino), 93%; Latino, 5%; Black, less than 1%;  Other, 2%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 38.4 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 40.5 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $25,080  </P> <P> Median household: $41,575  </P> <P> Average household: $51,399  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 30%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,000: 31%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 18%  </P> <P> $75,000-$99,999: 12%  </P> <P> $100,000 and more: 9%  </P></p>

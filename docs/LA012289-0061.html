			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ACT OF KINDNESS IN 1933 IS STILL REMEMBERED  </P> <P> According to Webster, nostalgia is "homesickness" or "a longing for something  far away or long ago." So this is not nostalgia, because I certainly don't want  to go back to either the scene or the time of the incident that follows.  </P> <P> But I think what took place that hot afternoon in 1933 in New Mexico is worth  sharing.  </P> <P> A friend, who had just finished reading an article I wrote about being on the  road in the '30s, reminded me of it.  </P> <P> In that story my mother, my sister and I were traveling across the country from  Denver to California in the family car, an old Essex.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Money Would Be Waiting  </P> <P> Trying to get the jump on winter, we had started without having enough money  for the trip, but my father had promised faithfully to wire money at some of  the cities along the way. He said he'd have $25 waiting for us at the Railway  Express Office by the time we got to Albuquerque.  </P> <P> In the story I pointed out that when we got to Albuquerque the promised money  had not arrived, so my mother "made do" and we continued to California.  </P> <P> "Hey, wait a minute," my friend said. "What do you mean by your mother made  do?" Twenty-five dollars in the '30s was almost two weeks' pay. If she was  counting on it and it wasn't there, how'd she swing it? How could she possibly  "make do"?  </P> <P> "Well," I answered, "that's not the story I started out to tell."  </P> <P> The answer seemed to satisfy him but it didn't satisfy me. I got to thinking  about it. A woman with two children in a car packed to the windows with  personal belongings, almost out of gas and stuck in what was then a small town  in New Mexico in the depths of the Depression. How had she made it?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Childhood Memories  </P> <P> It's funny -- sometimes somebody accidentally nudges a door you'd forgotten was  even there. It swings open and the memories come flooding through.  </P> <P> It was hot and dusty and late afternoon as my sister and I waited for my mother  to come out of the Albuquerque Railway Express Office.  </P> <P> When she did, she was very upset. She stopped on the steps of the loading dock  for a few seconds, wiped her eyes, came to the car and got in.  </P> <P> "Was it there?" my sister asked. She was 11 or 12 at the time. Not exactly an  adult, but old enough to help with the worrying. Mother shook her head and put  on her driving gloves very slowly and very carefully.  </P> <P> When I asked if we could get something to eat she didn't answer for a moment.  Then she said, "Of course we can. We have to, don't we?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low Voices  </P> <P> She drove about two blocks along the railroad tracks to the Harvey House  restaurant and took us inside. It was a huge dining room, smelling of good  things to eat and almost empty.  </P> <P> When a waitress came over to show us to a table, mother took her a few feet  away from my sister and me and spoke to her in a low voice. The waitress  listened and then went to the kitchen. She came back with a man who was wearing  a suit.  </P> <P> He and my mother talked for a few more moments. He nodded and led us all to a  table, where he pulled out a chair and seated my mother. My sister and I sat on  either side of her.  </P> <P> "What would you like?" the waitress asked.  </P> <P> "Perhaps sandwiches for the children," my mother said, "and I'd like a cup of  coffee." The girl was starting to write it down when the man put his hand over  her order book.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handsome Order  </P> <P> "Why don't you let me order for you?" he asked. Then, not waiting for an answer  from my mother, he told the girl we would all start with hot soup and then we'd  have the beef stew, mashed potatoes, bread and butter, and coffee for the lady.  He asked my sister and me if we wanted milk or hot chocolate.  </P> <P> We both said, "Yes, sir!"  </P> <P> "Milk and hot chocolate for the children and some of the cobbler all around.  Does that sound all right?"  </P> <P> "Will that be all?" the waitress asked.  </P> <P> "Oh," the man said, "and these people are the guests of Mr. Fred Harvey."  </P> <P> I saw my mother say thank you, but I didn't hear her voice.  </P> <P> The taste of the rich brown stew is still with me, though I've had a million  meals since that one.  </P> <P> And thinking about it still brings up the picture of that immense restaurant,  so clean it looked as if it had been polished, and the waitresses -- the Harvey  girls, with their bright smiles, puffed sleeves and starched aprons. They  rustled when they walked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Real Hospitality  </P> <P> When the last of the cobbler was gone and we rose to leave, my mother pushed a  couple of coins toward the waitress. The girl pushed them back with a smile.  </P> <P> "Oh no, ma'am. You're Mr. Harvey's guests," she said and placed two bags in  front of my mother.  </P> <P> "The manager said I was to wrap up what you didn't eat, so you could take it  along."  </P> <P> "But we cleaned our plates," I said. My sister sighed and looked at me as if I  was the stupidest person in the world. First the waitress, then my mother, then  all of us got the giggles. Mother picked up the sacks and we left.  </P> <P> In the car, mother and my sister looked into the bags, which clearly contained  a greater volume of food than we'd had for dinner.  </P> <P> "What's in them?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Loaves and fishes," mother said. "Loaves and fishes."  </P> <P> That evening she swapped some of our personal possessions for a tank of gas and  a room in an auto court.  </P> <P> There was no money at Railway Express the next morning, either, but for some  reason things didn't seem so bleak or so frantic.  </P> <P> As we were passing the Harvey House on the way out of town, my mother pulled to  the side of the road for a moment. "Some day," she said, "when you two grow up  I want you to go to a Harvey House and order the most expensive thing on the  menu and then I want you to leave a big tip."  </P> <P> We both said we would.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Money Was Waiting  </P> <P> There was a money order waiting for us in Yuma. I don't think it was $25, but  it was enough to get us the rest of the way to the relatives we'd be staying  with in California.  </P> <P> In spite of the fact that Fred Harvey's long gone now and the last Harvey girl  is probably married and celebrating her grandchildren or great-grandchildren,  and Harvey's restaurant chain has probably changed hands a dozen times or more,  I think I'll check and see if there are any still around.  </P> <P> And if I find one, I'll stop in, order from the top of the menu and maybe  finish with a little cobbler and a cup of coffee. Then I'll lift my cup:  "Here's to you, Mr. Harvey."  </P></p>

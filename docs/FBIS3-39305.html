Nikolaou: "Prime Minister Mitsotakis'  Tragic Mistakes"]    [Excerpt] The deadlock our country faces today in our  foreign policy -- and particularly our isolation in the Skopje  issue -- originated in the tragic mistakes of the Mitsotakis  government. However, the then-opposition, which is today the  government, bears serious responsibilities because it, too,  focused on the question of the name [Macedonia].    These views were expressed by former Prime Minister G.  Rallis  in an interview given to TO VIMA. The former prime minister  urges the political leadership to agree on a consensual policy  to find a realistic solution.    G. Rallis in his interview with our political editor N.  Nikolaou speaks also on the government's policies up till now  and finds that A. Papandreou is not keeping his promise to offer  equal treatment under the law to all citizens, but instead he is  bringing back the partisan way of thinking in the Army, the  civil administration etc.    Here is the text of the interview.    [Nikolaou] The government has already completed three months  in power. It may be that it is too early to assess its work  (although in the economy much has already been done), but it  would be useful to have an evaluation of at least the "style" of  the new government.    [Rallis] I was hoping that A. Papandreou with the  experiences  of his previous eight-year term as prime minister and with the  knowledge that this is his last term as prime minister --  regardless of the likelihood of his moving to the presidency of  the republic -- would this time keep the promise he gave right  after the 1981 electoral victory of the Panhellenic Socialist  Movement [PASOK] that he would be the prime minister of all  Greeks -- a promise he soon forgot.    The disappointing fact is that, unfortunately, not even now  is he going to carry out this promise which, in any event, is a  self-evident democratic principle for a parliamentary prime  minister. Already from the very first days of his new prime  ministership, it appears that in all political decisions the  partisan spirit is prevailing and that in the end he surrenders  to that spirit.    It is not necessary to emphasize how destructive the  perpetuation of this tactic is for our country.    [Nikolaou] But has he given any signs of such a divisive  policy? What specific instances do you have in mind?    [Rallis] I want to believe that this tactic of going along  with this partisan mentality is not his deliberate personal  choice. What is important, however, is that regardless of his  intentions the harmful effects are there and more are coming at  a time when, because of the many and critical problems facing  the country, it is imperative that we avoid upheavals and that  we promote instead peace and tranquillity.    But the events of the last days in December in the sector of  city transportation in Athens and in the armed forces show that  the need for calm, especially at this moment, is hardly  understood. [Passage omitted]    [Nikolaou] Let us move now to the armed forces. By what  logic  did the present government not have the right to recall to  active duty officers who were removed for purely partisan  reasons?    [Rallis] I would like to make a few comments regarding the  events in the crucial and sensitive sector of the armed forces  and of the police. In July 1974, immediately after the fall of  the dictatorship, the former government of national unity faced  a tremendous problem caused by the seven-year dictatorship  especially in the armed forces. In spite of those difficulties,  the government of national unity managed to deal with the  situation by recalling to active duty only one high-ranking  officer, Lieutenant General Dionisios Arbouzis. Many other  excellent officers were in retirement, such as Peridis and  Erselman -- to speak only of those who have passed away -- but  there were many others too. Nevertheless, the former government  decided that for the good of the armed forces it should not  recall them to active duty. With this policy the government  restored and secured not only legality but also order and  discipline in the armed forces. The beneficial effect was soon  evident in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, which became  indeed strong and battle-ready.    Today's government, when it took over two and one-half  months  ago, faced no similar problems nor did it face any unrest in the  armed forces. Therefore, it had no reason to replace their  leadership. In any event, the military leadership -- namely the  chiefs of the four general staffs and the commander of the armed  forces [Stratia] -- should be replaced only in the event they  refuse to implement the government's defense policies. Such a  problem did not exist. The government's view of a multiparty  military leadership with representation from all parties and  other new-found ideas are totally unacceptable. The cadres of  the armed forces do not belong to political parties nor do they  act in a partisan way. Free, democratic citizens vote for the  candidates of their choice, but they belong to the armed forces  and to the nation, not to political parties. Nonetheless, the  government has recalled to active duty several retired general  officers in all three weapons, four of whom took over the post  of chief in the General Staff of National Defense [YEEThA], the  Army General Staff [YES], the General Staff of the Air Force  [YEA] and the General Staff of the Navy [YEN]. And let me say  that it is possible that all four are good officers but I do not  think that they are better than the two I mentioned earlier.    As General Verivakis, the former chief of YEEThA, correctly  said, the return of the retired officers to active duty has  indeed created a major issue in the ranks of the officers and of  the armed forces in general. Self-respect and the unrest caused  many resignations harmful to the cohesion, the strength, and the  defense capabilities of the armed forces. Personally I would  agree with those resignations. But I cannot but appreciate the  honest and courageous decision of those who resigned sacrificing  their career to uphold the ethical code that must guide the  officer corps. I cannot understand why Air Force General N.  Kouris, the present deputy minister of defense, did not protest  this partisan domination of the armed forces, which brings back  to our country the mentality and the political climate of  national discord between the World War I and II, which brought  such calamities to the nation. And I must say that I have  personal knowledge of General Kouris' abilities because of my  work with him when I was prime minister.    [Nikolaou] The New Democracy [ND] government had recalled  retired officers to active duty, and in fact some of them had  served in the military police [ESA] during the dictatorship as  stated recently in the Chamber of Deputies.    [Rallis] Yes, the ND government had recalled to active duty  two retired general officers of the Air Force, and appointed  them as chief and deputy chief of the Air Force general staff.  It should have avoided it. In any event, there is a great deal  of difference between that and the actions of the PASOK  government this time. First of all, only two officers had been  recalled then, and only in the Air Force. Most important, those  two officers were not party cadres as is the case today. It is  generally known that the Navy officer who was recalled to active  duty and was appointed chief of YEEThA was until the eve of his  recall a member of the PASOK Central Committee.    Regardless of the abilities and the qualifications of the  recalled officers, and for some of them I have many  reservations, the fact that immediately after their retirement  they had become active PASOK party cadres should have ruled out  any thought of bringingh them back to active duty. Never before  has a similar action taken place and indeed to such extent not  only in the armed forces but also in the police, even in the  fire-fighting corps. Retired officers were chosen for their  leadership, too.    This is an unbridled effort to bring the party into those  crucial sectors which are directly related to our national  integrity and social protection, at a time particularly critical  for our country.    [Nikolaou] Which were in your view the mistakes of the  previous government with regard to Skopje?    [Rallis] In my opinion, it was a very serious error that  from  the beginning the main -- the excessive, I would say -- focus  was on the name of the small state, and that the proper emphasis  was not given to the question of the borders, the Constitution,  the flag, and the propaganda which I believe were much more  important than the name.    We fought with such a policy on a problem which the  foreigners -- especially our European partners and the Americans  -- cannot understand to the degree we wished, while at the same  time we encouraged inside the country a not only useless, but in  many ways dangerous nationalistic paroxysm.    For the small Skopje state, without historical and cultural  tradition, the name, even unwarranted, and the language, even if  manufactured, constitute the only foundation for a separate  state existence. I do not underestimate the significance of the  name, nor do I ignore the ulterior motives it conceals. But the  development of a specific threat we could have averted and  eliminated through international guarantees and especially with  the strengthening of our domestic front in all sectors.  <H5>  Errors of Strategy and Tactics </H5>   [Nikolaou] On which specific areas do you find the erroneous  moves of the Mitsotakis government?    [Rallis] The moves of the government were unfortunate in  several areas including (a) it did take advantage of the  opportunity offered by the Pineiro Package; (b) after the  removal of Samaras from the Foreign Ministry, the former  government, instead of taking advantage of the opportunity to  proceed with a "mid-course correction," continued with increased  zeal the policies of the dismissed minister in full agreement  with the former opposition; and (c) the government did not  assess properly the alternative solutions as well as the  possibility Skopje had to bypass the European Union.    So, without a community plan which could have been an  improved version of the Pineiro Package we were left to face the  difficult problem alone, relying only on the "community  solidarity" which is effective only when it is invoked by our  strong partners.    [Nikolaou] What were the consequences of our haphazard  policy  on Skopje?    [Rallis] The consequences of this policy were clearly  negative from the point of view of organizing the strategy and  tactics for the effective defense of our national rights and the  safeguarding of our country's interests. But there were also  adverse consequences as a result of our policies including (a)  the almost total concentration of our foreign policy on the  Skopje issue, at the expense of any other constructive effort  that could be undertaken for our country and any opportunity  that came along in the new order in the Balkans and (b)  essential weakening of our position on the coming developments  of the Cypriot problem, especially at a time when the Cypriots  ask for our most active assistance.    In closing, I would like to say, sadly, that the Skopje  issue  is going from bad to worse for us, with the danger that we may  not achieve what previously was given to us, as it has happened  before in the Cypriot issue, too.    We are reaping now the bitter harvest of our mistakes. But  who is to blame? The present government accuses the previous  government and today's opposition accuses the government. No one  accepts responsibility on his part. But it is certain that they  are all to blame -- government and opposition. It is at least  hypocritical for one party to blame the other. This is an  attitude which does not serve the national interest -- I would  say it is harmful instead -- nor does it bring honor to the  political leadership and neither does it upgrade our political  life.    The fatigue caused to the international community by  prolonging this issue and the damage from this continuing  deadlock cause haphazard and unrealistic moves. This situation  should have forced the political leadership to agree at last on  a consensual policy (which we often advocate but never  implement) to find a realistic solution to this problem, a  solution which of course will safeguard our interests.  <H5>  The Mistakes of Prime Minister Mitsotakis </H5>   [Nikolaou] The recent developments on the Skopje issue with  the diplomatic recognition of this state by six countries of the  European Union show that the policy followed primarily by the  previous government was leading to an impasse. How do you  evaluate more generally this policy?    [Rallis] In April 1992, while I was addressing the Chamber  of  Deputies on the Skopje issue, and in June of the same year in a  joint statement on this issue with seven other personalities, we  tried to turn the policy and the actions of the former  government on this national issue to the right direction,  without weakening our country's bargaining position.    I had foreseen even then -- with accuracy, almost  prophetically -- the adverse developments for Greece which  followed and which unfortunately continue with painful  consequences. Neither my efforts nor my specific warnings had  any positive effect.    [Nikolaou] Your proposal was not accepted by the government  at that time. Was this the reason that led eventually to  resigning as parliamentary deputy?    [Rallis] The way things were going my worries intensified. I  could not approve the actions of the government and -- even less  -- I could not agree with the demagogic and jingoistic policies  of the opposition, which had forced the ND government to a  policy of impasse on the Skopje issue. PASOK is equally  responsible for this deadlock.    So I decided to resign from my parliamentary position on  March 29, 1993, just before the voting on the Skopje issue  shortly after midnight, with a letter addressed to the president  of the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

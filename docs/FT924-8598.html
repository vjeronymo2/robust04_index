			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: New reinsurance venture aims to fill catastrophe gap INTERNATIONAL investors are financing a Dollars 350m Bermuda-based venture which aims to take advantage of new opportunities in the catastrophe reinsurance market. The Mid Ocean Reinsurance Company, sponsored by Marsh &amp; McLennan, the insurance brokers, and J. P. Morgan, the US bank, begins underwriting next week. The new company will work with international brokers to support risks lead by underwriters in the London market, particularly at Lloyd's, where capacity has been dented following a run of heavy losses. Mr Ian Heap, Mid Ocean's president and chief executive, said the company had been set up 'because the broker market for reinsurance was diminishing. The demand for the product was exceeding supply.' A number of reinsurers have withdrawn from the market and rates are rising, he added. Mid Ocean will initially underwrite up to Pounds 10m (Dollars 15.50m) per risk, taking 'lines' (or shares) of up to 10 per cent of reinsurance programmes. Mr Charles Skey, Mid Ocean's underwriter, has more than 30 years' experience at Lloyd's where he was widely regarded as an expert in catastrophe reinsurance. Mid Ocean will underwrite from Bermuda but has a contact office at Lloyd's. Marsh and Morgan are each investing more than Dollars 30m in the new company. Exel, a Bermuda-based insurer set up by US corporations in 1986 and formerly headed by Mr Heap, will invest a further Dollars 100m. Other backers include Commercial Union, the UK insurer; Mr Richard Rainwater, a Texan investor; Bishop Estate of Hawaii; and Fund American Enterprises Holdings of New York. The investors are expecting returns on capital of more than 20 per cent in the venture's initial years, according to Mr Heap. Reinsurance premiums for catastrophe cover by UK and other European insurers rose sharply at the end of 1990 and increased again last year. US insurers are expecting big increases following record losses after hurricanes Andrew and Iniki earlier this year. Bermuda's low taxes and gentle regulatory environment make it an attractive location for 'offshore' reinsurance and captive insurance companies.</p>

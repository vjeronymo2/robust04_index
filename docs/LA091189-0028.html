			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS;  </P> <P> IT IS BETTER, BUT FLUFF, PUFF STILL PLAGUE TELEVISION NEWS  </P> <P> KGTV(Channel 10) anchor/commentator Michael Tuck said in a recent radio  interview that "television news is better now than it was five years a go."  </P> <P> This is some sort of ritualistic chant practiced by just about everybody  employed in the television news industry. Question any aspect of TV news1 and  they get this glazed look on their face, usually followed by, "Well that may be  true, but it is better now than it was five years ago."  </P> <P> Or they start talking about Edward R. Murrow. Either way, television news  professionals tend to defend the present by comparing it to the past. The  constant comparisons to the past could lead some to believe that TV news had  been pretty lousy. Especially since five years ago they said TV news was better  than five years before that. In fact, they've been fondly reflecting on the  leaps and bounds made by TV news ever since someone first said, "Maybe it would  be a good idea to show some pictures while we read the news."  </P> <P> Local TV news people say the resources at their disposal are far greater than  ever before. Now that news is a moneymaker for stations, they have more staff,  more equipment and more technical versatility than ever before.  </P> <P> Of course, ask them why they don't do a better job of covering the day-to-day  news, and they quickly point out that they don't have the resources. Then they  get that glazed look.  </P> <P> Echoing the thoughts of many in the industry, Tuck said that competition has  improved television news, that the overall quality of journalism is far better  than in the Happy Talk Era of a few years ago.  </P> <P> He also said television news is "more cynical and penetrating of what public  officials are doing," which, except for his aggressive "Perspective" pieces,  could be called laughable. A recent Tribune analysis of local TV news showed  that KFMB-TV (Channel 8), for example, devoted twice as much time to sports as  to government and education stories, and twice as much time to weather as  national news.  </P> <P> Beyond covering every obligatory press conference and staged-for-television  photo opportunity, political coverage by television news is rarely more  sophisticated than a few talking-head interviews.  </P> <P> "Instead of just being reactive and covering (stories) on the surface, we're  looking at root causes more," Tuck said.  </P> <P> That's probably true. They are far more willing to go in-depth on some  subjects. Channel 10 devotes quite a bit of time to its annual swimsuit  feature.  </P> <P> Last week, Channel 10 was one of many stations to focus on drug issues, which  gave the station the opportunity to show footage over and over again of  narcotics officers making a bust. Or maybe that was "Cops" or "Geraldo." It's  becoming harder to tell the difference these days.  </P> <P> Witness the antics of Channel 39's Paul Bloom, who gleefully reenacts crime  scenes, pointing to blood stains and pantomiming the use of guns for emphasis.  Other than coming across as a shill for the Police Department, Bloom's style of  reporting, and the rapidly growing group of television reporters doing similar  reports, aims to strike emotional chords with the audience, more than simply  telling the story.  </P> <P> That's a relatively new development in the industry. Whether it is better or  not is a reasonable topic of debate.  </P> <P> Other elements of TV news remain relatively unchanged. At least 90% of the  stories covered by television are generated from press releases or newspaper  stories. Far too often they simply pick up stories without bothering to check  facts. It's the same type of rip-and-read approach used by old radio news  programs.  </P> <P> Television news undoubtedly is better in its ability to cover events live, to  instantaneously be at the scene of a breaking news story. On the other hand,  the preponderance of unnecessary stilted live reports is a truly annoying part  of modern television news. Was it really necessary for KNSD-TV (Channel 39) to  have a reporter live at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, even though it was  empty, to babble about Pete Rose?  </P> <P> Tuck said television news is better because it does a better job of covering  the stories that are important to people, such as environment and health  issues. Just last week, Channel 10 had "focus groups," or average citizens,  watching its newscasts to tell the station what is important, what they like  and don't like about Channel 10 news.  </P> <P> Input from such groups, aided by surveys and the all-important, God-like  barometer of TV news -- ratings -- shape TV news, even more so than five years  ago. The polling methods are more sophisticated now, and therein lies the  well-documented basic flaw of the industry.  </P> <P> Asking people what they want to see on TV is sort of like asking children what  they want for dinner. They may not watch what they say they want to see, and  they're rarely going to ask for what's good for them.  </P> <P> The result is a truckload of sensational yet superficial stories, an emphasis  on warm puppy features instead of the real factors that control people's lives.  </P> <P> Maybe, in some ways, television news is better than five years ago. And  microwave popcorn is better, in some ways, than conventional popcorn. But it's  still 90% fluff.  </P> <P> Dr. Charles Hohm, chairman of the sociology department at San Diego State  University, was "incensed at the sloppy reporting" of the arrest of Jack D.  Mooers, an SDSU associate professor.  </P> <P> When Mooers was picked up for having a few hundred marijuana plants on his  property, he reportedly told police he worked for SDSU's sociology department.  In fact, Mooers worked in the school of teacher education, which was reported  by news outlets that bothered to call the university.  </P> <P> According to Hohm's research, the local newspapers and Channel 39 checked with  the school, but Channels 8 and 10 simply referred to him as a professor of  sociology, not the type of association the sociology department craves.  </P> <P> When he tried to get a correction, Hohm found the TV stations had "no remorse,  a real cavalier attitude" toward the mistake, which Hohm feels tarnished his  department.  </P> <P> At least Hohm can take solace in knowing TV news is better now than it was five  years ago.  </P> <P> KSDO-FM (102.9) has hired longtime KGB-FM (101.5) deejay John Leslie to work  afternoons, the first local hiring by the station, which switched to a classic  rock format a week ago. The station has picked up Phil Hendrie, most recently  of KLSX in Los Angeles, to do morning drive, at least temporarily. More hirings  are expected this week. . . . Fired KKLQ (Q106) morning deejay Jack Murphy will  be on KVSD-AM's (1000) "Night Talk" talk show at 8:30 tonight to share his  views on life and his ex-employer.  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Bonn funding need tumbles A sharp improvement in Germany's cash position has helped cut the new borrowing requirement of the public sector by about two-thirds this year, the Bundesbank said yesterday in its monthly report. The turnround is in line with statements by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, that the high federal budget deficit, which soared after reunification, was falling significantly. In the first 10 months the public sector borrowed DM32bn (Pounds 13bn), against DM101bn in the same period of 1993, as the government's credit needs were reduced by its more favourable cash position. The government's cash deficit totalled DM22.7bn in the January-October period, down from DM48.5bn. Net new government borrowings were down to DM17bn from DM66.5bn in the 10 months. Pressure on Mr Helmut Kohl's government to continue the tougher line on spending has come from industry and the Bundesbank. This week Mr Kohl said the government would cut bureaucracy, reduce the share of public sector spending in the economy and strive to privatise more state assets. Concern over high levels of state spending has been a main concern of the Bundesbank in trying to hold down money supply expansion. It has long argued that the high cost of financing east Germany's reconstruction should be matched by spending curbs in the west. Although the earlier steep rise in M3 has slowed sharply, the Bundesbank is still determined to reduce it further.</p>

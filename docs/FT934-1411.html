			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Exciting wines at razor sharp prices - Jancis Robinson scours the high street for the best value bottles in the second part of her seasonal round-up A brewer's group of specialist off-licences is offering the widest range of wines, although those interested in price above quality are best served by supermarkets. Limited distribution wines are marked (LD). Star ratings denote corporate commitment to wine quality. SAINSBURY*** Prices have always been razor sharp, but the range is noticeably more exciting than a year or two ago, although some of the best wines enjoy only limited distribution (LD). WHITES Chardonnay Vin de Pays d'Oc 1992 Pounds 2.99. Extremely keen price for a wine in which the lees-flavoured appeal may fade rapidly but is rarely associated with this price bracket. Do Campo Branco Pounds 2.99. Portuguese white blended by Australian Peter Bright from Fernao Pires grapes which has settled down in bottle to become an attractive, if simple, fruity dry white. Gyongyos Esztergom Country White 1992 Pounds 3.35. Lively, dryish Semillon from Hungary. Argentinian Torrontes Pounds 3.49. Scented, lively aperitif blended by Trapiche from Argentina's white grape speciality. Chardonnay delle Tre Venezie Pounds 3.59. Still one of the best-value whites available in the UK, blended by Angela Muir. Riesling QbA 1989 von Kesselstatt Pounds 4.65. Someone has been working very hard to place a wine from this ambitious Mosel producer in every major chain and we should benefit from the attractive prices while they last. This is a snip, a declassified Kabinett from a very good vintage and already shows some maturity. Sprightly, for once this really is 'liquid refreshment'. Gentil Hugel 1992 Pounds 4.95 (LD). Hugel's new Alsace blend sounds so much better than Edelzwicker and tastes both soft and lively. It would make a please-all holiday house white, especially good for serving without food. Lindemans Bin 65 Chardonnay 1993 Pounds 4.95 (available elsewhere). Displaying admirable quality considering the quantity made. Menetou-Salon 1992 H Pelle Pounds 6.45 (LD). Better value than most Sancerres on offer. Fine. REDS Jumilla Altos de Pio 1989 Pounds 2.99. Plums, life, good powerful aroma. Slightly tough but there is fruit too. Faugeres Pounds 2.99. A good, vigorous, if light example of this appellation in the hills of the Languedoc from the ubiquitous Domaines Virginie. Drink slightly cool, with leftovers? Castel Pujola Tannat 1988 Pounds 4.75 (LD). Basque immigrants brought the Madiran grape to - Uruguay] Powerful, concentrated, well-balanced wine in a nicely labelled bottle. Worth seeking out. Ch Beaumont 1990 Haut-Medoc Pounds 5.95. A special Christmas price for this good vintage of a respectable cru bourgeois. Penfolds Bin 389 Cabernet Shiraz Pounds 7.45. Well-blended classic South Australian. Mercurey 1990 Domaine de la Grangerie Pounds 7.95 (LD). Scented and fruity with an attractive suggestion of licorice. Good with turkey. TESCO*** Great activity to some interesting effect. The rivalry with Sainsbury continues. Many Tesco or International Winemaker labels. WHITES Uvas del Sol Argentinian White Pounds 3.49. Big, powerful, dry, exuding flavour from a blend of Chenin and Ugni Blanc with some aromatic Torrontes grapes, made by LA Agricola. The Torrontes 1992 (more limited distribution) is worth the 20p premium over the Sainbury example (Waitrose has the 1993). Dry but scented. Australian Colombard/Chardonnay Pounds 3.75. Lemon and lime. Well blended from Murray river-irrigated fruit. Domaine de la Jalouisie Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 4.99 (LD - very). Yves Grassa, best known for his Cotes de Gascogne, plays to extremely good effect with the white burgundy grape and some top quality barrels. Viogniers Pounds 4.99 and Pounds 5.49 (LD). Both of these Vins de Pays d'Oc are full, almost blowsy examples of this most fashionable grape. The Domaine St James (from Etang de Colombes in the Corbieres) is so peachy it's almost commercial air 'freshener'. REDS Merlot del Piave Pounds 2.99. Full, lively, north Italian soft red. Serve cool. Uvas del Sol Argentinian Red Pounds 3.49. Robust blend of Italian Sangiovese and Bonarda with Malbec. International Winemaker Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc 1992 Pounds 4.99. Modern, cool-fermented Languedoc wine. Very deep purple. Young, simple, powerful, drink now] Yarra Glen Pinot Noir 1992 Pounds 5.99 (LD). A second label from Tarrawarra in the Yarra Valley, widely regarded as Australia's natural Pinor Noir habitat. This seems better value than the Pounds 9.99 first label to me, although it may be best served very slightly cool. Penfolds Bin 128 Shiraz 1990 Coonawarra Pounds 6.99. Oaky, dense mouthful. FORTIFIED WINES Halves of sherry. Tesco sherries have always good but not always this well packaged. A useful half of lively, palate-whetting Manzanilla is Pounds 2.99, while the even more tingly, fuller Palo Cortado is Pounds 3.99. THRESHER/BOTTOMS UP/WINE RACK**** This Whitbread-owned off-licence group is waving the specialist flag most vigorously at the moment with some thoughtful buying and useful literature. It seems to be trying to hook us out of curiosity rather than price-cutting. WHITES Sauvignon Nouveau 1993 Fortant de France Pounds 3.99. Lively, fruity, jolly, if simple. English wines from the Harvest Wine Group. The exciting range of well-made wines from the English winemaker described in the Weekend FT a few weeks ago, in the Pounds 4 to Pounds 6 range and well worth it. Bridgewater Mill Riesling 1993 Pounds 4.99. Petaluma's second label, a full, lively Riesling from South Australia that is drier, and therefore more useful, than most. Villa Maria Riesling 1993 Pounds 5.49. Spine, acidity, spritz, off-dry New Zealander. Casablanca Sauvignon Blanc 1993 Pounds 5.99. Real pizazz. Off dry richness. Long Chilean. Scharzhofberger Riesling Kabinett 1990 von Hovel Pounds 7.15. Lovely, light, pure, palate-sharpener. Gewurztraminer Hengst 1990 Alsace Grand Cru Pounds 9.99. Good, meaty, savoury yet full, persistent white that can be drunk with all sorts of red wine foods. Puligny-Montrachet 1990 Louis Carillon Pounds 15.99. Lovely pure stuff with great nerve and density. Great that a mass market chain actually lists this (although you may have to order it). REDS Redondo 1991 Pounds 3.29. Loose, juicy red from a Portuguese co-op. House wine, for serving with or without food. Quinta de Lamelas 1992 Pounds 3.69. First-class concentrated red from the Douro valley, made at Quinta de la Rosa. Too cheap. Cotes-du-Rhone Tradition 1991 St Esteve d'Uchaux Pounds 4.79. Full, supple, smooth. A good southern Rhone at a fair price. Palliser Estate Pinot Noir 1991 Pounds 9.99. Light, but perfumed, slightly sweet, and well structured for drinking with this year's festive fowl. Mountadam Pinot Noir 1991 Pounds 9.99. If the above is New Zealand's answer to Beaune then this is Australia's answer to Nuits, a much more substantial yet still lively riposte to red burgundy. VERY STICKY Seppelt Old Trafford Tawny Pounds 7.49. Tooth-rotting sweet fortified wine with more than a hint of rancio and zabaglione. Stanton &amp; Killeen Liqueur Muscat Pounds 5.49 a half. Australian sticky par excellence. Christmas pudding was created for this. VICTORIA WINE** A name to watch in 1994, although for the moment it is left at the starting post by rivals Thresher. WHITES Gaillac Blanc 1992 Labastide de Levis Pounds 3.29 (available elsewhere). Amazing transformation from the dried-up apple peel of previous vintages to a characterful fruity mouthful, yet still recognisably the Mauzac grape. Australian winemaking is the answer - yet again. Good house white. Cape View Sauvignon Blanc 1993 Pounds 4.29. South African fruit, New Zealand winemaker, lively wine. Charles de France Chardonnay 1992 Boisset Pounds 4.69. A marginal bargain, this basic white burgundy, but worth seeking out just to see which cards a commercially astute Burgundian chooses to play. Answer: heavy Dom Perignon-like bottle, heavy French branding, and the claims 'oak aged' and (to trump New World producers) 'hand picked'. REDS Jumilla 1990 Carchelo Pounds 3.59. Another well-packaged wine. New wave red Spanish. Rich, desperately trying to hide its naturally high alcohol. Vina Pilar 1990 Felix Callejo Pounds 4.99. Another bargain from Ribero del Duero in north west of Madrid. Heavy oak but lots of ripe fruit. Ch Carignan 1990 Pounds 6.99. Well made, plummy, vigorous yet accessible petit chateau claret. Colle del Talo 1990 Pounds 6.99. Well-made Tuscan vino da tavola from Vicchiomaggio. Concentrated Sangiovese grapes given oak ageing. Substantial wine that can already be enjoyed. WAITROSE*** Solid selection with some interesting bees in its bonnet. WHITES Santa Julia Torrontes 1993 Pounds 3.75. Judiciously young, fragrant Argentinian aperitif wine. Tesco and Sainsbury also stock a version. Ch Haut Rian 1992 Pounds 3.99. Distinctly superior dry white bordeaux which packs much more of a punch than many of its more expensive peers. Ch Chaubinet 1992 at Pounds 3.95 is almost as good. Jacquere 1992 Vin de Savoie Pounds 4.55. Alpine refreshment but with more fruit than in many years. Avontuur Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 4.99. Extremely good value for a well-made, relatively savoury, mealy South African. Tokay Pinot Gris 1992 Blanck Pounds 5.25. Gorgeous. Serious, full, smoked bacon flavours. Very long and substantial. Ch Bastor-Lamontagne 1990 Sauternes Pounds 7.75 a half. Waitrose has long sold this fine value sweet white bordeaux. Deep, rich, long, from a fine vintage. This wine could be drunk now but it should also repay cellaring until the turn of the century. REDS Ramada Pounds 2.39. Yet another underpriced offering from a Portuguese co-operative. Hints of sweet chestnuts. Tiring after a while but look at the price . . . Cotes du Ventoux 1992 Paul Boutinot Pounds 2.99. Juicier, lighter version of red Cotes-du-Rhone; good value. Avontuur Cabernet/Merlot 1993 Pounds 3.99. Jolly, powerful South African blend from Stellenbosch. Teroldego Rotaliano 1991 Gaierhof Pounds 4.25. Amazingly deep colour with deep, full, soft fruit flavours and a hint of bitterness at the end. Good with cheese. Last week, Marks and Spencer's two-star rating was omitted.</p>

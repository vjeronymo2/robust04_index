According to a report disseminated by  the Algerian Government, seven people were killed in one of  these clashes. Unofficial neutral sources announced yesterday  that ever since General Liamine Zeroual assumed power as  surrogate president of the former Ruling Council, nearly 60  people have been killed in clashes between government forces and  antiregime opponents.    According to political observers, the intensification of the  conflict in Algeria has further reduced any hopes of a political  solution to the country's crisis. In his first speech after his  appointment by the former coupist council, General Zeroual  promised the Algerian people that the way would be paved for a  political solution to the country's crisis by initiating a  dialogue with opponents.    These observers believe that the current trend in Algeria is  no different than that which prevailed in the era of the former  Ruling Council and that there are no indications that the  government intends to resolve the political crisis. The release  of political prisoners, the lifting of the state of emergency,  and the change of approach toward opposing groups and factions  are among the factors that could pave the way for a solution to  the multifaceted crisis in Algeria.    If the newly appointed government of General Zeroual wishes  to tread the same path blazed by the former Ruling Council in  its attitude to opponents, it will certainly face a crisis and  will not have a better fate than the members of the former  Ruling Council, who were forced to step down at the beginning of  this week.    The use of the military has never been effective in  resolving a widespread political crisis, and the newly appointed  Algerian Government is being forced by the insolvent economy to  adopt a quick political solution. For the past few days, the  Algerian Government has been announcing to all its creditors  that it cannot pay its foreign debts, which only confirms its  bankruptcy.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM stresses Maastricht gains MR JOHN MAJOR will today emphasise his support for the Maastricht accord in an attempt to restore the government's grip on recalcitrant Conservative MPs. Downing Street signalled yesterday that the prime minister is also ready to defy his party's Euro-sceptics by acquiescing at the Lisbon summit in the reappointment of Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president. Mr Major voiced his intense irritation with Tory divisions over Europe at a lunch yesterday with new Tory MPs. Expressing dismay at the internal battles that have erupted since the Danish referendum, he reaffirmed his view that the deal he had secured at Maastricht had begun to reverse the trend towards EC centralisation. That message was underlined by Downing Street aides. They said Mr Major would tell the Commons today that the accords on political and monetary union were 'good for Britain and good for Europe'. Privately, some ministers said yesterday that many in government would not be unhappy if Maastricht unravelled because of rejection in, say, the Irish or French referendums. But they insisted that, with the British presidency of the EC starting in two weeks, Mr Major could not be seen as attempting to wreck the accord. Ministers believe that a repudiation of Maastricht would fatally undermine the government's chance to put the enlargement of the Community and completion of the single market at the centre of the Brussels agenda. That stance is likely to infuriate Tory Euro-sceptics who used Mr Major's visit to Rio to rally opposition to Maastricht. Yesterday the European Reform Group broadened its assault by blaming sterling's place in the exchange rate mechanism for the depth of the recession. Mr Major intends to allow the threatened revolt to 'blow itself out' by delaying the bill to ratify the legislation until Denmark makes its position clearer. Downing Street aides insisted that the Mr Major had yet to take a formal decision on the extension of Mr Delors' tenure. But they pointed out that there was no other credible candidate likely to be less 'federal' in instinct. It was also suggested that an extension would provide the opportunity for Mr Ruud Lubbers - the Dutch prime minister and a favoured British candidate for the presidency - to take over in 1995.</p>

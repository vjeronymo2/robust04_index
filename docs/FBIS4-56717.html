			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Juan B. Chevalier, spokesman for Panama's </F> Arnulfist Party, PA, by an unidentified reporter at PA campaign  headquarters in Panama City on 8 May--recorded]    [Text] [Chevalier] I believe Balladares' recent  announcement proclaiming victory is a bit premature, because to  announce victory with merely half the votes counted is somewhat  hasty. I believe there are still half of the votes left to be  counted. A runner can still get tired halfway through the race.    [Reporter] What can you say about the vote count, which is  taking place at the Atlapa Convention Center?    [Chevalier] I believe the election has been a demonstration  of true democracy. The people have voted freely and elected the  winner, but we still do not know who the winner is.    [Reporter] What is your opinion on the election process?    [Chevalier] It is an irreproachable process. Panama has  given the world an example of how an election process should be  carried out. The people have voted with a civic spirit, and  their decision has been respected so far.    [Reporter] Do you believe the PA will triumph in these  elections?    [Chevalier] What's that?    [Reporter] Do you believe the PA will emerge the winner in  these elections?    [Chevalier] Of course. I have always said the elections were  between this country's two largest parties. I have always  maintained that the struggle was between the PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party] and the PA. Certain sectors went around  talking about other candidates who I personally believe should  not have participated in the elections. The results so far have  proven me right....    [Reporter, interrupting] Such as which candidates?    [Chevalier] You know perfectly well to whom I am referring.  Please do not ask me foolish questions. [laughs]    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] ...a reconciliation?    [Chevalier] I do not believe.... [pauses] I have always said  we can be adversaries but not enemies; these are two different  concepts.    [Reporter] Don't you believe that with the two parties  claiming victory this could lead to violence and intolerance?    [Chevalier] I do not believe this could be the case, because  we are all willing to accept the final verdict, but the votes  must first be counted. I believe it is a bit hasty to proclaim  victory in the middle of the race. That is all I wanted to say,  and I reiterate it. I believe it is a bit hasty; moreover, the  Electoral Tribunal has been stating that candidates should not  make victory statements and that they should wait until the  National Vote- Counting Board announces who won; therefore, to  claim victory halfway through the vote count is comparable to  making excuses beforehand.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Stafanets, Chernivtsi: "Reunification </F> of Bukovyna with Romania Landed in Court"]    [Text] In Chernivtsi the Press Office of the Oblast  Administration has again taken the newspaper "Play Rominesk"  (Romanian Region) to court in the Pershotravnevyy Rayon. This  action followed a series of incendiary articles seeking to sow  mistrust, engender tensions, and question the validity of  international border agreements. Many in Chernivtsi feel that it  is high time that the Romanian Culturological Society imeni  Eminesku, of which the Play is the official publication, should  be held accountable for their campaign. The issues are complex  since Romanians make up 20% of the electorate, a fact not  lost  on local politicians.    Even the most tolerant of stoics would be annoyed by the  activities of the Eminesku society which, from its very  beginnings in the 90s, always had more to do with politics than  culture. The leaders, Oleksadryna Chernova, Iliye Zehrya, Vasyl  Teretsanov, speculate on Ukrainian poverty with a variety of  changing demands: now a Romanian university in Chernivtsi, then  special privileges for Romanian-speaking conscripts, or finally  dual Ukrainian-Romanian citizenship. Their inspiration comes  from the Christian Democratic Alliance of Romanians in Ukraine  which is registered in Kiev, although its activity is limited to  Chernivtsi. Recently the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice had to  caution the Alliance about interfering in government affairs.    Their activism peaked in 1992 when the new Ukrainian state  was coming into its own and many Moldavian village councils in  Chernivtsi region seized the opportunity to raise the Romanian  tricolors. At that time there were already six Romanian  societies, but the Eminesku group strove for pre-eminence as the  true torch bearers and martyrs of the `Romanian idea'. Romanian  press reports indicate that at the end of 1993 the editor of  Play Rominesk, Teretsanov, had received the National Prize of  the "Greater Romania Fund" for his poetic and journalistic works  on behalf of reunification of Bukovyna with its Romanian mother,  all of which he is said to have accomplished despite savage  persecution.    But Bukovyna is not a festering boil like the Transdniester.  While Teretsanov hankers for laurels from Iliescu for his  martyrdom--and there are many politicians in Romania ready to  finance his activities--there is no hope that the Ukrainian  government or local authorities will play along by arresting and  executing him. In the meantime, the Eminesku society has to put  up with 55 kindergartens and 86 schools with Romanian as the  language of instruction, a chair of Romanian language at the  university, Romanian organizations at educational institutions,  reinstitution of historical placenames, as well as friendly  relations between Ukrainians and Moldavians. This is true not  only of Ukraine, but also of Moldova. The Moldavians and  Romanians in the Ren district of the Odessa region can only hope  for the tolerant conditions prevalent in Chernivtsi.    Still, various Romanian national fronts and some deputies in  the Romanian parliament have set out to save their compatriots  in Ukraine. They seek solace in the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact to  support their pretensions to Ukrainian territory, ignoring  subsequent international treaties. Some recent improvements in  Ukrainian-Romanian relations are due to the visit of Adrian  Nastase, the speaker of the Romanian parliament, to Ukraine and  the Chernivtsi Oblast. However, politicians in Chernivtsi feel  that even highly placed Romanian politicians question the  present borders but, in distinction to the radical elements, are  willing to wait for a more opportune time to strike. This  supposition is supported by the recurring demands in the  Romanian press for recovery of `historical lands' and  allegations by the official Romanian press agency, Rompress,  that Romanians are deprived of opportunities for professional  education.    More likely, having been soundly rejected in Moldova, the  adherents of "Greater Romania" feel they have to seek new lands  to conquer for their raison d'etre. Without a chronic struggle  for some imaginary Romanian lands they run the risk of being  relegated to the lunatic fringe even in Bucharest itself. In  Bukovyna they miscalculated when the Ukrainian authorities  simply let the law take its course.</p>

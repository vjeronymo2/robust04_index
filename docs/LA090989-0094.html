			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MICHAEL, HARRELL AT BOWL  </P> <P> Lucidity and purposefulness again marked the performances Hermann Michael  elicited from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, when the West German conductor led  the orchestra at the second concert of his two-night visit to Hollywood Bowl  this week.  </P> <P> More important, the extreme contrasts -- from deep quietude through extrovert  bumptiousness -- to be found in both Richard Strauss's "Don Quixote" and  Dvorak's Eighth Symphony were delivered and savored in ear-opening readings  Thursday night.  </P> <P> The Philharmonic does not always play with such conviction and neatness this  late in a summer season. But then, not many conductors pay the orchestra the  compliment of attempting to use all its many resources of color and dynamics in  an outdoor setting, where those resources are not necessarily well perceived.  </P> <P> Thursday, with cellist Lynn Harrell the guest protagonist and Philharmonic  principal violist Heiichiro Ohyama taking the secondary solo spotlight, Michael  led a "Don Quixote" which found therein Strauss's sometimes neglected nuances  and faceted pensiveness, as well as the expected heroism.  </P> <P> It became a touching performance through Harrell's probing exploration of the  Don's fantasy, poignancy and vulnerability. To dig this deep into the hero's  character would be courageous at an indoor performance; to attempt it in an  amphitheater seating 18,000 might seem foolhardy, except that on this occasion  Harrell and his colleagues made it work.  </P> <P> Ohyama's stylish and immaculate playing made a nimble foil to the cellist's  virtuosic ruminations, and the other solo lines -- especially those contributed  by concertmaster Sidney Weiss -- fleshed out the musical drama.  </P> <P> Michael and the Philharmonic dug as deeply into Dvorak's familiar orgy of  melody, producing freshness and spontaneity in a work already known for its  irresistibility.  </P> <P> This time, tune followed tune with a sense of the inevitable; climaxes emerged  naturally and unforced, and each movement carried its proper weight to the  happy conclusion. At that end, the crowd of 9,037 erupted with cheers and  hollering, and that seemed perfectly natural, too.  </P></p>

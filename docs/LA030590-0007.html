			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WILCOX PUTS LIGHT TOUCH ON CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY: THE GOP AIDE SEEKING TO SUCCEED MARIAN LA FOLLETTE (R-NORTHRIDGE)  HOPES COMEDY WILL MAKE HIM A SERIOUS CONTENDER IN THE 38TH DISTRICT.  </P> <P> Last Wednesday, a young state Assembly candidate took the microphone as a  roomful of Republican campaign contributors loosened their belts after a  fund-raising dinner. But the candidate didn't deliver the predictable speech  about the need to crack down on criminals and unleash private enterprise.  </P> <P> He did impersonations.  </P> <P> First he did Ronald Reagan, mimicking the ex-President's avuncular laugh and  mannerisms. Then he did George Bush, Dean Martin and George Burns.  </P> <P> And when candidate Robert Wilcox wound up his routine, his audience applauded  -- if not thunderously, at least warmly.  </P> <P> "I'm following Ronald Reagan's footsteps," said Wilcox, 24, in a recent  interview. "First show business, then politics."  </P> <P> Since his high school days, Wilcox, an aide to GOP Assemblywoman Marian W. La  Follette of Northridge, has moonlighted as an amateur impressionist at  open-mike nights, company parties and GOP dinners.  </P> <P> But for the next three months at least, Wilcox will be concentrating on  politics as he campaigns to replace La Follette in the Republican-dominated  38th Assembly District, which arcs across the northern San Fernando Valley from  Hidden Hills to Tujunga.  </P> <P> Last Tuesday, La Follette abruptly announced that she will not seek reelection  and, in a familiar political baton-passing ritual, endorsed Wilcox to succeed  her. Wilcox also is expected to be backed by La Follette's longtime ally, state  Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), in his quest for the GOP nomination in the  district.  </P> <P> Wilcox's heir-apparent status didn't last long. Two days after La Follette's  surprise revelation, Granada Hills real estate broker Paula Boland, a longtime  GOP grass-roots activist, announced that she would challenge Wilcox in the June  5 primary.  </P> <P> Boland, 50, was swiftly endorsed by two prominent GOP figures in the Valley,  Assemblywoman Cathie Wright of Simi Valley and Los Angeles City Councilman Hal  Bernson. And political observers predict a number of other candidates will make  a bid for the seat, which La Follette has held for 10 years.  </P> <P> Despite his youth, Wilcox is a seasoned veteran of local GOP political battles  and is considered a strong contender to succeed La Follette. At age 15, he was  youth chairman of Davis' first state Senate campaign. After a stint as a  part-time field representative for Davis, Wilcox joined Davis' ill-fated 1986  campaign for the U.S. Senate, acting as campaign coordinator and helping with  fund raising and speech writing.  </P> <P> Since 1986, he has been an aide to La Follette, gaining visibility as a prime  mover behind her long but unsuccessful campaign to carve the sprawling,  610,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District into smaller districts.  </P> <P> With his slightly oversized glasses and suits that seem to flap a bit on his  gangly 6-foot, 4-inch frame, Wilcox has the air of a high school Latin teacher  on his first day of class. But in Valley Republican circles, he is known as a  clever political coalition-builder and deal maker.  </P> <P> In an effort to persuade Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates to run for mayor  last year, for example, Wilcox quietly raised enough money to perform  preliminary opinion polling for Gates, according to Eric Rose, 24, a close  friend and fellow GOP worker.  </P> <P> But Wilcox has shown unusual precociousness in entertainment as well as  politics. His impressions are so popular in some circles that he is sometimes  paid for his appearances, and he admits to being star-struck by performers from  Frank Sinatra to songwriter Sammy Kahn.  </P> <P> "I'm telling this story against my better judgment, but I won "The Gong Show"  when I was 12 years old," Wilcox said.  </P> <P> "I did this celebrity news routine. I had George Burns interviewing Jimmy  Carter in the Rose Garden. I had Jack Benny doing the weather. And Richard  Nixon did commercials," he said.  </P> <P> An on-and-off student at Cal State Northridge since 1983, he is a journalism  major and hopes to work someday as a television news reporter. But for years he  has fantasized about breaking into show business.  </P> <P> "I flirted around with getting into show business full time, " he said. "I love  entertaining -- singing and dancing -- the kind of old-time entertainment that  doesn't exist anymore.  </P> <P> "You know, Sammy Davis Jr. or Jerry Lewis -- they're the kind of all-around  entertainers who don't exist anymore. . . . To see people out there smiling and  enjoying themselves, that means a lot to me."  </P> <P> Raised in the Valley, Wilcox was the third child of a McDonnell Douglas  computer analyst and a housewife. A churchgoing Presbyterian, he attended the  private Los Angeles Baptist High School in Sepulveda, where he was student body  president.  </P> <P> "We had Bible classes every day," he said. "Some teachers would start every  class with a prayer. It definitely had a fundamentalist Christian outlook."  </P> <P> A conservative, Wilcox favors an end to bilingual education in Los Angeles  public schools and mandatory anti-drug education for students beginning in  kindergarten.  </P> <P> He said business must provide more money and "take leadership" in the war on  drugs. He opposes creating new landfills or expanding existing ones in the 38th  District, an issue that has been one of La Follette's biggest political  headaches.  </P> <P> In addition, Wilcox said he will vigorously continue La Follette's efforts to  break up the Los Angeles school district.  </P> <P> Many political figures associated with the Davis and La Follette camps praise  Wilcox as intelligent, energetic and an excellent public speaker.  </P> <P> "I think he'll be very approachable, with good intelligence and good  conservative instincts," said Davis, Wilcox's longtime political mentor. "And I  think he'll have a lot of potential. He has an excellent ability to express  himself, much better than most people at age 24."  </P> <P> But others who know Wilcox are less than flattering.  </P> <P> "I don't think Rob cares about the district," said one person who spoke on  condition of anonymity. "He just wants to be an elected official and have the  prestige and glamour he thinks goes along with that. Rob's a great one to have  over at your house for a party. But I'm not sure he's a great one to have in  the Assembly."  </P> <P> Some local observers said Wilcox's backing from Davis and La Follette will make  him hard to beat in the GOP primary, especially given the recent upsurge of  support for La Follette's school district breakup efforts.  </P> <P> But other analysts think Wilcox will be hampered by his age and his lack of  name recognition. And they say Boland, given her backing by Wright and Bernson,  could be a formidable candidate.  </P> <P> Republican observers with a longer view worry that a bitter, expensive primary  battle between Wilcox and Boland -- and perhaps others -- could weaken the GOP  nominee enough to open the door to a Democratic upset in November.  </P> <P> However, Republicans outnumber Democrats in the district by about 12,500. And  so far, only two Democrats -- Irene Allert and Gary Crandall -- have filed for  the seat, and neither is well known.  </P></p>

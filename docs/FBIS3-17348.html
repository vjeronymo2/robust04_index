Regional fighting renewed on Thursday after two Georgian  battalions supported by armor had tried to break through tunnels  in Kodor Pass.    A deputy Abkhazian defence minister described the attack as  well- prepared but Abkhazian troops stepped in quickly to  suppress it.    Two Georgian tanks were destroyed as well as one artillery  piece and one rocket launcher. Several Abkhazian soldiers were  injured.    The Abkhazian defence ministry fears a possible attack on  Abkhazian positions amid reports of Georgian troop concentration  along the Ingur river separating the two sides.    In the meantime, head of Abkhazia's pro-Georgian government  Zurab Erkvania told our correspondent in Tbilisi that the  Abkhazians burnt down the village of Nabakevi in the Gal region.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 22 Apr (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi  has denied that the government is being pressured by the World  Bank or other financial institutions. He added that the  government does not take orders from the World Bank or other  financial institutions. The government's decisions in the area  of economic reform, he pointed out, are based on the conviction  that they will serve the interests of the homeland and the  citizens. He also said that no one could force us to do  something in which we do not believe.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM published today, the prime  minister added: We have economic ties with all countries. We  export, import, and hold open dialogue with all the world's  countries and economic blocs, including the IMF, the World Bank,  and the Paris Club. He added that we all benefit through common  interests, and our cooperation with the World Bank and other  international institutions must be viewed in the context of  "common interests" only.    Dr. Sidqi touched on the issue of price hikes. He added that  the state is striving for economic liberalization and for  keeping the economy free from administrative decisions. This  does not mean, however, that there will be no state control on  prices and on the quality of commodities. The proof of this is  that many contaminated commodities are discovered and rejected,  and their importers are brought to trial.    The prime minister emphasized that for more than two years  prices have been relatively stable. He said that inflation  rates are declining noticeably. The rate now has gone down to  approximately 7 percent, compared with over 25 percent a few  years ago. This proves that the economic reform policy in Egypt  is successful.    On reports that the government intends to lay off employees  in the public sector after privatization, Dr. Sidqi reiterated  that there will be no victims from the public business law and  that no employees will be laid off unless they want to and, in  that case, they will get all their rights.    On the government's confrontation with corruption, Dr. Sidqi  said that no society is free from corruption, but this issue has  been highly exaggerated here. Most cases of corruption are the  result of rumors or malicious writing. Many of these cases have  been taken to court and the rulings were decisive.    The prime minister was then asked about the delay in  enacting  the tenant-landlord law. He noted that the government prefers  to conduct more studies on this matter and that the results will  soon be submitted to the People's Assembly, because such a law  could have negative or positive ramifications for society and it  should be studied further.</p>

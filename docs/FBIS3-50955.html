			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roxie Wasking Vasquez from the "Vector 21" </F> newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] In officially opening the elections campaign for the  21 August 1994 elections, Government Secretary Patrocinio  Gonzalez Garrido, acting as director of the General Council of  the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE], has called for respect  for the law.    Without mentioning the Chiapas conflict, he issued his first  statement since the beginning of the armed struggle in that  state. He said that violence is the negation of politics and  represents backwardness, disorder, anarchy, and the destruction  of democracy.    The government secretary appeared gaunt, nervous, and  worried. He said only the law can guarantee legal security and  democratic life. He noted that, within a state of law, it is  always possible to punish criminals. Gonzalez also insisted  that violence does not permit the reaching of agreements. Here  is what he said:    [Gonzalez] "Society, the political parties, and the  government reject violence as a means of producing political and  social change. As the president has said, there is nothing that  can inhibit Mexicans' ability to reach agreements and to talk  among themselves. The federal government has reiterated its  commitment to safeguarding and strengthening a state of law with  the security and peace demanded by development, as well as with  dialogue and agreements as means for securing fundamental  cooperation. All of this requires laws and compliance with the  law."    After delivering this message, the meeting turned into a  debate on the situation in Chiapas. The political parties  represented at the IFE General Council have rejected violence,  but there is criticism about the methods the Mexican Army and  the federal government have used to put down the uprising.    A calm and articulate Porfirio Munoz Ledo [leader of the  Party of the Democratic Revolution -- PRD] engaged the attention  of his listeners by charging that the government controls the  public forces and that the Indians have become cannon fodder.  Munoz Ledo, speaking as the PRD representative, said the  inefficient and segregationist policies of the regime should be  questioned. He denied that the political forces have a common  position on the Chiapas events. We, he said, demand moderation,  legality, dialogue, timely information, and effective support  and help for the people. We also demand respect for human rights  and basic solutions, as well as an end to the impunity of  government officials and political agents. Here is what  Porfirio Munoz Ledo said:    [Munoz] "The executive branch has the constitutional  obligation to determine when, how soon, and how officials under  its jurisdiction should be changed. Our responsibility is to  continue struggling for the renewal and purge of the electoral  authorities at all levels."    Alberto Carrillo Armenta, representative of the Cardenist  Front for National Reconstruction Party, also called for a  nonmilitary solution in Chiapas. He said this year's elections  process cannot be initiated if there is a state of emergency.  He demanded security measures for candidates who, like the  Cardenist Front's candidate -- Rafael Aguilar -- will be  carrying out a political campaign in that state of the Republic.    The Popular Socialist Party, represented by Jesus Carlos  Hernandez, called for common sense in the debates on, and in the  solution of, the Chiapas conflict. He rejected foreign meddling  in the region.    The National Action Party also participated in the debate.  Juan de Dios Castro spoke in a very emotional tone. He tried  to stir the political awareness of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI], the federal government, and all  Mexicans. He said the conflict in Chiapas could extend to other  regions of the federation because there is poverty in all of  them. He explained that the individual guarantees of the Mexican  people cannot be violated because of what is happening in  Chiapas.    He recalled, quoting a South American leader, that changes  will take place with or without politicians -- they just come.  Here is what Juan de Dios Castro said:    [Castro] "Changes will take place with or without us. If  they take place without us, this will sadden me. The people are  making demands. They are shouting demands that we make  structural changes. They are also demanding respect for the  Constitution."    The PRI had three of its militants at the meeting. Two of  them are official IFE representatives -- Santiago Nate and  Amador Rodriguez Lozano -- and the third one, Miguel Gonzalez  Avelar, is an adviser to the Chamber of Deputies. The PRI  representatives said their party is not evading a debate, but  they asked that the issue be discussed at a forum other than IFE.    Amador Rodriguez Lozano said democracy is not a birthright  of  political parties but, rather, of society. He said democracy  does not equate with irreconcilable division, and he added that  no attention should be paid to apocalyptic visions. He said  there are other problems that require the attention of IFE's  General Council. Here is Amador Rodriguez Lozano:    [Rodriguez] "The position we must adopt at this first  meeting  should not be one of searching for a leading role in the  discussion of this problem. We should center our attention on  the many difficult matters we have ahead of us -- matters that  we will have to discuss repeatedly, passionately, and often."    Miguel Gonzalez Avelar said there should be no confusion  concerning the Mexican Army's involvement. He said that  communities have the right to demand, as in the case of Chiapas,  the presence of national forces. He said it would not be right  for members of the federation not to expect to demand and  receive help from the forces of the federation.    Gonzalez added that our duty is not to dull our awareness.  He recalled that in Chiapas there are rebel minorities, just as  those who killed [Mexican Independence hero Miguel] Hidalgo were  also in the minority, as were those who brought a foreign prince  to Mexico and those who killed [Mexican patriot Francisco]  Madero. Here is what Gonzalez said:    [Gonzalez] "Today there is this faceless violence from a  well- organized group that unfortunately and tragically includes  young people aremed with wooden rifles who remind us of the  Cristera War [between government forces and Catholic militants]  when young people charged federal soldiers to silence their  rifle barrels with little wax balls, believing this could be  done because the little wax balls had been previously blessed by  their pastors.    "In any event, these groups are proposing substituting the  party system for the unalterable will of rifles."    The first regular IFE session is continuing. It has  officially opened the 21 August elections process to renew the  Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, the Presidency, and the House  of Representatives. The session continues. The members will be  discussing other issues. Discussions on the Chiapas events  concluded at 1200.</p>

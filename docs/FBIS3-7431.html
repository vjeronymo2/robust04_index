			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army Spokesman Colonel Phalangkun Klahan said that  some newspapers had presented reports accusing the Army of  supporting the Khmer Rouge [KR], banning reporters and diplomats  from visiting the border, and forcing the repatriation of  Cambodian refugees. They also publicized photos showing  relations between Thai and Khmer Rouge soldiers. The spokesman  said the reports were untrue and were causing damage to the  Armed Forces. He said that the Armed Forces upheld humanitarian  principles and UN policy in assisting the refugees. It is the  duty of the Cambodian Government to look after the refugees  since they are Cambodians. He reaffirmed that the Armed Forces  did not support the Khmer Rouge.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Spain oil slick spreads AN OIL slick from the Greek tanker Aegean Sea spread along Spain's northwestern coast yesterday despite efforts to prevent it from destroying valuable marine ecosystems and invading beaches, Reuter reports from La Coruna. Efforts to extract crude oil still stored in the stricken tanker were frustrated by heavy swell and fires burning in the engine room, La Coruna governor Pilar Lledo told reporters. She said the authorities were unwilling to risk human lives in salvaging the tanker while its situation was still unstable. The oil had covered an area of 19 square miles by early yesterday and environmentalists feared it could spread as far as 60 miles and devastate shellfish beds which provide much of the region's livelihood. Local unions and ecology groups claimed the authorities had failed to take sufficient preventive measures. Beaches along the Betanzos and Ares estuaries, northeast of La Coruna, were covered with oil and the slick was bearing in on Ferrol, whose port remained closed yesterday.</p>

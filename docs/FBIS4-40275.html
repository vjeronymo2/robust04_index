			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Andrey Kirillov and </F> Andrey Bychkov]    [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun [TASS] -- The treaty on the basis of  friendly relations between the Russian Federation and the SRV,  which had been prepared for signing by the Russian and  Vietnamese governments, will not be signed today, an ITAR-TASS  correspondent has been told by circles close to the Russian  Government.    According to sources close to the Vietnamese delegation, the  questions of the United Nations' role in the world and Vietnam's  debt to Russia, following its succession from the former USSR,  still need to be agreed upon.    According to Vietnamese sources, questions of the  prospecting  and joint extraction of oil and gas by the "Vetsovpetro"  enterprise and problems of the Vietnamese community in Russia  also remain unsolved. Nor has agreement been reached on the  question of the base at Cam Ranh, as Vietnam has put forward a  proposal to review the conditions of its lease.</p>

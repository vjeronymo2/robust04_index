			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Booksellers protest over HSE deal BOOKSELLERS have appealed to the government to overturn a decision by the Health and Safety Executive to sell its publications to a single bookshop chain - Dillons. In July the HSE announced that it had awarded the contract for the distribution of both its free and priced publications to Promotional Logics (Prolog), which will operate a warehouse and mail-order service, and Dillons Bookstores, part of the Pentos group. Mr Terry Collins, group chief executive of Blackwell, the Oxford bookseller, has written to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, asking him to 'call in' the HSE decision for review. At the moment HSE publications are available through Her Majesty's Stationery Office, its 48 agents, and more than 3,000 bookshops throughout the country. From next month, critics say, essential publications such as Health and Safety at Work regulations will be available in range and quantity only at 22 Dillons stores while a further 80 Dillons and 100 Ryman stores, also part of Pentos, will act as order points. In 15 main towns and cities such as Edinburgh, Norwich, Aberystwyth and Stoke-on-Trent there will be no retail outlet where HSE publications can be viewed and purchased. Mr Collins told the employment secretary: 'To restrict availability at the retail level to any government or government agency publications to a single source runs contrary to the principles of open government.' Mr Peter Rimmer, director of information of the HSE, has said the aim of the new contract is to reduce distribution costs and to improve the marketing and targeting of HSE publications. HMSO put in a bid for the contract but was unsuccessful. Any bookshop can buy the HSE publications at full price but only Prolog and Dillons can buy at a discount.</p>

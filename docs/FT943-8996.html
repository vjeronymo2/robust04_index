			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: And the miller told his tale . . . - Clive Fewins hears Nigel Moon whistle for the wind Oh damn] It's stopped] This plaintive cry is a normal part of daily proceedings as Nigel Moon looks up at the stationary sails on his 60ft windmill and whistles for the wind. Downfield Mill, a brick-built, two-sailed, late-Victorian windmill in the Cambridgeshire fen country at Soham, near Ely, has belonged to Moon for 20 years. A graduate in history and archaeology, he always wanted to buy a windmill. So, when the chance came to buy Downfield for Pounds 5,000 at the age of 22, he left his job with the Leicestershire museum service and took a variety of part-time jobs for the five years needed to restore the building to working condition. Moon has been a full-time miller since 1980, when the project was completed (apart from an enforced break in 1986 when he spent a year re-building the 36ft sails). The time has gone quickly. On milling days, a flour-covered Moon can be seen dashing frantically around the five floors, tools usually in hand as he strives to keep all systems going. On the days he is not milling, he is on the road delivering his organic brown and white flour, milled oats, rye, maize and barley to whole-food warehouses, bakers, and hotels all over the Midlands. 'Sadly, I spend far too much time on the road. Travel is my Achilles heel as I live in Leicester, 79 miles away from the mill. 'The reason I have not moved is mainly economic. Although I have tried, I have been unable to develop new markets round the fens. All my selling is in my native Midlands. To move to Soham would mean more, not less, time on the road.' Although it is an exhausting, seven-day-a-week occupation, Moon says he would not do anything else. He last took a holiday 20 years ago. 'I certainly don't do this job for the money,' he said. 'Last year I turned over Pounds 34,000, and after deducting all my overheads managed to pay myself about Pounds 100 a week. Fortunately I am single. It would be impossible to support a family on what I earn, and luckily I have the help of my mother, who is 75 but still drives over to the mill with me and does all sorts of jobs, including cutting the grass.' If he was able to cope with one more large contract Moon reckons he could raise turnover to Pounds 40,000. He had the chance to do this recently, but had to turn it down. 'Physically I just couldn't manage all the extra work,' he said. Moon has reluctantly concluded that the only way to expand his business  - and to cope more easily with the physical challenge of handling 10 tons of machinery as a one-man operation - is to sell Downfield and buy a more efficient mill. 'Even when there is no wind and the sails are down it is hard work because I have a set of stones powered by a belt drive from an electric motor I installed in an adjoining building,' Moon said. 'Working the mill this way is not as satisfying as when it is running on the sails, but the two systems often run in concert and the electric system helps to keep production going. 'I need to mill between 1 1/2 and two tonnes a week to fulfil my obligations to my customers. It can be very hard if there is no wind. I often used to get up at unbelievable hours and dash over to Soham if there was a good wind blowing. But then I realised that this area has its own peculiar weather system, so I just come when it suits me. 'Most weeks I can rely on sufficient wind to get by - but it is not always on the days when I want to be here milling] 'Downfield is a lovely old smock mill, but when it was rebuilt in 1890 by a local family they didn't use the latest internal design,' he said. 'Ideally you want a storage floor at the top with the millstones on the floor below that, not on the first floor, as at Downfield. The real object should be to achieve an on-line flow system using gravity all the time. At Soham a lot of the processes move in reverse. It keeps me fit, but I have to do a lot of charging around.' Moon has his eye on another, technologically more sophisticated windmill nearer his home. 'If I were to sell Downfield I reckon I would get more for the land around it than for the mill itself,' Moon said. 'Two years after I bought the mill for Pounds 5,000, provided by my late father, I was able to buy the quarter-acre plot that goes with it. There is certainly room for a house here. All I need to do now is to find someone mad enough to buy the mill] 'If I am able to buy the other windmill I have in mind, I reckon I could get it going with a minimum of restoration. And because it is better laid out than Downfield I am sure it would be more profitable. The books would certainly benefit from my not having to spend so much time on the road and I would be able to reduce my overdraft. I reckon transport costs me Pounds 100 a week, so I would be able to make big savings. 'Nevertheless, I am not really in this business for the money. There must be thousands of easier ways of making a living]' Downfield Windmill, Fordham Road, Soham, Ely, Cambridgeshire CB7 5BG. 0353-720333.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: Masters turn to bronze - William Packer welcomes the new foundry at Wimbledon Art School At a time of year when the students seem to take over with degree shows, it is some considerable relief to find the masters' work exhibited. But Bronze Works, at the Burlington New Gallery, is something else again. Wimbledon School of Art is one of the few free-standing art schools left in the country independent of any parent polytechnic or soi-disant university - although its degrees must be validated by the Surrey University. Still, it prides itself on being virtually unique as a degree-awarding institution in retaining the designation 'school'; long may it continue. Do we find some symptom of that independence of spirit in this present project? Every art school, college or department of fine art must have its sculpture school, which, one would have thought, would enjoy the facility of a foundry. But it is not always so. I remember a foundry of sorts in my time at Wimbledon over 30 years ago, but it was a small affair more for demonstration than regular use. Several factors have tended to conspire against the foundry, on grounds of both practice and principle. Casting is expensive, in bronze especially so, and any association with the old tradition of modelling from life would have made its case less urgent, not more. But Wimbledon stands unregenerate - it has even reintroduced the life-class as standard and is toying with the idea of making its use an absolute requirement once more. So with the foundry. A proper working foundry has been installed, which will be available not only to the students but, for a fee, to working artists from outside the school. In times when commercial foundries have been badly hit financially and even forced to close, this is an important initiative. To celebrate its inception, the staff of the fine art department and artists associated with the school have been invited to try their hand. Hence the show. Some 20 artists have taken up the challenge, and all but two have employed the lost-wax process of casting, which is about as traditional as you can get. The technique was perfected by the Greeks in the days of their glory, and was revived in the Renaissance with equal sophistication. The artists here stick to the ideas and preoccupations that inform their main work. To return to the figure or an academic image for the sake of the old process would have been arch and inappropriate. But the painters especially seem to have been stimulated by the opportunity and the fresh cast of mind that an unfamiliar medium requires. Michael Ginsborg, for example, with his 'Convolute', takes the sprung, linear tension of his abstract imagery - so elegant, lyrical and refined in his paintings - and transforms it into something no less elegant, but so much more active, physical and robust in its three-dimensional presence. For John Mitchell, the shift has not been so great, for his paintings have long been set on the volumes and perspectives of the basic geometric figures  -the cone, the cube, the pyramid and the rest - but here again the physical weight of these elements, set now in the real, utterly transforms the imaginative experience. Other painters, by contrast, have been somewhat reluctant to leave the safety of the wall in their venture into three-dimensions, but the relief, with its pictorial properties and its sculptural presence, is an authentic and fascinating form that plays both ends, as it were, against the middle. Prunella Clough plays for real, for once, the formal games she has long played so beautifully in her paintings, setting up a plane or field against which more active elements or figures then come and go, elements that might as well be abstract or descriptive - here, as it happens, a cloth that is both at once. And Colin Painter, more obviously theatrical, shows a relief that must have been a tour-de-force of casting, with its lace curtains drawn aside to show shallow protruding planes. There is, of course, much else besides. Bronze Works: The Burlington New Gallery, 4 New Burlington St London W1 until July 9</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Death toll rises in Lebanon fighting THE TOLL from eight days of fighting between Israel and the pro-Iranian Shia Moslem Hizbollah in Lebanon rose yesterday to 20 killed - half of them civilians - and 55 wounded, provoking the US State Department into issuing its customary appeal for restraint. The risks for all sides are considerable if the conflict is allowed to escalate. Casualties incurred by Israel if it launched a ground offensive could not easily be borne by a government fighting an election campaign. Hizbollah would risk losing Syrian support and the already strained tolerance of the Lebanese if it incited more massive Israeli reprisals by breaking its February pledge not to fire Katyusha rockets into Israel. And despite a statement by Mr Farouk Al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, that Syria was 'ready to confront Israel if it imposes war', Syrian soldiers were reportedly ordered not to fire their surface-to-air missiles this week at the first Israeli jets to fly over their positions in Baalbek in two years. Meanwhile, the government in Beirut appears to have little say in what is happening in the south of its country. While the cabinet debates the issue, thousands more refugees have taken to the road and the country's currency and economy have been further undermined by the instability in the south. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, this week exhorted the Lebanese 'to resist the savage Zionist aggression'. Tehran has invested 10 years of effort, many millions of dollars and its revolutionary credentials in the Hizbollah. To abandon them now would be humiliating for the Islamic Republic. Syria might be prepared to limit the activities of Hizbollah if a deal could be struck with Israel for the return of the Golan Heights, but Arab diplomats say Damascus is disillusioned by Israel's refusal to trade land for peace and is not about to make conciliatory gestures while the peace talks are in the doldrums. Hizbollah members privately acknowledge they would be satisfied with an end to the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. Although Katyusha rockets were fired into northern Israel in the aftermath of the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Abbas Musawi in February, Hizbollah has otherwise limited its operations to Israeli and Israeli surrogate targets inside the borders of Lebanon. The US and Israel say that the disarming of Hizbollah must precede any consideration of an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, despite a 14-year-old United Nations Security Council resolution requiring the 'immediate and unconditional withdrawal' of all Israeli forces from Lebanon.</p>

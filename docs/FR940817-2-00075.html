			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, Mn affects multiple organ systems, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the respiratory and reproductive systems as well as the CNS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because the only available evidence suggests that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNS is the most sensitive target for Mn toxicity, neurobehavioral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endpoints were the focus of the RfC derivation. Although other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of effects remain a concern, it is presumed, based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited data now available, that protecting against neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides protection against these other, apparently less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitive endpoints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In revising the RfC for Mn, a draft version was subjected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peer review by external experts (from academic and non-EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governmental institutions) as well as internal experts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following this peer review, a further-revised version was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to and verified by an EPA-wide RfD/RfC work group in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1993. The current RfC for Mn was made available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through IRIS in early November 1993 through two mechanisms. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special notice beginning November 1 in the news section of EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal IRIS2 database announced the availability of a hard copy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the text to EPA requesters who contacted the Risk Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hotline; also, the text was obtainable through the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Library of Medicine's publicly accessible on-line computer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database, TOXNET, beginning November 10, 1993. It also became  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available on line via the EPA IRIS database beginning December 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993. <FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The complete text of the revised RfC as it exists on IRIS2 may be found in Appendix C in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Alternative Approaches to Deriving RfCs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the revised RfC for Mn became available to the public,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl Corporation and other interested parties submitted comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the RfC and issues related to it. One of the primary comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned the availability of various statistical techniques for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deriving a NOAEL from the study by Roels et al. (1992) and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from supplementary data for that study provided to ORD by Roels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1993). In response to Ethyl Corporation's request that EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider alternative approaches to analyzing these data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deriving an RfC for Mn, further analyses of the subject data were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertaken using a variety of statistical methods. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches may be identified as (1) conventional NOAEL- or LOAEL-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based analyses, (2) ``no statistical significance of trend''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NOSTASOT) analyses of the type described by Tukey et al. (1985),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) benchmark dose analyses of the type described by Crump  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1984), and (4) Bayesian analyses of the type described by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jarabek and Hasselblad (1991). These analyses and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results <FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>  yield several possible RfC estimates, so designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the current and only verified RfC for Mn is that which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been verified by the EPA-wide RfD/RfC work group and entered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on IRIS. It must be emphasized that the RfC estimates developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the purpose of this risk assessment do not represent a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision of the current verified RfC for Mn. Reexamination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current Mn RfC, and any decision to revise or reaffirm the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current RfC, will be under the purview of the EPA-wide RfD/RfC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work group at some future date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See ``Reevaluation of Inhalation Health Risks Associated with Methycycloentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (NMT) in Gasoline'', Appendix A, Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;46. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A fundamental issue pertaining to all of the approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented here is the selection of a measure of exposure. Roels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> et al. (1992) described two measures of respirable dust, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational lifetime respirable dust concentration (LIRD),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed as &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  x years, and the current concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respirable dust (CRD), expressed as &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The CRD concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was measured at the time the study was conducted by Roels et al.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and refers to a representative concentration measured for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of job performed by a worker (e.g., electrician, maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worker). The LIRD value for each worker was a cumulative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure measure derived by adding the CRD values over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worker's entire period of employment. If a worker changed jobs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the plant during his period of employment, the CRD for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each job held was multiplied by the number of years the worker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed that job. Thus, if more than one job classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was worked, the worker's LIRD was the sum of the products of CRD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplied by years of performance of the respective jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if a worker held only one job classification, his LIRD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was simply equal to his CRD multiplied by the number of years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employed. Another measure of exposure may be derived from LIRD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by dividing an individual worker's LIRD value by his total number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of years of employment. The latter measure, designated as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average concentration of respirable dust (ACRD), reflects a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worker's time-weighted cumulative exposure level but removes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years from the unit of measurement of LIRD and is expressed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Although Roels et al. (1992) did not refer to ACRD, this value could be calculated for each individual and for the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cohort by using the unpublished data provided to ORD by Roels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1993). For reasons to be discussed later, ACRD offers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantages for certain analyses and, unless otherwise noted, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exposure measure used in the alternative RfC estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conventional NOAEL- or LOAEL-Based Approach <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The conventional method, and only method used thus far by EPA, to derive an RfC has been to identify a NOAEL or LOAEL from a study and divide that concentration by uncertainty factors, as described above for the Mn RfC. In the case of the study by Roels et al. (1992), the geometric mean LIRD concentration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mn-exposed workers was used as a LOAEL. Roels et al. (1992) also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed an exposure-response analysis of their data by grouping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exposed workers into three exposure categories and comparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prevalence of abnormal neurobehavioral scores for each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three groups to those of controls. As indicated in the summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sheet for the Mn RfC (see Appendix C), the results of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure-response analysis were not used in deriving the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mn RfC because the reported analysis did not correct for multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparisons. However, ORD's analyses of additional data provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by Roels (1993) suggest a possible RfC estimate of 0.03 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (versus the current RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), if a one-tailed test of statistical significance is accepted (see Appendix A,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Reevaluation of Inhalation Health Risks Associated with Methyl-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MMT) in Gasoline'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced in the reference section below, hereafter referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as Appendix A.). Because it was based on an exposure-response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, this RfC estimate is labeled as such in Figure 1, which could not be reproduced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is available by calling the person listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section of this notice. It is also available in docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, item number II&hyph;A&hyph;17, page 12 (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESS  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section of this notice for docket location).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. NOSTASOT Approach <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Another approach to analyzing dose-response data makes use of a procedure known as NOSTASOT, described by Tukey et al.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1985). In essence, the procedure applies a trend test sequentially to determine the highest noneffective dose of a series of doses by eliminating one dose at a time. In this manner, the dose level at which the response is not significantly different from controls is determined to be the NOSTASOT dose, which could therefore be considered a NOAEL. Applied to Roels'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1993) epidemiologic data by beginning with the highest individual ACRD exposure and moving downward (i.e., a ``top-down'' approach), the procedure yielded a NOSTASOT of 285 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for eye-hand coordination (see Table A&hyph;4, Appendix A). This approach implies that once nonsignificance is reached, further application of trend tests to lower dose groups would also yield  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonsignificance. However, this was not the case with Roels' (1993) epidemiologic data, and thus it was important to determine not simply the highest NOAEL but the highest NOAEL below the lowest LOAEL. By this ``bottom-up'' approach, the highest nonsignificant exposure below the lowest statistically significant exposure was 21 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , for visual reaction time. Using the latter value as a NOAEL and a total uncertainty factor of 100 (the same as that used for the current Mn RfC, except omitting a factor of 10 for extrapolating from a LOAEL to a NOAEL), one would obtain a value of 0.07 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for an RfC estimate (Figure 1). Disparities in the NOSTASOTs obtained for various endpoints by the top-down and bottom-up approaches raise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questions about the suitability of this technique for deriving a NOAEL from the data of Roels (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont has urged President  Alberto Fujimori to repeal controversial Legislative Decree No.  776 so that the municipality can complete all projects awarded  in bids before 1995. Otherwise, he said, the president must  assume this responsibility.    [Begin recording] [Belmont] I am calling on the government  to  carry out these projects. I also want to challenge the  government: If Legislative Decree No. 776 is repealed, I will  complete and dedicate all promised projects before 1995 is over.  If the municipality does not carry out these projects, then the  government must do it, because these funds belong to Lima  citizens. The people of Lima have made great efforts to pay  their taxes to complete these works, which will help Lima become  the great city we all dream of and want to see.    [Unidentified reporter] Is there a possibility of charging  the government if it does not carry out the projects already  under way?    [Belmont] If the government refuses to carry out the  projects  already awarded and behaves like a dog in a manger, which does  not eat nor lets anyone else eat -- not the mayor, because in  this case he is not pocketing the funds -- Lima will lose,  because the government does not want Lima to be successful. [end  recording]</p>

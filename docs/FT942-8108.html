			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Books: Closet narcissist - Fiction PROFANE FRIENDSHIP by Harold Brodkey Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 387 pages The significance of Narcissus is not that he fell in love with his reflection, but that he failed to recognise his own image. A comparable failure of perception darkens the life of Harold Brodkey's anti-hero, Niles O'Hara, a closet narcissist, a beautiful little boy in Venice of the fascist 1930s who grows into a ruminative old one, yet fails to understand the drama of his own life. You could interpret the novel as the apotheosis of homoeroticism, detailing an affair that never really was, viewed through the prism of memory in the seductive glow of Venice. But to do that is to avoid considering why Profane Friendship so infuriates and dissatisfies. Brodkey's own, much publicised life provides a distracting point of comparison which cannot quite be discounted. He first became famous for being on the persistent verge of producing the new great American novel, and after almost 30 years The Runaway Soul (1990) almost qualified. But in recent months he has acquired a far more difficult sort of fame - for his intimate, ultimate unveiling in The New Yorker, the stark reporting of how it feels to find yourself dying of Aids. Brodkey explained that he believed he had contracted the HlV virus through a homosexual route down which he had briefly gone after his first marriage and before the second: his implicit defining of himself as an occasional bisexual, pre-eminently at home with heterosexuality, has no direct bearing upon his portrait of Niles, a writer who lines up firmly in heterosexual ranks. Yet Profane Friendship, for all the hero's self-confessed concern with girls, never moves far beyond homoerotic perimeters. From the vantage point of self-scrutinising old age, back on a Venetian visit, O'Hara recalls childhood years in 1930s Venice, with his family, and when a pretty Italian boy crossed his path, never quite to leave it. Their juvenile preoccupation with each other reaches the level of the ambiguous crush when the adolescent Niles returns to Venice after the war. Although a little light self abuse of the mutual sort is as far as the two youths go, and Niles succumbs with the studied reluctance of a hip, young chap who wants to do his friend a good gay turn, you are incited to wonder what sort of deep deception is going on. In old age, with a deal of heterosexuality behind of them, Onni is still captivating and bemusing his friend whose guise remains that of the gruffly indifferent. Yet he succumbs, as all true narcissists do, to the embrace of constant attention. The sense of enclosure and obsession is overwhelming. Brodkey's diction, flashy, complex and opaque sentences swollen with the weight of imprecise adjectives, seems to strive for illumination and perception, while achieving no more than a chronic evasiveness. For in the obsessed brooding over Onni, Niles O'Hara manifests a profound longing, always frustrated, whose implications drift away into the might-have been. It is a novel which never faces its own complex yearnings. The use of the word 'profane' in the title suggests that the relationship is characterised by a polluted unclean quality. And by so entitling it Brodkey implies that the two men's life of role and game playing with each other is to be censured. A strange case of homophobia.</p>

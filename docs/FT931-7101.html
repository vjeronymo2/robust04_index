			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Smokers may face higher taxes PRESIDENT Bill Clinton warned yesterday that smokers may face higher tobacco taxes to help pay the cost of giving everyone access to healthcare. 'I think we are spending a ton of money in private insurance and government tax payments to deal with the healthcare problems occasioned by health habits, particularly smoking,' Mr Clinton said yesterday. 'You do have to find some way to recover some revenues to cover people who now don't have coverage.' Higher tobacco taxes are reported to figure on a list of potential ways of raising money to pay for overhauling the healthcare system, which Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, who heads the White House task force, is now working on, along with other 'sin taxes' such as alcohol and gun levies. The Los Angeles Times said yesterday that Mrs Clinton had ruled out the option of taxing employees on company health insurance benefits, viewing this as too damaging to her husband's chances of re-election in 1996. Mr Clinton said he had not ruled anything out, and White House officials said revenue options remained under consideration. Healthcare reform is likely to save money over the long term; it is seen as essential if the federal budget deficit is to be reduced, because programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid are the fastest-growing items of government spending. Extending coverage to the 35m people who do not have company health insurance, but are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, is expected to cost anywhere from Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8.40bn) to Dollars 44bn a year. Costs of subsidising long-term nursing home care could drive the bill higher. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that treating employer-paid health insurance as a taxable benefit where it exceeds a reasonable average could bring in Dollars 113bn over five years, and would introduce stronger incentives to curb medical inflation.</p>

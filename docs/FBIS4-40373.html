It is to be laid down that representatives of the state  in management organs of joint-stock companies (associations or  other mixed-ownership forms of enterprise), whose holding  (stock, share) is federally owned (hereinafter, companies), will  perform their activities in the management organs of the  aforesaid companies in accordance with the present edict and  decisions of the Russian Federation Government and also of  federal organs of executive authority or the Russian Federal  Property Fund, on whose behalf they are acting in accordance  with Russian Federation legislation.    4. The following can be appointed to represent the state in  companies' management organs:    --state employees -- on the basis of decisions by the  Russian  Federation president, Russian Federation Government, the  relevant federal organs of executive authority, or the Russian  Federal Property Fund;    --other citizens of the Russian Federation (except those  elected to representative organs of state authority or local  self-government) -- on the basis of contracts to represent the  interests of the state concluded in accordance with civil  legislation.    Contracts with Russian Federation citizens to represent  state  interests will be concluded by the Russian Federation State  Committee for the Management of State Property, the Russian  Federal Property Fund, or their territorial organs and must  incorporate:    --the term of the contract and the procedure for its early  cancelation;    --the amount of recompense to be received by the  representative of the state;    --the terms of material liability for breaching the terms of  the contract to represent state interests.    Contracts to represent state interests in management organs  of joint-stock companies (associations and other mixed-ownership  forms of enterprise, whose holding (stock, share) is federally  owned, are to be registered at justice organs.    5. State representatives in companies' management organs are  obliged to agree in writing with federal organs of executive  authority or the Russian Federal Property Fund on whose behalf  they are acting:    --draft decisions of companies' management organs, which  they  will be submitting and supporting;    --their future vote on draft decisions proposed by other  members of companies' management organs.    6. Draft decisions and voting on draft decisions on the  following questions will be agreed in accordance with the  present edict (if they fall within the terms of reference of the  corresponding companies' management organs):    --amendments and additions to the statutes of joint-stock  companies (associations and other mixed-ownership forms of  enterprise);    --changes in the amount of compoany capital;    --the appointment (election) of specific individuals to  management organs and supervisory organs of the corresponding  companies;    --acquisition of credits that are more than 10 percent  greater than the corresponding companies' net assets;    --the sale and other transfer of real estate and also  mortgaging of real estate;    --companies' involvment in the creation of other enterprises  (including setting up daughter enterprises) amd industrial  finance groups.

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV ASKS ARABS TO MEET TO SOLVE CRISIS  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, rejecting a military solution in the  Persian Gulf as "unacceptable," Monday called for a meeting of Arab countries,  with Saudi Arabia in a leading role, as a means of seeking a political  settlement to the crisis.  </P> <P> "Now, more than ever, there are arguments in favor of using the Arab factor,"  Gorbachev declared at a news conference after two days of talks with French  President Francois Mitterrand.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said Soviet special envoy Yevgeny Primakov, who met with Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein over the weekend in Baghdad, reported signs of  continued softening in positions taken by Hussein.  </P> <P> "The position of Saddam Hussein is not the same that he held some time ago  (after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait). Some reflection has taken place,"  Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> In an interview with Cable News Network broadcast Monday, Hussein himself  described the sessions with Primakov as "wide-ranging, deep and very useful."  Primakov flew to Saudi Arabia on Monday for talks with King Fahd.  </P> <P> Although stressing Soviet solidarity with United Nations sanctions against  Iraq, Gorbachev urged caution in dealing with what he described as an  essentially Arab problem that should be solved by Arabs.  </P> <P> "There needs to be some Arab mechanism," he said. "All this is taking place on  Arab soil, and we need to look at the national interests of the people. This is  the quickest way to seek a settlement for Iraqi leadership as well."  </P> <P> At the same time, Gorbachev added, members of the U.N. Security Council must  stick together in the strict enforcement of U.N. sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> "We cannot allow and should never give grounds to Iraq and the regime of Saddam  Hussein to believe or have any hope of disharmony or weakening of the  resolutions," he said.  </P> <P> By stressing Arab-led negotiations with the Iraqi government, Gorbachev  appeared to be opening the door to a possible compromise with Hussein that  would allow the Iraqi president to withdraw from Kuwait without losing face  among fellow Arabs.  </P> <P> For 20 years, the Soviet Union and France have been Iraq's strongest allies  outside the Arab bloc. However, Mitterrand did not join with Gorbachev in the  appeal for a joint Arab conference on the Iraq issue, saying only that he has  long favored an international conference to deal with the Arab-Israeli  question.  </P> <P> Mitterrand, who was quoted in the French press recently as saying that war was  imminent in the gulf, took a more pessimistic stance than that of his Soviet  counterpart.  </P> <P> "The basic facts haven't changed since the Aug. 2 invasion," the French  president said Monday. "I can see how various developments could link together  to lead to an armed conflict." Almost from the beginning of the gulf crisis,  Mitterrand has talked about what he terms the "logic of war."  </P> <P> A few hours after Gorbachev and Mitterrand broke up their meeting at the  14th-Century Rambouillet Chateau outside Paris, 257 French hostages boarded an  Iraqi Airlines charter flight in Baghdad to return to France.  </P> <P> The plane landed in Paris late Monday to cheers from throngs of family members  and journalists. Among those returning were seven French diplomats who had  endured an arduous siege of their embassy in Kuwait city.  </P> <P> In a move aimed at separating France from the rest of the international  community opposed to the invasion of Kuwait, Hussein ordered the release of all  French hostages, including those held as human shields at strategic sites.  </P> <P> "I am delighted to have the French hostages come back," Mitterrand said during  his joint news conference with Gorbachev.  </P></p>

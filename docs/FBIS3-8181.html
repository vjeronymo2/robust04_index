			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ryszard Bugaj, Sejm deputy and Union of </F> Labor chairman, by correspondent Bohdan Onichimowski; place and  date not given]    [Text] [Onichimowski] Acting on a recommendation  submitted by the Union of Labor, the Sejm recently rejected the  president's projects of new constitutional act. Does that mean  that you have provoked a new "war at the top"?    [Bugaj] It is true that the Sejm acted on our  recommendation, although I had mixed feelings about it because,  in my opinion, the main difficulty was that the president's  initiative could have delayed the progress of the ongoing work  on the new Constitution. I believe that we must have a new  Constitution in good time before the presidential election, but  the president appears to think otherwise. On the other hand, as  regards the "war at the top" question, I think that such a war  could indeed be waged, but not necessarily for the  above-mentioned reason. If the president were to stand at the  head of the dissatisfied masses, could lead a war against the  parliamentary majority, but that war would not necessarily be  directed against us because we too dislike the policies of the  present government.    [Onichimowski] It is said that four fundamental areas in the  life of a state are crucial for its existence and survival. Let  us try to evaluate the current state of affairs in each of these  areas. The first of them is external security.    [Bugaj] The situation here is not felicitous. In the past  year, we have noted unmistakable attempts to rebuild elements of  Russia's imperial policies and a far-reaching skepticism on the  part of our Western partners as regards the chances of their  involvement in any operations designed to protect our security.  I do not want to say that they are doing nothing at all in that  direction, but they are certainly most restrained, if not  reticent. Of course, there is no immediate reason to sound the  alarm: The situation is far from wonderful, but it is not  overly dramatic, either. Everything is still in our hands: We  can and should decide ourselves whether our state is to be  internally strong and cohesive, whether our citizens can be  satisfied with their government and their parliament, and  whether our economy is capable of producing surplus resources  with which to finance adequate national defense so that we can  rest safely in the knowledge that the situation in that area is  not deteriorating.    [Onichimowski] The second sphere of concern is our internal  security.    [Bugaj] Here a very considerable deterioration took place  over the past years. Some people believe that this should be  counteracted primarily by building up the numeric strength of  our police force. Unfortunately, this will require substantial  funds, but we should shape our policies so as to restrict and  eradicate the root causes of social pathology. After all, we do  not have enough resources to provide three policemen to patrol  every street corner and enough police presence to watch every  house in every area. The causes of the mounting incidence of  crime are to be found in the widening gap between different  groups' financial circumstances, and also in the growing  unemployment.... It is no accident that people can walk  everywhere in perfect safety in the streets of Scandinavian  cities.    [Onichimowski] The rising incidence of tuberculosis in our  society is not a favorable reflection on our successive  governments' record in the area of health protection, is it?    [Bugaj] In this respect, we are, in my opinion, on the eve  of the introduction of a substantial and much-needed reform,  which, however, is still waiting to be put into practice.    [Onichimowski] Instead, there has been much discussion about  it for many years now....    [Bugaj] I agree with you: Much is said, and nothing  happens. All that is happening at present is that the health  service's budget is being reduced, money is being taken away  from vital health services, and there are no visible signs of  progress in organizational actions or the construction of a  rational financial system for the sector. I find the present  situation deplorable. It is most probably being continuously  compounded by the repeated changes of health ministers and by  the fact that we still have no public-service system, which  would go on working and discharging its duties regardless of the  constantly changing political configurations.    [Onichimowski] And, finally, the fourth sector. It is  paradoxical that the standards of education, the unrestricted  availability of cultural goods, and the general level of  civilizational development attained under the Polish People's  Republic was instrumental in overthrowing that regime, whereas  our new sociopolitical system has brought a pronounced  regression in all of these areas.    [Bujak] If we are to discuss the realm of culture, we must  admit that in certain areas state patronage was far from  rational: It was geared a little too obviously to the promotion  of specific ideological messages. Unfortunately, the state's  withdrawal from its patronage role has been too drastic. On the  other hand, education definitely needs funds urgently, and that  money must be found somewhere. I believe that, regardless of  the reasons for the present state of affairs, we have already  moved past the worst depression in this area, and there is some  hope that the situation will gradually improve.    [Onichimowski] To conclude, let us touch on a subject close  to your own heart: privatization. What do you think of the  proposal to recall Deputy Bogdan Pek from his post of chairman  of the Sejm Commission for Ownership Transformations?    [Bugaj] I am emphatically against this idea. Even if Deputy  Pek has at times been clumsily "undiplomatic" in his attempts to  investigate the truth and counteract the pathological phenomena  that abound in the field of privatization, he has nevertheless  demonstrated real integrity and determination in uncovering such  instances and battling against them. If he were to be recalled,  it would be a symbolic act pointing clearly to the Sejm  majority's intention to cover up for and protect those guilty of  suspect practices. From what I know of the privatization  process, there is much questionable activity associated with it,  so we should stop viewing it entirely theoretically and instead  begin taking pragmatic action. We certainly need to increase  parliamentary control over these processes.    [Onichimowski] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

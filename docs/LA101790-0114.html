			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GROSS LEADS THE SANTA MONICA SEASON OPENER  </P> <P> Look into the nooks and crannies of this city's musical landscape and you'll  find community orchestras, some of them quite good. Sunday night at Santa  Monica Civic Auditorium one such ensemble, the Santa Monica Symphony, opened  its 1990-91 season under the baton of Allen Robert Gross.  </P> <P> Gross, who leads the Occidental-Caltech Symphony, is one of two conductors left  over from last year's auditions for music director.  </P> <P> Presumably his two concerts this season serve as a second-round tryout for the  still-vacant position. He proved a genial and attentive podium presence,  instilling confidence and energy in his players with smiles and clear-cut  gestures.  </P> <P> Although there were some rough edges apparent in the playing, they remained  just that, edges to otherwise solid performances. The lack of technical polish  -- this group consists of a mixture of amateurs and professionals -- never got  in the way of the essence of the music.  </P> <P> Beethoven's Second Symphony opened the concert, in a vigorous and dashing  interpretation. Gross opted for steady, fastish tempos and light accents,  lending understated nuance to phrasing with elegant left-hand motions. He  coaxed an admirable forcefulness from his string section, and enthusiasm  infused the entire reading.  </P> <P> In Stravinsky's "Firebird" Suite, which concluded the concert, the orchestra  impressively captured its kaleidoscopic color. Coupled with Gross's lucid  interpretation -- its poised balances, solid rhythms and contrasted dynamics --  the music spoke with a directness that didn't slight its poetry.  </P> <P> In between came Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme with Philharmonic  principal cellist Ronald Leonard as soloist. He brought his usual technical  ease to the task, his singing tone capturing in full measure the playfulness  and pointed lyricism of this score. The orchestra accompanied handily, with  particularly sensitive work from the woodwind section. T.M.  </P></p>

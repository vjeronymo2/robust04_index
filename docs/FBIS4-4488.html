			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Fellow countrymen who  had defected to the northern half of Korea from South Korea gave  their impressions.    Pak Hung-tal who came over to the North last year said the  people in the North now enjoy a happy life as the dear leader  Kim Chong-il has brought the peculiar Korean-style socialist  system into bloom and shapes good politics centred on the masses.    He said:    "By availing themselves of the setback of socialism in some  countries, the imperialists and the South Korean puppets are  resorting to every conceivable plot against the North, crying  about the 'nuclear suspicion' and 'international cooperation  system' in a bid to isolate and stifle the North. This is a  daydream of fools.    "No force on earth can match the invincible might of the  singlehearted unity of the North which is making headway under  the banner of socialism, firmly rallied behind dear General Kim  Chong- il."    Noting that dear General Kim Chong-il is the destiny and  future of the Korean nation, a defector So Tok-su said:    "Socialism of the North where the entire people are  vigorously pushing forward the socialist construction, closely  rallied behind the dear leader, is invincible, and it is  exerting a great influence upon the world people.    "Our dear leader Kim Chong-il who is steadily glorifying the  people-centred socialism built in the North and wisely leading  the struggle for the victory of socialism worldwide, is the  great of great produced by heaven."    Cho Won-taek who came over to the North with his whole  family  had this to say:    "The dear leader, last year, resolutely smashed challenges  of  the enemy with his iron will and matchless grit, saving the  nation's destiny and powerfully demonstrating the might of our  republic to the whole world.    "People in the South ardently long for the socialist system  in the North where the nation's dignity and soul are exalted,  and heartily wish to live under the system.    "National reunification must be realized according to the  10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation at an  early date so that the people in the South, too, may live in  happiness under the loving care of the dear leader."</p>

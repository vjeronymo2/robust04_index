			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Sinn Fein plans diplomatic effort SINN FEIN, the political wing of the IRA, is planning a diplomatic campaign to seek potential allies in the European Parliament and the United Nations. A strategy document, Towards a Lasting Peace in Ireland, will be discussed at Sinn Fein's annual congress in Dublin this weekend. The document argues that the political and economic changes in eastern and western Europe 'demand an equivalent breadth of vision and willingness to innovate. The partition of Ireland and the British claim to jurisdiction over the Six Counties (Northern Ireland) is a European issue'. It argues that the UN can help to bring about abolition of emergency laws and special courts in Northern Ireland and the republic and participate in setting up talks. The document says: 'As an interim measure Sinn Fein would propose that the UN secretary-general requests annual reports from the British government on its role in Ireland and conducts a yearly review of the consequences of the continued partition.' It envisages an international conference on the conflict which would 'involve representatives of all political views in Ireland, along with international experts on decolonisation and conflict resolution'. The British and Irish governments have rejected the inclusion of Sinn Fein in political discussions on Northern Ireland, until it formally distances itself from the IRA and renounces the use of force. Neither government would comment yesterday on the proposals but could be expected to block any attempt to involve the EC or the UN, arguing that it was an internal matter. Sinn Fein's weekend congress will discuss a range of social and economic issues, including a women's policy document which includes motions on the right of divorce and abortion in the republic. The congress is not expected to produce serious divisions over moves to distance Sinn Fein more clearly from the IRA. In a recent interview with the Irish Times Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said the IRA 'does come from the same tradition as Sinn Fein. We do share common objectives, but the IRA reaches its decisions independently of Sinn Fein, and Sinn Fein reaches its decisions independently of the IRA'.</p>

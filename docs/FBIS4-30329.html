			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Prime minister Tsutomu Hata  announced Saturday [25 June] he will disband his two-month-old  cabinet to break the current impasse in Japanese politics.    "I will resign with my cabinet en masse today," the prime  minister told a hastily convened news conference at his official  residence.    Hata, 58, said his decision to give up the premiership is  based on his firm belief that a "political vacuum" should be  avoided as Japan faces a host of domestic and international  challenges.    The resignation of the Hata Cabinet was to be approved at an  emergency cabinet meeting which got under way immediately  following the announcement.    The decision to disband the two-month-old minority coalition  government was taken just hours before the House of  Representatives was to convene a plenary session to vote on a  no-confidence motion submitted by the No. 1 opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP).    "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will  entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the  Diet," Hata told the press conference.    "If the lower house is dissolved, there will arise a  political vacuum and it becomes impossible to tide over the  yen's appreciation and other problems," he said. "I want to  avoid a political vacuum by every means."    The decision on resignation en bloc was made at a meeting of  coalition leaders earlier in the day and it was agreed to allow  the two largest parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), both in the opposition camp, to form a new government,  coalition sources said.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said the development was  what his party has demanded, adding it will seek to forge a  third coalition government.    Coalition and SDP leaders failed to bridge their policy gap  in two days of on-and-off realliance talks.    The Hata government was formed in April after its  predecessor, headed by Morihiro Hosokawa, collapsed in a dispute  over the former prime minister's alleged shady financial  dealings.    The SDP, partner in the Hosokawa coalition that ousted the  LDP from power after 38 years of uninterrupted rule, left the  ruling alliance after Hosokawa quit.    The no-confidence motion that was threatening to scuttle the  Hata administration was widely expected to clear the 511-seat  lower house with the backing of the LDP and the Japanese  Communist Party, which jointly command a parliamentary strength  of 221 votes, and some other parties.</p>

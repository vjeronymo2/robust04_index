			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Carlos Tunnermann Bernheim] </F>   [Text] The construction of democracy in Nicaragua is an  imperative for our times. The challenge of creating it on firm  foundations demands that we move forward to build a "culture of  consensus," because a true democracy can only be created through  the civilized instruments of dialogue and political negotiation.    Of course, in our tumultuous history there are unfortunately  very few examples we can cite as valid precedents upholding the  culture of consensus. Instead, the pages of our history are  filled with the opposite phenomenon: the violent resolution of  conflicts, the use of force, and a propensity toward one-man  rule and dictatorships. Still, since it appears that democracy  may finally have found a place in our history, it should be  feasible to construct a democratic program that will enable us  to prepare for the transition to the 21st century, based on a  broad national consensus.    Nicaragua's critical situation and the new conditions of the  world and of Latin America demand of our political leaders a  process of maturation that will lead to a new political style,  capable of setting aside, like museum pieces, the habits and  ideas that no longer make any sense in our new national and  international situation.    This is the challenge that the circumstances and patriotism  impose on us, a challenge to which we must all respond if we do  not want to remain prisoners of a political primitivism that is  capable of placing us outside history and shutting the doors on  any chance of progress.    We face multiple challenges: we need to consolidate the  fragile peace we have achieved; move ahead toward true  democratization; strengthen production systems in order to  expand our exports; combat unemployment; give priority attention  to social policies; and stimulate our incipient scientific and  technical development. Our goal should be a more just and human  society, not only a more prosperous market. The new  international and regional competitiveness will leave us  sidelined on the road to development if we do not clearly  perceive our current challenges and step out boldly to face them.    In the Latin American debate on strengthening democracy, the  need to promote social policies that are fully integrated in  overall economic development strategies is taking on increasing  importance. The new thinking, which overcomes the rigidity of  neoliberal systems, grants a key role to social reform and the  struggle against poverty as a way to strengthen democratic  governability. The state cannot reduce its role to that of a  simple "market watchdog." It must also shoulder its  "compensating" responsibility on behalf of the most vulnerable,  and those who bear the greatest brunt of structural adjustment  plans.    The challenge of building democracy in Nicaragua also  requires the internal renewal and democratization of the FSLN  [Sandinist National Liberation Front], whose importance in our  national political spectrum no one can deny. Until the FSLN is  transformed into a modern, civilian, and participatory party  that once and for all eradicates verticalism and the temptation  of one-man rule, thereby creating an authentic democratic option  for our people, the process of building democracy in Nicaragua  will not have the firmness and amplitude we all want.    The FSLN's renewal needs to be the product of an extensive  debate in which mutual respect for persons and ideas will  prevail. Nothing is more contrary to that purpose than resorting  to insults and calumnies, even using the Sandinist media and  manipulating those who regrettably allow themselves to be used  for such blameworthy procedures.    We hope the debate will proceed in another direction and  take  on the decency that respect for true Sandinist principles  demands.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap has  disclosed that he will go to the Philippines for negotiations  with his Philippine counterpart on the sale of 400,000-500,000  tons of Thai rice to that country. The Philippines is expected  to buy 200,000 tons of 25-percent broken rice and 300,000 tons  of 35-percent broken rice from Thailand. The Philippines will  ask for a four- month credit for the purchase of this rice. If  the negotiations are successful, the private sector will be  allowed to carry out this rice deal, because the government does  not intend to interfere in rice exports.    Chaiyot revealed that even with the delivery of 150,000 tons  of Philippine fertilizer, the Philippines still owes Thailand  some 475 million baht. The National Rice Policy Committee, he  said, is responsible for this debt and will decide whether or  not the Philippines should pay compensation to Thailand in case  debt repayment is delayed.    Asked about the proposal made by Deputy Prime Minister  Amnuai  Wirawan, chairman of the National Rice Policy Committee, for  Thai investors to pay the money they intend to invest in the  Philippines to the committee and withdraw the same amount from  the Philippine Government, Chaiyot said the proposal is  practical and there should not be any problem with it. The  deputy minister noted that the committee will take care of the  debt while the Commerce Ministry pursues its efforts to sell  Thai rice.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANDREW DICE CLAY  </P> <P> Regarding: "To Brooklyn in Search of the Real Andrew Dice Clay" (by Patrick  Goldstein, June 3):  </P> <P> A very pretty portrait for your June 2 cover -- misogynistic bigot with  fiancee. And such a sensitive young thing he turns out to be, only awful,  really, when the eyes of the world are on him, and only then when he needs the  money for his family. Heartwarming.  </P> <P> Now that you are shamelessly in bed with Andrew Silverstein, I await your  apologia for 2 Live Crew, Chuck D and N.W.A. Once you offer the  poor-misunderstood-performer excuse for Silverstein, it seems that you're  equally committed to shifting the focus of your rap lyric coverage from First  Amendment rights to human interest. Or don't you bend over backwards to pander  to hatred unless it's got the full force of a major studio publicity department  behind it?  </P> <P> I've got a suggestion for another cover story -- those shiny metal silhouettes  of nude women that are so popular on the mud flaps of trucks. Better yet, how  about a feature about mud flaps, or, even more to the point, about mud?  </P> <P> SHAWN A. LEVY  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

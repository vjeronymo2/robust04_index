Twenty-two political parties and organisations of Peru  including the Socialist Political Action Party, the Communist  Party and the General Confederation of Workers, released a joint  statement on February 6.    The statement manifested full support and firm solidarity  for  the cause of the Workers' Party of Korea, the DPRK Government  and people for defending their sovereignty and system chosen by  themselves and for peace on the Korean peninsula and peaceful  reunification of the country.    It appealed to all the political parties, governments and  peoples of the world who value peace and justice to support and  encourage the DPRK's just stand for a solution of the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula.    Seven political parties and organisations of Pakistan  including the Socialist Party, the Pakistan Organisation for  Afro-Asian People's Solidarity and the Federation of Trade  Unions issued a joint statement on February 8 urging the United  States to approach the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks with a  sincere attitude and position.    The statement said that if the U.S. Administration really  has  a willingness to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  in a peaceful way, it must honestly implement the DPRK-U.S.  joint statement and not drive the situation to a catastrophe.    Five organisations of Tanzania, including the Youth Union  and  the Scientific and Technical Association in a joint statement on  February 3 said that the United States must renounce the policy  of strength and immediately withdraw its troops and nuclear  weapons from South Korea, mindful that a nuclear war on the  Korean peninsula would bring irreparable grave consequences to  the Korean people and the world people.    A former general of Greece, George Pattas, chairman of the  Western European Committee for Korea's Reunification and Peace,  in a press statement on February 6 said that the U.S. hardline  conservative forces are deliberately straining the situation by  threatening to deploy even Patriot missiles in South Korea in a  bid to overpower North Korea militarily. This will only result  in obstructing an early and peaceful solution of the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks, he  added.</p>

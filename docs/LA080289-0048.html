			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-LAPD OFFICER LOSES BID FOR PAROLE  </P> <P> The State Board of Prison Terms on Tuesday denied convicted murderer Paul  Perveler parole for the third time after a hearing that featured testimony from  Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale).  </P> <P> Prison officials rescheduled Perveler's hearing for August, 1990, and set the  condition that the former LAPD officer undergo a psychiatric evaluation before  then.  </P> <P> Also testifying was Perveler's first wife, Lela Halverson of Glendale, who said  her ex-husband vowed to kill her for testifying against him. Nolan became  involved with the case after being contacted by Halverson and eventually  authored legislation that forced prison officials to consider public outcry in  deciding parole cases.  </P> <P> Perveler, convicted of murdering his second wife and the husband of his  girlfriend in the late 1960s, originally had been sentenced to death.  </P> <P> The sentence was commuted to life when California outlawed the death penalty,  and in 1978 he was given a parole date of 1985, which was eventually denied  after protests from the public.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> N.Y. DAILY NEWS KEEPS PRINTING;  </P> <P> NEWSPAPER: NON-UNION REPLACEMENTS BROUGHT IN FOR 1,800 WORKERS. POLICE ARREST  11 AS PROTESTERS TURN VIOLENT.  </P> <P> Daily News managers published and tried to distribute a newspaper today using  non-union replacement drivers who ran a gantlet of protesters throwing rocks  and bottles.  </P> <P> Police reported at least two minor injuries and at least 11 arrests, including  two men held after a delivery truck was firebombed.  </P> <P> Copies of today's paper, reduced to only one edition, were trucked out of the  printing plants -- about three hours late -- under police escort.  </P> <P> It was not immediately known how many were printed and delivered, but the News  was absent from some mid-town Manhattan and suburban railroad station  newsstands during rush hour. The paper said 920,000 copies were distributed  Thursday morning, down from its normal daily circulation of 1.18 million.  </P> <P> Half a dozen pickets marched outside the News headquarters this morning, and  union leaders stood outside to direct workers to go home.  </P> <P> The strike called Thursday night at the nation's second-largest metropolitan  daily newspaper capped a 10-month dispute over management's efforts to gain  more control over money-losing operations.  </P> <P> Police in riot gear escorted delivery trucks out of a Daily News printing plant  in Kearny, N.J., through hundreds of strikers and their supporters hurling  bricks, stones, eggs and bottles.  </P> <P> One truck was firebombed in neighboring Harrison, N.J., but no injuries were  reported. Two men were arrested shortly afterward in Kearny on charges of  possession of three Molotov cocktails.  </P> <P> Another man was arrested for allegedly throwing rocks at a truck at the Kearny  plant. "He was the only one we could catch," Kearny police Capt. Anthony  Gouveia said. "It was ugly out there."  </P> <P> Strikers broke the windows of a News truck in Brooklyn, and the driver was  taken to a hospital for treatment of facial injuries, a police spokeswoman  said.  </P> <P> She said other strikers pelted a News truck in Manhattan, causing the driver to  lose control and hit two parked cars. A security guard inside the truck  sustained minor injuries in a scuffle with two strikers.  </P> <P> Six people were arrested, mostly on charges of disorderly conduct, outside the  Long Island plant, and two were arrested outside the Brooklyn plant, where a  fireworks-style explosive was ignited beneath a truck.  </P> <P> Eight unions with about 1,800 members went on strike, and the Newspaper Guild  said its 800 members would honor picket lines, including one at the main News  offices in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Management crews produced today's edition. Its lead headline concerned a police  crackdown on drug dealing near city schools, but a smaller headline beneath it  said "Unions Strike News" and had a picture of a News delivery truck burned  after a dispute Thursday that triggered the strike.  </P> <P> Contracts for all 10 of the newspaper's unions ran out in March, and  negotiations have stalemated.  </P> <P> John Sloan, Daily News vice president for labor relations, said replacement  workers from other Tribune Co. papers in Orlando, Fla., and Chicago were being  flown to New York.  </P> <P> New York's other two tabloids planned to increase their press runs today. The  New York Post, which normally prints about 625,000 copies, expected a press run  of 850,000 to 860,000. New York Newsday was expected to increase its press run  from about 250,000 to about 400,000.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Markets: Waiting for the taxman to burst the bubble - Wall Street THE DAY after Congress approved President Clinton's budget and its hefty tax increases for the rich, a big US mutual fund group placed full page advertisements in newspapers offering investors free advice on how to shift their money into tax-exempt funds. In the first two days, hardly anyone took up the offer. The rich, it seems, were either: a) perfectly happy to hand over more of their wealth to the government to help reduce the deficit, b) casually indifferent to the impact of higher taxes, or, c) too shell-shocked by the budget's implications to react. Of the three explanations, c) is probably nearest the truth. Under the Clinton budget, the top marginal tax rate for individuals making more than Dollars 115,000 a year in taxable income, and couples making more than Dollars 140,000, rises from 31 per cent to 36 per cent. This is a big increase in anyone's book, and one that is retroactive (backdated to January 1 this year) to boot. History shows that spending and investment behaviour inevitably changes to fit a new tax environment, and no one expects anything different this time around. That there has been little evidence so far of individuals rushing to shelter their income from higher taxes suggests that the rich (a category which, as defined by the Clinton administration, is broader than one might think) have not yet come to terms with the fact that they are going to be less rich from now on. Stock market investors seem to share this unwillingness to face the reality of the Clinton budget. How else to explain why, week after week, share prices have been following bond prices into record territory, yet one of the main driving forces behind surging bond prices has been the expectation that the President's deficit-reduction budget will hinder, not help, the US economy? In more normal times, the judgment of bond market economists that government policies will retard economic growth, and presumably corporate earnings growth as well, would depress equity market sentiment and show up in lower share prices. Yet, stocks continue on their record-breaking course, apparently untroubled by the bond market's gloomy prognosis of the economic outlook. This week alone the Dow Jones Industrial Average twice set a new record closing high. Stock markets are performing so well because investors are more impressed by record low interest rates - the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell below 6.4 per cent this week for the first time ever - than they are worried about the immediate outlook for the economy. As long as low interest rates keep diverting funds out of low-yielding short-term assets and into stocks, and as long as low interest rates allow companies to raise fresh capital cheaply, investors will keep buying equities. The problem with this situation is that the markets are becoming increasingly reliant upon favourable interest rates and expectations of improving earnings. With share prices so high by historical standards - stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index are trading at 23 times earnings - an upturn in interest rates, or a failure of corporate earnings to meet expectations (or both), could trigger a dramatic sell-off. Admittedly, interest rates are unlikely to rise anytime soon. Only this week, the July producer and consumer prices data showed that inflationary pressures in the economy remain extremely weak. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, may have warned recently that he is ready to tighten monetary policy at the first sign of overheating in the economy, but with inflation so low and output so sluggish, there seems little need for higher rates in the foreseeable future. The markets' hopes for corporate profitability, however, rest on shakier ground. Over the past year the majority of companies have reported stronger earnings more because they have been able to cut costs and boost productivity, and less because they have raised prices of their goods and services or enjoyed sharp growth in sales volume. The improvements in productivity, however, may have peaked. This week the government reported that average non-farm output per hour dropped 2.5 per cent in the second quarter - the second straight three-monthly decline. More worryingly, it was the largest fall in hourly output for more than four years. If productivity is really shrinking, then companies are going to have to look elsewhere for earnings growth. This means they will have to raise prices, or hope consumers start spending heavily again. In the current economic climate, raising prices would not make much sense, because that would only offset any benefits to be had from stronger consumer spending.  --------------------------------- Monday      3576.08  +  15.65 Tuesday     3572.73 -    3.35 Wednesday   3583.35  +  10.62 Thursday    3569.09 -  14.26 Friday      3569.65  +   0.56  ---------------------------------</p>

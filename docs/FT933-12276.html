			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A bit of history fights to survive - Common Markets OVER THE centuries those who work in and around the City of London have had a plethora of good food suppliers on their doorstep. Meat from the butchers at Smithfield, fish from Billingsgate, and a little bit of everything under one beautiful roof at Leadenhall Market. But while property values and changing buying patterns have already forced changes on Smithfield and Billingsgate, further changes in the City of London are making survival precarious for Leadenhall Market traders. A shortage of retail customers and financial pressures on the market's traditional big spenders, the managers of company dining rooms, mean empty and unlet shops in Leadenhall for possibly the first time in the market's history. This is a shame, but there is still a wide variety of quality foods available from the 600-year-old market: fruit and veg from W Baxter, meat from R S Ashby, fish and oysters from Ashdown's, flowers from A Booth: plenty of watering holes - the New Moon, the Lamb Tavern (with a magnificent Victorian tile mural of Sir Christopher Wren planning the Monument) - as well as an Oddbins wine shop and English, French and Spanish restaurants. Poulterers met at Leadenhall as early as 1321 and were joined by the Cheesemongers in 1397. By 1411 it was a flourishing market for fish, meat, cheese and corn and survived the Great Fire of 1666. Its present striking structure was created by Sir Horace Jones in 1881 for a mere Pounds 99,000. A late 19th century drawing in the entrance to Beauchamp's restaurant shows the market busier than any modern superstore - with every man in a top hat or bowler and every woman in a bonnet. Those were the days, cries Edward Blackett of Ashdowns, the third generation manager of the family fish business. With rent and rates now over Pounds 100,000 per annum, profits from fish, that most perishable of comodities, can be elusive. And the last decade has brought fundamental changes to the way the market operates. The first happened gradually. Since the early 1980s corporate entertaining has come under the scrutiny of company finance directors. Out, in cost-cutting exercises, have gone in-house catering staff, and in have come catering companies who buy centrally, often from wholesalers with much cheaper premises. The boom of the 1980s disguised this but the crash of 1987 marked not only Ashdown's best trading year but also the beginning of the market's decline. In 1989 shops started to close and, in 1991, H Blankley, the oldest shop on the market (opened in 1881), closed. The sites are still vacant. The troubles of Leadenhall's closest neighbour, Lloyd's of London, have also made trading more difficult, but it is the very close ties to the City - for centuries Leadenhall's lifeblood - which make it unable to profit from any economic upturn today. Other food and drink retailers report their best day's takings on Saturdays, with increasingly more people shopping on Sundays and bank holidays - just when Leadenhall Market puts up the shutters. It is only open 248 working days a year and bank holidays mean red ink for the market's monthly trading figures. In April and May this year it was only open for 20 and 19 days out of each month. Additionally, there is no point in offering late night shopping - the City worker has gone home. And, while Leadenhall Market should certainly be on any visitor's itinerary, tourists are unlikely buyers of fresh salmon, beef or dressed crab. The busiest site today on the market shows how much its customers have changed. On a corner stands Croissant Express where, incongruously, an almost entirely Asian kitchen brigade fills baguettes, pours cappucinos and bakes croissants and pizzas for City folk who stand to eat looking up at the market's arcades. Above the pizza oven history intrudes. Up a narrow staircase is a small office in which Pickwick would have felt at home.</p>

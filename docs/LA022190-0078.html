			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: OSTERLOH GAVE HARVARD EARLY CLOUT FOR A ROUT  </P> <P> A word to the wise: Don't underestimate Rick Osterloh.  </P> <P> Ask those on the Blair High basketball team who were baptized by fire Friday.  Rapid fire.  </P> <P> Osterloh, a Harvard senior, scored 30 points and made 10 of 14 shots from the  field to lead the host Saracens in a 109-78 romp over Blair in a Southern  Section 3-A Division playoff game. What's more, Osterloh worked quickly --  Harvard Coach Greg Hilliard pulled his sharpshooting guard with three minutes  to play in the third quarter. Hilliard also pulled Matt Clark, who finished  with 25 points.  </P> <P> It took but a tick of the clock to trip the offensive avalanche. Anticipating a  touch pass from Clark on the opening tip, Osterloh bolted to the hoop and  scored an uncontested layup. Harvard's defense clung to Blair like a  sweat-soaked jersey, using a smothering press to steal the ball on each of the  Vikings' first four possessions.  </P> <P> "They were really surprised," Hilliard said of Blair. "You could tell by the  look in the guards' eyes in how effective the trapping was. You could actually  detect a little bit of fear."  </P> <P> Fear might have been a factor but frustration was more readily apparent. The  Saracens' net kept snapping, as did Blair's morale. Harvard, which entered the  playoffs as the San Fernando Valley League champion and the top-seeded team in  the 3-A, held a 33-17 lead at the end of the first period and a 61-37 advantage  at intermission.  </P> <P> "After we stole the ball a few times, you could hear them bickering at each  other," Osterloh said. "That's great. Our whole point is to try and make the  opponents timid, and we really did that in the first quarter.  </P> <P> "I thought before the game that I was going to do everything I could to keep us  from losing. By the end of the first quarter, everyone was so high and  confident that there was no way we could lose."  </P> <P> Osterloh and Clark also were called for charging in the first quarter. The  violent collisions sent a message.  </P> <P> "They let them know that they could stand there and get knocked down each  time," Hilliard said. "I don't mind them doing that to establish that they  intend to be aggressive."  </P> <P> And, as confidence-builders go, four dunks didn't hurt. Osterloh, who had not  slammed since the preseason, had a career-high two. The jams whipped the crowd  into a frenzy.  </P> <P> Osterloh, meanwhile, was cool and focused. His coach noticed as much from the  outset.  </P> <P> "We came out very purposeful and prepared," Hilliard said. "He gets very quiet  and very intense. That's something I really look for. When he sits down before  the pregame introductions and he's just staring straight ahead, I know he's  ready to go."  </P> <P> Fueling the fires of intensity was the fact that Harvard had not played a  postseason game in three years, making this the inaugural playoff appearance  for each team member. Four of the Saracens' five starters -- Osterloh, Clark,  Mike Wolf, and Lloyd Rogers -- have played together since seventh grade.  </P> <P> Said Osterloh: "It was like a dream of all of ours."  </P></p>

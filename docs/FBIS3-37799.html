He said the initiative has saved the world from troubles,  sufferings and escalation of combat operations in former  Yugoslavia. In the words of Goncz, the major Russian political  success consolidated its international authority and position on  the world scene and enabled NATO to overcome the post-ultimatum  situation with dignity.    Goncz reminded Kozyrev of his latest meeting with Russian  President Boris Yeltsin when the Hungarian state head said  Russia will continue to play a key role in solution of European  problems.    On the same day, Kozyrev was received by Hungarian Prime  Minister Peter Boross. The premier praised Russian diplomatic  efforts to settle situation around Sarajevo and said decisive  and constructive Russian efforts enabled Hungary to overcome a  difficult situation, as it is geographically close to the  Yugoslav conflict zone.</p>

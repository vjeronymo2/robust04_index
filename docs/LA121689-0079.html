			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOCH SPY TRIAL UNLIKELY; FBI LACKS EVIDENCE  </P> <P> The FBI, after more than seven months of exhaustive investigation, has failed  to find solid evidence to support espionage charges against career diplomat  Felix S. Bloch and has all but abandoned hopes of prosecuting him, sources  familiar with the case said Friday.  </P> <P> A federal grand jury has heard testimony from a series of witnesses, including  an Austrian prostitute linked to Bloch, the sources said, and FBI agents have  completed a painstaking "Capone-like" examination of his finances, a reference  to the government's successful tax case against mobster Al Capone.  </P> <P> But neither the grand jury proceedings nor the financial reconstruction yielded  sufficient evidence to confirm FBI suspicions that the veteran State Department  official accepted payments from the Soviets in exchange for U.S. government  secrets, the sources said.  </P> <P> With only limited long-shot leads still to be checked in Europe, the FBI  sharply cut back its surveillance of Bloch earlier this month.  </P> <P> In what may be the only action taken against Bloch, the State Department is  expected to move soon to remove him from its payroll. He has continued to draw  his $78,600 annual salary since his suspension June 22.  </P> <P> "This is coming out the worst possible way," one official said. "The bureau is  criticized for heavy-handedness for the public surveillance that was maintained  primarily to stop him from disappearing. And (bringing) no charges makes the  FBI look like the guilty party."  </P> <P> Failure to bring charges against Bloch would magnify what has already been a  highly embarrassing episode for the State Department, FBI and Justice  Department and leave unknown the extent of the damage he allegedly caused to  national security.  </P> <P> It also would renew questions about the fairness of Bloch's treatment by the  government, which officially acknowledged suspicions against him that, in the  end, it could not prove, and which conducted an extraordinarily public  surveillance that made him a media event.  </P> <P> For months, FBI agents had monitored Bloch's Washington residence around the  clock, accompanied him on walks and followed him on trips to New York and other  destinations, often trailed by an entourage of reporters and cameramen.  </P> <P> The decision to reduce surveillance came after Justice Department officials,  lacking cause to bring charges, questioned whether agents legitimately could  take any action to prevent Bloch from seeking asylum in the Soviet Embassy or  otherwise fleeing the country.  </P> <P> Bloch's lawyer, John M. Bray, declined to comment on his client's affairs, and  official spokesmen for the FBI and Justice Department would not discuss the  case.  </P> <P> Bloch, who could not be reached for comment Friday, has spoken cryptically  about the investigation in the past. In August, for example, he was urged by an  interviewer for the Austrian magazine Profil to declare that he was not a spy.  </P> <P> Instead, Bloch replied: "There are suspicions but there is no proof. They have  to prove my guilt."  </P> <P> Bloch, a 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, served as the second-ranking  officer at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, a sensitive crossroads post, until he  returned in 1987 to the State Department to head the office handling regional  affairs for the European Community.  </P> <P> Last May, sources said, U.S. intelligence officials intercepted an overseas  phone call to Bloch from a KGB "illegal," or undercover intelligence agent, who  used the pseudonym Pierre. Based on that call, the FBI asked French agents to  monitor a meeting in a Paris restaurant between the two men.  </P> <P> At the meeting, Bloch allegedly passed a travel bag to the agent, identified by  U.S. intelligence officials as Reino Gikman, a Soviet spy who traveled  undercover as a Finnish computer salesman. The meeting was understood to have  been photographed by the French agents.  </P> <P> In June, U.S. intelligence officials intercepted another international call  between the two men, during which the Soviet agent, using cryptic terms, seemed  to try to warn Bloch that both men could be under surveillance, the sources  said.  </P> <P> At that point, the FBI greatly expanded its surveillance of Bloch and no longer  took pains to remain covert. The State Department placed Bloch on  administrative leave with pay, took back his building pass and removed his  nameplate from his office door, leaving a gaping hole.  </P> <P> A month later, the investigation was reported by ABC News and subsequently  confirmed by the State Department.  </P> <P> In an interview with FBI agents, Bloch maintained that he knew Gikman only as a  fellow stamp collector, sources said.  </P> <P> A source familiar with the investigation said the grand jury had questioned a  former Austrian prostitute named Tina, who in July told Austrian police that  Bloch had paid her more than $750 a night for sexual services.  </P> <P> She now works as a waitress in a Viennese coffeehouse, and Austrian security  officials said they are "certain" that she had no connection with any espionage  activity.  </P> <P> U.S. sources said it is difficult to assess what damage Bloch may have done if  he revealed secrets to the Soviets. He had wide access to economic data in his  latest assignment, and he had enjoyed even broader access to sensitive material  while at the Vienna embassy.  </P> <P> Before his June 22 suspension, Bloch allegedly made an incriminating admission  in an intercepted conversation with his wife, Lucille.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, problems associated with the investigation have hampered the  government's ability to remove Bloch from the government's payroll.  </P> <P> Under State Department regulations, if Secretary of State James A. Baker III  decides to fire Bloch, he must provide written notice in advance and give Bloch  an opportunity to reply.  </P> <P> Bloch then could request a hearing before the Foreign Service Grievance Board,  which would convene an arbitration panel consisting of an outside attorney and  two retired Foreign Service officers.  </P> <P> The department would be required to present evidence to the panel to convince  it that the separation is justified, and the panel could set its own rules of  evidence.  </P> <P> Hearings under the procedure normally would be closed, but they could be opened  -- or their records released -- if Bloch so requested. And if the panel decided  against Bloch, he could appeal the ruling to the federal courts.  </P> <P> Last fall, the State Department proposed an amendment to the Foreign Service  Act that would have allowed Baker to suspend Bloch -- or any other Foreign  Service officer -- without pay if there was "reasonable cause to believe that  (the officer) has committed a job-related crime."  </P> <P> "It clearly applied to Bloch," a State Department official familiar with the  issue said.  </P> <P> But the American Foreign Service Assn., the union representing U.S. diplomats,  succeeded in watering down the amendment. Under the final version of the law  approved by Congress, Baker can suspend a Foreign Service officer who has been  convicted of a crime but not one who is merely under suspicion.  </P> <P> Staff writers John Broder and Robert C. Toth contributed to this story.  </P></p>

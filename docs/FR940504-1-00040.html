These changes will include but not be limited to: Permit application, denial, and appeal procedures; permit fees; and the process for issuing permits where a competitive selection process is used to select the permit holder (e.g., big game guide-outfitters).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before July 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be addressed to: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Regional Director, Attention: Daryle R.

Since that time, the permit administration program on refuges in Alaska has continued to evolve. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to provide up-to-date guidance to both commercial users and Service employees for the administration of permits in Alaska. Prior to promulgating these revised regulations, the Service will be reviewing its existing permit administration program and will be proposing revisions based on over 12 years of experience with the program and the implementation of ANILCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evolution of the program for administering permits has been influenced by a number of factors since the original regulations were promulgated. One factor has been the increased public awareness and understanding of the need for securing permits prior to engaging in many activities on refuges in Alaska. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another factor is the November 1984 Inspector General's Audit Report that found that the Service was not collecting fees which were commensurate with the value of the commercial activities authorized. This audit resulted in the Service developing a fee schedule based on client use days instead of charging a fixed $100 administrative fee for all permits regardless of the scope of income generated by the commercial permittee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another event causing a significant impact on refuge permit administration in Alaska was the decision of the Alaska Supreme Court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Owsichek  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State Guide Licensing and Control Board,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 763 P.2d 488 (Alaska, 1988). That ruling found the State's system of assigning exclusive guide areas unconstitutional. Prior to this ruling, the Service had depended upon the State's system for selecting and assigning guides to areas which were located within refuge lands. In an attempt to allow the State an opportunity to develop a constitutionally acceptable system, and one which would satisfy Service needs, the Service imposed a moratorium on the issuance of permits to new guide applicants. This effectively limited the availability of permits to those who were guiding at the time of the 1988 court ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After some time, the Service decided to develop its own interim program in order to provide an equal opportunity for all registered big game guide-outfitters to compete for permits. During late 1991 and early 1992, the Service proposed an interim system to select big game guide-outfitters. After soliciting public comment on the system, and making revisions based on substantive comments, an interim program was implemented in June 1992. Requests for proposals were then solicited and applicants were notified of selections in January 1993. Successful applicants were awarded 5-year permits effective July 1, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It now appears that the State may not be able to implement a satisfactory system for the selection of guide-outfitters prior to the expiration of the 5-year permits the Service issued in 1993. Accordingly, the Service proposes to initiate development of regulations related to the big game guide-outfitter program and include them in the revised regulations pertaining to the general administration of permits in Alaska (50 CFR 36.41).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has identified several issues at this preliminary stage for which it invites public comment:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is the existing 180 day period allowed for filing appeals of adverse decisions on permits appropriate in this instance? Should a separate appeal system be developed which speaks directly to big game guide-outfitters?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To what extent should the existing interim system for selecting big game guide-outfitters be made part of the regulations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the State develops a selection system that meets Service requirements, should provision be made for the suspension of the Service permit selection system?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments on the foregoing issues, as well as other related aspects of this process, are encouraged. The Service will follow this comment period with the publication of a proposed rule which will allow, also, for additional comments prior to publication of a final rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mollie H.

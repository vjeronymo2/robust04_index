			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Black and white pepper prices were fully steady this week, reports Man Producten. The week started with higher offers from India for black pepper and the Malabar market has also been very firm. Short shippers continue to eat away any carryover in Cochin. Whites prices for Indonesian supplies have been rising quietly as Concern about the the effects of the dry weather has increased. China is a seller but will soon run dry. The nutmegs and mace market remained steady in origin, with limited offtake because most industries are well covered until end this year. There were a few european resellers taking profits by underquoting origins. When the current prices survive this lull in the market we will certainly see a much firmer market early next year, when coverage will be done for 1995. High grades of Cassia are increasingly difficult to obtain.</p>

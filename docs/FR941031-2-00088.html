			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The bend points for 1995 are obtained by multiplying the corresponding 1979 bend-point amounts by the ratio between the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67, and for 1977, $9,779.44. These results are then rounded to the nearest dollar. For 1995, the ratio is 2.3654391. Multiplying the 1979 amounts of $180 and $1,085 by 2.3654391 produces the amounts of $425.78 and $2,566.50. These must then be rounded to $426 and $2,567. Accordingly, the portions of the average indexed monthly earnings to be used in 1995 are determined to be the first $426, the amount between $426 and $2,567, and the amount over $2,567.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, for individuals who first become eligible for old-age insurance benefits or disability insurance benefits in 1995, or who die in 1995 before becoming eligible for benefits, we will compute their primary insurance amount by adding the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) 90 percent of the first $426 of their average indexed monthly earnings, plus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) 32 percent of the average indexed monthly earnings over $426 and through $2,567, plus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) 15 percent of the average indexed monthly earnings over $2,567.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amount is then rounded to the next lower multiple of $.10 if it is not already a multiple of $.10. This formula and the adjustments we have described are contained in section 215(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 415(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Maximum Benefits Payable to a Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1977 amendments continued the long established policy of limiting the total monthly benefits which a worker's family may receive based on his or her primary insurance amount. Those amendments also continued the then existing relationship between maximum family benefits and primary insurance amounts but did change the method of computing the maximum amount of benefits which may be paid to a worker's family. The Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;265) established a new formula for computing the maximum benefits payable to the family of a disabled worker. This new formula is applied to the family benefits of workers who first become entitled to disability insurance benefits after June 30, 1980, and who first become eligible for these benefits after 1978. The new formula was explained in a final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 8, 1981, at 46 FR 25601. For disabled workers initially entitled to disability benefits before July 1980, or whose disability began before 1979, the family maximum payable is computed the same as the old-age and survivor family maximum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Computing the Old-Age and Survivor Family Maximum <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The formula used to compute the family maximum is similar to that used to compute the primary insurance amount. It involves computing the sum of four separate percentages of portions of the worker's primary insurance amount. In 1979, these portions were the first $230, the amount between $230 and $332, the amount between $332 and $433, and the amount over $433. The dollar amounts in the formula which govern the portions of the primary insurance amount are frequently referred to as the ``bend points'' of the family-maximum formula. Thus, the bend points for 1979 were $230, $332, and $433.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bend points for 1995 are obtained by multiplying the corresponding 1979 bend-point amounts by the ratio between the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67, and the average for 1977, $9,779.44. This amount is then rounded to the nearest dollar. For 1995, the ratio is 2.3654391. Multiplying the amounts of $230, $332, and $433 by 2.3654391 produces the amounts of $544.05, $785.33, and $1,024.24. These amounts are then rounded to $544, $785, and $1,024. Accordingly, the portions of the primary insurance amounts to be used in 1995 are determined to be the first $544, the amount between $544 and $785, the amount between $785 and $1,024, and the amount over $1,024.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, for the family of a worker who becomes age 62 or dies in 1995 before age 62, the total amount of benefits payable to them will be computed so that it does not exceed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) 150 percent of the first $544 of the worker's primary insurance amount, plus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) 272 percent of the worker's primary insurance amount over $544 through $785, plus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) 134 percent of the worker's primary insurance amount over $785 through $1,024, plus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) 175 percent of the worker's primary insurance amount over $1,024.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amount is then rounded to the next lower multiple of $.10 if it is not already a multiple of $.10. This formula and the adjustments we have described are contained in section 203(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 403(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Quarter of Coverage Amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1995 amount of earnings required for a quarter of coverage is $630. A quarter of coverage is the basic unit for determining whether a worker is insured under the Social Security program. For years before 1978, an individual generally was credited with a quarter of coverage for each quarter in which wages of $50 or more were paid, or an individual was credited with 4 quarters of coverage for every taxable year in which $400 or more of self-employment income was earned. Beginning in 1978, wages generally are no longer reported on a quarterly basis; instead, annual reports are made. With the change to annual reporting, section 352(b) of the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;216) amended section 213(d) of the Act to provide that a quarter of coverage would be credited for each $250 of an individual's total wages and self-employment income for calendar year 1978 (up to a maximum of 4 quarters of coverage for the year).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Computation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the prescribed formula, the quarter of coverage amount for 1995 shall be equal to the larger of the current amount of $620 or the 1978 amount of $250 multiplied by the ratio of the national average wage index for 1993 to that for 1976. The national average wage index for 1976 was previously determined to be $9,226.48. This was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 29, 1978, at 43 FR 61016. The average wage index for 1993 is $23,132.67 as determined above. Section 213(d) further provides that if the amount so determined is not a multiple of $10, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Quarter of Coverage Amount <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ratio of the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67, compared to that for 1976, $9,226.48, is 2.5072043. Multiplying the 1978 quarter of coverage amount of $250 by the ratio of 2.5072043 produces the amount of $626.80, which must then be rounded to $630. Accordingly, the quarter of coverage amount is determined to be $630 for 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> ``Old-Law'' Contribution and Benefit Base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1995 ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base is $45,300. This is the base that would have been effective under the Act without the enactment of the 1977 amendments. The base is computed under section 230(b) of the Act as it read prior to the 1977 amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

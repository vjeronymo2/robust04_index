			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / French ecology group approves link with Socialists MR Brice Lalonde, head of Generation Ecologie, one of France's leading environmental movements, has endorsed the proposal by Mr Michel Rocard, the former French prime minister, for an alliance between socialists and ecologists, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Mr Lalonde, who resigned last year as environment minister, said the ecologists 'owed a great deal to Mr Rocard' and welcomed the idea of an alliance. Mr Lalonde's endorsement is a step forward for Mr Rocard, who needs to secure the ecologists' support for his proposal. Leading figures on the left have backed Mr Rocard, including Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, and Mr Bernard Kouchner, the popular health minister. The latest polls show the socialists with 20 per cent support against the conservatives' 41 per cent.</p>

Our Arab  affairs correspondent Arye Gus has learned that last night's  meeting between the sides, which was marked by a positive  atmosphere, dealt with security arrangements in the wake of the  UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre, as well  as with the resumption of the negotiations between Israel and  the PLO. The sides did not deal with the demand to remove the  settlers from Hebron. It is also possible that the Israeli  delegation will meet with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross in Tunis.  The delegation is scheduled to return to Israel tonight.</p>

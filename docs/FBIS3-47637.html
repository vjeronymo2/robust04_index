Cho Sun-hwan  of the United People's Party about a missing classified  document, grilling them about how they had handled the material.    The two are former assistant Yi Un-chae, 38, and former  secretary Chong Chu-hun, 31.    Noting that Chong made three visits to Japan between 1987  and  1993, the interrogation focused on whether he had any connection  with Chochongnyon, the pro-Pyongyang Association of Korean  Residents in Japan, a spokesman said.    Chong lived in Japan between July 18, 1987, and Nov. 17,  1990, for study; and between Nov. 21, 1990, and April 13, 1993,  for further study. He visited Japan from Sept. 30 to Oct. 3,  1993, on business.    Chong and Yi were summoned for interrogation on Thursday  afternoon after a tip that he planned to visit Japan again.</p>

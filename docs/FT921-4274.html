			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: End to banana quotas urged QUOTA CONTROLS on Latin American banana imports to the European Community should be ended, the Committee of Independent EC Banana Importers and Distributors has told the EC Commission. 'A quota scheme or an equally restrictive tariff quota would have dire consequences for European importers, distributors, retailers, community consumers and the fragile economies of Central America,' the committee says in a letter to the commission, which is struggling to sort out a banana regime for the European single market. The committee represents banana importers, distributors and ripeners from 10 EC countries. It points out that consumers in the Benelux countries and Germany enjoy lower banana prices and higher per capita consumption than consumers in the UK, France and Spain, which have protectionist measures to help traditional suppliers in the West Indies and the Canary Islands. Recognising that growers from the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states will need some form of protection, the committee suggests a straightforward tariff on Latin American bananas.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Pounds 1.5m bribes for MoD man alleged A SENIOR Ministry of Defence official took backhanders totalling Pounds 1.5m in exchange for contracts placed with three foreign ammunition suppliers, a court heard yesterday. For nearly five years Mr Gordon Foxley, the MoD's ammunitions procurement director, arranged for sums to be channelled into Swiss bank accounts, Snaresbrook Crown Court in London was told. Mr Victor Temple QC, prosecuting, told the jury the money came from three companies, Fratelli Bortelli, of Milan, Italy; Gubruder Junghans, based in Schramberg, Germany; and AS Raufoss, with offices in Gjovik, Norway. He alleged that Mr Foxley, now 69, entered into 'corrupt arrangements' with each one. 'It was agreed that he would receive secret commissions from these companies based on the value of orders he placed or caused to be placed with the companies.' Mr Foxley, now retired, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, denies 12 charges of corruption. Mr Temple claimed the payments - between December 1979 and August 1984 - were based on 5 per cent of the contracts he arranged. The case is expected to last two weeks.</p>

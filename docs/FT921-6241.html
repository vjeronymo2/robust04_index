			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry stresses need for CAP reform EUROPE'S farm policy has to be reformed with or without a settlement in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Ray MacSharry, the agriculture commissioner, said yesterday. Against a background of overproduction, a limited EC budget and declining farm incomes, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has become a priority for the European Commission, Mr MacSharry told the annual Agra Europe conference on the outlook for European agriculture in London. 'The negotiations so far have been slow and difficult. But I believe that ministers are now coming to the view that they can no longer delay decisions that their farming communities expect, indeed demand of them now.' He denied that the EC proposals, which would reduce price support for farm production, would damage 'the so-called commercial sector of agriculture'. But the EC would also not allow the decline of rural communities in 'situations where there is no viable alternative to agriculture'. Uncertainty over Gatt had caused hesitation in states that recognised the need for reform and afforded delay to the less convinced. But Mr MacSharry was hopeful that a deal would be reached this year. Failure would be very costly, he said. 'I firmly believe that the future lies in freer trade and that failure to continually advance on this front creates a serious risk of a return to protectionist tendencies.'</p>

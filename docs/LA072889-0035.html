			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: THE BOWERY THEATRE FINDS  THERE'S ROOM AT THE INN  </P> <P> There are love matches in corporate heaven, says Lee Julien, the Kingston Hotel  partner who lobbied fellow investors to provide the Bowery Theatre a new space.  </P> <P> Julien calls the relationship between the theater and the hotel "synchronistic,  almost a miracle. We bought the hotel about 90 days ago. It all came together  at the same time."  </P> <P> It began when Julien inquired about arranging parking for the hotel with John  Howard, the president of Ace Parking. Howard, then president of the Bowery's  Board of Trustees (he's since been succeeded by Richard Madsen), brought the  plight of the homeless Bowery to Julien's attention. Julien had pursued a  doctorate in theater at Stanford in 1969, before he dropped those studies to go  into real estate. The Kingston had a space; the Bowery needed one. Julien was  interested.  </P> <P> But could he persuade other general partners that it made sense to loan a  space, worth $3,000 a month, rent-free -- and underwrite utilities costs of  roughly $400 to $500 a month? The hotel had a history of bankruptcies and  foreclosures under its former name, the Executive.  </P> <P> It didn't hurt that the major investor was another theater buff, Malcolm  Kingston, chairman of the West Coast drive to raise money for the restoration  of the Old Globe Theatre in England. Kingston came to the opening of the  Bowery's "Italian American Reconciliation" and liked it well enough to give  Julien's idea the thumbs-up.  </P> <P> The Kingston Playhouse was born.  </P> <P> "The experiment to see whether private enterprise can support the arts and  still benefit is an interesting one. A lot of people will be watching to see if  it works out -- me among them," Julien said with a laugh.  </P> <P> His partners "want to see some benefit," he said. "There is a benefit in  supporting the arts, of course. We're having an increase in food and beverage  sales. The possibility exists that we may experience an increase in room sales  eventually. I'd like to promote our hotel as a theater hotel."  </P> <P> But the best part, said Julien, who joined the Bowery's Board of Directors last  week, is that 20 years after the doctorate he never got around to writing the  dissertation for, he has found a way to reunite avocation with vocation. He can  see the benefits for the Bowery, which just announced its first full season  ever, beginning with "What the Butler Saw" in September and ending with  "Teibele and Her Demon" in March. And he appreciates those less tangible but  still rewarding benefits for himself.  </P> <P> "It's proof that you can finally do what you love to do," he said.  </P> <P> Whither the San Dieguito Playhouse? The 31-year-old community theater just lost  a succession of spaces, from its old home at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, where it  had to strike and rebuild its stage every year around racing season, to a site  at the La Paloma Theater, where it had to strike and rebuild its stage before  and after each of La Paloma's daily movies. Now the St. John's Catholic Church  in Encinitas has given it a building, but with a catch. The group must find a  space to put it on; the 44-by-80-foot site has been sold to a developer. Escrow  could be settled by the end of July.  </P> <P> "Community theater is an endangered species," said Norma Payne, president of  the playhouse's Board of Trustees. Given the rising price of land, most  theaters must be underwritten to survive, she explained. Community theaters,  which produce non-professional shows with all-volunteer staffs, often find it  hard to compete with professional theaters for funds.  </P> <P> "We're on the City Council agenda," said Payne, who hopes to be producing  "Painting Churches" and "A Christmas Carol" this year.  </P> <P> "All we are asking for is somewhere we can move the building. We would be  responsible for maintenance. If we could find a donor, we would be happy to  name the theater after him."  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: The Ensemble Arts Theatre has passed the critical point in its  fund raising for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe '89, Aug. 13-Sept. 2. But it has  raised enough to take only one of the two shows it initially planned on: Sam  Shepard's "Angel City." Ensemble Arts plans to produce the second play, "Water  Music," by UC San Diego playwright Michael Erickson, in November in San Diego,  and has scheduled "Angel City" for a Sept. 28 opening here in a yet-to-be  announced location. Among the Edinburgh-bound is Linda Libby, the  longest-playing member of the "Six Women With Brain Death" cast. She left the  ensemble Sunday after starting with the show in October, 1987. . . . Paul  Harter, a real estate investor in Los Angeles, moved to Coronado with his wife,  Ione, four years ago. This year, he gave a deferred gift valued at $1.2 million  to the Old Globe Theatre. The money, according to the Globe, will be used to  help provide rehearsal and creative space for artists and staff; to establish  long-term support for a variety of programs, including the University of San  Diego Master of Fine Arts program and Teatro Meta, and to help retire the  $500,000 deficit incurred as a result of the Festival Stage fire. Recently, the  Harters donated more than $4.75 million to the Zoological Society of San Diego.  . . . The Sunday matinee performance of the La Jolla Playhouse's "Dangerous  Games" at the Mandell Weiss Center for the Performing Arts will be interpreted  for the hearing-impaired. Deaf actress Freda Norman will give a free  pre-performance discussion at 1 p.m. Holly Boursier and Norman's husband, Rico  Peterson, do the signing. Twenty-five discount tickets will be available to the  hearing impaired at $8 apiece. The TDD (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf)  number is 534-0351. . . . The military audience is up for the La Jolla  Playhouse production of "Nebraska," the Keith Reddin play about the servicemen  who baby-sit missile silos. The playhouse finds that a large number of people  are asking for those $2 military discounts. . . . The Old Globe Theatre will  begin selling tickets to the general public Sunday for the American premiere of  "Brothers and Sisters," the Maly Drama Theater production that may well be the  highlight of the San Diego Arts Festival in October. The tickets may seem  pricey at $75 to 125, but the two-part, six-hour epic drama about Soviet lives,  loves and backbreaking labor under Stalin's iron hand, should not be missed.  Next week, the tickets will be advertised in the L. A. market. . . . Josefina  Lopez's touching, semi-autobiographical play, "Simply Maria: Or the American  Dream," winner of the 1988 Young Playwrights Competition at the Gaslamp Quarter  Theatre Company, has been scheduled for broadcast from 4-5 p.m. Sept. 17 on  KPBS-TV (Channel 15).  </P></p>

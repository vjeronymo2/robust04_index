			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: Cross-dressing Japanese style - 'Takarazuka]' is the apotheosis of kitsch Takarazuka is a show that needs psycho-analysis more than criticism. The mysteries of cross-dressing on stage - let alone the mysteries of cross-dressing in the Japanese theatre - are not to be gone into here. Suffice it to say, as a television programme and a lot of press coverage have lately made us aware, this is an all-girl show whose 'male' stars are the darlings of Japanese house-wives. The girls' training, as television helpfully showed us, starts them off as housemaids and they end up as Gary Glitter. Can education aim for more? Now Takarazuka is at the Coliseum, hideously loud, brash, slick, inexorably vulgar, and awash with feathers and sequins, transformations, japonaiserie, cherry-blossom, a stuffed seagull, baritone ladies singing love-songs - though not a single scene takes place near that celebrated beauty-spot The Well of Loneliness - and relentless smiles. It is the apotheosis of kitsch, and is wholly uninteresting on any other terms. Yet given the heady mix of cliches, of second-hand ideas, of feeble dance routines and witless songs, anything better would dilute the kitsch-value. What you must go for is the rampant fatuity, the glitz, the megawatt seriousness of the thing, purveying mindlessly unreal fantasy in giant Dayglo dollops. Not for our audiences, of course, those inscrutable passions that the show inspires in the hausfraus of Tokyo, even unto offers of marriage. (The local drag-queens are, I am told, also fans of Takarazuka's chaps: but here we enter a world of treble-bluff identity which sets the mind reeling). It is sexually quite peculiar, in a sanitised way, and should be immediately comprehensible to British audiences reared on pantomime, where the principal boy is a girl and her mother a man. The show lasts three hours (Was that all?). The first part is the menu touristique with tripping maidens, a samurai serenading a dead seagull (the programme alleges it is a hawk; I was surprised it didn't claim it as the Dodo) and cherry trees. Transformations brilliantly done. Colours very bright. Pause to wonder why the Japanese, whose popular art - from Kabuki to wood-block print - is so stylish, so ineffably elegant, so beautiful, can tolerate such taradiddle. Answer comes there none. Part two is a scena, based on an O Henry story about a bank vault, in which a little boy (believe in that performance and, like the White Queen, you will believe six impossible things before breakfast) is locked in the vault for 30 years. He is, alas, rescued by a reformed bank thief engaged to the bank owner's daughter. Songs, sober-sided dancing, a multitude of bar-boys, a lot of auburn hair, spoken dialogue obligingly given surtitles ('I thought he was in Africa - or Monaco'). A hero called Ralph - and you may guess how that sounds in Japanese. Ill-controlled hysteria from your critic. The last section - by which time I was lobotomised by neon, scene changes and the curiously shrill tone of the amplified Japanese female singing voice  -is called A Million Dreams. (Mine were all of escape.) Mira Anju, the star of the show, appears in a succession of numbers, variously resembling Michael Jackson, Makarova en smoking, Jack Buchanan, without effacing memories of these. She is, like Billy Bennett of blessed Music Hall memory, almost a gentleman. A pianist goes three rounds with a Chopin etude while a quartet caper. More. Much, much more. Someone singing By a sleepy lagoon. Someone else having a go at Besame mucho. The roar of the big-band sound that, even so, cannot make the score sound like music. At the end, down the obligatory stair-case come the entire cast in pink: pink tail-suits, pink ostrich feathers, pink Dubarry frockery. Not so much La vie en rose as L'enfer en rose. Miss Anju, in gold pailletted tails and feathers, looks splendid. I recalled a be-plumed Zizi Jeanmaire, whose Mon truc en plumes had more wit in ten seconds than Takarazuka in its three hours. It is a very odd experience indeed - a collector's piece, I suppose. My companion thanked me 'for an unforgettable evening'. I am going to try and forget the evening as soon as possible. Takarazuka] is at the Coliseum until July 23. Sponsored by Mitsubishi Corporation.</p>

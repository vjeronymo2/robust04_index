			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Clients not told costs in advance, survey shows - Legal briefs Solicitors are still failing to inform clients in advance of the cost of legal advice and representation, in spite of clear guidance from the Law Society, the profession's governing body. According to the National Consumer Council, 25 per cent of firms also fail to provide an internal complaints procedure as required by the society's practice rules. In an NCC survey of solicitors in England and Wales, 80 per cent said they told clients at the outset of the likely costs of their case. But only 60 per cent of clients said they were told of the likely cost. One in four said they had no idea how much their case would cost until they received the bill. Most solicitors also claimed that legal aid clients required to contribute to the costs of their case were told the likely level of contribution at the outset. But less than half of clients said they were told of their legal aid contribution at the start. Lady Wilcox, NCC chairman, said the survey showed solicitors were not as good at communicating information as they thought, but this was not surprising given only 10 per cent of firms actively sought feedback from clients.</p>

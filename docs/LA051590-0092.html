			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DECLINE IN DROPOUT RATE CREDITED TO 4-YEAR EFFORT;  </P> <P> STATE REPORT: OXNARD IMPROVES DRAMATICALLY, BUT IN VENTURA THE NUMBER OF  STUDENTS WHO QUIT REPORTEDLY DOUBLED.  </P> <P> Oxnard education officials said Monday that a state Department of Education  report showing a dramatic decline in high school dropout rates is an  encouraging result of a four-year effort by parents, educators and community  groups aimed at keeping students in school.  </P> <P> But in the Ventura Unified School District, where, according to the report, the  dropout rate has more than doubled in the last three years, administrators  questioned the accuracy of the state's figures.  </P> <P> In the Oxnard Union High School District, the number of dropouts decreased  dramatically from 30.1% in 1986 to 7.8% in 1989. The decline was so marked that  the Oxnard district was one of two in California singled out Monday by state  Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig as exemplary for its efforts to keep  potential dropouts enrolled.  </P> <P> "It's been a big deal in our district," said a delighted Oxnard Union High  Superintendent Bob Carter.  </P> <P> For the past four years, a special committee of principals, parents, students  and local groups, including the NAACP and the Assn. of Mexican-American  Educators, has set up programs to keep kids in school, he said. Improvements  include a full-time psychiatrist on each campus and community workers to call  parents when their children miss school.  </P> <P> Countywide, the report released today shows a 29.9% decrease in the number of  high school dropouts since 1986, compared with an 18% drop statewide. About one  in five students dropped out statewide in 1989, while in Ventura County the  rate was about half that, 11.5%.  </P> <P> The state defines a dropout as a student who has been absent for 45 days or  more with no record of enrollment in another school or continuation program.  </P> <P> Honig and Oxnard officials also credited Oxnard's gains to money from a state  program designed to motivate students. The district received a total of $80,000  from the Maintenance and Motivation Program, which was used to hire outreach  consultants and fund programs for "at risk" students.  </P> <P> Oxnard is one of only two high school districts in Ventura County, and 41  districts statewide, to receive money from the program, said Susie Lange, a  spokeswoman for the Department of Education. The other county district, the  Santa Paula Union High School District, receives money under a joint  application with the Santa Paula Elementary School District, officials said.  </P> <P> In the Santa Paula high school district, however, dropout rates increased from  20.9% for the class of 1988 to 28.4% the following year, the report said.  </P> <P> While the report has encouraging news for Oxnard school officials, the number  of dropouts it shows for Ventura schools has given officials "a real sense of  concern," said Jeffrey Davies, director of Evaluation and Informational  Services for the Ventura district.  </P> <P> The number of dropouts in Ventura schools more than doubled between 1986 and  1989, from 9.4% to 19.5%, according to the report.  </P> <P> "We know that cannot be the case," Davies said. "We don't think it is accurate.  We don't think it has increased dramatically."  </P> <P> According to the district's own tally, the annual dropout rate has been in the  6% to 7% range, he said.  </P> <P> Davies also questioned the state's figures from 1986, which state officials  acknowledge are estimates.  </P> <P> Despite questions over the report's accuracy, however, Ventura officials are  taking the report seriously, Davies said. The district's three high school  principals, Assistant Supt. of Educational Services Joseph Spirito and Davies  met Monday to discuss the figures, Davies said.  </P> <P> The district will attempt over the next three weeks to assess the accuracy of  the report, Davies said. As part of its efforts, officials will attempt to  track the 262 students that the state said dropped out in 1989 to find out  whether they in fact dropped out altogether or enrolled elsewhere.  </P> <P> "We'll take a more aggressive stance toward pursuing them and find out where  they did go," Davies said.  </P> <P> Other districts that show significant changes in the dropout rate include the  1,350-student Oak Park Unified School District, which had a dropout rate of  6.8% in 1986, but only 2% in 1989.  </P> <P> Oak Park officials said only one student dropped out of Oak Park High School's  90-person senior class last year.  </P> <P> The Moorpark Unified School District cut its dropout rate nearly in half, from  30.5% in 1986 to 15.8% last year.  </P> <P> In the Simi Valley Unified School District, the 1989 dropout rate of 14.3% is  still well below the state average, but the number has increased a third over  1986 figures, the report showed.  </P> <P> "We haven't determined the cause of the problem, and we're not going to be  helped next year with the budget cuts," said Allan Jacobs, associate  superintendent of Instructional and Educational Services in the district.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley district faces an $8.5-million projected deficit in the next  school year. Because of budget cuts, the student-to-counselor ratio will  increase next year from 600 to 750 students per counselor, Jacobs said.  </P> <P> Jacobs said the district has special programs to provide alternatives to  at-risk students, including independent study, an adult school program and a  program for pregnant minors.  </P> <P> But in a few cases, even with school officials, teachers, parents and  counselors working to keep a student in school, it is not enough, Jacobs said.  </P> <P> "There are all kinds of things we're working on," Jacobs said. "But the way it  is today, when a kid decides to leave school there isn't much you can do about  it . . . If they decide they're going to go somewhere else, they go."  </P> <P> State DROPOUT RATE: The California rate falls to 20.4%.

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Nankai Electric issue disappoints NANKAI Electric Railway of Japan yesterday saw a muted response to its substantial Dollars 300m five-year warrant bond issue, The deal, lead-managed by Daiwa Europe, was issued at par, but traded down to 98 1/4 bid by the close of trading, just inside full fees of 2 1/4 per cent. The deal will be watched by other Japanese companies looking to raise funding to refinance maturing warrant and convertible bond issues. In total, Dollars 36bn warrant and convertible bond issues by Japanese companies will mature this year, rising to Dollars 84bn in 1993. Up to 80 per cent are currently 'under water' - the exercise price is above the share price. Where the warrants to buy new shares are not exercised, the companies will have to repay the bonds either out of cash flow or by raising additional finance.</p>

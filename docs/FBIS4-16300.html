			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial announcement: "We Must Survive Along With You!"] </F>   [Text] So, today's issue of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA is being  produced with the funds collected by readers. But debts remain  -- 250 million rubles [R] to the "Pressa" Publishing House and  many millions to paper combines, printing centers, and partners  in the newspaper's delivery. How did these debts arise?    It is known that production of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA was halted  for two and one-half months during October-December 1993 because  of the actions of the former Ministry of the Press and  Information, which were subsequently deemed illegal in court.  The editorial office incurred tremendous losses as a result of  the abortive subscription campaign for the first half of 1994  and was deprived of the revenue from advertising and retail  sales -- in all, by the end of 1993 the loss exceeded R1.3  billion. In addition, the editorial office's current account  was frozen for a long time by a Central Bank directive, which  the Superior Court of Arbitration deemed invalid -- this was how  the chain of debts and unjustified sanctions in the form of  fines arose.    At the same time we know that our readers have a very great  need for the newspaper -- it has largely restored its readership  in a short time: The number of subscribers has topped 270,000,  and the total circulation is approaching half a million. A  further 18,000 subscribers have joined us in April. But it is  becoming increasingly costly to produce the newspaper. It now  costs R25-30 million to produce a single issue. This is only at  present! What is to be done?! Let us consult one another.</p>

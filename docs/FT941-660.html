			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / US funds bite the silver bullet: The speculative forces driving up the metal's price The silver market has long been a favourite playground for speculators. Now the same big speculative US commodity funds that drove up the gold price this time last year have joined in the fun. The funds' objective, say some traders, is to push silver's spot price from this year's low of Dollars 4.90 a troy ounce to Dollars 8. Their first target is Dollars 6 an ounce, which they might achieve this week. 'If the funds want to take the price to Dollars 6, Dollars 7 or Dollars 8, they can take it there. They have the money,' says Mr George Milling-Stanley, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. US hedge funds are rumoured to have spent Dollars 1bn (Pounds 668m) to buy physical silver which they have moved from the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) to vaults in Delaware to give the impression that Comex stocks are falling because of heavy demand. Since October Comex silver stocks have dropped by about 30m ounces, or about 11 per cent. Dealers suggest the funds are willing to spend another Dollars 1bn. At present prices, Dollars 1bn would buy about three quarters of the Comex stockpile. For some traders this brings back memories of when speculators had tonnes of the metal moved out of Comex stocks into trucks that simply drove up and down New York streets until stocktaking was completed. Then the silver went straight back to Comex. The silver market was also the scene of the most audacious, and ultimately disastrous, gamble by the Hunt family of Texas. In 1979 Mr Bunker Hunt, whose family had built an oil fortune, and some Arab partners attempted to corner the silver market by amassing nearly 200m ounces, about half the world's deliverable silver - then worth Dollars 6.6bn. In less than a year, silver rose from Dollars 6 an ounce to just over Dollars 50. But in early 1980 the price began to slide, the Hunts could not meet their margin calls and had to be bailed out by their bankers. Their initial losses totalled Dollars 1bn and eventually the catastrophe helped drive the Hunt businesses into bankruptcy. The massive stocks of silver flushed out by the high prices have loomed ominously over the market ever since. 'Bunker Hunt and others caused mayhem in the silver market that lasted for years,' says Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. 'Silver bullets have a history of backfiring and the consequences are often bloody.' It has been said that the US funds were attracted to the silver market by its volatility - it is possible to double the price in a year, something that cannot be achieved with gold. 'But silver has also been known to halve in price in a year,' says Mr Smith. Mr Milling-Stanley points out that, whereas the funds' attack on the gold price came when there was record demand for the physical metal, this is not the case with silver. 'I talk to consumers every day and they are not buying more silver.' Most silver is used for photographic or X-ray film and demand has held up reasonably well during the recession, helped by cheap disposable cameras that need more silver in the film. Industrial demand for silver remained stable at about 13,000 tonnes last year, according to the CRU International research organisation. Nevertheless, CRU estimates that demand outpaced supply by 1,771 tonnes last year, helped by an upsurge in imports to India. Following some easing of import restrictions, India imported 2,800 tonnes of silver in 1993 compared with 800 tonnes the previous year. Mr Tony Warwick-Ching of CRU suggests the long-term outlook for silver has improved. But he estimates there is still 10,000-15,000 tonnes of silver in stocks worldwide, enough to satisfy demand for at least a year. He pours cold water on the US funds' hopes that Indian demand will remain at record levels even if prices rise. Demand from India dropped dramatically when the silver price reached Dollars 5 an ounce recently. 'And India could start selling again. India exported a great deal of silver when the price boomed in the late 1970s.' Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, agrees. 'India has a long history of dishoarding precious metals, particularly silver, when overseas prices are attractive.' Mr Arnold is advising clients to 'stand aside for the time being and watch and see just how high silver prices can be pushed by the funds and other investors and speculators. The higher prices go, the more certain we can be that there will be a massive supply response and prices will fall back.' Dealers suggest that the US funds are using their financial muscle to drive up the silver price, hoping this will attract the attention of ill-informed private investors. Once there are enough of these on the bandwagon, the funds can exit with their profits. One dealer says: 'The big fish are making a lot of noise to attract in the tiddlers so that the big fish can then swim off with their spoils.' And after that? Mr Milling-Stanley says that when the funds take their profits, he would not be surprised to see silver's price drop below Dollars 5 an ounce again.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UP, UP AND AWAY IN THE SILVER MARKET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Silver supply and demand  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Supply (tonnes)                      1992            1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mine output                        11,649          10,994 Scrap recovery                      2,270           2,300 Eastern bloc sales                     60             650  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                              13,979          13,994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Demand Indian imports                      1,125           2,800 Fabrication                        13,080          12,915  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                              14,205          15,715  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance                              -226          -1,771  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CRU International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

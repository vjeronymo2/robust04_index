			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Teresa Ochoa] </F>   [Text] Merida -- Yesterday, members of the 32d Military  Zone seized nearly 40 tons of weapons and ammunition.  Authorities are investigating to determine whether the weapons  are linked to the Chiapas conflict. The soldiers arrived in five  vehicles at "The French Courier" gun shop and seized the weapons  just before midnight. The store is located on the corner of 60th  and 65th streets, just two blocks from the local Government  Palace. Although military authorities are keeping a tight lid on  the matter, it was learned from unofficial sources that there  are several tons and that the load may weigh as much as 40 tons.    Answering questions about the reports, General Antonio Lopez  Portillo said the seizure "probably did occur." Major Alberto  Larios did not deny that there could be 40 tons of war materiel,  and he confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into possible  connections between local armories and the Chiapas conflict.  "Who said there were 40 tons?" he asked, after denying the  general was in, when in fact he was in his office. "That does  not concern me. I know nothing of the matter," he said.    Two individuals from Chiapas were arrested two weeks ago  while trying to move 3,000 .22 caliber bullets reportedly  obtained at the Merida armory. Larios said authorities are  investigating possible ties between these men, the armories, and  the Zapatist National Liberation Army. The men were trying to  load the ammunition at the Merida bus terminal to transport it  to their home state. The two men from Chiapas were intoxicated  and acting suspiciously, and because of this, Federal Judicial  Police were called in.</p>

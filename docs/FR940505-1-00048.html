			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> California's motor vehicle control program (CMVCP) predates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first federal statute regulating motor vehicle emissions, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act of 1965. In the Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quality Act of 1967 (Pub. L. 90&hyph;148), Congress allowed California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a waiver of the Air Quality Act's preemption section on motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle emissions control because of California's pioneering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts and unique problems. The 1977 amendments to the CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded the flexibility granted to California in order ``to afford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California the broadest possible discretion in selecting the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means to protect the health of its citizens and the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welfare.'' H.R. Rep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 301&hyph;2 (1977).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> So long as California demonstrates that its motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are ``in the aggregate'' at least as protective of public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and welfare as applicable federal standards, section 209(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act requires the Administrator to waive the Act's general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition on state adoption of standards relating to the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless the Administrator finds that California's determination was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arbitrary and capricious, that California does not need the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard to meet ``compelling and extraordinary conditions,'' or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the California standards and accompanying enforcement procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not consistent with section 202(a) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(c)(4)(B) also provides that a state that has received a section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 209 waiver (i.e., California) may prescribe controls or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibitions respecting fuels or fuel additives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In section 209 waiver decisions EPA has explained that California standards are inconsistent with section 202(a) if there is inadequate lead time to permit the development and application of requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period. In addition, the Agency has held that to avoid inconsistency with section 202(a), California's procedures may not impose inconsistent certification requirements such that manufacturers would be unable to meet both the California and Federal requirements with the same test vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 CAAA further expanded the California waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions to cover nonroad vehicles or engines (except for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preempted engines), and also established a special California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clean-fuel vehicle program to be implemented in California (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Pilot Test Program). See sections 209, 211(c)(4), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 249.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California law reserves to CARB most authorities for adopting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enforcing motor vehicle emission controls (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions on fuels and fuel content) and standards for nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines and consumer products. Under this authority, particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as strengthened by the California Clean Air Act of 1988 (Chapter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1568, Statutes of 1988), CARB has adopted many new provisions with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential for vast VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reductions. CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations adopted through the first half of 1990 are described at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length in EPA's 1990 proposed FIP for the South Coast. See 55 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36470&hyph;36479.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More recently adopted State measures include: Low Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vehicles (LEV) and Clean Fuels Program; Utility and Lawn and Garden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Equipment Engine Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards for Consumer Products (CARB regulations adopted thus far  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover approximately 30 consumer product categories); and Emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards for Construction and Farm Equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is not generally assigning credit in the attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration for State (or local) regulations that have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already been approved as part of the SIP or are not now undergoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approval. EPA's policy restricts State credit in either their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment demonstrations or progress plans for reductions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures that have not been submitted as approvable elements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal reason for this policy has been to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act, which requires that each SIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``include enforceable emission limitations and other control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures, means, or techniques (including economic incentives such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as fees, marketable permits, and auctions of emissions rights), as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as schedules and timetables for compliance, as may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this Act&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, EPA policy has been to require that reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in attainment demonstrations be submitted for incorporation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SIP, to ensure that the reductions are enforceable directly by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA in the event that the responsible State and local agencies fail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to perform their implementation responsibilities. It is for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason that EPA is proposing in this NPRM to promulgate consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product regulations comparable to rules which CARB has previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted and already enforces, but which the State has not yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted as a SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

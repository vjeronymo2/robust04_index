			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Colosio theories fail to satisfy Mexican opposition: Prosecutor's claims that assassin probably acted alone criticised Mexico's main opposition parties have criticised the special prosecutor's claim that the assassin of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the slain presidential candidate of the ruling party, probably acted alone and was not part of a conspiracy. Mr Miguel Montes, the government's special prosecutor, last week backed away from his original contention that several people aided the assassin, saying there was no new evidence to bolster the conspiracy theory. Without calling for the release of three men arrested for helping the gunman, he said: 'The hypothesis is strengthened that the murder was committed by one man alone: Mario Aburto Martinez'. Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the presidential candidate of the centre-right opposition, said: 'They should get to the bottom of this. What Montes has said so far does not satisfy me or my party.' The leftist opposition said that there were severe doubts about the impartiality of the special prosecutor and 'we are now seeing the consequences of this'. The three men accused of assisting the assassin had been hired by Mr Colosio's own party to control crowds at the campaign rally where he was slain. Their arrest contributed to political instability and nervousness in financial markets in the weeks following Mr Colosio's death, with polls showing that about one-third of respondents believed the ruling party was behind the killing. The evidence against the accused appears to have been largely based on photographs and video footage which, in the prosecutor's original view, showed them helping Mr Aburto, who has confessed to the assassination. However, Spanish police called in to help the investigation later concluded that the photographic evidence was inconclusive. Earlier last week the five members of the independent commission appointed by President Carlos Salinas to verify the findings of the special prosecutor resigned, saying they were not given sufficient legal authority to carry out their task. A government official said the widow of Mr Colosio would select a new commission. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the left-leaning opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party, has received a death threat, according to the state newspaper El Nacional yesterday. The threat came in a letter, which said: 'We are disposed to eradicate social ulcers. Cuauhtemoc is one of those. Remember what happened to Colosio and say goodbye to Cuauhtemoc because this week he will die.'</p>

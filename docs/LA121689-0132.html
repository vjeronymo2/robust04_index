			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FERGUSON CRYING FOUL OVER GOP MANEUVERS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: NEWPORT BEACH ASSEMBLYMAN SAYS TIMING OF CAMPBELL RESIGNATION WAS  RIGGED TO KEEP HIM OUT OF RACE.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson charged Friday that some of his fellow Republican  legislators conspired to eliminate him from the race for state Sen. William  Campbell's seat so they could clear the field for his opponent, Assemblyman  Frank Hill.  </P> <P> Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said he believes that Campbell resigned on Friday --  a few weeks before he had originally scheduled his departure -- because it  could trigger election laws that prevent him from entering the race.  </P> <P> Ferguson recently moved into Campbell's Senate district so he could run for the  seat. If Gov. George Deukmejian calls for the special election before  Wednesday, Ferguson said, he might not meet the residency requirement to become  a candidate.  </P> <P> "I think it's outrageous that someone would scheme such a Machiavellian plan to  ensure that I was not allowed to run in this race," Ferguson charged Friday.  "It's obviously no accident that this whole thing was set up. It's well thought  out."  </P> <P> Ferguson said he wasn't accusing the Legislature's Republican leaders of  planning the conspiracy.  </P> <P> But he noted that Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) and  Senate Minority leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) have both endorsed his opponent,  Hill (R-Whittier).  </P> <P> "There are four people who are involved: Frank Hill, Ross Johnson, Ken Maddy  and Bill Campbell," Ferguson said. "I'm not accusing them, but they're the only  ones who have any interest in this race politically."  </P> <P> Campbell refused to comment Friday and Hill did not return telephone calls to  his office.  </P> <P> But Johnson angrily rejected Ferguson's charge, saying, "That's just  categorically incorrect.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that any such conspiracy to deny Gil Ferguson the right to run  for office exists or has existed. Certainly I have not been party of any such  conspiracy."  </P> <P> Ferguson said he talked with Deukmejian's office Friday about his concern and  was told "the governor does not want to do anything that would exclude me from  the race." Ferguson said Deukmejian could delay the special election long  enough for him to qualify, but he was afraid the governor might unwittingly  schedule it too early.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Deukmejian said the governor has not decided when to schedule  the special election, which could involve a primary as early as February. He  said, however, that the governor was not seeking to exclude Ferguson from the  race.  </P> <P> "Certainly, the governor is not interested in excluding anyone from running in  the special election," Deukmejian spokesman Tom Beerman said.  </P> <P> On Friday, Campbell submitted a terse letter of resignation to Senate President  Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), saying he would step down from the  31st District office effective at midnight. Beerman said Campbell also met  Friday with the governor.  </P> <P> In a press release Friday, Campbell said he decided to resign after the last of  his legislative projects -- attending a committee meeting Thursday on the  subject of investments by the public employee retirement systems.  </P> <P> "I plan to use the last two weeks of this year to make the transition from more  than two decades of public service to my new career as president of the  California Manufacturers Assn.," Campbell said in the release. "Although that  position does not take effect until Jan. 1, 1990, I felt that the transition  should be accomplished at personal rather than public expense."  </P> <P> Campbell announced in October that he would leave his office in early January  to become president of the manufacturers association, a major trade group with  extensive lobbying operations in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Days later, Ferguson announced he would run for the seat. His Assembly district  overlaps Campbell's Senate district, but Ferguson has lived for several years  in Corona del Mar, outside the Senate district. Last month, Ferguson said he  moved to Laguna Beach and registered as a voter in the Senate district as of  Dec. 1.  </P> <P> Campbell's 31st Senate District straddles the line between Orange and Los  Angeles counties, stretching up to Whittier and south to Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> In addition to Hill and Ferguson, Brea City Councilman Ron Isles is the only  other Republican who has announced plans to run for the Republican-dominated  seat.  </P> <P> State officials also said Friday that the timing of Campbell's resignation  guarantees that the 20-year legislative veteran will receive an immediate  cost-of-living increase when he begins collecting his pension.  </P> <P> By quitting before Dec. 31, Campbell will receive the increase scheduled to go  into effect in January; had he delayed his resignation until after the first of  the year, he would have had to wait until January, 1991, to receive a  cost-of-living increase on his base pension salary of nearly $27,000.  </P> <P> Campbell's decision to linger in office after his announcement in late October  angered California Common Cause, which criticized him for having a "serious  conflict of interest" by not resigning immediately after accepting a private  offer.  </P> <P> The public interest group lambasted Campbell again last week for taking a  "junket" in leading a handful of legislative colleagues to New York City to  meet with investment bankers. The Times disclosed that Campbell, as chief of a  joint legislative budget committee, also scheduled -- as part of the group's  official duties -- a tour of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and that the  legislative contingent accepted dinners and free Broadway play tickets from  corporate executives.  </P> <P> Air fare and lodging for Campbell and four other state senators will be paid by  taxpayers, Senate staffers said.  </P> <P> In another matter, a spokeswoman for the federal Small Business Administration  said Friday that Campbell has failed to comply so far with the agency's request  that he reimburse the government $60,175 in grants that were made to his 1987  Conference for Women.  </P> <P> The agency asked for the money back after newspaper articles showed that the  conference, promoted by Campbell's office, paid $165,000 in consultant fees to  a firm owned by Campbell's wife, Margene, and a former aide, Karen L. Smith.  </P> <P> "After the Conference on Women was held last April (1987), it was widely  reported that certain individuals, including your wife and a former member of  your staff, made large profits from the conference," said an SBA letter  addressed to Campbell in March.  </P> <P> "If that is true, SBA should be reimbursed for the assistance it provided to  the Conference. Simply stated, taxpayer funds cannot and should not be used to  support a training event that generates profits for the event's organizers."  </P> <P> Lesher reported from Orange County and Frammolino reported from Sacramento.  </P></p>

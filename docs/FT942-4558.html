			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Output betters market hopes Manufacturing output grew by an unexpectedly strong 1.1 per cent in April, indicating that the economic recovery is still robust, in spite of the impact of tax rises. Industrial production, which includes the more volatile oil and gas sector, was 1.6 per cent higher on the month, according to the Central Statistical Office. Both figures, which are seasonally adjusted, were well ahead of market expectations of month-on-month increases of about 0.5 per cent. However, analysts said that the rise partly reflected a rebound from March, when both production and output fell. Those declines were revised to 0.6 per cent and 0.7 per cent yesterday. Monthly figures are volatile and the CSO prefers to concentrate on three-monthly averages. These show that manufacturing output was 1.2 per cent higher in the three months to April than in the previous three months, while industrial production was 1 per cent ahead. If the three months to April are compared with the same three months in 1993, manufacturing output has risen 2.3 per cent, while industrial production is up 4.4 per cent. In spite of last month's growth, manufacturing output is still about 3.7 per cent below the its pre-recession levels. Recent revisions to the trade figures mean that manufacturing output in 1993 is now believed to have been 0.1 per cent lower than previously estimated. Industrial production is just 0.4 per cent below its peak, reached in June 1990. Its strength is mainly due to oil and gas output, which in April passed its previous record level set in May 1987. Oil and gas output in the three months to April was 37.2 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Electricity, gas and water supply output rose 5.9 per cent between March and April because of colder-than-average temperatures. However, coal production continued to decline. Manufacturing output was boosted by a 14.8 per cent surge in coke and nuclear fuels production, which rebounded after maintenance work in February and March.</p>

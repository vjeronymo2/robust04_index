			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETURN TO THE BOOTH BY REAGAN PRODUCES DIVIDED CONSTITUENCY  </P> <P> Vin Scully must have been terribly embarrassed with his novice color man by the  end of the first inning. I thought it would never end. If he got paid more than  a free hot dog, it would be too much.  </P> <P> I hope in the future Scully's protege will stick to horseback riding, where he  has a lot more experience.  </P> <P> JAMES HARRINGTON  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

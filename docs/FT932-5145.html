			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / 'Costly' Arts Council criticised THE Arts Council, which distributes government support for the arts, is 'cumbersome and costly', according to a report commissioned by Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary. A review of its operations by consultants Price Waterhouse points to several areas of the activities of the council - which last year distributed Pounds 225m - where savings could be made. The report says the administrative cost of projects and schemes is high, and that the council wastes resources with extensive consultations. For every Pounds 1 in funding delivered to artists through the council and the regional arts boards, 10p is spent on administration. Mr Brooke made clear that while he did not regard this as too high, he felt there was room for improvement. He said: 'I can certainly think of other organisations which manage to spend large sums of money without spending 10 per cent on administration.' He said he would consider the contents of the report and consult various groups over the next few weeks before deciding what action to take. Mr Brooke added: 'The report is radical and constructive. We are pre-occupied with getting the maximum amount of money into the hands of the artists.' The review says the relationship between the council and the heritage department is 'ambiguous' in spite of Mr Brooke's commitment to allowing the council to take its own decisions. It also concludes that the composition and procedures of the council are cumbersome and recommends changes including 'streamlining' management teams and reducing the council's membership. The review sets out three options for improving the council's operations: Relatively minor structural changes and a cut in staff numbers of about 20 - 12 per cent of the workforce - to achieve an annual saving of about Pounds 429,000. Extending the structural changes, shedding almost 40 staff and saving about Pounds 847,000, but leaving the council basically intact. Cutting the council to a core of 50 posts, leaving it to buy in expertise and services from other bodies. Lord Palumbo, Arts Council chairman, said it would examine the options and consult regional colleagues before putting its advice to Mr Brooke.</p>

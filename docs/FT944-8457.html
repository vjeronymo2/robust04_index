			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Buoyant glass-maker shines - The week ahead TUESDAY: The strong profit recovery at Pilkington, the glass maker, has continued in the six months to September with analysts forecasting a figure of between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m before tax and exceptional items, up from Pounds 30.5m in the first half of last year. The improvement stems largely from increased capacity utilisation and some price rises. The headline figure will be nearer Pounds 75m, including the gain from the sale in June of its insulation business. TUESDAY: After seeing promising first-quarter figures from Thorn EMI, the music and rentals group, analysts are anticipating another encouraging set of results. Jeffrey Harwood, leisure analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, expects a 17 per cent pre-tax profits rise to Pounds 135m for the half to September 30, against Pounds 115m. Thorn has benefited from the bouyant state of the music business and is now re-orienting its rental interests by moving into the burgeoning 'option to buy' market. TUESDAY: National Grid is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 300m (Pounds 285m) when it reports results for the first six months. The City will be looking for as much information as possible on the Grid's flotation, which is expected in the middle of the year, but it could have to wait some weeks before details are announced. TUESDAY: Interim profits at Northern Foods are forecast at around Pounds 65m, down from Pounds 72.1m a year earlier, because of pressure on dairy profits, and exceptionals. Any indication of Northern's ideas for restructuring the dairy industry would be welcomed by analysts. TUESDAY: Vodafone, the UK's largest cellular phone group, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits in the Pounds 175m-Pounds 185m range, only a few percentage points ahead of last year's Pounds 174.5m, as start-up costs for overseas licences start to bite. Overseas losses could amount to Pounds 50m. The UK cellular market has proved buoyant, however, with surprisingly stable pricing, and it is expected that the bare figures conceal substantial underlying growth. WEDNESDAY: Courtaulds, the chemicals and fibres group whose shares have been weak over the past few months, is expected to report interim profits before exceptional items of around Pounds 80m, little changed from last year. But a modest increase in the dividend to about 4.2p (4.0p) is thought likely. The City will be keen to hear if Courtaulds is managing to pass on its rising raw materials costs, which accelerated over the summer. WEDNESDAY: Tate &amp; Lyle is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year ended September of around Pounds 265m, against Pounds 223.5m a year earlier. A recovery in cereal sweeteners and starches will be the main factor. A 1p rise in full-year dividend to 14p is expected. WEDNESDAY: Yorkshire Water is forecast to show a 12 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits before exceptionals to about Pounds 84m. The figures will be overshadowed by restructuring provisions and accounting changes on the treatment of infrastructure maintenance charges. Shareholders will also be curious to know whether Yorkshire has been tempted to follow the trend of higher-than-expected dividend payments. Forecasts are for at least an 8 per cent increase to 8.2p, which could well be bettered. WEDNESDAY: Granada Group, the broadcasting, leisure, rental and business services group, is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to end-September of at least Pounds 250m on Wednesday, up from Pounds 176m last time. The second half will see the first full contribution from London Weekend Television, of which Granada won control in February for Pounds 760m. THURSDAY: After last month's upbeat trading statement, the City expects a good set of interim results from retailer Storehouse. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of around Pounds 25m, compared with Pounds 11.6m last time, for the group which includes British Home Stores, Mothercare and Blazer. Attention is likely to focus on how well the BHS expansion programme is progressing. THURSDAY: Allied Domecq is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 240m after exceptionals and Pounds 310m before, against Pounds 271m and Pounds 292m respectively a year earlier. A dividend increase of around 6 per cent to 7.5p a share is likely. Investors will be looking for more news on the integration of Domecq into the group and on further recovery at Carlsberg Tetley, the group's beer joint venture which lost market share last year.</p>

In addition, Yevhen  Sukhin, the CEO of "Ukrnaftohaz" and first deputy chief of the  State Oil and Gas Committee, informed the Ukrainian and foreign  press about the formation of the National Stock Holding Company  of Ukraine (NSHCU). NSHCU will deal in oil and gas enterprises  that have been targeted for incorporation and privatization.  These include "Ukrhazprom", "Ukrnafta", "Ukrzakordonnaftohazbud"  and a number of other enterprises.    The primary goal of NSHCU is to secure investments to  promote  rapid reorganization and to cover foreign energy debts.

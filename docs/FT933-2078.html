			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Technology: Custom-built toys for pen pushers / Profile of Telepad, which has big plans for pen computers Who needs a pen computer? Everyone who can write, to believe the razzmatazz over Apple's Newton, Eo's personal communicator, Grid's Gridpad and other electronic personal assistants. In practice, innovative devices of this kind are finding favour first with a smaller but no less demanding audience: agents, salespeople and inspectors whose job means hours on the road and quantities of data to be analysed and relayed to headquarters. Pen computers have no keyboard. Their users write directly on the screen using a special stylus. The computer's software records the handwritten input either as the original drawing - a sketch map or a signature, for example - or translates handwriting into alphanumeric characters. Insurance companies, engineering concerns and inspectors are already sending out their staff armed with machines built by Grid and IBM of the US and NEC of Japan among others. The machines are not perfect. Persuading a machine to recognise the scrawl that passes for most people's handwriting is not easy. 'Pen computing will be a horizontal market - but not yet,' muses Ron Oklewicz, president and chief executive of Telepad, a three-year old US computer company based in Reston, Virginia. What he means is that while pen computing is not yet sufficiently flexible or reliable for universal use, it has ready applications in niche areas - field force computing being the obvious example. Oklewicz's company seeks to exploit the gap between the potential of pen computing and the reality of building reliable systems based on novel technology. Telepad is still in its development phase. It raised Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.8m) through a public offering resulting in a Nasdaq listing on July 15 and is in many ways a model for the computer company of the future. It is a 'virtual' company, only 32 people strong and fleet of foot. It relies on other organisations for product design and manufacture. Its eponymous product, the Telepad, a foot-square polycarbonate-cased screen selling for between Dollars 2,400 and Dollars 3,000, is manufactured for it under contract by IBM, in one of the first examples of the industry giant's new policy of selling its skills to third parties. The physical design of the device was entrusted to two US design shops, GVO of California and Edge of Philadelphia. Warehousing and physical distribution are handled in the US by LMI of Memphis, Tennessee, which also takes responsibility for repairing broken machines. Much of the technology in the Telepad is off-the-shelf. It will run all the most popular industry operating systems, for example: Windows, OS/2, Penwrite, Go and Pendos. So how does Telepad reckon to differentiate itself from the competition? It claims to be one of the first systems integrators in the pen computing business, putting together hardware, applications software and telecommunications in a package customised to the exact needs of the user. This puts it in a different category from companies like Apple which are chiefly concerned with selling innovative hardware. Oklewicz, a former manager of Apple's federal systems division, does not see the Newton as competition. IBM, on the other hand, 'is perpetual competition, but it is opening up the market'. Some prestigious customers are already shopping there. The US Air Force, one of the world's largest buyers of computer equipment, is spending Dollars 1m on Telepads for staff inspecting radar installations. A US police force is using Telepads to replace 14 separate accident report forms by one electronic entry. Miniature cameras, or radio devices which communicate with satellites to pinpoint the user's geographic position, can be linked to the device. Telepad, however, not only provides the hardware and the communications  - it also develops the necessary information-processing software. A store chain, for example, recording its inventory on Telepads could transmit the data to head office over the telephone or radio links for analysis.</p>

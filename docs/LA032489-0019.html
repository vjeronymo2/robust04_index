			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER MUST CLIP WINGERS ON CONTRA AID  </P> <P> Once again, a secretary of state was trapped in the tribulations of shuttle  diplomacy.  </P> <P> Like Henry Kissinger's imbroglios in the Middle East and Alexander Haig's  peacemaker Ping-Pong between the Falkland war machines of London and Buenos  Aires, James A. Baker III bounced from one fractious summit to the next.  </P> <P> Only Baker never left town to do it.  </P> <P> In a mission of unprecedented duration, this secretary of state spent a week on  Capitol Hill shuttling between demagogues and demigods, and a smattering of  statesmen.  </P> <P> His plan: Win broad, bipartisan backing for a document that spells out the new  U.S. policy supporting the Central American presidents' effort to bring  democracy to Nicaragua and repatriate the Contra rebels, and provide  humanitarian aid to the Contras.  </P> <P> His problem: Deep-seated distrust of the wingers -- that is, the  arch-conservatives of the right and arch-liberals of the left -- each hoping to  scuttle the shuttle.  </P> <P> His plea: Ron and Ollie don't work here anymore. Trust me on that. And vote to  give the Contras one more pay period -- $41 million for the next 10 months for  humanitarian aid only.  </P> <P> It is a decent and even humane plan that is being opposed by many in the  congressional rank and file for all the wrong reasons.  </P> <P> For most of the past week, Baker shuttled between clusters of party leaders  gathered in the offices of the Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader,  the Speaker of the House and the House minority leader. At each stop, he'd pull  the same two-page paper from his pocket and patiently go over it, paragraph by  paragraph, line by line. At each stop, objections and accusations would be  heard -- the conservatives had one set of complaints, the liberals another.  </P> <P> Unspoken was this bit of deliciously Washingtonian irony: As Baker worked his  diplo-politico fandango up and down the halls of Congress, the underlying cause  of everyone's complaints was being revealed just three blocks away, in the  halls of justice.  </P> <P> The trial of Oliver North was laying bare the true deceit of Ronald Reagan's  Central America policy. Testimony has made clear our former President's  contempt for Congress -- and the extent of his anti-democratic effort to  subvert the will of the Senate and House by sneaking funds to the Contras.  </P> <P> We now know that after Congress voted down military aid to the Contras, Reagan  made a secret deal with Honduras to get the job done -- even though he has  sworn that he didn't know his own National Security Council staff was doing  anything to help the Contras.  </P> <P> He agreed to provide Honduras with military and economic aid in exchange for  that country's willingness to let the Contras operate bases and receive arms  shipments in their territory, just across the border from Nicaragua.  </P> <P> That is the policy that Sen. Jesse Helms favors even to this day;  Administration officials believe Helms wants the Baker initiative to fall apart  so we can go back to a good ol' war.  </P> <P> And that is the policy that the liberals -- especially those in the House --  fear will bubble up anew in George Bush's White House.  </P> <P> "I've been lied to routinely by the Sandinistas and the Contras," says Rep.  David Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign  Operations. "It's a hell of a mess. I haven't trusted the Sandinistas, the  Contras or the executive branch of my own government."  </P> <P> Just winning the support of the party leaders is not enough, as Baker sees it.  He says it's important to have a majority of both parties behind the plan to  show that, in the wake of our failed Central American strategies, the United  States can finally achieve continuity in its own policy.  </P> <P> "It's not enough to have a policy that's cobbled together by getting 25  Democrats to vote with every Republican," said Obey.  </P> <P> Five Central American presidents have agreed on a peace plan under which  Nicaragua will hold elections no later than Feb. 25 of next year and will  permit campaigning by parties in opposition to the Sandinistas. And by May 16  of this year, the presidents will complete a plan for the Contras' "voluntary  demobilization, repatriation or relocation."  </P> <P> The Bush Administration wants money for food and shelter to keep the Contras in  place until elections are held in Nicaragua. But House liberals want to kill  all funding for fear that, if the elections are not held, the Contras will pick  up arms again.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of very concerned liberals who are unwilling to vote any more  aid for the Contras -- regardless of what our party leaders tell Jim Baker they  favor," says California Rep. Robert Matsui.  </P> <P> My fellow liberals are well-meaning but wrong on this one. Our complaint was  with the policy-makers, never with the individual Contra soldiers -- just as,  in the Vietnam era, our complaint was against our policy-makers, not our heroic  fighting men in the field. We must do all we can to ensure that the Contra  soldiers will be treated well and fully repatriated.  </P> <P> Our history in the support of freedom fighters is not exemplary. In the 1950s  we encouraged and then turned our backs on the Hungarian freedom fighters; in  the '60s we did the same for the brave men at the Bay of Pigs; in the '70s we  left many gallant souls to undeserved fates in Vietnam.  </P> <P> We owe it to the Contra soldiers to take our new President and secretary of  state at their word -- and then make damn sure they keep it.  </P> <P> EPILOGUE: At one of those dinner parties that fuels Washington, Bob Matsui, the  liberal Democratic congressman, is talking shop with Sen. Dave Durenberger, the  Minnesota Republican. The topic: the new push for a bipartisan foreign policy.  </P> <P> "A lot of liberals will speak out against giving any money to the Contras,"  says Matsui.  </P> <P> Durenberger beams. "That's just what the wingers on the right want to hear," he  says. "If your liberals speak out loudly enough against it, our wingers may be  able to justify voting for it."  </P> <P> What a country.  </P></p>

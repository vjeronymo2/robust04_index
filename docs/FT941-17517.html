A spokeswoman for the Moscow-based State Committee for Emergencies said the captain of the Tupolev-154 craft had reported one of its engines catching fire minutes after taking off from the Siberian city of Irkutsk on Flight 130 to Moscow. As he turned back to the airport, the other two jets of the Baikal Air aircraft failed. The airliner was just 12 minutes into what should have been a five-hour flight to the Russian capital from Irkutsk, an industrial town situated on Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater lake and a famous tourist attraction.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata issued a statement on  20 December that victory of communists and ultra-rightists in  the Russian parliamentary elections does not affect Japanese  policy to support President Boris Yeltsin's economic reform.    Commenting on the landslide victory of the ultra-right  Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Hata  noted "that was partly because the Russian public is very  frustrated with the present circumstances of the reform process."    On that ground, He stressed: "Japan strongly hopes all  members of the new Russian parliament will demonstrate their  sense of responsibility to both the Russian public and the  international community, and further promote the nation's reform  efforts." In conclusion, he added: "There is absolutely no  change in Japan's policy to offer appropriate assistance to  Russia's reform efforts."</p>

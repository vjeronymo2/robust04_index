			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Second half helps Amic restrict 1991 fall to 11% AN improved second half allowed Anglo American Industrial Corporation (Amic) to restrict the decline in full year 1991 earnings to 11 per cent. Profits at Amic, the industrial arm of the giant Anglo American group, improved by 5.6 per cent in the second half following a 25.4 per cent reduction in the first six months. Full year net earnings fell to R401m (Dollars 139m) from R451m. Turnover was 5.5 per cent higher at R6.46bn, but earnings at the operational level were 24 per cent down at R434m. Income from associate companies and investment and interest income also dropped. Mr Graham Boustred, the retiring chairman, said the results reflected a deepening domestic recession and further deterioration in world markets. Of the main profit contributors, both Highveld Steel and AECI, the chemicals company, were hard hit, with Highveld's attributable earnings dropping to R96m from R150m while earnings at AECI dropped to R187m from R238m. Earnings also fell at Boart International, a key supplier to mining markets, to R48.2m from R66m. Companies that managed to lift earnings included Mondi, the forest products group, and Scaw Metals. Mondi's attributable earnings rose by 18 per cent to R110m and Scaw lifted earnings to R84m from R78m. Mr Boustred said the group was budgeting for a modest increase in earnings this year. The 1991 dividend is being held at 350 cents per share.</p>

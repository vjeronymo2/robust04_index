			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>   [Text] KABUL, April 2 (AFP) -- Emerging from a lunchtime  meeting with United Nations special envoy Mahmud Al-Mestiri  Saturday, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani declared his  committment to a permanent ceasefire in Kabul.    "We are ready to accept a permanent and unconditional  ceasefire," Rabbani told journalists at the Presidential Palace.    Rabbani added he hoped the "other side" would follow his  lead  on the ceasefire, stop their bombardment of the city, and open  the highways for free passage of relief food supplies to Kabul.    Just before Rabbani emerged from lunch with Mestiri three  artillery rounds crashed into the neighbourhood, but apart from  this there was an unusual but welcome calm in the capital.    Mestiri heads a UN delegation which will spend three days in  the capital talking to Afghan leaders in a bid to end the  current three- month long factional fighting which has killed  and wounded more than 15,000, driven hundreds of thousands from  their homes and destroyed vast tracts of the city.    Rabbani's chief rival Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar has  demanded the president's resignation as a precondition for a  negotiated peace settlement but Mestiri said he did not discuss  this with Rabbani.    "This point was not included in our negotiations," Mestiri  told AFP.    Mestiri's departure from the Presidential Palace was blocked  by a small group of placard-waving children demonstrating for  peace.    Exiting from his limousine Mestiri spoke with two young  Afghan girls who handed him their written demands.    "I know all the children in Afghanistan want peace," Mestiri  said, before driving off to the Intercontinental Hotel for his  next meeting, with provincial peace delegation leader  Jallaloddin Haqani.    The pistol-packing Haqani said all sides in the factional  fighting had agreed on the point that the military option was  null and void.    However, 200 kilometres (120 miles) north of Kabul fighting  raged between the forces of Rabbani's commander-in-chief, former  defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, and Hekmatyar's military  ally, Uzbek warlord General Abdol Rashid Dostam.    The fighting is around Dostam-occupied Qelagai, where  massive  amounts of ammunition and large numbers of Masood troops are  being trucked daily in preparation for an attack against the  strategic centre of Pul-e Khumri, half an hour's drive further  north.    UN sources said there was a possibility that observers might  be sent to Kabul to monitor the situation but ruled out the  military role of Blue Helmets as peace-makers.</p>

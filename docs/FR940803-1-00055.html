General Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proper brake adjustment is critical to the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. When brakes are correctly adjusted, vehicles can generally be brought to a stop within a satisfactory distance and in a controlled manner. However, brakes that are not properly adjusted cannot develop the retardation force designed into the vehicle's brake system, resulting in increased stopping distances. Under emergency conditions, this can result in a collision that might otherwise have been avoided, or in a more severe collision than would have occurred with properly-adjusted brakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Out-of-adjustment brakes are the primary equipment-related cause for commercial motor vehicles to be placed out of service during roadside inspections. According to the FHWA's Office of Motor Carrier Field Operations Annual Report for Fiscal Year 1992, 36.2 percent of vehicles placed out-of-service are cited for this deficiency. A copy of this report has been placed in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, brake-related accidents, some stemming from gross brake maladjustment, are also a factor in some ``equipment malfunction'' CMV accident citations. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) regulatory evaluation, prepared in conjunction with their rulemaking on automatic brake adjusters (ABAs), noted that 6.8 percent of all medium and heavy truck accidents were reported as being caused by defective equipment. Of that figure, 31 percent were due to defective brakes, with 60 percent of those brakes judged to be out of adjustment; this amounts to 1.3 percent of accidents reported_or nearly 4,000 accidents per year. The regulatory evaluation also cited a review of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports on 97 serious heavy truck accidents investigated from 1969 to 1981. Out-of-adjustment brakes were cited as a causal or contributing factor in 27 of those 97 accidents, or 28 percent. A copy of the NHTSA's regulatory evaluation has been placed in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Safety and Operational Role of Automatic Brake Adjusters and Brake Adjustment Indicators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Automatic brake adjusters significantly reduce the effort required for inspection and manual adjustment of the brakes. Clearance-sensing ABAs limit the clearance between brake linings and drums, or pads and rotors, to a level that ensures effective brake actuator strokes. They adjust on every complete brake application. Stroke-sensing ABAs adjust on brake applications severe enough to cause the brake actuator stroke to exceed that which the ABA is designed to maintain. ABAs include, but are not necessarily limited to, automatic slack adjusters (ASAs). The term ``automatic brake adjusters'' is used to provide a performance-based description of this class of devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brake adjustment indicators (BAIs), especially when used in concert with ABAs, can do a great deal to address the brake adjustment problem. A BAI conforming to the NHTSA requirements can significantly reduce the time necessary to assess brake adjustment levels. Use of these indicators will make it easier for drivers and maintenance personnel to make brake-adjustment checks at more frequent intervals, and detect brake adjustment problems before they become severe enough to cause, or worsen the outcome of, an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. NHTSA and NTSB Research on CMV Brake Performance and ABAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two extensive research studies of CMV brake performance, and operational and maintenance experiences of motor carrier fleets utilizing CMVs equipped with ABAs, have been performed by the NHTSA and the NTSB. We summarize both here. Copies of the NHTSA and the NTSB studies are available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS, Springfield, Virginia, telephone (800) 553&hyph;6847). Copies have also been placed in the public docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. NHTSA Research.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NHTSA research was reported in ``Automatic Brake Adjusters for Heavy Vehicle Air Brake Systems,'' February 1991, report DOT-HS&hyph;807&hyph;724 (PB 91&hyph;215814). Seven fleets participated during a 2.5-year initial study period and an additional 3 years of follow-up; 245 tractors and 289 trailers accumulated nearly 50 million miles of travel during this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Researchers and fleet maintenance staffs made nearly 20,000 measurements of brake stroke length on approximately 1,800 brake adjusters (four different manufacturers' ABAs, plus manual brake adjusters (MBAs)). For 36 types of ABA installations, the median out-of-adjustment rate was 4.0 percent, and the median number of out-of-adjustment observations per brake per 10,000 miles was 0.016. The NHTSA noted that ``[t]he ASAs tested were principally models designed and marketed in the early to mid 1980's. There have been extensive design improvements in both ASAs and other brake system components since that time. Thus, the performance data presented here for these earlier ASA designs likely understate the performance levels that can be expected from ASAs purchased today.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NHTSA collected a limited amount of control data on MBAs. There were 96 MBAs used in portions of 3 of the fleets. The use of MBAs generally resulted in higher percentages and rates of out-of-adjustment brakes than did the use of ABAs, and the differences were considered to be statistically significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2. NTSB Research.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NTSB, an independent Federal agency responsible for investigating and determining the probable cause or causes of certain transportation-related accidents, has studied numerous accidents in which brake deficiencies have been cited as causal factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

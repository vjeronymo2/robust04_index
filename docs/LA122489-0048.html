			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> HOUSEPLANTS CAN HELP CLEAR THE AIR  </P> <P> QUESTION: I have an energy-efficient house. During the colder weather, it gets  stuffy and I don't feel as good as I usually do. Is there any energy-efficient  method to improve the air quality without investing a lot in special systems?  </P> <P> ANSWER: The most energy-efficient and inexpensive method to improve the air  quality in your home is to reduce the amount of pollutants you put into the  air. There has also been some recent research done which shows that certain  varieties of common houseplants can help purify indoor air.  </P> <P> Many of the chemicals from cleaners, waxes, and materials in your home may  build up and actually make you feel ill, irritable and depressed. When you are  doing polluting activities like cooking, cleaning or painting, operate an  exhaust vent fan. Close the doors to that room and crack open a window just a  little to reduce the loss of heated air from the rest of your home.  </P> <P> Replace synthetic household cleaners and materials in your home with natural  ones. For example, polyester curtains or vinyl shades can give off fumes when  heated by the sun. Cotton or wood is better. If you dry-clean curtains, hang  them outdoors first before rehanging them.  </P> <P> You can use a water/vinegar solution to clean greasy film from a vinyl floor.  Then use club soda to polish the floor. You can clean tar off a floor by first  scraping off the excess with a knife. Then rub it vigorously with a dry cloth  and butter or margarine.  </P> <P> Instead of using spray cleaners and polishes, you can remove water marks from  furniture naturally. Mix a small amount of wood ash with cooking oil and apply  with a soft cloth.  </P> <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has done research  using houseplants to remove such harmful chemicals as formaldehyde and benzene  from indoor air. Certain common houseplants, such as the spider plant, have  been found to be particularly effective for purifying the air naturally.  </P> <P> In addition to removing indoor pollution and producing oxygen, indoor plants  add needed moisture in the winter. You should place the plants in areas where  air circulates, perhaps a hallway or near a return register.  </P> <P> There are companies that produce completely natural cleaners, waxes, adhesives,  paints and even shoe polishes. Some use only coconut oil as a base, no  petrochemicals, and the products are totally biodegradable. They are available  through health food outlets and by mail order.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 382, which includes "low-tox"  cleaning tips, a list of 10 house plants useful for purifying air and a list of  manufacturers of natural cleaners and products. Please include $1 and a  self-addressed business-sized envelope.

Is it  possible to set it too low and waste energy heating it up again?  </P> <P> A: With most furnaces -- gas, oil or electric -- the lower you set your  thermostat, the better. Heat loss is a function of the temperature difference  between indoor and outdoor air. If the temperature difference is less, then the  heat loss is less.  </P> <P> Even with a heat pump thermostat, setting it back too much at night may not  yield savings as great as you anticipate. In the morning, when the outdoor  temperature is lowest, the heat pump may not be able to heat your house quickly  enough. Then the expensive back-up resistance heater may kick on.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Reopening of the Albanian File Requested -- Letter by </F> Albanian Intellectuals to the UN secretary general, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, May 5 (ATA) -- "Albanian intellectuals hold  that this is a crucial moment for the Albanian national question  which must mark its return to the agenda of the international  politics and the treatment of an historical truth with a new  attention and greater sensibility in relation to the UN Charter  principles," says a letter that a group of 66 Albanian  intellectuals among who Adem Demaci, Rexhep Qosja, Ismail  Kadare, Ali Podrimja, Jussuf Vrioni, Sherif Delvina, Nermini  Vlora, Zferia Cana, Kristo Frasheri and Inva Mula, addressed  recently to the UN secretary general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    It is the aspiration of the Albanian people on both sides of  the border, and also in the interest of all the peoples of the  region and in the interest of the peace in europe that this ray  of light, appearing on the horizon of international politics,  has its impact in the reopening of the Albanian file, the  Albanian intellectuals say.    Their demands are based on the December 1960 resolution of  the UN General Assembly, which says that "subjugation of peoples  to a slavery, foreign domination and exploitation is a denial of  the fundamental human rights, which runs contrary to the UN  Charter and makes a compromise with the cause of peace and the  world cooperation." They also cite Article 2 of this resolution  which says that "all the peoples have the right to determine  their destiny freely... they freely define their political  status...."    The Kosova question, the intellectuals say, is one of the  fundamental components of the Yugoslav crisis which is not at  all "An inner Serbian question" and by all means calls for a  re-examining and proper solution based on new democratic  principles.    Opposing the thesis that the Albanians of Kosova make up a  minority in Serbia, the Albanian intellectuals say that the  Kosova question, taking into account its proportions and  complexity, makes up a typical case of the colonial regime.  Unless the hand of the Serbian occupiers is not halted on time,  the intellectuals warn, they will commit a real holocaust  against the Albanian population of Kosova.    The albanian intellectuals, "Separated by Borders," ask  Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the question of the future of Kosova  and of all the Albanians residing in the former republics of the  disintegrated Yugoslav Federation -- in Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], southeastern Serbia  and Montenegro -- be treated as soon as possible in a special  international conference under the protection of the universal  organisation.    Imperative for the entire Albanian nation today is the  recognition of the republic of Kosova as an independent,  sovereign and neutral state placing it under the observation and  protection of international bodies the recognition of the right  of the Albanians of Macedonia, who make up 40 percent of its  population to be a substantial constitutive component of the  state recognition and observation of national and human rights  according to the final act of Helsinki and the Paris Charter to  the Albanians in Montenegro and southeastern Serbia. On behalf  of the Albanian people they solemnly pledge that they will  strictly observe these rights for its ethnic minorities.    By ending the appeal, Albanian intellectuals hope that the  UN  secretary general will act quickly as is demanded by this  question which threatens to degenerate into a conflict without  any outcome.</p>

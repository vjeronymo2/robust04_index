This work will affect the overall  situation and will closely relate with the interests of the  broad masses of cadres and workers. We must implement it  carefully and take active and reliable steps to carry it out.    Zhao Zhihao pointed out: In organizational reform, the most  crucial issues are to improve relations of various sectors,  clearly define functions and powers, streamline organs, change  functions, raise efficiency, render good service, and guard  against and overcome bureaucracy and formalism. This year the  county and township levels should comprehensively promote the  public service system; the province and various cities and  prerectures should encourage organs to [words indistinct] in  line with organizational reform. All cities and prefectures  should regard the whole process of promoting the public service  system as a process to strengthen the building of government  organs and raising the quality of personnel and guarantee the  smooth implementation of the public service system.    Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The wage reform of organs and  institutions has involved the immediate interests of more than 2  million workers and staff members of organs and institutions  across the province. We must know the policies well, strictly  observe organizational discipline and prevent the people to do  things in their own way or to establish new organs. It is  necessary to do a good job in conducting in-depth and meticulous  ideological and political work. Regarding reform of the  insurance system of organs and institutions, the State Council  has clearly defined that the personnel departments should take  charge of it. Personnel departments at all levels should rapidly  issue overall plans for reform of the social security system of  organs and institutions in our province and enable the social  security work of organs and instituions across the province to  become regular and legal.    Vice Governor Zhang Ruifeng also attended the conference.</p>

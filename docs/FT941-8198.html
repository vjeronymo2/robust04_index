			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Money managers take a fresh look at commodities - Risk and Reward In the US, the apparent swing into the second stage of a business cycle recovery has drawn big money's attention back to commodities. After years of underperforming fixed-income investments, commodities - particularly metals like copper and aluminium - outperformed bonds in the first month of this year. Although low oil prices have kept inflation concerns at bay, money managers still reason that owning physical assets will pay off with big returns when a surge in demand breathes life back into basic industries that are commodity consumers. Mutual fund managers and other money managers have piled into commodity proxies - mostly shares of companies that are commodities processors - pumping up prices to unrealistic levels. Newmont Gold, a US mining company, is priced at almost 50 times current earnings, while the US's largest aluminium companies, which posted large losses in 1993, are trading at 100 times projected earnings two or three years into the future. What has happened, analysts say, is that the total market capitalisation of commodity-linked equities is too small for the purposes of mutual funds, which have an estimated Dollars 2,000bn in assets to invest. US pension funds, also interested in commodities, weigh in with another Dollars 2,000bn in assets. Direct investment in commodities would seem a logical alternative, but most mutual funds and many pension funds and insurance companies are prevented by charter or their investment boards from owning physical commodities or commodity futures. Derivatives dealers have moved in to ease the strain, offering structured notes with values tied to the price movement of an underlying commodity, but which fit the definition of a fixed-income investment. Swaps based on commodity price relationships are also being sold to fund managers. These deals could gradually inflate prices in the physical markets, traders say, again because the money to be invested is vast compared to overall market size. Wall Street's pin-striped fund managers have been tiptoeing into fixed-income instruments linked to corn prices, because the unusually low feedgrain supplies in the US this year have boosted prices; into structured oil deals, because oil prices are at historically low levels; and into base metals, where prices occasionally sank below production costs last year when Russian supplies glutted markets. Last month, a California-based insurance fund with Dollars 14bn in fixed-income assets ventured into the oil swaps market for the first time in a trade based on expectations that the upwardly-sloping forward oil price curve will invert to a more traditional backwardation (whereby the spot price is above the deferred delivery date) during the next 18 months, with spot prices moving above the two-year forward price. Merrill Lynch persuaded Pacific Mutual Life Insurance to invest about Dollars 15m in the 1m barrel trade as a means of diversifying assets. Pacific Mutual will profit if the spread returns to a pre-defined level. If the spread does not move out of contango (whereby the spot price is below the deferred delivery price), Merrill Lynch will profit from the trade. The trade was an unusual one for an insurance fund, but could herald a trend. Banks and broker-dealers are actively adding commodity-derivatives expertise to their trading and sales rosters, viewing commodities as a lucrative expansion opportunity as growth in foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives businesses level out.</p>

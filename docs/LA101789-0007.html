			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIGOTRY ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> It is a shame that we are seeing a return of bigoted minds in the hallowed  halls of learning. These minds today should be totally free of this cancer.  </P> <P> Yet today to understand this we see something that lights this fuse, a feeling  of frustration in these young people that we have not seen before, failure  because things are "not fair."  </P> <P> I spoke to a young man, age 21, who is a senior at UC San Diego. He plans to  enter the medical profession. I've known him since his birth. He has never had  a bigoted bone in his body. Years have developed a successful student, athlete,  leader and a compassionate human being. When asked whether his college  grade-point average would permit access to a UC medical school he stated, "Dad,  it isn't fair . . . our family had no slaves, were part of the system and we  succeeded to be educated and earn an honest living; now we hear that more seats  must be filled with minorities. Dad, it's not fair."  </P> <P> I do not believe in discrimination but when I hear that affirmative action has  replaced selection based on merit and aptitude I can understand the frustration  of a young man who sees people far less qualified being given "extra points"  for affirmative action. It becomes personal. To express feelings in opposition  brings cries of "racist."  </P> <P> The kids today are feeling the brunt of all this and a few respond in socially  unacceptable ways. They are not right in what they do, agreed, but let's look  at the problem. My son is right when he says, "Dad, it's not fair."  </P> <P> IRA KAPLAN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Left group backs student loans THE INSTITUTE for Public Policy Research, a leftwing think tank, has proposed moving further towards student loans and means-tested fees to finance expansion in higher education. The Labour party has hitherto opposed student loans and charges for higher education, but the think tank says the present system of student finance 'supports the wealthiest young people in society at the expense of the majority'. However, it says that the government's current loan scheme achieves the worst of all worlds: it deters students and fails to raise revenue. It says that the primary constraint on expanding higher education is the cost to government, and proposes that any reform of student funding should raise revenue while distributing costs more fairly. The report says students should be funded through loans paid back through the tax system when they earn above the national average. Other proposals include modularised courses to increase choice and flexibility; a two-semester academic year; and separate funding for teaching and research. Higher Education: Expansion and Reform.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "ao": "Priority--Early Elections"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--The Saturday [12 March] meeting of the  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] Executive Committee started  with an evaluation of the political situation and an assessment  of the ability of the SDL district organizations in Povazska  Bystrica and Ziar nad Hronom to act. The participants' main  attention focused, however, on the development of the domestic  political situation in Slovakia.    The Executive Committee approved the course of action by the  SDL Presidium and the SDL Club of Deputies in the search for a  way out of the political crisis. It continues to regard an  agreement on calling early elections as the priority of the  SDL's tactics so that the new cabinet's period of activity can  be strictly defined. The Executive Committee authorized the SDL  Presidium to conduct talks on the formation of a preelection  coalition with the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS],  the Farmers Movement of the Slovak Republic, the Association of  Workers of Slovakia, the Green Party in Slovakia, and other  political entities, as well as on the formation of a provisional  government. The SDL is interested in the new government having  the greatest possible degree of continuity with the previous one.    At a meeting with reporters, SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said  that he was opposed to the assumption of power by the new  coalition being accompanied by politically expedient purges at  various levels. As for posts in the Supreme Inspection Office  [NKU] of the Slovak Republic, SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik  said that the NKU was the fourth institution of constitutional  power. Changes in its leadership are essential, he said,  precisely because the NKU chairman (from the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia) and the deputy chairmen (both from the  Slovak National Party) did not act independently in their posts.    Responding to behind-the-scenes rumors about a lack of unity  among SDL deputies to the National Council of the Slovak  Republic, Peter Weiss said that their activity was determined by  the president's [9 March] address to parliament and by the  failure to enlist a sufficient number of deputies' votes to  decide on a date for early elections before the dismissal of  Prime Minister Meciar. Hence, the problem was not just to  express no confidence in the prime minister, but to agree on a  sequence of steps. However, the SDL Club of Deputies' decision  of Friday [11 March] afternoon [to support the no-confidence  vote in Meciar] was unanimous. Peter Weiss did not rule out the  possibility that, apart from a broad coalition government, there  could also be a cabinet formed by the SDL and the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia, naturally without Vladimir Meciar. As  regards representatives of the Hungarian political parties, the  SDL does not count on their direct participation in the  formation of a provisional government.</p>

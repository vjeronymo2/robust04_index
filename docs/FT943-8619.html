			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Pig cycle gets stuck in low gear - UK prices have now been below break-even levels for 12 months Pig farming has always been a notoriously cyclical affair; but the present down-swing in prices has been deeper and much longer than usual and is causing severe pain in the sector. A year ago this week the average ex-farm price for finished pigs was just over 105p a kilogram deadweight. It had fallen sharply during the previous six weeks to that level, which was generally recognised to be about the break-even price on efficient farms. The decline continued through last autumn and winter and although there was some recovery during the spring and summer of this year the price consistently failed to reach the break-even point. Since then it has dropped back again, to 96.45p last week. Moreover the average all pigs price (AAPP), calculated weekly by the Meat and Livestock Commission from a mix of open market and contract deals, has failed to reach a profitable level during the whole of the past 12 months. We pig keepers are used to our charges being either 'copper or gold' as the cycle of production and price revolves. But a full year of heavy losses is an extreme situation and has resulted in many business failures. Just how many pig producers have been forced out of business is not yet known but there must now be significantly fewer of us than the 11,800 operating across the UK in June 1993. It is not just farmers who have lost money on pigs. Many abattoir operators claim to have had similar problems and some have gone out of business. Some of those that remain have had to cancel or modify minimum price contracts half way through their term and still more have assessed the situation and refused to continue with such contracts. Feed companies too have reduced their exposure to the vagaries of the pig market. In the past most major companies financed the breeding and feeding of large batches of pigs, employing farmers as contractors and paying them a share of the proceeds for the use of their buildings and labour. The system locked in guaranteed feed business for the manufacturers and reduced capital involvement for farmers while at the same time providing them with an income. This kind of vertical integration was never popular with traditionalists but it served its purpose for the parties involved. Now, however, following substantial losses during the past 12 months, most feed manufacturers are reducing their involvement in such schemes or pulling out altogether. The single major exception appears to be BOCM Pauls, which earlier this year took over the 100,000-head-a-year Louis Dreyfus operation and is also reported to have agreed to buy 6,000 sows from Unigate, which were farmed by its Malton Bacon Factory subsidiary. BOCM Pauls is now thought to control the production and marketing of some 1.5m pigs per year - about 10 per cent of the UK total. The company is almost alone among major feed suppliers in expressing its faith in the future of pig rearing. The disillusionment of the others is hardly surprising. For while the incomes of most other sectors of UK agriculture have been boosted by the devaluation of sterling and associated increases in EU prices, pig farmers have had virtually no such assistance. Indeed rises in the ex-farm price of cereals increase the cost of pig feed, thereby raising further the break-even point for pig production. The combination of currency devaluation and a potential shortage of feed grain because of poor yields across Europe has increased the price of feed grain by Pounds 12 to Pounds 15 a tonne above expectations in the UK this harvest. The problem is not confined to the UK but affects most of the main pig producers of Europe. A few months ago, in response to the crisis, the French government allocated special aid to its pig farmers, which was later judged to be illegal under European Union law. In Germany a few days ago the average pig price was similar to that in the UK at the equivalent of 97.5p a kilogram deadweight and in Holland it was even lower at 89.7p. On the reasonable assumption that production costs across the EU are similar, it must also be assumed that pig farmers in those countries are losing substantial amounts on every animal they produce. However, better news may be just around the corner. At last, it seems, there is a reduction in the number of pigs coming to market. Losses, which were at their highest last November, led to a reduction in the number of sows kept for breeding. The resulting cut in births, the MLC believes, is about to feed through to the supply of finished pigs and this should boost prices. Indeed spot, open market prices have already strengthened a little and this could be the beginning of the recovery. The MLC forecast some months ago that the AAPP would reach 100p a kilogram deadweight by August and 110p by October. The August forecast cannot now be achieved by the end of the month and in view of that the October prediction now seems too optimistic. Even so a rise into profit does appear to be on the cards in the relatively short term - and very welcome it will be too. If MLC forecasts are to be believed, prices should hold above break-even levels through the autumn and for at least the first half of 1995. Goodness knows, after 12 months of losses, they need to. And I expect that, unlike most feed companies, we on this farm will carry on farming pigs for the time being. However, an exodus of big companies that have been committed to pig rearing for many years is bound to make us wonder if we are right to do so.</p>

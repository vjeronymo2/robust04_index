			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Clarke urged to give Bank of England responsibility for interest rates MR KENNETH CLARKE, the new chancellor, has been urged to give the Bank of England sole responsibility for setting interest rates in Britain, Peter Norman writes. A report published today by the influential European Policy Forum said Britain's present inflation target should be the subject of a contract between the government and the Bank's governor so that the UK could be 'locked in' to a low-inflation economic policy. It also said the Bank should set target ranges for the growth of money supply. Mr Frank Vibert, the report's author, said such steps would allow Britain to keep pace with moves to central-bank independence in the European Monetary System.

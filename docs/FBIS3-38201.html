Mr. Demirel  said police had failed to provide sufficient security and were  to blame for the incident in which one demonstrator was killed  by shots fired from inside the embassy. He was speaking in  Davos where he is attending the World Economic Forum. Swiss  Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti denied there had been any security  lapse. The shooting and Turkey's refusal to lift the diplomatic  immunity of its embassy staff led to a diplomatic row between  the two countries.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Trading warning clips 4p from Avon Rubber shares Shares in Avon Rubber slipped back in a buoyant market yesterday as the group warned of a toughening trading environment in spite of an 18 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits. The shares closed 4p down at 484p. Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to October 2 rose from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 11m. Sales were 14 per cent higher at Pounds 265.7m. Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive, said that in spite of an 'excellent perfor-mance' from the main tyres division, recession in con-tinental Europe was likely to affect trading in the current year. 'We are going to be hard pushed to make another gain,' he said. Vehicle output on the Continent was estimated to have fallen by about 20 per cent. The tyre division increased operating profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 6.4m on sales just 5 per cent higher at Pounds 82.7m. The current year had begun somewhat 'slower than we had hoped', said Mr Mitchard. The downturn in the European vehicle industry had hit the components division which nevertheless managed to increase operating profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 3.9m. Sales were 26 per cent higher at Pounds 99.8m. The technical products business, which includes Avon's defence related products, had 'fired on all cylinders', said Mr Mitchard, resulting in a 9 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 5m. Sales were 17 per cent higher at Pounds 70.3m. Cadillac, based in the US, had been held back by a squeeze on prices from General Motors, one of its main customers. The group had lost about Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) in busi-ness, as a result. However, sales were 10 per cent higher in dollar terms, said Mr Mitchard, due to greater demand from US vehicle manufacturers. The inflatables business, which returned a loss of Pounds 403,000 against a profit of Pounds 25,000 last time, continued to be difficult. It was uncertain whether this would remain a core business for Avon, he said. The final dividend was maintained at 11.5p for a total of 16.5p (16.5p). The 5 per cent rise in earnings to 30p was held back by the Pounds 22m rights issue in May.</p>

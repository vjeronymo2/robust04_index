			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GWR acquisition plan is blocked by Radio Authority GWR, the expanding Bristol-based commercial radio group, has had an acquisition plan blocked by the Radio Authority, even though a similar scheme involving Emap and Trans World Communications was accepted. The GWR plan, like the Emap deal, sought to use a loophole in the 1990 Broadcasting Act to own more radio licences than the Act allowed. The Emap scheme involved setting up a 'deadlocked' company between the media group and Schroders, its merchant bank. Each owned 50 per cent of the share capital of the new company, which was designed to hold two Trans World radio licences. By excluding the two Radio City licences from Emap's total, the group was able to push ahead with a bid for Trans World. The Radio Authority view was that the device was legal, a view that survived a judicial review granted to the Guardian Media group, which owned 20 per cent of Trans World. The High Court ruled that the Radio Authority had not acted outside its powers. After the judicial review, which appeared to clear the way for a rationalisation of the industry, GWR applied to the authority for permission to push ahead with a takeover on a similar basis. This was rejected. The Radio Authority view is that it will not authorise any further 'deadlocked' company deals as a way around the concentration of ownership rules until the government makes its legislative intentions clear. It is believed the authority has been unable to get any view of what the government has in mind from Mr Stephen Dorrell, the National Heritage secretary. The government is planning either a green or a white paper on the media some time next year, with the possibility of changing the rules on cross-media ownership in the 1995-96 parliamentary session. GWR declined to comment last night.</p>

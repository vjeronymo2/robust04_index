			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Central banks 'more adventurous' with gold Central banks are seeking ever more adventurous and ingenious methods of making profits from their gold hoards, according to Mr Terry Smeeton, chief manager, foreign exchange division, at the Bank of England. He revealed for example, at the Kalgoorlie Gold Conference, that some central bank gold is to be used to back a new type of investment, a Euro certificate. But it would not necessarily result in central banks releasing gold, he said. They would be able to buy or sell certificates during their life and 'there may be no sale of gold at the end of the day'. A London group expert in securitisation had well-advanced plans for Euro certificates with a life of three to five years, pricing linked to the price of gold and an active secondary market. The securities, which might carry interest, would be aimed at investors wanting exposure to the gold price. The scheme would increase the liquidity of some central banks gold holdings while avoiding sales of metal. Mr Smeeton brushed aside accusations that central banks, by lending gold to the market at derisory interest rates, were helping to push down the price of one of their own major assets. He admitted that central banks had about 1,500 tonnes of gold - equivalent to several months consumption - on loan and that 'the price might be somewhat higher' if it was not in the market. He insisted, however, that central banks were responding to market developments 'instigated by the mining community and encouraged by the ingenuity of the banking community'. Also, 'the fact that some interest is being earned on central bank gold reserves may enable a reserve manager more easily to keep at bay those within the country who may wish to sell the gold'. Mr Smeeton said, however, that the UK central bank would not not take part in the scheme; and he doubted if any other western European bank would be involved. He suggested that the spectre of big sales from central bank vaults, containing 35,000 tonnes, was diminishing. The biggest holders, the US, Switzerland and Germany, were not active in this area - Switzerland for legal reasons and the other two countries 'probably because they are responsible for the world's two major reserve currencies and confidence in them is enhanced by the knowledge that respective central banks own a substantial holding of the metal that has long served as the world's ultimate reserve asset'. Furthermore, while more sales from western European central banks, also big gold holders, could not be ruled out, 'I think the long term trend will be for the bulk of them to be retained'. Commenting on reports that the Japanese finance ministry was to sell 90 tonnes of gold from unwanted coins, Mr Smeeton suggested the news was leaked ahead of the sale to head off market rumours that Japan's central bank was selling gold - which would have been much more alarming. Delegates who contacted Japan yesterday said the refinery concerned could handle only a few tonnes a month so the market should suffer no big disturbance.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Leading Article: A new vocation A CENTURY of failure in Britain's vocational training and education cannot be quickly reversed. But the next two years should show whether a key building block of the new system - National Vocational Qualifications - is helping fill the country's skills deficit or merely giving a fancy new name to existing arrangements. If it succeeds it may owe something to the unglamorous sounding National Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets (Nacett) unveiled last week. The small committee's high-powered membership, along with the co-operation shown by rival government departments at its birth, are promising signs. NVQs are a critical part of Nacett's remit, aimed at the system's greatest weakness, namely the large number of young people with no vocational or educational qualifications. NVQs, which are meant to rationalise a maze of vocational qualifications, are now available to more than 80 per cent of the workforce. Based on competence tests rather than written exams, they stretch from level one (semi-skilled) to level five (higher professional). They are meant to promote mobility through core transferable skills and improve comparability both between occupations and between vocational and academic achievements. Few people argue with the NVQ principle or with national education and training targets, in particular the aim that by 1997, 80 per cent of young people should have reached NVQ level 2 or its academic equivalent of four higher grade GCSEs. But employers have been slow to sign up their employees to NVQs, and opinions are strongly divided about the way NVQs are organised. Critics argue that there is little sign of parity of esteem between academic and vocational qualifications and that the lack of central authority, ultimately from Whitehall, has allowed the system to be hijacked by the 126 industry bodies which have designed unacceptably company and job-specific qualifications, with little emphasis on transferable competences. For all this, the system is reformable. Nacett's annual report will be a useful spur. One immediate aim should be to establish reliable figures about how many people have, or are working towards, NVQs - the figure of 3m quoted by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications appears to be a guess. At the same time, the NVQ assessment system could be made less rigid and expensive. It could also be made easier for people to sub-divide NVQs by doing a core qualification and then adding more sophisticated options. The upgrading of vocational qualifications remains in its infancy in Britain. Education reformers are familiar with the problem of seeing their work damaged by vested interests. It will take combined determination from the Education and Employment departments to overcome the difficulties. But the task is not impossible - the targets must be met.</p>

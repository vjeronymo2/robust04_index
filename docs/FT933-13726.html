			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Protest over Asda options to chief and four directors Leading institutional shareholders in Asda, the supermarkets group, said they intend to protest to its board about stock options granted practically free of charge to chief executive Mr Archie Norman and four other directors. The investors say the options violate guidelines set out by the UK's two leading shareholder groups, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers which urge that options only be granted at the market price of the stock on the day it is issued. Discounting means that even if the share price remains stagnant, directors have the opportunity to earn profits. Executive share option schemes are the one aspect of executive remuneration which shareholders have the opportunity to vote on but only if the number of new shares to be issued is more than 5 per cent of a company's existing share capital. Thus, Asda did not need to seek shareholders' approval when it authorised the programme six months ago. Mr Norman is granted the option of purchasing up to 2m shares between 1996 and 1997 at a nominal price of 0.01p. This is compared with yesterday's closing price of 60.5p. They are only exercisable if Asda's earnings per share over five years are at least 15 per cent per year while the share price must be at least 100p. No exercise of options is allowed if earnings per share growth is below 10 per cent and the share price is below 45p. The National Association of Pension Funds, in particular, has criticised the granting of options where the exercise is linked to earnings per share because it is regarded as a measurement too easily manipulated by managements.</p>

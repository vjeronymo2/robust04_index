			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROUGHT AND PORTER RANCH  </P> <P> On July 11, The Times reported that the dutiful, public-spirited citizens of  Los Angeles reduced their June water consumption by 15%. On the very same day,  the Los Angeles City Council, obviously relieved that the water shortage crisis  is now over, voted to allow construction of over 3,000 new residences for  11,000 new Angelenos in the massive Porter Ranch development. To the citizens  of Los Angeles I say: I hope you enjoy your brown lawns, suckers!  </P> <P> STEPHEN SLOBIN  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

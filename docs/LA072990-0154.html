			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING WORDS  </P> <P> Children of non-English-speaking parents: The greatest favor you can do for  your parents is to teach them English -- one word a day.  </P> <P> Without it they are limited in opportunity, isolated in anunreal, small world,  and they will suffer much prejudice and discrimination. I know, I indulged my  parents, spoke only Spanish at home (they said they were too busy earning a  living to learn English). They gave me all they could -- including a college  education. But when I wanted to take a job in New York, I couldn't go. My  parents couldn't buy food without me to speak English.  </P> <P> RAMONA ALVAREZ  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

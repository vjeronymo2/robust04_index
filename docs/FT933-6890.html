			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Arts: Novelty concerts from Spain - The Edinburgh Festival Away from the main themes of the festival there has been a delightful pair of concerts from Spain. The Orquestra de cambra Teatre Lliure arrived in Edinburgh without much of a fanfare and offered little biographical information about itself except that it was founded in 1985 by the conductor Josep Pons and performs 20th-century repertoire. Its calling-card comprised two imaginative concerts: a pair of Spanish programmes, one of music by Manuel de Falla, the other of Roberto Gerhard, composers from very different artistic backgrounds. If they have one trait in common, it is a liking for strongly-contrasted colours, as we heard quite vividly. The Edinburgh prospectus had advertised the orchestra as 'brilliant', an epithet which did not seem excessive after the event. The Falla concert was held in the Usher Hall, but probably should not have been. Despite an audience turnout which justified the use of a large hall, the chamber versions of the scores that were being played could hardly make the impact they deserved. For one work - Falla's pithy Harpsichord Concerto (wisely performed here in an alternative version for piano) - there were only six players on the platform. Given the novelty of the pieces the orchestra had brought, one really wanted as immediate a contact with the players as possible. Two of Falla's most popular works were on the programme, but each in a rarely-heard original form: El corregidor y la molinera (later to spawn The Three-cornered Hat) and the first version of El amor brujo. The second was the eye-opener, both because it is longer than the usual version and because its nature is so different. Originally the music developed out of a chain of recitation, songs and dances. It was described as a 'gitaneria', or gypsy-piece, folk music at heart in a way that one could hardly guess at from the orchestral showpiece we usually hear. The singer, Ginesa Ortega, gave us real Flamenco in the songs, guttural, raw, full of passion - no concert-hall sophistication there. For the Gerhard programme the orchestra moved to the small Queen's Hall. An irony this, as there were now more musicians on stage than for the largest of the Falla scores. But this was to Gerhard's advantage and even the two very derivative Spanish works that had been included - the Flamenco divertissement Alegrias and the song-cycle Cancionero de Pedrell based on Spanish folksongs - came across with some bite and flair. I suspect there is not much of the true Gerhard in either of those. A short cycle of songs to surreal poems written in French by a Catalan poet in the Japanese style proved to be attractive, precious, not particularly distinctive. It was the ballet score Pandora, composed in Cambridge in 1942-3, that best showed how dramatic and evocative this composer can be, its sense of enveloping doom typical of the war years.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: James Dickie up to Pounds 628,000 James Dickie, the engineering components manufacturer, pushed ahead both turnover and pre-tax profits for the six months to February 28, and is restoring its interim dividend payment. Reflecting improvements in demand and new business, turnover of this USM-quoted concern expanded from Pounds 7.86m to Pounds 10.6m while the surplus before tax amounted to Pounds 628,000 against a previous Pounds 250,000. Earnings per share were 6.91p (3.03p) and the interim payment - the first since 1990 - is 1p; last year's final single payment was 2p from pre-tax profits of Pounds 678,000. The group invested Pounds 520,000 in plant and machinery during the first six months and expenditure is expected to total Pounds 350,000 in the second half, the directors stated. Despite the level of investment they added that 'gearing reduced encouragingly' during the interim period, and should reduce more by the year end.</p>

His proposal for an interparty policy study group triggered a  controversy over a coalition merger, and Hosokawa is showing  irritation with such frictions between the coalition parties.  Earlier this week, Hosokawa started to refuse to answer  reporters' questions about the policy study group or the  coalition merger, saying: "I have to work on my duties as prime  minister. You must not talk about the floor group unification.  No more question on this issue, please." On 29 March, Hosokawa  closeted himself in his office for about six hours "to study  something." This made his associates wonder "what is wrong with  the prime minister?"    Hosokawa's close associates said that he is "really sick and  tired" of the controversy over the coalition merger. When  Hosokawa visited Kanazawa to help campaign in the Ishikawa  gubernatorial election, he told reporters: "I am not going to  talk about a political realignment anymore because my remarks  always produce unexpected reactions. I should devote myself to  my duties as prime minister." However, he added that "I think  the coalition parties' participation in the policy study group  will accelerate the adjustment of candidates in the lower house  elections under the new electoral system." As the result,  speculation on a coalition merger became further heated.    As for the political realignment issue, Hosokawa was saying  "I do not know" or "no comment" until last week, but he has  "refused to answer any questions" on the issue since 28 March.  In response to a report that "an agreement has already been  reached to form a new party led by Hosokawa and Ichiro Ozawa,"  Hosokawa candidly expressed his displeasure, saying: "I have  never heard of it. It is really a nuisance."    Hosokawa's irritation has been worsened by a delay in Diet  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget because this has been  caused by his own suspicious loans from the Sagawa Kyubin  Company. On 29 March, he closeted himself in his office after a  meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata at around 1000.  Except for 50 minutes for lunch in the dining room, he spent  all day alone until shortly before 1700. When Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura called on Hosokawa that evening,  Hosokawa refused to see him, saying "please let me finish my  studies if you do not have some urgent business."    In explaining the "six hours of silence," Hosokawa's close  associate said: "The prime minister had to study for the 30  March session of the lower house Budget Committee. In  preparation for questions from the Liberal Democratic Party, he  thoroughly reviewed the Sagawa issue." However, it appears that  Hosokawa is much too stressed out by the internal discord in the  coalition and the Sagawa scandal.</p>

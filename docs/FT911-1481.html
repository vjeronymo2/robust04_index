			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / A competition with a catch or a day's fly fishing on the Kennet - will go to whoever can present credible evidence of having caught, by fair angling means, a specimen of Salvethymus Svetovidovi, otherwise known as Svetovidov's long-finned char. This is undoubtedly the most challenging angling contest ever devised, and I am pretty confident the prize will go unclaimed. For there are certain obstacles to the pursuit of this creature, which - in fairness to the more adventurous readers of this column - I should outline. For one thing, the fish is unique to one lake in the entire world. It is called El'gygytgyn, and it is situated in Central Chutotoka. Quite where Chutotoka is, I am not sure. Somewhere in eastern Siberia, perhaps. Wherever it is, Lake El'gygytgyn is not likely to figure on the tourist agenda. According to my information - gathered from a translation of a learned Russian treatise - it is frozen solid for all but two months of the year. The climate is described as extremely harsh and the fauna as extremely sparse ; scienceSpeak for a God-forsaken, wind-whipped, snow-bound, ice-encrusted hellhole of a place. Assume, however, that the intrepid angler actually manages to find El'gygytgyn during its ice-free summer. The problems are only just beginning. The long-finned char prefers to swim at a depth of 150 feet or more. In addition it is a demersal planktivore , which means - I think - that it is most unlikely to snap at a spinner or bait even if means could be devised to get them down to it. At this point I will leave it to the expert. I have not been to Lake El'gygytgyn, nor would anything induce me to do so. But I can claim to be one of the few fishermen in England - possibly the only one - to have seen Svetovidov's long-finned char in the flesh. I can exclusively report that they are very small, very dark, with a very few tiny spots, and long fins. The only interesting thing about them is that they are the first new specimen of salmonid to be identified in recent times. For this Anatoly Nikolayevich Svetovidov, who first trawled one from El'gygytgyn's frigid depths, will be honoured by ichthyologists, if not by anglers. I saw, and indeed touched, this rare creature in the basement of the Natural History Museum, whence it had just arrived in a bottle of preserving alcohol from the Soviet Union. I had gone there at the kind invitation of the senior scientific officer, Gordon Howes, to learn something of the habits of the giant European catfish; and to delve into the legends associated with this mysterious and disgusting freshwater monster. It is difficult, however, not to be sidetracked when one is surrounded by the world's greatest collection of preserved fish, some of which date back 300 years and more. It was not long before I was peering over Howes' shoulder into the dusty cabinets on whose shelves the fishes of the world gleam in their multitudes, heads down or standing on their tails in their jars of fluid. I asked him about the Goliath Tigerfish. I had caught the ordinary tigerfish on the Zambesi and in Lake Kariba, and had heard tales of a gigantic cousin, of unparalleled fierceness, to be found somewhere in the darkest jungle or densest bush of Central Africa. Had Mr Howes heard of it? He smiled gently, and produced a jar the size of a coalscuttle in which a mighty fish was suspended, jaws agape, vicious teeth glinting. It was enough to fire visions of tangling with the beast in some unexplored tributary of the Upper Congo. Among other river predators, Howes showed me an Amazonian fish which made the piranha look no more threatening than Charlie Bubbles, our lethargic goldfish. He scooped it from its bottle to display its oral weaponry. From its lower jaw rose two fangs so long that Nature had provided holes through the top of its snout to contain them. This was Hydrolocus, the wolf-fish, a creature of nightmares. We went to Howes' office. I glimpsed a dissected cod under a microscope. On another table was a minute butterfly fish from Indonesia, collected by Mungo Park. Before giving me a friendly, fishy handshake, Howes presented me with a scientific paper arguing that rainbow trout had been wrongly classified. I reeled out into the spring sunshine, exhilarated by the unusual experience of acquiring learning. A few weeks ago the BBC showed a sobering film - in which Howes appeared - on the devastating impact of spending restrictions on the Natural History Museum's research programme. I cannot argue that the possession of 750,000 dead fish in bottles is of much practical use to anyone. But the collection does represent knowledge, and it reflects to the nation's credit. It, and those who tend it, deserve honour and protection.</p>

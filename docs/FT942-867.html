			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news In the aftermath of the Fed's attempt to defend the dollar against the yen last week, the US and Japan will be the key economic focus this week. A clutch of Japanese statistics should indicate that Japan's recession has bottomed out, and there are mixed signs of recovery. Tuesday: Analysts expect today's data will show that Japanese unemployment rose to 2.9 per cent in May, from 2.8 per cent in April, while May's retail sales were 2.9 per cent lower than May last year. In the UK, the Treasury's revised economic forecast is expected to point to an increasingly healthy recovery. Predictions for 1994 gross domestic product growth are likely to be up from the earlier figure of 2.5 per cent, while inflation forecasts are likely to be down from 3.25 per cent. Thursday: A spate of US economic indicators today and tomorrow are expected to show the recovery remains strong but spending has slowed slightly. Today's data is likely to show a small rise in factory orders in May, while Friday's purchasing managers' index is likely to reflect the healthy state of the manufacturing sector.</p>

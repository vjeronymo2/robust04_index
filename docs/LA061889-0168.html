			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: CHECK OUT FINE PRINT ON RATES BEFORE CHECKING IN  </P> <P> It's summer touring season again and time to review the discounts and deals  being offered by major chain and franchise hotel and motel companies.  </P> <P> First some caveats.  </P> <P> Remember that discounts are just marketing tools to lure mature travelers.  </P> <P> Things can change quickly in the lodging industry. Offers can be altered or  even dropped after a change in management.  </P> <P> More frequently, individual hotels have the right to suspend senior or other  discounts for special events, or just limit the number of discounted rooms they  offer during peak seasons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Key Phrases  </P> <P> It's important to check such key phrases as "good only at participating  properties" or "subject to space availability" or "not offered on minimum-rate  rooms."  </P> <P> Although the industry is getting much better at eliminating these exclusions  from their senior rate programs, they still pop up.  </P> <P> When making reservations, check to make sure that the discount is in effect  during your stay; double-check before you check in at the accommodation.  </P> <P> And make sure that the senior discount is the lowest rate available.  Frequently, hotels and motels offer weekend specials that could include lower  rates or meals, that are not known to the national reservation service. Often,  these kinds of specials are a better buy than a regular room at a senior  discount.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proof of Age  </P> <P> Be sure to have a membership card for AARP, Mature Outlook or another  recognized organization, plus a driver's license, passport or other proof of  age. Social Security cards don't help.  </P> <P> Discounts of 10% are common. Many "Mobil Travel Guide" accommodations provide  them, as does the American Automobile Assn. But don't expect to double your 10%  discount if you belong to both AAA and AARP.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Offerings  </P> <P> Here's a rundown on major hotel discounts:  </P> <P> Best Western: More than 1,300 independently owned franchise properties, 10% to  those 55 or older or to members of AARP.

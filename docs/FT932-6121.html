			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Tradition gives way to the age of the nerd - Tycoons once dressed to fit their image, says Brenda Polan. But things are changing WHISPER IT low in Jermyn Street and Savile Row but we are entering the age of the nerd. As those long-promised green shoots of economic growth finally peep through, it is becoming clear that the new wealth-makers will be pallid, round-shouldered, and wear huggy jumpers and anoraks. According to several surveys, it is the computer whizzes, the developers of ware both hard and soft, who are leading the independent sector out of economic stagnation and decline. Tomorrow's tycoons are the lads in wire-framed glasses to whom a keyboard is as familiar as a dashboard and a mouse as necessary as a gear stick. Once, getting (and holding) great wealth demanded a military bent. Later, it demanded the technical inventiveness and organisational skills of the manufacturer. More recently, it called for an understanding of money as a commodity in its own right - the iron nerve of the risk-taker and asset-stripper, the political cunning and ruthless manipulativeness of the media mogul, or an instinctual identification with the yearnings of the mass market. By and large, each generation of new rich has expressed its origins in its style. The self-made earl or the ennobled and empalaced general (whether Percy, Churchill or Wellesley) did not (as Northumberland, Marlborough or Wellington) become any less dashingly military in manner or dress. The Victorian industrialist dressed himself to match his blackened smokestacks and his sober self-importance. According to the costume historian's tongue-in-cheek explanation, toilers in the City of London espoused the pin stripe at the end of the last century because its splendid orderliness and comforting colour scheme reminded them of the columns in their ledgers. Most of this century's newly rich, however humble their origins or unorthodox their rise, have made haste to conform. They may well, as did Lords Hanson and White when they were misters on the make, cut a swathe through the female population of Hollywood clad in slightly raffish versions of the pinstripe double-breasted suit, but it was undeniably just that. Their contemporaries acquired a Savile Row tailor just as fast. Even the international operators - the antipodeans, colonials, foreigners and expatriates such as Garfield Weston, Rupert Murdoch, Sir James Goldsmith, Kerry Packer, Mohamed Fayed, the Barclay twins, Conrad Black and George Soros - slip into that Square Mile uniform when they need to concentrate or borrow. The change began with the post-war, baby-boom tycoons whose wealth was based on servicing the needs, desires and fashion fads of their own large, affluent and greedy generation: men like Richard Branson, Chris Blackwell, Alan Sugar, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Christopher Moran, Andrew Cohen, David Sullivan, John Madejski, Peter Waterman, Michael Green, Brian Reynolds, Cameron Mackintosh and Lawrie Lewis. These, if they can be coerced out of jeans and a loud sweater, tend to prefer the off-the-peg suit in lighter fabrics and paler shades, usually with an Italian label and wide trouser legs. They are partial to flamboyant waistcoats. They sometimes wear grey shoes. Ties bother them, as do razors. In their hearts, they appear to yearn for the in-your-face freedom of their contemporaries, the pop-star tycoons like Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Dave Stewart and Elton John. What, they seem to ask, is the use of being rich if you cannot be scruffy? What is the point of being a 1960s' person if you give in to the wrinklies? Those who do give in have a tendency to add a maverick element. Andreas Whittam-Smith, editor and co-founder of The Independent newspaper, appears to have a passion for a certain satin-finish tie in shades of pastel pink and baby blue. This clashes horribly with his complexion, but he wears it with a pale grey suit or dark pinstripe every time his picture is taken. Sugar, wealthy founder of the Amstrad electronics empire, is rather like an ageing beauty who will not relinquish the fashions of youth and appears reluctant to discard his late-1970s' pink shirts with white button-down collar. The female tycoons, and there are a few, have had to write their own dress code. They had a little help from an American called John Molloy who, in the early 1980s, wrote a guide for ambitious women called Dress For Success. This took the male power-and-authority uniform and, basically, substituted a knee-length skirt, flesh-coloured tights and medium-heeled court shoes for trousers, dark socks and black shoes. Molloy also recommended an early Thatcher-style pussy-cat bow instead of an old school tie. Fashion reshaped the basic formula, but only a little. Simone Mirman of Sock Shop and countless ambitious brokers, bankers, estate agents and niche retailers played the game; Anita Roddick of Body Shop and Debbie Moore of Pineapple did not, creating their own relaxed styles of dress more in keeping with their business philosophies. The latest crop of men and women to watch - the under-40s who are energetic and driven enough to form a recovery vanguard - are, for the most part, a conventionally tidy-looking lot, their hand-out photographs revealing clear eyes, straight ties and cheap haircuts. Not all of them are unredeemably nerdish. Shami Ahmed of Joe Bloggs Jeans; Tim Hely Hutchinson of Headline Publishing; Archie Norman of Asda; Neil MacKinnon of Citibank; Julian Richer of Richer Sounds; Pippa Wicks of Courtaulds; Kathleen O'Donovan of BTR; Nicola Horlick of Morgan Grenfell; Robert Hanson and Tim Vestey, both of the family firms  - all tend towards relaxed informality or, at least, a loosened-up version of the conventional uniform. But the boys who cannot fail, surely, are the keyboard kings in the Brains specs, the unpressed chinos and the machine-washed jumpers. Whether wealth will ever seduce them into expensive clothes and a good barber is doubtful. Economic recovery might be in sight but many things have changed irrevocably: the cultural dominance of bankers within the business world, and the idea that they must be propitiated by adoption of their uniform, are just two of them.</p>

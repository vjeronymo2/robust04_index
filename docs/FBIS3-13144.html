This was stated by the Federal Minister for Interior, Lt Gen  (Retd) Naseerllah Babar. He said there was a link between the  RAW and Khad which seem to jointly undertake terrorist  operations against Pakistan.    He was responding to a question from this correspondent on  the possibilities of the involvement of the Israeli agency  Mossad operating in Afghanistan.    The Minister said since most of the former communists  trained  by KGB, the Russian intelligence agency, had now shifted to  India, there was a strong possibility that the Indian and Afghan  Intelligence agencies were cooperating.    The Minister said Mossad operating in Afghanistan was a bit  too far-fetched an idea." To another question the Minister said  the government has put the suspected Afghans living in Peshawar  under surveillance. He agreed that most of the former  communists who have acquired residence in Peshawar were trained  by the KGB.    The government, he said, had so far not received reports on  the hijacking of the school bus from the intelligence agencies.  However, he said that during his recent visit to Peshawar he was  told about the antecedents of one of the hijackers who he said  belonged to Khad. He said his photo was shown to him with other  Khad agents. This hijacker he said belonged to Parwan province  in Afghanistan.    The government the Minister said was not trying to jump to  any conclusion on the hijacking incidence and wanted to give  full time to the agencies to investigate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, Feb 12 (TANJUG) -- Delegations of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) and the Republic of  Croatia opened talks here on Saturday about the gradual  normalization of their relations relying on a declaration signed  in Geneva in January.    The delegations are headed by F.R.Y. Vice-Premier Zeljko  Simic and Croatian Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Mate Granic.    The closed-door talks in the Croatian Foreign Ministry  concentrate on the opening of an F.R.Y. office in Zagreb and a  Croatian office in Belgrade, a variety of humanitarian  questions, and the establishment of transport and  telecommunication links.    Having signed the Geneva declaration in mid-January, the  F.R.Y. and Croatia reasserted readiness for gradual  normalization of their relations broken in 1991 when Croatia  forcibly seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation.    On January 27 in Geneva, the F.R.Y. and Croatian Government  delegations agreed to set up joint commissions to deal with the  question of missing persons, refugees, and humanitarian matters.  The commission held its first meeting in Zagreb on Saturday.    The Yugoslav delegation, as was announced, would be received  by Croatian president on Saturday evening.    It was learnt unofficially that on February 14, Mate Granic  should arrive for talks in Belgrade, while one day later the  offices of the F.R.Y. and Croatia would be opened in Zagreb and  Belgrade, respectively.    F.R.Y. Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated, after  the  declaration on the normalization of relations was signed, that  this document does not prejudice the question of the final  status of the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK).    The RSK was formed in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated  parts of Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession  from ex- Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the status of  Serbs to that of a national minority. In March, 1992, the RSK  was declared "a United Nations Protected Area" (UNPA). It will  maintain this status until the final relevant political solution  is found.</p>

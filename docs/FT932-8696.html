			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour angered by Welsh deal MR DAVID HUNT, Welsh secretary, angered the Labour benches in the Commons yesterday by confirming the existence of a written agreement between the government and Welsh nationalist MPs over the membership of the European Community's proposed committee of the regions. He gave no further details of the deal. But Mr Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary, said membership of the committee - to be established under the terms of the Maastricht treaty  - should be determined at local government level.</p>

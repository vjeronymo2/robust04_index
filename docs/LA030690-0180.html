			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> REDGRAVES TO STAGE 'SISTERS'  </P> <P> The theatrical Redgraves are planning an on-stage family get-together in  Chekhov's "Three Sisters," with Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave joining Vanessa's  daughter, Joely Richardson, in the title roles.  </P> <P> The two sisters, Vanessa and Lynn, have never performed together publicly,  Thelma Holt, the play's producer, said today.  </P> <P> Richardson, 24, appeared in the film "Wetherby" with her mother. Lynn, who  turns 47 on Thursday, has been living in Los Angeles for many years and has not  worked on the British stage since 1973.  </P> <P> "I always felt that to justify spending so long away it would have to be  something very special for me to return," said Lynn, who received an Academy  Award nomination for her role in the 1966 film "Georgy Girl."  </P> <P> Vanessa, 53, received an Oscar for the 1977 film "Julia."  </P></p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Noble Lowndes under Imro investigation NOBLE LOWNDES, the employee benefits agency, is under investigation by the Investment Management and Regulatory Organisation, according to the acquisition document circulated by Sedgwick Group yesterday. It says that last year Noble Lowndes identified possible breaches of Imro rules on 'suitability and switching' by two of the consultants in its personal financial services divi-sion. Imro launched a formal investigation in April this year to examine these breaches, to study the effectiveness of compliance systems and controls within the company and to consider the payment of compensation to investors who may have suffered loss. Mr Stuart Tarrant, group finance director, said Sedgwick was fully aware of the investigation, which he expected to take several more months to complete. Mr Tarrant said TSB had agreed as part of the sale of Noble Lowndes to provide an indemnity against any disciplinary proceedings that result. The acquisition document says Noble Lowndes has already implemented and is in the process of implementing further significant changes in its systems and procedures to remedy compliance weaknesses.</p>

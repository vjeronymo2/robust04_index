			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said Ukraine was  bearing the whole brunt of problems caused by the Chernobyl  disaster, "although the country which planted the Chernobyl bomb  under Ukraine no longer exists."    Ukraine will be unable to solve those problems without the  world community's assistance, Kravchuk said on Tuesday at a  rally marking the eighth anniversary of the tragedy.    "We can understand those who demand that the Chernobyl  Nuclear Power Plant be closed down immediately," he said, adding  that Ukraine would need international assistance in that too.  But Ukraine "cannot do without" nuclear plants, he told the  rally, held outside the fire station whose personnel fought the  fire at the Chernobyl plant on 26 April 1986.    Also on Tuesday, local activists of the international  Greenpeace erected a symbolic earth mound to commemorate the  Chernobyl victims.    Last year Ukraine's nuclear plants generated 33 pct (the  Chernobyl plant 7 pct) of the country's electricity.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: HIGH FINANCE AND HIGHER EDUCATION  </P> <P> College tuitions are going through the roof. Latest reports indicate it now  costs $21,000 to send your loved one for a year to any respectable institution  in the United States.  </P> <P> It is not the end of high tuition raises but rather the beginning.  </P> <P> Most educational experts predict that by 1995 the tariff for an average  150-pound male student or a 110-pound female student will be $1 million a year,  not counting admission to basketball games. Who will be the lucky students?  Young people whose parents have made a killing in Time-Life-Warner Brothers  stock or who own six or seven skyscrapers in a rezoned Central Park.  </P> <P> I asked Meyer Daniloff, a Regis Professor of Matriculation at Ivy League  Normal, why tuitions were rising so fast. He replied, "All the universities in  America are looking for a better class of student, and the only way we can get  it is to raise the price of admission.We're tired of the grungy, unkempt, badly  mannered student of the past, and the only way to get rid of them is to raise  the rates. As the midget who sat on J.P. Morgan's lap once said, 'If you have  to ask what college costs, then you can't afford it.' "  </P> <P> "Won't schools become boring if only rich kids can attend them?"  </P> <P> "They will at first, but pretty soon the students will get used to being with  their own kind, and you will have a country club atmosphere that most schools  at the moment seem to lack."  </P> <P> "Is there any way that middle-class students can find the wherewithal to attend  college?"  </P> <P> "Of course. You don't think our society would keep them out just because they  can't afford to go?"  </P> <P> "How can they do it?"  </P> <P> "They can buy a state lottery ticket, and if they win the lucky jackpot they  can go to any school of their choice. But they have to pick all eight numbers  before the registrar will accept them."  </P> <P> He continued, "The main advantage to the schools raising tuition is that they  get a fat-cat student who will eventually give to the alumni fund. The downside  is that if it gets too expensive to go to college, fathers and mothers will not  know what to do with their offspring when they reach 18 years of age. Parents  in the past could get rid of their children without looking cruel by sending  them to college. Now the children will have every excuse to stay in the house  forever."  </P> <P> I said, "Without intending to, the colleges are making life miserable for the  parents of middle- and lower-class kids."  </P> <P> "It's a difficult problem, but there is nothing you can do about it. There was  always the fear that America would eventually price itself out of higher  education. This is as good a time as ever."  </P> <P> "Will the students who pay the top-of-the-line fee get a better education?"  </P> <P> "I don't see why they should. We're not saying all parents have to come up with  the tuition or else. All we're saying is that if a student chooses to become an  airline pilot for a drug cartel just because he can't afford school we are not  to blame."  </P> <P> "Will you guarantee tuition is not going to rise more in just a few years?"  </P> <P> "When it comes to education, nobody can predict the future. But I'll bet Pete  Rose anything that it isn't going to go down."  </P></p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Approval gained for tunnel trippers The Anglo-French inter-governmental commission has approved limited passenger services through the Channel tunnel. The commission has given permission for invitation-only passenger rail operations, the final stage of preparation for running regular public services. Trains will be run at less than full load with increasing frequency, under the supervision of the commission, which must satisfy itself on safety. Trains will carry invited passengers and their cars between the Cheriton terminal at Folkestone and the Sangatte terminal near Calais. Eurotunnel shareholders, travel agents, journalists and politicians will be among the first groups invited. The company hopes to launch a regular service in October. The commission's decision also covers high-speed Eurostar passenger trains between London, Paris and Brussels.</p>

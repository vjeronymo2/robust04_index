			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, "envoy of the </F> South Yemeni president to the United Nations," by Hanan al-Badri  in Washington; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Badri] What steps will  the southern leadership take if Sanaa backtracks on its  acceptance of the cease-fire?    [Al-Dali] We have in our hands the constitutional and legal  right to defend ourselves against any attack or invasion by the  Sanaa authorities. And we -- the victims of aggression -- are  internationally entitled to seek assistance from any friendly or  fraternal state. So in accordance with international law, we  are entitled to seek foreign assistance.    [Al-Badri] Will the confrontation escalate if Sanaa does not  comply fully with international law? And we ask: Why have you  not over the past two weeks used Scud missiles, as you have a  stockpile of them? Is it because you have been subjected to  pressures urging you to comply with the diplomatic efforts  seeking to achieve the aim of securing recognition for the south?    [Al-Dali] I would like to stress that we support the policy  of nonescalation. Because we indeed wish to end this conflict.  But our adherence to the policy of nonescalation does not at all  mean that we are unable to retaliate. If the situation  escalates today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow, we will reply  powerfully. As for the use of the Scud batteries, our military  commanders should be asked about it. They know what should be  done in these conditions. At any rate, we can, of course,  resort to using this type of missiles to protect civilians from  air raids.    [Al-Badri] But what about the recognition issue, which is  one of the most important issues Sanaa is concerned about?    [Al-Dali] I believe that international recognition of Aden  is proceeding unhindered. It will most certainly take place.  And we feel that the Sanaa rulers have begun to lose control of  the situation and express -- in word and deed -- the state of  alarm and confusion they are experiencing.    [Al-Badri] We heard that you have obtained strong promises  from the permanent member states of the Security Council of  their move toward granting recognition.    [Al-Dali] As I said, recognition of Aden is most certainly  on the way. Very soon fraternal states and then friendly  states, first and foremost the permanent member states of the  Security Council, will announce their recognition of Aden as an  independent political entity, as was the situation in the past.    [Al-Badri] Did you raise with the Americans and the United  Nations the issue of sending international forces to protect  civilians in the south and observe the cease-fire?    [Al-Dali] I personally did not raise that matter, nor was I  assigned to do so. But if the situation becomes critical, we  will demand that. We rely in an action like that on the  foundations of international legitimacy and the UN Charter.  [passage omitted]</p>

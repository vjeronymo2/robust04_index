			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Italian party picks new hero to clean its stables ITALY'S Christian Democrat (DC) leadership yesterday elected Mr Mino Martinazzoli, a former defence minister, as secretary-general, entrusting him with the task of revitalising a discredited and divided party . Mr Martinazzoli, 61, is on the so-called left of the party and is one of the few senior figures untainted by the series of corruption scandals and allegations of misuse of power. He comes from Brescia in the north, where the party has suffered at the hands of the populist Lombard League. Recent local elections in Mantua showed DC support had been almost halved within a year, accelerating the tendency for the party's strength to be reduced to Rome and further south, where traditional patronage politics still hold sway, He takes over from Mr Arnaldo Forlani, who was widely blamed for a badly misjudged campaign in the April general elections when the DC vote fell to 29 per cent - below 30 per cent for the first time. Mr Forlani offered to step down in the immediate aftermath of the elections, and resigned formally two months later. But he was persuaded to stay on while the party attempted to find a successor. Mr Martinazzoli's main problem is retaining the loyalty of Mr Mario Segni, the reformist politician who has gathered considerable support inside and outside the party in a movement to reform Italy's institutions via referendums. On Saturday at a rally in Rome, Mr Segni made clear that his ideas about changing the system squared little with those of the mainstream Christian Democrats. Mr Martinazzoli is believed to have offered Mr Segni the number two job in the party and appears anxious not to lose him since he is the DC's most attractive electoral card. He is also expected to use the existence of Mr Segni's reformist movement to get rid of the party's old guard. The latter, exemplified by men like Mr Forlani and Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister, have been keeping a low profile. But it is far from clear whether they realise the extent to which the rules of the political game have changed. Italy faces a four-hour general strike today in protest against proposed welfare cuts in the 1993 budget. The strike is expected to cause substantial transport disruption but essential services for health and the public utilities will be working.</p>

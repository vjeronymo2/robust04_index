			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "CPI-M Politburo Flays PV, Cong"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 1: The politburo of the Communist  Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) on Saturday criticised the Prime  Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the ruling Congress party  for rejecting the Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh's  resignation and for admitting the Janata Dal leader, Mr Ajit  Singh, and a group of parliamentarians into the party.    In a statement issued here, the politburo denounced the  attitude of the Congress government and the Prime Minister,  towards the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the  multi-crore securities scam. The ruling party has come out  "brazenly in defence of all those indicted by the JPC as being  accountable in the worst corruption scandal since independence."  The Prime Minister's action in rejecting the resignation of Dr  Singh has struck a blow at the concept of a minister's  accountability for gross failure of his ministry to check such a  mindboggling swindle of public funds.    The statement also charged the Congress with "shamelessly"  defending the other ministers indicted by the JPC report such as  the Health and Family Welfare Minister, Mr Shankaranand, and the  Rural Development Minister, Mr Rameshwar Thakur. The Congress  spokesman, Mr V.N. Gadgil's criticism of the JPC's indictment of  the two ministers showed the utter contempt for the unanimous  report submitted by the JPC and for parliamentary democracy  itself. The swindling of public funds caused by the Narasimha  Rao government's policies could not be covered up by such  Congress machinations.    It said that the Congress has set another example of  "contempt of parliamentary democracy by admitting Ajit Singh and  a group of MPs [members of Parliament] into the party." The  Congress has made it a practice to make a mockery of the  anti-defection law in its pursuit to get a majority in the Lok  Sabha. The unprincipled and self-serving step of defection to  the Congress by Ajit Singh would also meet with the firm  disapproval of the people. The last that Mr Ajit Singh and the  others could have done was to resign their seats in Parliament  as they had been voted on an anti-Congress platform, it added.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Fund-raising campaign to save Fulham ground FULHAM football fans are today launching a fund-raising campaign to try to secure the club's future at its west London ground, which is owned by a company in receivership. Urgency is lent to the Fulham 2000 campaign by the fact that there are only 100 days to run on the club's lease of the Craven Cottage ground, which has been its home beside the river Thames since 1896. The ground is owned by a company called Vicenza Development. It was part of Cabra Estates, the quoted property company where provisional liquidators were appointed in November. Cabra owed more than Pounds 60m to banks and other creditors, with Royal Bank of Scotland as the lead bank. Royal Bank appointed acc-ountants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand as receivers at Vicenza. The bank has bought Chelsea Football Club's ground, another part of the Cabra estate, and granted Chelsea a 20-year lease with an option to buy. But the future of Fulham FC and the Craven Cottage site remains uncertain. Apart from the short time left on the lease, the result is still awaited of an inquiry into a planning application to redevelop the ground for flats. Cabra made the application but Fulham and Hammersmith council rejected it. The inquiry is understood to have been concluded in September, but no word has yet come from the Department of the Environment. Fulham 2000 says: 'With no planning permission having been granted, and no demand for any residential redevelopment, Fulham should be allowed to buy the ground at today's market value.' The campaign seems to assume it is owned by the Royal Bank, which it is not. The receivers say that the 'options are open'. With so much undecided, the campaign has set itself no monetary target, other than collecting as many Pounds 10 membership fees as possible. It hopes eventually to be able to contribute to a solution that would see the club stay at the ground with a partial redevelopment of the site to help add value for the bank.</p>

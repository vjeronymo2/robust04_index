			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUR CHAMPIONSHIPS IS QUEST OF WHELCHEL AT OFF-ROAD EVENT  </P> <P> When it comes to racing in the desert, off-road driver Jerry Whelchel of  Mission Viejo has a simple slogan: "I'll race whenever, wherever or whatever it  takes to win. This is how I make my living and I want to win them all."  </P> <P> Whelchel, 29, can win more titles than any driver in the 17-year history of the  SCORE Off-Road World Championships today when he competes on a man-made,  1.1-mile course at the Phoenix International Raceway.  </P> <P> Whelchel qualified in unlimited single-seat dune buggies, limited 1650cc  single-seat dune buggies, 1600cc Baja Bug and stock four-wheel drive trucks  Saturday before 2,000.  </P> <P> Roger Mears of Bakersfield and Frank Arciero of Laguna Niguel each have won  three events in a day. Mears accomplished the feat twice, in 1978 and 1982.  Arciero won three events in 1987.  </P> <P> Whelchel's top competition figures to be Robby Gordon, 21, of Orange, who  became the top qualifier in the two-wheel drive truck and 1650cc single-seat  dune buggy classes with his first-place finishes Saturday.  </P> <P> Gordon later announced that he would enter his 1650cc buggy in the unlimited  class, setting up a showdown with Whelchel for honors as the fastest driver on  the course, which is half pavement and half dirt.  </P> <P> Whelchel seemingly never left the track Saturday, jumping out of one vehicle  for Lloyd Sukut's Sage Council Racing team and into another for an eight-lap  race. The only events he failed to enter were the motorcycle and All-Terrain  Vehicle (ATV) classes. TOM HAMILTON  </P></p>

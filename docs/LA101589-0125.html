C. ;  </P> <P> SATELLITES CALLED KEY TO FIGHT ON FAMINE  </P> <P> Satellite-gathered data on weather, crops and environmental damage will be  crucial in avoiding world famine in the 21st Century, an Ohio lawmaker said in  urging support for U.S. Earth-observation programs. Rep. Tony P. Hall (D-Ohio)  said satellites "are basic tools for humanity in the search for solutions to  hunger." But according to a report, funding for the primary U.S. satellite  program, Landsat, is in doubt. Hall, chairman of the House Select Committee on  Hunger, said the study, "Satellite Technology and World Food Security," offers  "clear evidence that any loss of our satellite capability will directly affect  our ability to avert famine."  </P></p>

The meeting analysed the fulfilment of the presidential  decree to settle the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and also the  reasons why the implementation of several provisions of this  document is being dragged out. The participants of the meeting  mapped out agreed actions to ensure the practical reduction of  tension in the region.    In Filatov's opinion, the number of "sore spots" in Russia  was diminishing in spite of the difficult economic situation.  "The adoption of the new Russian Constitution," the head of the  Presidential Administration stressed, "has laid the foundation  for further social stabilisation in the country."    "The strength of a state," he added, "depends on its unity  and indivisibility, by concord among all the subjects of the  Federation making it up. Therefore, the work of every regional  leader should be assessed by what he has done to strengthen the  Russian statehood and to resolve regional problems on its basis."    The meeting noted with concern that the settlement of the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict was complicated by differing approaches  and a frequent desire "to grab all the pie".    Filatov told the meeting that President Yeltsin's address to  the Russian Federal Assembly (parliament), scheduled for  February 24, would contain a package of comprehensive measure to  strengthen the Russian state.</p>

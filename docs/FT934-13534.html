			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Arts: Mr and Mrs Nobody Pooter is the very model of John Major's diary in Private Eye. Here is a conventionally decent man recording everyday events in a slightly complacent way while not wholly understanding what is going on around him. Shaming admission: I had not read The Diary of a Nobody until I was doing my homework for this play. Everything that has been said in praise of the book, which began as a series of diaries in the late 19th century Punch, is absolutely right. The book is brilliant. The trouble with Mr and Mrs Nobody, the stage adaptation by Keith Waterhouse, is that it is Mrs Pooter's Diary as well as Mr's. As Waterhouse freely admits, he was at least as intrigued by Carrie Pooter as by her husband, Charles. So he devised the wife's diary to go alongside the original 'with the two journals fighting it out, so to speak, as they provide often conflicting accounts of the same event'. This is a fatal mistake. Private Eye has shown that you must choose one partner or the other. With Harold Wilson you chose Mary; with Margaret Thatcher it was obviously Denis, and with the Majors it is John. The result is a one-eyed view of the world, but amusing, ironical and often perceptive, just like Pooter. The Waterhouse version is not new. It has a six month run at the Lyric in Shaftesbury Avenue in 1986, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams. The 1993 revival stars no less than Patricia Routledge and Clive Swift. And the lovely Richmond Theatre was packed with expectation. Seldom has one heard so few laughs in a show designed to amuse. Not much pathos in the Pooter life either. The few good scenes are concentrated on songs around the piano: they could come from anywhere. Times, fashions change. Mr and Mrs Nobody may have worked in 1986. What Ms Routledge and Clive Swift are doing in a piece like this, directed by Matthew Francis of the excellent Greenwich Theatre, and produced by Duncan C Weldon who has an eye for the West End, in the year 1993 is beyond comprehension. So many talents; so few rewards. The production ought to be stopped in its tracks before there is a real disaster. Richmond Theatre until Saturday. (081) 940 0220</p>

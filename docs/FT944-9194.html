			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (1): Caution called for on the road ahead - After the shocks which followed the increase in US interest rates, bankers and traders are optimistic about the prospects for growth / A look at a hazardous year for the industry The financial hurricane which swept through the world's financial markets this year has rocked the rapidly growing derivatives industry. Falls in the dollar and world bond markets have triggered or coincided with news of multibillion derivatives-related losses by a string of large international companies. Yet, eight months after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates, bankers, traders and even corporate buyers are sanguine about the potential for continuing growth in derivatives products - in spite of estimated losses of more than Dollars 6bn by corporate users over the past 18 months, a flood of adverse publicity, two legal cases and the prospect of more litigation to come. And there is a general welcome for the increased emphasis on disclosure, transparency and accountability which has ensued in the wake of this year's troubles. The fall in the bond market, triggered by the increase in short term US interest rates, is the single economic factor to have done most damage, with heavily leveraged investors in over-the-counter products such as structured notes particularly badly hit. 'The last few years have seen a bull market for interest rates. People thought these low rates were going to continue and got things out of perspective. The froth built up,' points out Paul Spraos, publisher of Swaps Monitor, a specialist newsletter. Two buyers of interest rate products - Gibson Greetings and Procter &amp; Gamble  -have already sued Bankers Trust, which sold them the products. In the biggest case Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant, in October launched a suit seeking damages of more than Dollars 130m. Procter &amp; Gamble suffered losses from a complex interest-rate swap contract, under which it agreed with the bank to exchange payments in the future based on the interest rates prevailing at the time. The wider economic turmoil had a knock-on effect elsewhere, with increased volatility in equity markets and a rise in commodity prices, again upsetting the projections of buyers, investors and traders. And the unexpected decline in the dollar has also led to some losses. Publicity has also been attracted by losses such as those incurred by Metallgesellschaft, the German engineering company, which was hit by a fall in the oil price, especially during the last three months of 1993. An MG trading subsidiary was forced to unwind expensive hedges designed to protect it against a rise in price. Bankers are quick to point out that businesses which simply invested in cash markets have been hurt this year and they say that changes in accountancy practices and the increasing tendency of banks to mark the value of the assets to prevailing market values has exaggerated some of their trading losses. However, they accept that some of their business has been hit. Figures from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the industry body, show that the notional value of swaps and other over-the-counter (OTC) deals outstanding reached Dollars 8,475bn in 1993, an increase of 58.5 per cent over 1992. But following last year's surge in derivatives turnover, growth in the OTC market could slow this year. Although few figures are available Mr Spraos reports a sharp fall in the highly lucrative structured notes market, with activity running about a third of last year's level. Indeed, bankers are quick to concede that the appetite for structured notes has declined. One leading banker suggests the overall value of over-the-counter transactions could fall by more than 15 per cent this year. However, the story has been far from completely negative. It is widely accepted that the number of transactions could easily equal last year's figures, although the unit size of each individual transaction may fall. Economic volatility has increased interest in many categories of products, including the simpler less complex products traded on futures and options exchanges. Exchange traded volume rose sharply in the first six months of the year. The most impressive growth came from Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange (Tiffe), where in June monthly volumes broke through the 4m level for the first time, overall volume doubling compared with the same period last year. Europe's three largest exchanges saw volume increase by more than 40 per cent in the first half. Bankers are optimistic about sales of some categories of more complex products. This year has seen the launch of a number of funds which invest in OTC commodities products and other financial instruments whose value is tied to commodity prices. There is confidence in some quarters about the prospect for equity-based products, particularly in emerging markets where index-based products offer a solution to problems such as settlement and custody. This could be especially important in more primitive markets such as Russia. 'A structured solution might give you control of these risks,' says Barry Davies, head of equity derivatives at Morgan Stanley. A number of houses are also keen to promote products based on credit risks. 'People have less clear-cut views on the direction of interest rates, but a clearer view on the evolution of spreads. As a result, derivatives linked to spread have become popular among investors,' says Yves de Balmann, chairman of Bankers Trust International in London. More broadly though there is some confidence that the uproar over losses may leave some positive effects, especially if - as many in the industry now hope - the threat of tougher external regulation has receded. A series of reports by multilateral and governmental organisations as well as postmortems into the losses at individual companies, have served to focus attention on accountability and disclosure. A report by the G-30, a group of senior bank executives, published earlier this year - suggest the speed of the market's development has in some cases left behind less sophisticated end users, for example. 'The G-30 report (and a separate report by the US General Accounting Office) all spell the same thing to me. There needs to be accountability of senior management. Both client and investment bank have to be fully aware of what is going on in their organisation,' concludes Mr Davies. 'Boards have not always been aware of the magnitude of the risks they have been running. A long stretch of successes made people sloppy,' says Jean-Christian Cheysson, managing director of Credit Suisse Financial Products. Bankers have responded by emphasising the need for their clients to adopt effective risk management procedures and argue that there is now an emerging consensus among the industry, buyers and regulators about the need for better information flows and reporting, including a global standard for disclosure. In early October, JP Morgan took the unprecedented step of making a component of its 'black box' - the daily data on interest rates, including money markets, swaps, and government bonds, and other market statistics, and the methodologies it uses to measure them - available free of charge to anyone who wants them. By establishing a benchmark for risk management, through the launch of this Riskmetrics system, Morgan hopes that it can help improve the overall health of the market. There are also signs that the industry is making some progress in developing better ways of accounting for derivatives. Increasingly the focus for these efforts are the risks arising from adverse movements in the markets rather than the risk of default by counterparties in the over-the-counter market, so-called 'credit risks'. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association is working on new disclosure guidelines which would take these market risks into account, possibly by the adoption of the concept of value at risk, which estimates how much an investment portfolio can lose over time. 'I think we are making good progress,' concludes Mr Kurt Viermetz, vice-chairman of JP Morgan. 'Participants are learning in terms of transparency and statistics. But the learning curve is very steep for the whole market around the globe.'</p>

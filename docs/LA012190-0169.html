			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COAST COMMISSION DEADLOCKS ON PICKING CHIEF IN STRUGGLE OVER CONTROL OF PANEL  </P> <P> The California Coastal Commission has deadlocked on the choice of a new  chairman, with environmentalists and pro-development members at odds over who  should head the panel.  </P> <P> At a recent meeting in Marina del Rey, the commission split 6 to 6 between  Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, backed by environmentalists, and  David Malcolm, a Chula Vista city councilman aligned with pro-development  forces.  </P> <P> Commission spokesman Jack Liebster said the matter will be reconsidered at the  group's meeting next month in San Francisco.  </P> <P> David Hart, a Sierra Club lobbyist, said the leadership fight highlights the  struggle for control over direction of the 12-member commission, established to  protect the state's coastline.  </P> <P> Hart said the outcome of the race will be a clear indication of whether the  commission will be more oriented toward developers or will "continue . . . its  relatively good record of fairly applying the Coastal Act."  </P> <P> The Coastal Act of 1976 allowed local governments to regulate coastal  development by adopting new land-use plans and zoning ordinances. The  commission is responsible for approving the local plans.  </P> <P> Howard said she became a candidate only after Robert Franco of Del Rey Oaks, a  pro-environmental commissioner, was unable to win a majority of votes for the  chairmanship. "He didn't know if he could get the seventh vote and that's where  my name came in as an alternative," Howard said.  </P> <P> When asked to contrast herself and Malcolm, Howard said: "I am more of an  environmentalist and I guess that's really where the difference comes in.  Malcolm is probably more developmentally oriented than I am."  </P> <P> Malcolm, a real estate developer, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Under the administration of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., a liberal Democrat  with strong environmental leanings, the commission was dominated by  conservationists.  </P> <P> With the election of Gov. George Deukmejian in 1982, the balance of power  shifted. Deukmejian, who has called for the abolition of the commission,  appointed four new members who generally shared his view that land-use planning  is best left to local officials. In addition, Deukmejian reduced the agency's  budget and staff.  </P> <P> The Legislature's Democratic leaders helped win appointment for several  commissioners in the early 1980s who appeared to be more sympathetic to  developers than their predecessors.  </P> <P> Howard was appointed to the commission in 1987 by the Democratic-controlled  Senate Rules Committee after a lengthy search for an environmentalist who could  win Senate confirmation. The Rules Committee, Deukmejian and Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) can each appoint four commissioners.  </P> <P> In a surprise move last month, Howard told fellow commissioners that she was  resigning, citing personal problems involving the death of her husband and her  desire not to take on additional responsibilities.  </P> <P> Howard's husband of 34 years died last March from a self-inflicted gunshot  wound. At the time, Howard was recovering from a fractured pelvis she suffered  in a fall at her home.  </P> <P> But she changed her mind about leaving the commission, Howard said, after  learning that "it would take several months to have someone appointed to my  seat. I felt that was unfair to the commission, so I'm staying. . . . I am more  committed than ever to the commission."  </P></p>

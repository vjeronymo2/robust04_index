			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THEY JUST CAN'T FACE REALITY OF REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Our real estate group therapy class meets on Thursdays at Rebecca Milikowsky's  house. We discuss how terrible the market is and share with each other the pain  of living in a world where a house is no longer a ticket to instant wealth.  </P> <P> Janet Blankenship was the first to speak. "I spent all Saturday night baking  brownies, and on Sunday I put them out on the dining room table with hot apple  cider. Everybody who showed up ate the brownies, but not one person bit on the  house."  </P> <P> Ray Slattery said, "People don't buy homes in exchange for brownies the way  they did a couple of years ago. It's a buyer's market. Even chocolate eclairs  don't do it anymore."  </P> <P> Jodie Torkelson joined in, "We took out an advertisement in the Washington  Post, and the only response we got was from the Washington Times saying that  they would run it in bold type for half the price."  </P> <P> "The funniest thing happened to us," Herman Methfessel said. "A woman came to  the house and hammered a sign into the lawn that read For Sale. When I yelled  that the house was not for sale, she shouted back, 'You never know until the  fat lady sings.' I asked, 'What the hell does that mean?' And she said, 'Beats  me -- they taught us to say that in real estate school.' "  </P> <P> The conversation got a little dicey when Lila Crimson informed us that her  husband Matt and she had split, and there were very bitter feelings involved.  "If he had let me sell the house six months earlier we could have gotten  $500,000 for the place. What a Dummkopf! The reason I left him was he never  knew when to buy or when to sell or when to put out the garbage."  </P> <P> "Perhaps he didn't know that real estate prices would plummet."  </P> <P> Lila blurted out, "His girlfriend should have told him."  </P> <P> I tried to be helpful. "People who break up shouldn't get angry with each other  because the price of their house isn't what it used to be."  </P> <P> Lila asked, "Why is it that your home is worth a fortune when you're living  together, and it's not worth a Russian ruble when you're splitting up?"  </P> <P> "That's a good question," I said.  </P> <P> David Jaffe said to me, "You lied last year when you told everyone that your  home was worth $4 million."  </P> <P> I responded, "I didn't lie. Every toolshed in the neighborhood was worth $4  million."  </P> <P> Rebecca Milikowsky spoke up, "When it comes to real estate prices, people  should exaggerate as much as they can because it helps the entire community."  </P> <P> "I heard that Robbie and Tommy Gresinger couldn't sell their place, so they  turned it into a bed and breakfast business."  </P> <P> "They sound desperate."  </P> <P> "They told me that the bed and breakfast arrangement will guarantee them one  meal a day, which is the minimum that doctors say you need during a housing  slump."  </P> <P> Herman Methfessel said, "I think that the lesson from this meeting is, don't  sell your house for what it's worth -- sell it for whatever someone is prepared  to pay."  </P> <P> "But," protested Ray Slattery, "then you take all the greed out of real estate,  and greed is what the business is all about."  </P></p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Nuclear review will be delayed Differences between government departments have prevented ministers from announcing the terms for a review of the British nuclear industry. The government had previously indicated it would announce the terms this year, Michael Smith writes. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told the Commons yesterday that the government would announce the terms as soon as possible in the new year. Last March the government signalled in a white paper that it would bring forward the start of the review to this year. It was originally promised for 1994. Disagreements between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury have further delayed the terms of reference. The Treasury wants a thorough consideration of whether nuclear generation should be privatised but the DTI is far more cautious about the possibilities of selling off the industry.

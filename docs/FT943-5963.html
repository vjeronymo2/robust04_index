			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Observer: Wakey-wakey No sign of Des Wilson going gently into that good night. The veteran lobbyist is kissing farewell to PR giant Burson-Marsteller by launching one last campaign - to bring the UK into line with European clock-watching. Wilson is taking over as chief spin-doctor at BAA, owners of Heathrow airport et al, where, no doubt, he will be doing a lot of jet-setting. Is the daylight campaign thus no more than a clever ruse to ensure he doesn't have to get up at unearthly hours in order to make continental morning meetings?</p>

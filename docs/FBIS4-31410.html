			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zbigniew Wojciech Okonski, deputy minister </F> of foreign economic cooperation, by Krzysztof Krauss; place and  date not given: "Polish Trade with Russia; Different Time,  Different Reality"]    [Text] [Krauss] If our position on the Russian market  were the same today as it was on the Soviet market in 1990, the  value of the sale of Polish merchandise to Russia would amount  to more than $2 billion. However, it is a mere $700 million.    [Okonski] The population of the Soviet Union [SU] was almost  290 million people; the population of Russia is approximately  150 million. In line with official data, SU's imports in 1990  totalled $120 billion; Russia's imports in 1992 were  approximately $35 billion and, in 1993, dropped by another 27  percent. By limiting imports (including imports from Poland),  Russia, undergoing enormous economic difficulties, is trying to  protect its active balance of the turnover. It is trying to find  money to pay off its foreign debt, which is almost twice as  large as Poland's ($82 billion).    Until 1990, our trade was conducted in unreal  money--transfer  rubles. There was not much that could be bought for this  currency, and, if anything, it was only used in bilateral trade.  Trade was regulated not so much through commercial contracts  but through orders issued by the "center." Prices were also  shaped administratively to a considerable degree. The  coincidence of all of these circumstances: The economic crisis  in Russia and the recession in our country, lasting until 1992,  new world-level prices, the necessity for real foreign currency  for purchases simply had to affect the trade in some way. In  relations with some other countries of the former Council for  Mutual Economic Assistance [CEMA], the breakdown was even deeper.    We must also remember what constituted most of our exports  to  SU. We sold mainly machines and devices. The demand for them has  in recent years considerably decreased in Russia.    [Krauss] There is no chance, then, to increase our exports  to Russia in the near future? The West has made a fierce attack  on the Russian market, with success, if we take a closer look at  the geographic structure of Russia's purchases. As recently as  1990, there was only one Western state among the five greatest  trade partners of Russia: Germany. The leading five also  included Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Now (in  1992), the first five positions are occupied by Germany, Italy,  China, the United States, and France. There is no state  belonging to the former CEMA.    [Okonski] Russia is a market of huge possibilities; it  attracts the attention of all exporters. With the potential of  this country, it is to be expected, in the general opinion of  experts, that the economic collapse will eventually be stopped,  and, in a few years, production growth will begin once again.  This will increase the demand for imports and increase export  capabilities. At that time, those partners of Russia who are  already in that market will have a chance to develop their  businesses quite significantly. It will be a chance that is  offered to a few markets in the world. Our ambition is not to  increase our exports to the Russian market. We would like to  see that the import savings do not affect the purchases made in  our country. This is our task in the near future.    In other words, we would like to maintain exports to Russia  on the same level we have so far; we would not like to lose what  we already have.    [Krauss] What can we offer Russia? In what areas can we be  competitive compared to other partners, who are also aspiring to  maintain and increase their presence on this market?    [Okonski] Traditionally, the goods that are well known on  the Russian market and that have a good name are food, highly  processed consumer goods such as household appliances, clothing,  fabric, shoes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and others. However,  this does not exhaust our export capabilities. It must be  remembered that we sent huge amounts of investment equipment to  the former Soviet market. Polish equipment was used in the  construction of hundreds of factories and other production  objects. A large number of them were built in Russia. What is  needed is service and spare parts. It will also be necessary to  modernize many of these: metallurgical enterprises,  sulfur-processing enterprises, mines with an element that is  very important in the extraction industry--the devices ensuring  industrial safety, food-processing enterprises, power plants,  etc. If we do not let others push us out, this may become the  springboard for developing investment exports once again.  Documents submitted to the Economic Committee of the Council of  Ministers, which has approved them, envision increasing exports  in this direction by 30 percent by 1997. If we are consistent,  it will be quite possible to put this plan into effect.    Regarding construction of new objects, the situation is more  complex. We may be competitive, but Russia must be able to  afford to embark on such investment undertakings. For the time  being, the scope of new investment is very limited. However,  there are announcements that are very promising to our  exporters. I am thinking primarily about the construction of a  new natural gas pipeline to Western Europe, part of which--over  500 kilometers--will pass through Poland. Several thousand  kilometers of the pipeline will go through Russia. This may be  a great "labor front" for us, an opportunity to obtain  attractive orders, just like the planned construction of super  highways. Polish road-construction machines are of an entirely  different technology generation in comparison with what we had  10 years ago. Many of them are already in use in East Asia  under American names, and they are proving themselves quite  well. We really are not worse than the machine suppliers from  Germany, Japan, and other states.    [Krauss] However, investment export is rarely conducted in  cash; it needs to be supported with credit. Where are the banks  in Poland that could afford to conduct operations involving such  huge capital?    [Okonski] There already are examples of forming consortia  for the service of very large exports contracts. For the time  being, they do not pertain to the Russian market. They concern  the Chinese Consortium of Polish banks, of course, with  guarantees of the Bank of China--it opened a credit line of  approximately $400 million. However, Russia is currently a  particularly high risk market, and, for the time being, this  limits the possibility of employing such solutions and also of  employing in Russia the resources of the Exports Credits  Insurance Corporation (insurance on the political risk,  catastrophes, and other difficult-to-predict events), which has  been well capitalized recently.    [Krauss] The recently announced report of the Central  Planning Administration, entitled "The Economic Situation of  Poland in 1993 Compared to Other Countries," stresses, among  other things, that one of the unsatisfactory results of foreign  trade in the countries of our region is the weakness of  "systemic and institutional support of exports."    [Okonski] We are trying to support the exports to the  difficult Russian market. We have submitted to the Russian  party a proposal of signing long-term commercial contracts  concerning merchandise that is important to both states from a  strategic standpoint: raw materials for Poland (oil, natural  gas, metals), and for Russia pharmaceuticals, food, and  equipment for its key investments. We have already received  verbal support and are now awaiting a reply. A "governmental"  instrument is also annual commercial protocols that ensure the  maintenance of the minimum level of turnover in the main groups  of commodities (such a protocol concerning 1992 proved itself;  now we want to conclude appropriate protocols for 1994 and  1995), a commercial protocol on the exchange of special  equipment (spare parts for military equipment, which both armies  will need for a long time--totaling tens of millions of U.S.  dollars), and an agreement on military and technological  cooperation.    Cooperation in the armament industries is not at all a  closed  chapter. We witnessed a commercialization of the best  technologies, so the cooperation of experts of special  industries may be very useful. They might cooperate in the area  of modernization of our armies and in exporting equipment to  third markets. Another area of this cooperation might include  the adjustment of production capacities in these industries,  which are too high, to civilian needs.    [Krauss] You failed to include the settlement of old debts  on the list of government activities.    [Okonski] This will not happen overnight. It is a very  complex issue, and we should leave it to specialists. The past  cannot block our present relations. We are concentrating  primarily on what can be done to increase the exchange, to  increase its extent and intensity. I have discussed government  initiatives that are supposed to make it easier for exporters to  get access to the Russian market. However, the administration  also wants to support the activities of "economic entities" and  their associations (economic chambers, business clubs, regional  associations, and others), activities that are supposed to help  those companies remain on the Russian market. For example, this  year our ministry has $10 million to finance various promotional  initiatives: participation in exhibitions and fairs, economic  missions, seminars. However, at least half of the money needed  for these activities must be paid by the companies themselves.  We merely partially subsidize such initiatives--if they are  reasonable and economically well-founded. Our offices of  commercial advisers are also at the disposal of entrepreneurs:  They provide information, contacts, etc.    [Krauss] And the effect of these activities is a surplus in  the economic turnover with Russia?    [Okonski] We are not counting on a surplus, even though it  would be good to decrease the present deficit, which amounts to  approximately $600-700 million a year. What is important is  that Russia can supply us with many fundamental materials (oil,  natural gas, etc.) at competitive prices and on favorable terms.  Even though we do not want to recreate the former full  dependence, commercial criteria must be taken into account.    We would like to cover essential expenditures by means of  our  exports to a maximum degree. The limit, however, would be  profitability of exports. Another factor that encourages  seeking markets for our goods in Russia is that exports increase  the number of workplaces, which is quite significant for a  country with almost 3 million unemployed people. Even if we do  not achieve any surpluses of foreign currencies in our trade  with Russia, the employment effect is certainly of some  economic-social importance.    [Krauss] Thank you for the interview.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Commentary" by Li Changjiu (2621 7022 0036): </F> "Broad Prospects for Economic Cooperation between China and  Western Europe"]    [Text] In early April, Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho,  French Prime Minister Edward Balladur, and Portuguese Prime  Minister Cavaco Silva arrived on different occasions in Beijing  for formal visits. The media pointed out that "China fever" is  raging again in West European countries.    The PRC has experienced some twists and turns in its  relations with some West European countries in the 40-odd years  following its founding, though on the whole bilateral relations  with Western Europe have developed continuously. In recent  years, there has been a marked increase in visits between  Chinese and West European state leaders, key officials, and  entrepreneurs, and traditional friendly cooperation is being  restored and developed, especially in trade and economic  cooperation, where the trend has been one of accelerated  development. Both Chinese and West European leaders and  entrepreneurs see many favorable conditions for developing  bilateral relations and expanding economic cooperation and trade.    First, China and Western Europe share the same or similar  views on many key international issues and have a good basis for  cooperation.    China has consistently supported the integration,  cooperation, and development of West European countries, which  have supported China's reform and opening up and its effort to  integrate its economy with the world economy. In mid-March this  year, the GATT China Working Unit held its 16th meeting in  Geneva to continue scrutinizing the issue of restoring China's  GATT signatory status. EC representatives reiterated that they  want to conclude the work of the unit swiftly so that China can  resume its GATT's signatory status as soon as possible. French  Prime Minister Balladur said during his talks with the Chinese  premier that France supported the restoration of China's  signatory status and allowing China to be a founding member of  the World Trade Organization.    China has much common ground with West European countries in  safeguarding world peace and promoting world economic  development, which is a good basis for developing bilateral ties  and expanding trade ties and cooperation.    Second, there is strong complementary economic and trade  cooperation between China and West European countries.    West European countries are stronger in capital, technology,  and equipment, while China, in its pursuit of modernization,  requires huge amounts of capital, technology, and equipment and  is a potentially enormous market. The achievements scored by  Germany's Chancellor Kohl during his China visit in mid-November  last year have caught the attention of West European political  and business sectors. During Kohl's visit, China and Germany  signed 7 billion German marks of contracts and letters of intent  in a wide range of sectors such as steel, transport, energy,  chemicals, machinery, electronics, telecommunications, and  environmental protection; over 3 billion marks were contracts.    French industry and the foreign trade ministry officially  unveiled this February "France's new Asia policy," its general  spirit "firmly shifting toward Asia," and its direction of  expansion being the East Asian and South East Asian counties,  with China as its main target. Prime Minister Balladur said in  talks with Premier Li Peng that there was great room for further  cooperation between France and China. Longuet, the French  minister of posts, telecommunications, and foreign trade, will  later head a delegation visiting China to promote trade ties and  economic cooperation with China.    Statistics from Finnish customs show that trade with China  jumped from 341 million markkas in 1992 to 2.935 markkas in  1993, with China Finland's largest trading partner among the  developing countries. Finland has a great deal of experience in  forestry, logging, and environmental protection. There are many  opportunities for cooperation in these areas.    Third, China has great potential for trade and economic  cooperation with West European countries.    Last year, Sino-Japanese trade hit $37.8 billion, 32 times  the trade value recorded in 1972 when the two countries  normalized their relations. Up to last September, Japan had  invested $5.17 billion, one-third after 1992. Sino-U.S. trade  last year amounted to $27.65 billion, 10.3 times the amount in  1979 when China established diplomatic relations with the United  States. By the end of last year, the United States had begun  12,000 investment projects in China, worth $10.6 billion in  agreed capital investment. Over 6,700 of these projects,  commanding $6.8 billion in agreed capital investment, started  only last year. Despite the high volume, there is still much  room for growth in trade between China and Japan and the United  States.    The markets, investments, and export scale of the 12 EC  nations greatly exceed that of the United States and Japan.  China's trade with the EC in the first quarter of this year  already exceeds its trade with the United States. The EC has  become China's third largest trading partner. The EC has very  great potential for trade and economic cooperation with China.    There are broad prospects for trade and economic cooperation  between China and West European countries. Cotti, chief of the  Swiss Foreign Affairs Department, said at the annual convention  of the Swiss-China Economic Society in Zurich this February that  China's economy had become an important part of the world  economy, "Chinese shareholders" were on the move, and the rapid  rise of China's economy provided "enormous development  opportunities for Swiss business." When talking with Chinese  premier, Finnish Prime Minister Aho said that since economic  growth in Europe is slow, Finland would like to strengthen  economic cooperation with China. Equal, complementary, and  mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade between China  and the West European countries helps economic and trade  development in both China and the West European countries, but  also global peace, stability, and development.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Finance Minister Crispiniano Sandoval  said the evidence clearly shows that the entrepreneurial state  is a failure, and public companies, most of which operate with  deficits and provide poor services to the community, must be  transferred to private hands. Political interests should not be  a major factor in the issue of privatizations. The most  important concern should be the national reality and the need to  reform the state, the minister said. "If we want to reform and  reduce the state, we must privatize public companies," Sandoval  stressed.    "Here, the question is one of structure or change of  structures. No matter what government is installed in the  country, it must proceed with the privatization program,"  Sandoval said. The issue, however, continues to face opposition  in the Senate. Sandoval said the privatization of public  companies is an economic, social, and political fact currently  in effect everywhere in the world because it has been recognized  that the entrepreneurial state is a failure. Consequently, it is  necessary to transfer inefficient state companies to the private  sector, Sandoval said.    The minister recalled that in the past, such entities were  put under state control because of a doctrine that practically  did not leave anything in private hands. Sandoval said the  Wasmosy administration has the clear purpose of implementing a  privatization program. "Political interests cannot prevail, for  the national reality is at stake. No matter the political  orientation, if we want to reduce and reform the state, we must  transfer public companies to private hands," the minister said.    Sandoval pointed out that all governments need to open up  their administration, adding that an indication of that openness  will be "getting rid of inefficient state companies." The  minister said some people wrongly think that privatizing means  losing state assets.    "Political interests should not prevail. The most important  thing is the decision to reduce the state, which must become  more efficient. The state must get rid of the burden of  maintaining public companies that more often than not operate in  the red and provide poor services, according to the evaluation  made by the community itself."    When reporters pointed out that politicians, particularly  from the Colorado Party, do not seem to want these companies  transferred to private hands because they are used for  patronage, Sandoval said he did not think privatizations will  have a political cost. "I think the electoral cost could be a  lot worse if backward economic structures are maintained,"  Sandoval added.    The minister said no political party will succeed unless it  can modernize the country's economic base to encourage private  investments. "We will get many more votes if we get the country  to sustain solid growth. This can be achieved only if we  eliminate factors creating backwardness and underdevelopment,  that is, inefficient companies. Maintaining these companies  will have a political cost in the long term," the finance  minister concluded.</p>

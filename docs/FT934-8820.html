			<p>931113 FT  13 NOV 93 / Businessmen cleared TWO businessmen who ran Therm-A-Stor, a double-glazing company, were both cleared of fraudulent trading charges after the Serious Fraud Office dropped its prosecution more than six weeks into the trial. It had alleged at Birmingham Crown Court that Mr John Morris, the company's founder, and Mr Anthony Bonnar, managing director, had defrauded customers and suppliers of more than Pounds 12m. The SFO said the trial had been abandoned after the emergence of unforeseen evidence.</p>

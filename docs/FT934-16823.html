			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Eastern Europe looks on without the old fears - No longer directly affected, countries of the former Soviet bloc see President Yeltsin as democracy's best hope THE tremors from power struggles in Moscow have traditionally radiated far beyond the confines of the Kremlin and been monitored with a mixture of hope and fear in east and central Europe. This time too, anxious spectators have been glued to live television and radio reports of events around the Moscow White House. But this time it is different. For the first time in five decades the peoples of former communist Europe have been watching as voyeurs rather than potential participants in a drama whose outcome could immediately threaten their own existence. For politicians, businessmen and ordinary citizens, the travails of the new Russia are looked on with understanding more than fear, and Russia is seen more as a long-term trade partner than a potential enemy. Yesterday, east and central European leaders joined those from the west in expressing support for Mr Boris Yeltsin, as democracy's best hope. Czech President Vaclav Havel said: 'It is a clash between those who seek democracy and those who have decided to fight under the red flag and at the cost of bloodshed and victims to reinstall the old order.' Ukraine strongly condemned the 'irresponsible and adventurist' Russian parliament and appealed to the Russian people to support the government and 'prevent the reversal of democratic reforms'. It was very different in August 1991. When the anti-Gorbachev forces set out to restore the essentials of the old Soviet empire, both the Soviet Union and the Soviet Communist party still existed. Thousands of Soviet troops remained in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia as well as former East Germany. At that point a victory for the old communist forces could still have led to a new chill in relations with the west and, perhaps, a new attempt to reassert some form of Soviet control over the former east bloc. Yet such a restoration would have been beyond the powers of those who filed out of the White House yesterday afternoon after failing to wrest power from President Yeltsin. Russia without the Baltic states, Belarus, and above all Ukraine and the central Asian states, is not the same as the Soviet Union. It is still huge and unwieldly, and needs a new constitutional arrangement to give a more flexible federal structure. But it is no longer the threatening Soviet bear. Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, yesterday declared his support for Mr Yeltsin. He went on to reassure Hungarians, who fought their own bloody revolt against Soviet rule in 1956, of his conviction that 'no problem would arise which would mean the victory of the forces of restoration or some such crisis which would affect the whole world'. At the same time, however, he said continuing instability in the east highlighted the need for Hungary and other former communist states in central Europe to be fully integrated into a wider European Community and Nato. The sight of fighting in the streets of Moscow also revived nervousness in Warsaw, where a week earlier voters had been sufficiently nonchalant about any communist danger from the east to support former communist-era parties at the general elections. 'What happens if the armed forces in the Kaliningrad region decide to march home to take part in the conflict? One of their possible routes lies through Poland,' one commentator worried aloud on Polish television on Sunday. But Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, the leader of the Democratic Left Alliance was quick to tell the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper that his party was not interested in supporting anyone 'who wants to rebuild Russia's imperial traditions'. 'We are for democracy, a free market and integration with Europe, and it is in this light that we will assess the changes in Russia' he said. In the same paper Mr Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Democratic Union mainstream Solidarity party, warned that the events in Moscow marked 'an enormous threat to European security'; in the circumstances, the west 'should not support just anyone who was able to restore order in Moscow but. . . the most important thing was that the democratic reforms in Russia should continue'.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Red tape relaxed for EC trading THE CUSTOMS &amp; Excise department will shortly issue details of simplified administrative arrangements for businesses trading with other EC countries. The guidance follows successful negotiations to reduce red tape associated with 'triangulation' - where goods or payments between a supplier in one EC country and a customer in another pass through an agent in a third. Under initial EC proposals, that agent would have had to be registered for VAT, account for tax and submit detailed statistical documents in every country with which it did business. But EC member states' finance ministers agreed in a meeting this week to the wording of a simplified directive that will reduce the burdens on business. UK Customs officials described the previous arrangements as a 'running sore', which had generated considerable anguish and complaints from British business. Under the new arrangements, the final customer for the goods will account for any tax paid, while the intermediate agent will simply complete a regular form called the EC sales list.</p>

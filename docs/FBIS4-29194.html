			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan's overall merchandise  trade surplus fell back sharply in may after five straight gains  with imports soaring both in value and volume on the yen's rise,  the Finance Ministry said Thursday [16 June]. The politically  sensitive surplus with the United States, however, continued to  rise.    The overall customs-cleared trade surplus fell an unadjusted  15.9 percent to 6.54 billion dollars, scoring a double-digit  fall for the first time since December 1991, the ministry said  in a preliminary report. Imports rose 12.3 percent to 21.54  billion dollars, and exports gained 4.2 percent to 28.07 billion  dollars.    A ministry official, briefing reporters, said import volume  rose sharply on the yen's rise, citing the 16.1 point rise in  the trade index for import volume.    Regarding the effect of the yen's rise on exports, he said  the index for export volume fell 2.5 points to post the fourth  straight decline, but the price index was at 7.0 points to  inflate the export value.    In yen terms, the trade surplus fell 21.6 percent to mark  the  fourth consecutive decline, with exports falling 3.0 percent and  imports rising 4.5 percent.    The dollar averaged 103.17 yen in the latest reporting  month, down 7.4 percent from 110.85 yen the preceding year.    The official noted a special factor involving the "Golden  Week" holidays in early May that were longer than in the  previous year. Companies increased their exports in late April  ahead of the holidays to prevent any gaps in covering foreign  orders. But he said this alone would not lead to such sharp  declines in the overall surplus.    Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute,  cited a lot of information indicated in May. The May figures  are insufficient to judge that the overall trade gap turned  firmly lower due to holiday factors, he said. "But we must take  note of the increases in import volume," Takagi said, adding  that imports are increasing despite ongoing sluggish domestic  demand, and that Japanese manufacturers are indeed facing tough  price competition from cheaper imports in the unchanged market  pie. Meanwhile, the surplus with the U.S. remained higher in  reflecting lingering trade disputes, he said, adding that the  dollar is unlikely to fall against the yen against this  backdrop. Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. rose 7.5 percent  from a year earlier to 3.04 billion dollars, the third  consecutive monthly gain, the ministry said.    As for other major nations, the surplus with the European  union fell 31.5 percent to 1.34 billion dollars for the fifth  straight decline, and the surplus with other Asian nations edged  0.5 percent lower to 4.03 billion dollars after rising for 24  straight months.    Takagi traced the lower surplus with Asia to increased  imports of cheaper products, led by clothing from China, that  more than offset a relatively healthy increase in exports. In  fact, imports of clothing posted a strong rise in May, gaining  26.9 percent from the previous year.    Among other major import gainers were office equipment, up  46.9 percent, and semiconductor and other electronics parts, up  39.2 percent. Imports for crude oil fell 14.8 percent although  the import volume rose 4.6 percent, stemming from lower prices  that averaged 15.39 dollars, down 18.5 percent from 18.88  dollars.    As for major export gainers, semiconductor and other  electronics parts rose 30.2 percent, and engines and motors  increased 21.9 percent. Exports for audiovisual equipment fell  22.3 percent, and those for automobiles dropped 11.7 percent.</p>

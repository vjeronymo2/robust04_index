			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL DIPS INTO RESERVES  </P> <P> The City Council has approved a $46-million, "bare bones" budget for the fiscal  year, but rejected the city administrator's proposal to lay off one staff  member and reduce salaries of part-time employees by 20%.  </P> <P> City Administrator Julio J. Fuentes had recommended the salary cut and a freeze  on executive and lower management positions to maintain funding for four police  officers and four other police personnel. Fuentes also had recommended laying  off the assistant recreation director.  </P> <P> But after hearing protests last week from a number of employees and residents,  council members refused to cut back on staff. Instead, the council opted to use  about a fourth of the city's $484,000 reserve fund to fully fund the positions.  </P> <P> Council members instructed Fuentes to pull the funds from reserves and to seek  new revenues for the current fiscal year, which began last week.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO LOSES AMERICA'S CUP;  </P> <P> CONNER'S USE OF CATAMARAN RULED TO BE VIOLATION OF GOVERNING DEED  </P> <P> In a ruling unprecedented in the 138-year history of the America's Cup, a judge  Tuesday said that Dennis Conner and the San Diego Yacht Club violated the  spirit of fair competition called for in the Cup's rules and awarded sailing's  most prestigious trophy to New Zealand.  </P> <P> New York Supreme Court Judge Carmen Ciparick decided that, by racing a  catamaran against a monohull last September, San Diego had created a "gross  mismatch" not in accordance with the "friendly competition between foreign  countries" intended by the author of the 19th Century Deed of Gift governing  the race.  </P> <P> The long-awaited decision by the New York court, which has jurisdiction over  the interpretation of Cup rules, was a shocking blow not only to the sailing  community, but to the city of San Diego, which was expecting a billion-dollar  bonanza from hosting the next scheduled Cup regatta in 1991.  </P> <P> Leaders of the both the San Diego Yacht Club and the America's Cup Organizing  Committee (ACOC) criticized the judge for what one high-ranking ACOC member  called a legal "flip-flop." The lawyer representing the yacht club said  bluntly: "We've been had."  </P> <P> Those officials gave every indication that they expect to appeal the judge's  ruling, but a decision probably won't be made until today at the earliest. They  said they had to analyze the 14-page ruling and would be guided by "what is  best for the America's Cup."  </P> <P> Almost from the moment skipper Dennis Conner won the Cup for the San Diego  Yacht Club during races off the coast of Fremantle, Australia, in February,  1987, the Cup has been under siege. First there was a months-long controversy  over where the next regatta would be held -- San Diego or Hawaii -- in what  amounted to a bidding war, and then merchant banker Michael Fay of New Zealand  stepped into the vacuum and issued an unusual one-on-one challenge.  </P> <P> The gambit by Fay sent the contest once determined by sailors at sea into the  hands of lawyers and the courtroom.  </P> <P> Fay's challenge, which called for him to race off the coast of San Diego in a  $10-million, 123-foot monohull, was upheld by the New York court in November,  1987, touching off a decision by an angry San Diego Yacht Club and the Sail  America Foundation, ACOC's predecessor, to "dispose" of Fay's maverick  challenge as quickly and efficiently as possible.  </P> <P> What the San Diegans were seeking was a guaranteed victory, and that led Conner  and the yacht club to select a 60-foot catamaran, a boat clearly faster than  Fay's monohull. No catamaran had ever raced for the Cup, and the San Diegans  defended their unusual choice, which was criticized by many in the yachting  world for being unsportsmanlike, as legal under the Cup's racing rules embodied  in the 1887 Deed of Gift.  </P> <P> Last September off Point Loma, the two vessels raced in a best-of-three series.  The result was an anti-climactic blowout for the San Diego Yacht Club and  Conner, who won the first two races by wide margins. The loss sent Fay back to  court.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Judge Ciparick sharply criticized the San Diego Yacht Club for  selecting a catamaran and said the club fell short of its responsibility as a  trustee of the Cup. Acknowledging that forfeiture is an extreme remedy, the  judge said she had no choice but to turn over the Cup to Fay and his Mercury  Bay Boating Club Inc.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Aware of Risk'  </P> <P> "San Diego was well aware of the risk it ran when it chose to follow the  unprecedented course of defending in a catamaran," the judge said in her  ruling. "Barely paying lip service to the significance of the competition, its  clear goal was to retain the Cup at all costs so that it could host a  competition on its own terms. San Diego thus violated the spirit of the Deed  (of Gift).  </P> <P> According to the judge, "The holder of the America's Cup is bound to a higher  obligation than the victory of the Stanley Cup or the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> The foundation of Cup racing, since its inception in 1851, the judge wrote, is  fair competition, and the use of a catamaran so strayed from that concept, that  "accordingly, San Diego shall be disqualified. . . . "  </P> <P> "It is clear that a catamaran may not defend in America's Cup competition  against a monohull."  </P> <P> The announcement of Ciparick's decision came at 5:25 a.m. Auckland time and set  off impromptu celebrations throughout the city of 1 million, which calls itself  "the city of sails" because of the high interest in the sport. Joggers stopped  their early-morning exercise to discuss the news, and a fireboat motored into  Auckland Harbor to spray its hoses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fay Informed  </P> <P> Fay, who has devoted himself to a dogged pursuit of the Cup, was awakened by a  phone call from aide Alan Sefton, who told him of the decision. Then Fay went  for his own morning jog, receiving congratulations from his countrymen along  the way.  </P> <P> Fay reacted to his courtroom victory with restrained celebration, saying he  expects New Zealand to host a Cup regatta in April, 1991, that will feature  yachts from countries throughout the world. Before Tuesday's ruling, San Diego  had also scheduled a Cup regatta off Point Loma for May, 1991, which 25 foreign  challengers had already entered.  </P> <P> "San Diego went off on a tangent, if you could say that," Fay told Radio New  Zealand. "Even when we offered to delay the race, they didn't seem to want to  play the game. That was a big disappointment."  </P> <P> "We have always been strong in our belief about what the Cup meant." Fay said.  "The America's Cup is the winner. The Deed works."  </P> <P> Conner was traveling abroad and unreachable for comment. Neither was Malin  Burnham, head of the Sail America Foundation, a member of the ACOC and, along  with Conner, the principal force behind the victory of the Stars &amp; Stripes  yachts in both Fremantle and San Diego.  </P> <P> At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, San Diego Yacht Club Commodore Patrick  Goddard and other officials closed ranks behind Conner, saying that, despite  the court ruling, the yacht club supports Conner and the decision to race in a  catamaran.  </P> <P> "It's important for me to say that the decision to defend in a catamaran was a  joint decision" made by the yacht club and the Sail America Foundation, which  was in charge of conducting the regatta and raising money for Stars &amp;  Stripes.  </P> <P> "I'm personally proud of Dennis Conner and John Marshall (chief designer of  Stars &amp; Stripes)," Goddard said. "I'm personally feeling great  disappointment and a great amount of confusion about the judge's decision."  </P> <P> He said there are no deep divisions within the club about the use of the  catamaran. "We stand as one," he said.  </P> <P> Mark Smith, one of the attorneys representing the yacht club, criticized the  judge for what he said was her reversal in reasoning from earlier Cup decisions  involving the club and Fay. "Our feeling is that we've been had," Smith said.  "It's inexplicable to me . . . how she would write what she did."  </P> <P> He said the club will retain physical custody of the Cup until the appeals  process is resolved.  </P> <P> Thomas Ehman, executive vice president of the ACOC, said the judge "has done a  180-degree flip-flop." He said that, based on her earlier decisions in the  matter, "none of us (would) do anything differently."  </P> <P> Although an appeal seems likely, Ehman said both the yacht club and the ACOC  must weigh how "dragging it out" affects the Cup. Ehman noted that, under a new  "protocol" agreed to in the last three months among Cup challengers --  including the selection of a new America's Cup racing yacht -- the likelihood  of future challenges such as Fay's is now improbable.  </P> <P> Among those most disappointed with Tuesday's ruling was Gerry Driscoll, a  veteran America's Club sailor from San Diego who served on the America's Cup  Committee, the group formed in 1987 to pick where the next regatta would be  held.  </P> <P> It was Driscoll who became the most visible opponent of the yacht club's  decision to race Fay in a catamaran, saying a race between a multihull boat and  a monohull boat was both a mismatch and not in keeping with the tradition of  yachting. On Tuesday, Driscoll, who owns a boatyard on Shelter Island, said he  felt greatly for his yacht club.  </P> <P> "It's certainly a sad bit of history for the San Diego Yacht Club to write," he  said. He noted that, even though Conner overwhelmed Fay in September, many  sailing experts felt the catamaran wasn't sailed to its potential and could  have gone much faster. Of the result, he said, "It was nothing we can be proud  of."  </P> <P> Among those reacting to the ruling was San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who  implied that the judge is a political pawn of the New York Yacht Club, which  held custody of the Cup until 1984, when it was captured by Australian Alan  Bond.  </P> <P> "I hate to say this decision was politically motivated, but we all know the New  York Yacht Club wanted the Cup to go to New Zealand so they could compete for  it on foreign soil in 1991," she said. Under Cup rules, the only way an  American yacht club can recapture custody of the Cup is to win it back from a  foreign country.  </P> <P> "The decision is unfortunate for San Diego because we stand to lose hundreds of  millions of dollars and the international media attention that would go with  the race. I hope that the San Diego Yacht Club will vigorously appeal the  ruling. . . . "  </P> <P> For others, the loss of the Cup will be felt economically. Tom Armstrong,  general manager of Ensenada Express, which chartered boats to both Conner and  Fay and the media last September, said that, if the decision stands, "we'll  lose at least . . . $200,000" in business he was anticipating in 1991.  </P> <P> Also contributing to this report were Times staff writers Leonard Bernstein,  Chris Kraul and Greg Johnson.  </P></p>

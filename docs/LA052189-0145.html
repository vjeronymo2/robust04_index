			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A DESPERATE DASH  </P> <P> The level of desperation felt by many illegal immigrants to the United States  was poignantly captured by Times photographer Don Bartletti last Thursday  afternoon.  </P> <P> While on an assignment just north of the border, Bartletti saw a man walking in  a ditch alongside Interstate 805.  </P> <P> Two U. S. Border Patrol vans were nearby, apparently in pursuit. To escape  arrest, the man bolted onto the freeway into the path of three cars, seemingly  without looking.  </P> <P> The man narrowly missed being hit, just a few yards north of a sign warning  motorists to watch for pedestrians -- a sign that may have saved his life.  </P> <P> Dozens of others, especially at night, have not been so lucky in recent years.  </P> <P> Sadly, this scene seems bound to be repeated as long as desperate people, the  Border Patrol and high-speed traffic mix so dangerously in the South Bay.  </P></p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Government pledges to outlaw bugging THE government yesterday pledged immediate steps to make electronic bugging and trespass criminal offences and promised serious consideration of a civil remedy against undue intrusion into privacy. But it stopped short of backing the central plank of Sir David Calcutt's report into press regulation, that the widely criticised Press Complaints Commission should be replaced by powerful statutory tribunal. Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, endorsed as 'compelling' the report's findings that the self-regulatory PCC was neither effective nor independent. After cabinet discussions of the report yesterday, however, Mr Brooke told the House of Commons that a statutory body would have a constitutional significance that departed from Britain's traditional approach to press regulation. 'In the light of these considerations, the government would be extremely reluctant to pursue that route,' he said. The report came as two UK newspapers, the Daily Sport and Kent Today, published the transcript of an intimate telephone call alleged to be between Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker-Bowles. The transcript had been published in an Australian magazine and in some Irish newspapers yesterday. The report recommended a statutory tribunal able to fine newspapers up to 1 per cent of net annual revenue. Such a tribunal would also be able to use injunctions to restrain newspapers from breaching a statutory code. It is clear the government now plans to take up the suggestion made by Sir David in his 1990 report that criminal offences be created to prevent intrusion, for the purpose of publication, using electronic listening devices and long-lens cameras. Sir David suggested fines of up to Pounds 5,000 but not prison sentences for those found guilty. The government is also prepared to give serious consideration to creating a tort of invasion of privacy, allowing aggrieved parties to seek redress through civil action, and to look again at existing legislation on data protection and interception of telephone calls. Sir David attacked the PCC partly because it had not been set up in the way he had outlined in his original report and because he thought it had not done enough in celebrated cases, such as those involving the Royals. The PCC has decided, for instance, that although there had been complaints about the printing of topless photographs of the Duchess of York it would not take them further as the complaints had come from third-parties not directly involved in the story. Sir David said his proposals, which drew wide criticism from the newspaper industry, would enable the press to operate freely and responsibly by giving it the backing it needed 'in a fiercely competitive market to resist the wildest excesses'. Downing Street said the government would draw up its plans for reform after examining the Commons' heritage select committee's report, due next month, and hearing newspapers' criticisms of the Calcutt report. Officials said new legislation was unlikely to be tabled within the current parliamentary session ending in October. A clearer view of the government's intentions should come on January 29 during the second reading of Labour MP Clive Soley's private member's bill to create a statutory right of reply.

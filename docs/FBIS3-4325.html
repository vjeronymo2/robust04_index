Following the reform  of the foreign exchange system, China clearly stipulated that  foreign currencies are not to be circulated on the mainland. As  the New Taiwan dollar is foreign currency, even the Xiamen  special economic zone, which has independent right to  legislation, will not be allowed to legislate on the circulation  of foreign currency. Similarly, the circulation of Hong Kong  dollar in Shenzhen and Zhuhai will be gradually ended.    Chen Yuan pointed out on 25 March: The detailed rules for  implementation of the regulations on management of  foreign-funded financial organizations, which will be  promulgated before 1 April, focus on convergence between the old  and new regulations. Three state policy banks will be  established in the latter half of the year, and the headquarters  of the State Development and Import and Export Credit Bank will  be set up in Beijing. As the mainland's agriculture is widely  spread, the location of the headquarters for the Agricultural  Development Bank is not yet determined.    The People's Bank of China invited officials responsible for  foreign-funded banks and financial organizations in China to a  "Forum of Presidents of Foreign-Funded Banks" held at the  Beijing Capital Guesthouse on 25 March. Chen Yuan; Zhu Xiaohua,  another president of the People's Bank of China; and Luo  Bochuan, deputy director of the Foreign Exchange Management  Bureau, gave accounts of the mainland's financial and foreign  exchange structural reform. The officials of the foreign-funded  banks raised questions on relevant issues.    Chen Yuan said that the regulations on management of  foreign-  funded financial organizations promulgated by the People's Bank  of China will come into effect on 1 April. The regulations  synthesize the management method for sino-foreign financial  organizations, the management method for foreign-funded banks in  special economic zones, and the management method for  foreign-funded banks in Shanghai. When the regulations go into  effect, it will bring operation of the foreign-funded banks  under supervision. Detailed rules for implementation which are  now being drafted by the People's Bank of China and which are  expected to be promulgated before 1 April, stipulate the  convergence between the old and new regulations, which will  enable foreign-funded banks to readjust their businesses.    When mainland China's special banks are changed to state  commercial banks, the representative of the Standard Chartered  Bank branch in Xiamen asked, will foreign banks be allowed to  deal in renminbi business? Has the experiment of renminbi  business started? Chen Yuan said that the opinions of various  fields are being solicited and experiment will be conducted  first. However, this does not mean that the restrictions on  foreign banks dealing in renminbi business will be lifted only  after the state's special banks are changed to commercial banks.    The representative of the Dresdner Bank branch in Shanghai  asked: The new regulations for management of foreign-funded  banks allow these banks to engage in securities transactions.  In fact, such a business is stated in the management  regulations for foreign-funded banks and financial organizations  in Shanghai. However, the competent departments in Shanghai  have never approved it. Would it be the same case in the new  regulations?    Chen Yuan replied that the detailed rules will make further  stipulations on securities transactions. But the range will be  limited, which is different from the wide range of businesses  that can be done abroad. The new regulations actually stipulate  that foreign-funded financial organizations may engage in  approved securities transactions. Mainland decrees are usually  made on a long-term basis. As for the actual situation,  ratification is made by the competent unit in light of needs.  By the end of last year, Chen Yuan pointed out, foreign-funded  financial organizations had established 302 representative  offices in 193 cities and set up 98 business offices in 13  cities, with the volume of business increasing. With assets  totaling $8.1 billion last year, the foreign-funded banks  granted $4 billion of loans, of which 77 percent were granted to  domestic enterprises, and received $4.2 billion of savings  deposits. Foreign-funded banks now constitute an important  component part of mainland's financial system.</p>

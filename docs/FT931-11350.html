			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Transporters find some hope POTENTIAL bidders for passenger franchises found few surprises in Mr MacGregor's proposals but his plans for freight raised a cheer. Mr Mike Harvey, spokesman for the Freight on Rail group, which represents investors in the sector, welcomed Mr MacGregor's announcement as a 'major positive move' to increase freight on rail. 'Over the last eight weeks or so many of the companies who are already committed to moving freight by rail have been making sure that MPs and ministers are aware of how important freight by rail can be to the national economy. I have to assume that the messages have been getting through.' The Freight Transport Association, representing large freight users, said it was delighted with most of the proposals on freight, but 'very concerned' that while Mr MacGregor announced his intention to raise the gross weight limit for lorries in joint road/rail haulage operations to 44 tonnes, the increase would not apply to haulage carried out by road alone. 'There is an excellent case for 44 tonnes across the board. By restricting it the way he has, he is almost penalising industry.' Mr Philip Snowden, managing director of Badger Rail, a division of the bus operators Badgerline, which is likely to be interested in the Great Western InterCity line, said: 'We are a bit disappointed that he has restated the very distinct separation of the authority over the track from the railway operations.' He said operation of the track was an important part of the overall service provided to passengers. 'We would like to have a reasonable degree of at least day to day control over these aspects.' But the separation of track and operations was described as 'encouraging' by Mr Kenneth Irvine, rail privatisation project manager for British Bus, which is likely to bid for the South West division of Network SouthEast and the Gatwick Express service. Mr Keith Taylor, managing director of National Express, the coach operator, said: 'I welcome the process he has adopted, because it will give franchisees an opportunity to see what these businesses can produce.'</p>

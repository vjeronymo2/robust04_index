			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (15): The nuts and bolts - Engineering is still the motor of the economy MANY PEOPLE still tend to think of Switzerland as a country of solid banks, delightful tourist retreats and quaint watchmakers. In fact, the country's outsize engineering industry is the motor of the Swiss economy. With 3,000 companies and a labour force of 370,000, it dwarfs the banking sector, and its exports of SFr39.3bn last year were worth six times those of the watchmakers. By the late 1980s, the Swiss engineering industry had become so large that it was having difficulty keeping up with its customers' demands. In particular, it was suffering from skilled labour shortages, and chafing at Switzerland's tough restrictions on immigrant workers. In the past year, however, the industry's concerns have changed dramatically as, like its counterparts elsewhere in the world, it has been hit by the downturn in capital spending in many of its important markets. While Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), by far the biggest group in the sector, managed to eke out a 2 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits last year, few others did as well. Von Roll, the steel and machinery group, and Rieter, the textile machinery group, slumped into loss, while others, such as Sulzer Brothers, the pumps and textile machinery group, George Fischer, the machine tool builder, and Schindler, the lifts and rolling stock maker, reported sharp declines in their profits. At the annual press conference in February of the Swiss Association of Machinery Manufacturers (VSM), concern about labour and skill shortages gave way to shock at the soaring jobless rate. By the end of 1991, the number of full-time unemployed in the sector had nearly tripled to 5,700 compared to the end of 1990, and short-time working, which was virtually non-existent in the late 1980s, was affecting 21,000. Hardly a week goes by without announcements of closures and redundancies. Perhaps the most significant last month was the closure by Sulzer Brothers of its large-piece grey iron foundry at Oberwinterthur. This was the last remaining large-scale iron foundry in the country, and even though its demise will eliminate only 520 jobs, it was a chilling indicator of how tough things have become in some industry sectors. Sulzer pointed out that the foundry's main clients were the machine tool and textile machinery industries and their combined orders tumbled from 10.7m tonnes in 1989 to only 5.3m tonnes last year. Surprisingly, output and order statistics do not yet fully reflect the agony that is being felt in many engineering sectors. Last year, new orders of 200 leading companies surveyed by the VSM were down only 1.4 per cent and their combined sales advanced a healthy 11.3 per cent to SFr26.1bn. Total industry exports were up 0.3 per cent. However, other figures are more revealing. The combined backlog of 260 companies in a VSM study dropped from 6.1 months in the fourth quarter of 1990 to 5.3 months in the fourth quarter of last year, the lowest level in 10 years. Capacity utilisation also fell from a record 91.5 per cent in 1990 to a seven-year low of 85 per cent last year. The hardest hit was textile machinery, which is the second largest sector in the industry after machine tools. Textile machine sales were down nearly 18 per cent, as clothing and home furnishings makers turned cautious. The machine tool industry's sales tumbled 11 per cent to SFr3.6bn, hurt by the virtual drying up of eastern European markets. Sales of electrical and precision equipment eased 2 per cent, but electronic industries' revenues were up, thanks in part to major modernisation programmes of the Swiss telecoms establishment. As for the outlook, there is little optimism for the near term. Mr Martin Erb, executive director of the VSM, noted in February that the slight upturn in orders in the fourth quarter of last year was due to a single large order received by ABB to build a power station in Indonesia. In the first quarter of this year, exports were up a surprisingly healthy 7 per cent by value, but VSM officials cautioned against reading this as an indication that there will be much improvement in the year as a whole. For one thing, the export figure is flattered by the sharp decline in the value of the Swiss franc in the past year. For another, the important machine tool sector is still sagging, with exports down 21 per cent. Another negative factor is that domestic demand is likely to be softer this year than last because of budget constraints at all levels of government. 'It is still difficult to tell if we will even achieve the same level of sales this year as last year,' a VSM official says gloomily. This sharp change in the industry's health has heightened its anxiety about Switzerland's position in Europe and the world. Nearly two-thirds of all its exports go to EC countries and over 70 per cent go to the 18 west European countries. The VSM has long officially supported the idea of Switzerland joining the European Community and major international organisations, and this year added its formal endorsement for the proposal to join the European Economic Area. Mr Erb said that the engineering industry, with its record exports to the EC, 'provided further proof of the absolute necessity of free access to the largest internal market in the world'.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN ARE PAWNS  </P> <P> Negotiations between the Ocean View School District Board of Trustees and the  Ocean View Teachers Assn. have reached an impasse.  </P> <P> The board says it has given all it can; the OVTA says it isn't enough.  </P> <P> One negotiator shrugs his shoulders and says nothing can be done and drives  home to Lake Forest.  </P> <P> The students in Ocean View School District go home and cry. Teachers have  discontinued extracurricular programs until they have a new contract. This  includes after-school sports and the outdoor education trips to Catalina and  Yosemite. Some rumors include dances and graduation.  </P> <P> My present eighth-grader and youngest of five has seen his older siblings make  the trip to Yosemite and has anticipated his turn for as long as he can  remember. Pictures of eighth-graders at Yosemite are a legacy in our family  album. He has worked to earn service points to be among the top 10 students and  have first choice of the various hikes and activities. A letter sent home says,  "The teachers who will not participate regret that they have to take the stand  they have."  </P> <P> The teachers don't have to take this stand; they are making a conscious choice  to hold the children ransom. The ones getting hurt in this political power  struggle are the children who feel used and betrayed by those who say they  care.  </P> <P> Some teachers are even using class time to air their grievances to the  children. This is wrong and unprofessional. No matter how real the complaints  are, the children should not be dragged into the argument.  </P> <P> When the situation is eventually settled, whatever the teachers receive will be  retroactive. Whatever the children have lost will be gone forever.  </P> <P> With the children being used as pawns, we all lose.  </P> <P> CAROLYN SESSIONS ALLEN  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

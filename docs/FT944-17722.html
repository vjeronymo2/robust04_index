			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan Taiwan shares plunged 3.3 per cent yesterday after reports that a securities brokerage controlled by a leading stock market player, Mr Oung Da-ming, had bounced a TDollars 200m cheque, writes Laura Tyson. Panic selling set in as investors feared a chain reaction in the market, fuelled by a likely tightening of credit terms by underground financiers. Stock market speculators often finance their share purchases through margin loans from informal lenders. An official from the brokerage, Hong Fu Securities, confirmed the report but said that the problem would be resolved shortly. Mr Oung is the de facto head of the Hualon Group, one of Taiwan's 10 biggest industrial conglomerates, and a member of the country's Legislative Yuan, or parliament. The benchmark weighted index, which hit a four-year high of 7,183.75 on Mon-day, closed 235.33 down at 6,944.59. Shares in Hualon, the group's flagship textile manufacturer, and Chia Hsin Livestock, a company controlled by the group, dropped by the daily limit of 7 per cent.</p>

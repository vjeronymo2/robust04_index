			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;  </P> <P> ON BLACKS IN THE INDUSTRY  </P> <P> I'm black and I think Brown should be reminded that the dominant system in  America is free enterprise -- not socialism.  </P> <P> Consequently, we are all, blacks and whites, at liberty to do virtually  anything with our money.  </P> <P> Indeed, it could be argued that if black stars such as Eddie Murphy, Michael  Jackson and Bill Cosby had listened to Brown earlier in their careers, they  probably would not be as wealthy and powerful as they are now. I don't think  that they should feel obligated to spend their money in a way that fits Brown's  idea of what is "meaningful."  </P> <P> WAYNE BROWNE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

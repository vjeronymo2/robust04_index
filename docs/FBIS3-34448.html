The Palestinian president then left for a meeting with Arab  League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid at the Arab  League.    Palestinian and Israeli delegations, led respectively by  Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', the head of the PLO Economic  Department, and Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli  Foreign Ministry, continued their "marathon talks" aiming to  overcome the difficulties facing the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement signed on 13 September 1993.    Commenting on his talks until dawn with president 'Arafat  and  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, Peres said some topics were  discussed in private. We are trying to overcome some obstacles.  Asked if he was optimistic, Peres said: We should not be  making statements or forecasts now while the negotiations are  under way. When we finish our work, we will make statements.  Peres said things are moving forward.    Faysal al-Husayni, a member of the Palestinian delegation  and  the man in charge of the occupied territories, said there is  some progress in the talks and that further discussions will be  held to reach results.    Elsewhere, president 'Arafat received Torje Larsen, the  Norwegian Government's envoy, in the al-Andalus Palace this  morning. Afterward, Larsen said he is in Cairo to follow the  current Palestinian-Israeli negotiations closely.    Sources close to the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators  told  MENA of cautious optimism prevailing during the marathon talks,  which have been going on continuously for two days.    The sources said that during his meeting with 'Arafat and  Peres yesterday, President Husni Mubarak emphasized the need to  reach an agreement during the current talks. He humored his  guests by saying: You will not leave Cairo until you reach an  agreement.    The same sources said that Peres will not leave Cairo this  evening as scheduled. He will resume talks until tomorrow,  Thursday, before heading for Geneva to attend a conference for  the Jewish community in Europe.    MENA has learned that the major points of dispute are  security control of the crossing points, settlements security,  issues pertaining to the roads leading to Gaza settlements, and  the area of Jericho.    To put it simply, the dispute persisting between the Israeli  and Palestinian sides throughout all earlier rounds has revolved  around Palestinian control of symbols of national sovereignty in  the context of self-rule and the Israeli fear that granting the  Palestinians such control might lead to the establishment of a  Palestinian state.    Sources close to the Israeli delegation have said that the  Israeli military institution, represented in the delegation by  General Uzi Dayan, head of the political planning department of  the Israeli Army Staff Command, refuses to grant the  Palestinians security control over crossing points between  Jordan and Jericho and between Egypt and Gaza under the excuse  of preserving Israel's security.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (5): Hopeful but not over-optimistic - Fishery business becomes more competitive and specialised TALK to any fisherman in Cornwall and he will tell you a tale of gloom and doom about the present, the future and, indeed, the past of the industry. That is, if he will talk to you. Fishermen across the country are an introspective breed, little given to talking to outsiders and rarely divulging the real truth. More dispassionate observers are less gloomy, though. They point to an industry which has invested quite heavily in recent years and attracted younger men into it. They point to higher landings and the fact that Newlyn is the leading port, in terms of value of fish landed, in England. 'Conditions are not too bad at the moment,' says Miss Elizabeth Stevenson, a partner in W Stevenson and Son, the leading agent in the county which with 35 vessels also runs the largest privately-owned fleet in the European Community. 'Quotas are reasonable and it is possible to make quite a good living. Conditions were difficult at the start of the year with gales restricting fishing and the Gulf war pushing up fuel prices. But March was not too bad from a fishing point of view and oil prices have come back a bit from their peak. We are hopeful about the future if not over-optimistic.' She is supported by Mr Heugh Symons who with his partner Mr Steve Farrar runs the Blue Sail Fish company in Looe. 'Fishing is going through a difficult time. Costs are rising all the time. Diesel, repairs, investment costs, interest rates all cost more all the time. 'But those who work hard, those who work long hours are those who succeed. There are people who make a good living from fishing but there are also those who are finding the going extremely tough.' A similar sentiment is expressed by Mr Ian Greet, managing director of Falmouth Fishselling (Falfish) in Falmouth. 'The whole industry has changed over the last 10 years. Then the skippers went to sea, came back, sold their catches and went home before the cycle repeated itself. 'Now the whole industry is much more professional. The skipper has to be a businessman as well as a fisherman to succeed. He has to compete against subsidised competition and the Spaniards registering as British and taking part of the quotas laid down by the European Commission that would otherwise have gone to British boats. He just has to be more sophisticated to exist given these conditions. Fortunately, he has become more sophisticated. A lot more sophisticated.' It is the role of the Spaniards, though, that is causing great concern. A large number of Spanish vessels, having inadvisedly over-fished their own waters, have now registered in Britain and fish in Britain's traditional grounds off the south western coast. Yet they land their catches in Spain. 'About 95 per cent of what the Spaniards catch is landed in Spain,' Miss Stevenson says. 'Yet their catches are part of the British quota laid down by the EEC. They are in fact catching part of our quota.' The industry is waiting to see the result of legal deliberations about this practice - and it is not optimistic about the outcome. If it goes badly against Britain then Cornwall could be hit badly and the industry suffer. There are other concerns. The European Commission has stated that the fleet of the 12 member nations will have to be cut by as much as 40 per cent in the years after the opening of the single market in 1992. This comes on top of an overall European reduction in capacity of 3 per cent in tonnage and 2 per cent in engine power in the years between 1987 and 1991. Every skipper has also had to come to terms with overfishing in the 1970s, when the factory ships stood offshore and took almost anything that could be sucked out of the sea. The setting up of a conservation box around the coasts of the south west of England drawn up to protect the fish stock, especially mackerel, was sensible but added to the pressures on boats and their owners. Despite these problems the industry is in reasonable shape. Newlyn landed some Pounds 30m of fish last year and has around 200 boats working the port. Looe, a very much smaller port, has 40 boats working it and the market there handles some of the landings from nearby Mevagissey and Polperro. Landings in Looe last year rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 2.248m and with the overland catches, that is fish brought in to the market from Mevagissey and Polperro, there was a 3.6 per cent rise to Pounds 2.799m. Handling the catch has been much improved following an investment programme by the harbour commissioners who were assisted by the Rural Development Commission and Euro money. The auction house was rebuilt and new harbourside units put in. Even with all the latest equipment on the boats as well as onshore improvements, though, a touch of luck comes in handy occasionally. Just before Christmas some of the Looe boats struck it really lucky. Their catch one day turned out, to their surprise, to be bass, an upmarket fish admired in Paris as well as London. One boat came in with a catch worth Pounds 64,000, enough to give them a very nice Christmas. For the port as a whole bass catches amounted to Pounds 850,000 last year. Had it not been for good bass catches Mr Symons says the actual value of fish landed in Looe last year would have fallen slightly rather than risen. Even so, the actual 2 per cent rise was lower than inflation and so in real terms the port slipped slightly. Around the rest of the coast there are a number of smaller ports such as Padstow and Port Isaac that may have as few as half a dozen vessels based in them. Many of these will be fishing for lobster and crab, fish on which the margin of profitability is much greater. During the season - from about now until October, depending on the weather - two or three Vivier lorries, which have glass fibre tanks necessary to carry live shellfish, are in Cornwall every day to take the catch to continental markets. Once their main destination was Paris but now it is Spain. Overfishing has, however, cut the catch and volumes, Mr Greet believes, have probably dropped by about a half over the past five years, a symptom of the changes with which the Cornish fishermen have had contend.</p>

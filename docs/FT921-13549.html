			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmer's Viewpoint: UK lamb producers have to gird up their loins - Export demand is propping up prices although the EC support system has been given the chop THE RAINDROPS were as big and cold as I ever remember. The sleet mixed with them was travelling horizontally in the strong wind and the abominable mixture invaded my eyes, my ears and the tiny gap between my coat and my neck. At times it was even difficult to breathe. As I continued setting the new fold (that is putting up electric fences on fresh ground) for the 500 or so hungry lambs grazing turnips sown into stubble last summer after cereals had been harvested, I cursed the day I had agreed to allow my son, who usually looks after the sheep, to go skiing. By the time I had finished the job I was soaked to the skin and very uncomfortable. I had not taken waterproof leggings because it had been fine when I set out. My corduroy trousers had therefore quickly become saturated and acting as a wick had carried moisture upwards into my underpants and the tail of my shirt. Gravity had meanwhile allowed a fair quantity of water down into my Wellingtons so that I was squelching around with about half an inch of cold water in my boots. This all took place just a few days after the end of last year when the European Community had finally removed the variable premium for lamb that had provided a valuable safety net for sheep farmers since it had been introduced in 1980. While it operated it made up the average ex-farm price of eligible UK lambs of good quality to preset guide levels calculated each week. As I battled with the elements on that exposed field not knowing whether the lambs I was trying to feed would make economic prices in the open unsupported market, I seriously began to wonder if sheep farming would in the future be worth all the trouble - and discomfort. Last Saturday however the trade at Norwich livestock market made me pause and think again. Lambs being auctioned on a per head basis and ungraded were making almost as much as they would have grossed a few weeks ago with the market price and the variable premium combined. The same has been true across most of the auction markets in the country since the premium was abolished. There are, however, a number of reasons for this brisk trade, not least the ending of the premium itself. The fact is that, because of the uncertainty about what would happen when it finally disappeared, farmers who had lambs that were anywhere near ready for slaughter by the end of last year fed them extra rations to make them grow faster and ensure they would make the grade and qualify for a premium payment while the scheme lasted. This meant that the number of lambs offered for sale during the last week of the scheme were up on normal. The Meat and Livestock Commission estimates that the markets from which it collects data (probably accounting for about 60 per cent of all lambs sold at auction) handled 280,000 lambs during the week ending January 3, the last week of the variable premium scheme, and that the same markets sold only 46,000 the following week. Further, the MLC estimates that about 15 per cent more lambs were sold during the last few months of 1991 than in the same period the previous year. Given that the number produced in both years was similar, this must mean that there are many fewer to come to market by the end of the lamb marketing year in a couple of months' time. So there is now a shortage, and this is being exaggerated by a lively export trade to France and beyond. Moreover, the 'clawback', the amount previously reclaimed from exporters on all lambs sent abroad and which was equal to the variable premium (which was unique to the UK and intended only to support domestic trade while not distorting foreign markets) has also been abolished. For lambs intended for the export trade therefore the effect of the changes has been to cancel out all artificial barriers to trade and enable the animals concerned to be sold at their true market value. That is the reason why the market has risen to cover virtually all of the lost premium. But the good news for sheep farmers does not stop there. Coincidental with all this activity in the EC's domestic markets supplies of all meats, including lamb and mutton, from Poland and Hungary, which have been overhanging and depressing EC markets since those countries were given access to them, have suddenly dried up. Much of this mainly low quality meat has been bought to satisfy Europe's growing appetite for curries, kebabs and the like. But now the former Eastern bloc countries seem to want to retain more food at home and the meat traders of Europe are having to look elsewhere. They have turned in part to British cull ewes, that is old ewes that have lost their teeth and cannot forage efficiently or have been judged unfit for further breeding. In recent weeks the value of such animals has almost doubled. To the sheep farmer it means that he can, for the moment anyway, dispose of his spent stock at prices not far short of those he might have made for young replacement ewes last autumn, when the market for such replacements was depressed by the uncertainty surrounding the end of the variable premium. The one thing that may stop wholesale culling, which would reduce the national flock significantly and do all us sheep farmers a favour, is the need to keep the declared number of ewes on each holding until at least March 9 in order to qualify for the increased headage payment of Pounds 15, which is now the only government aid available to lowland sheep farmers. Indeed come the long-promised reform of the EC's common agricultural policy this will probably be the shape of the future for most farm commodities; payments for simply being on the land and keeping it tidy and grazed, with strict limits soon to be imposed on the number of animals or acres each farmer can claim for, and the rest from the market. Frankly it is not a system for which I have an instinctive liking. But all in all the sheep version has got off to a reasonable start and flock owners will not be too unhappy if it continues as it has begun. The danger is of course that exports, on which the buoyant trade is currently based, may not last at present levels. Then sheep farmers will have to rely much more on domestic demand. This has held up well in recent years in spite of competition from frozen New Zealand supplies retailed at prices much lower than those for fresh English lamb. It is well known, however, that this market premium for fresh English lamb is a fragile flower. If the abattoir trade pushes it just a touch too far retailers will, without compunction, switch to New Zealand supplies. That and another experience like the one on the turnip field, may still make me reconsider whether we really need the sheep enterprise on our farm.</p>

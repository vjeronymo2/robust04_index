			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Heseltine 'regrets' on Rover takeover Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that, as a 'warm-blooded' British citizen, he 'regretted' that there had been no viable UK bidder for the Rover car company when it was acquired by BMW of Germany this year. 'I would have loved to see it (a UK takeover), but it was difficult to envisage any solution beyond that which we saw,' he told the Commons trade and industry committee at its inquiry into manufacturing competitiveness. He told Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the committee, that the government had been concerned when British Aerospace, the previous owner of Rover, had announced the sale to BMW. But he felt that the proposed management buy-out would not have been viable, and added that there had been general satisfaction with the outcome of the sale to BMW. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders published yesterday showed an 18.3 per cent rise in new-car registrations last month to 134,748. This compared with the 113,919 recorded in June last year. The unexpectedly sharp surge last month has raised the prospect of a 2m-plus market in new cars this year, for the first time since 1990. The June surge brought registrations for the year's first half to 956,263 - a 13.7 per cent rise on the 839,035 in the first half of last year. The SMMT is continuing to be cautious in its forecasts, suggesting that the total market 'might' top 1.9m this year. It is also predicting about 445,000 registrations in August, by far the biggest sales month because of the introduction of the yearly registration prefix. However, this represents an increase of only about 1 per cent on last year's August sales of 440,206. The top 10 sellers in the first half of the year were: 1. Ford Escort 71,683; 2. Ford Mondeo 68,137; 3. Ford Fiesta 59,764; 4. Vauxhall Cavalier 53,012; 5. Vauxhall Astra 52,727; 6. Vauxhall Corsa 42,715; 7. Rover 200 39,533; 8. Rover Metro 28,739; 9. Peugeot 306 24,297; 10. Renault Clio 24,293.</p>

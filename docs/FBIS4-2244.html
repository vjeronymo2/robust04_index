			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Guo Fengmin Talks About Xi Yang Case, Stresses </F> That It Is Completely China's Internal Affair"]    [Text] Guo Fengmin, the Chinese leader of the Sino-British  Joint Liaison Group [JLG], stressed when talking about MING PAO  reporter Xi Yang's case, that it was absolutely a matter of  China's internal affairs because it was handled in accordance  with the law of China.    Last night, Guo Fengmin attended a spring get-together,  sponsored by the Chinese Enterprises' Association, where  reporters asked him questions about the Xi Yang case. One  reporter asked: "Do you think it is appropriate for the Hong  Kong government to issue a statement on the Xi Yang case?" Guo  Fengmin answered: "This matter is China's internal affair and  should be handled in accordance with the law of China."    Guo Fengmin added: The State Council Foreign Ministry  spokesman has made it very clear that the Xi Yang case is a  matter which has been handled according to the law of China. As  for the concrete details, he said that, as the leader of the  JLG, he did not have much understanding of the case. However,  he stressed that the Xi Yang case did not have any bearing on  Hong Kong journalists' normal news-gathering activities and,  because state secrets were involved, such a case, according to  China's law, could not be tried openly.</p>

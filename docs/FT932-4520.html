			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Sharif appeals to business Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, last night appealed to the country's top business leaders to help his government in pressing ahead with its economic development plans, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. 'The country has to be built by the private sector,' Mr Sharif was quoted as saying, in his first meeting with businessmen since a court ruling restored him to office last month. The appeal came before next Monday's annual budget which ends a year with a record high budgetary deficit. Mr Sharif is believed to be seeking the business community's support to generate more tax revenues. 'We are fully supportive of the prime minister and his policies,' said Mr Younas Khan, president of Pakistan's Overseas Chamber of Commerce, after the meeting.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Faroes licenses seismic oil survey The government of the Faroe Islands has awarded a licence for seismic surveys on the Faroese continental shelf to the American company Western Geophysical Corporation, of Houston, Texas. The licence marks the beginning of the Faroe Island's programme to explore for hydrocarbons in its offshore continental shelf area. BP has made a substantial oil discovery south-east of the Faroe Islands and close to the dividing line between the Faroes' and the British sectors, over which there is an unresolved dispute between the two countries. The Faroe Islands is a self-governing province of the Kingdom of Denmark. Economically the group is almost entirely dependent on fisheries. It is in the throes of a serious depression caused by falling stocks and prices of fish. Denmark has had to pump substantial sums of money into the the islands' to prevent total economic collapse. Against this background, the islands' government is pinning its hopes on hydrocarbons prospects.</p>

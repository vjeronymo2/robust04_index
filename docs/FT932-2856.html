			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US and Japan meet on chip share US AND Japanese officials are meeting in Washington this week to calculate the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market for the first quarter of 1993, as a measure of progress in resolving the long-running semiconductor trade dispute, Louise Kehoe reports from San Francisco. Coming amid US-Japanese efforts to establish a framework for negotiations to address a wide range of trade issues, the semiconductor talks are taking broader significance. They will provide further evidence of the success, or otherwise, of using 'measurable indicators' of progress in US-Japan trade agreements. In a 1991 semiconductor trade pact, Japan 'recognised' a US industry target of a foreign market share of 20 per cent, to be achieved by the end of 1992. The agreement stated that 'particular attention should be given to market share' in assessing progress. Yet, from a US perspective, the 1991 semiconductor trade agreement has been remarkably effective. To the surprise of many in the US semiconductor industry, the 20 per cent target was surpassed in the final quarter of 1992, when the market share proportion rose sharply to 20.2 per cent. The increase was partly due to Japan's economic recession, which shrank the overall size of its semiconductor market. The figure for the first quarter of 1993 will similarly be influenced by market conditions in Japan. The first-quarter market share figure is expected to be within a few decimal points of 20 per cent, up or down. Any significant decline in the first-quarter figure would be likely to raise a sharp response, from US trade officials and from industry executives. The Clinton administration is pressing for the inclusion of similar targets in future trade pacts with Japan. The Japanese government is strongly opposed. Despite its agreement to the terms of the semiconductor pact, Japan says such targets represent a form of 'managed trade'.</p>

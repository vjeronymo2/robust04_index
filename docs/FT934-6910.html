			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Delay plea on Crest ownership The British Bankers' Association yesterday said that the question of which body runs Crest, the new paperless securities settlements system, should be left open until the system has operated for some time. Sir Nicholas Goodison, the association's president, said ownership 'should not be resolved at an early stage'. Crest, details of which will be disclosed this week, should 'get up and running' first. Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said there was a 'serious risk' that a body put in charge before Crest started running would want to make changes and there would be further delays. Ownership of the Crest system, devised by an advisory committee sponsored by the Bank of England after the collapse of the Stock Exchange's Taurus system, has been the subject of wide debate. The committee, whose findings are expected to be sent to market participants tomorrow, is not thought to have addressed ownership in its initial paper. This will be dealt with in a paper due to be completed in February. There is thought to be support in the committee for the Bank to run Crest for the first year.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Iberia crisis may lead to break-up The management of Iberia, Spain's financially crippled and strike-hit airline, has warned ahead of a new round of talks today that it will break up the company unless unions agree to drastic wage cuts over the next two years. Union action grounded 75 per cent of Iberia's flights on Friday in the second 24-hour stoppage this month and further strikes are planned through to Christmas in protest at the company's plans to reduce salaries by an average 15 per cent over the next two years. The pay cuts form part of a rescue package for the company that includes a fresh injection of public funds. New funding has yet to be vetted by the European Commission, however, and government officials say there is no chance of Brussels agreeing to the recapitalisation of Iberia unless there is prior agreement on an effective plan that will ensure the airline's future viability. Mr Javier Salas, chairman of Iberia and also of INI, the public sector holding which owns the airline, said in a letter to employees there was now a 'serious risk' that the company could be 'legally bankrupt and forced into liquidation' early next year unless there was agreement over the management's proposals. Separately the management has warned union leaders that a failure to agree on the pay cuts would force the company into segregating its business and selling off its handling and catering units. Iberia would also dispose of its former wholly-owned subsidiary Viva, a former charter company that currently serves regular domestic and European routes, and shareholdings in the Latin American carriers, Aerolineas Argentinas, Chile's Ladeco and Venezuela's Viasa. Unions say they are prepared to negotiate reduced wages but that a prior condition to any cost savings must be a shake-up of the company's board and senior management. Iberia is expected to lose Pta44bn (Pounds 213m) this year, which is roughly the equivalent of what the airline hopes to save under the proposed pay cuts and from a plan to shed 2,120 jobs from its 24,456-strong labour force. Iberia's management says at least Dollars 1bn is required urgently to re-capitalise the company. Even in the event of an agreed plan to save costs, such sums would prove highly controversial in Brussels where seven European airlines, led by British Airways, are currently contesting the commission's recent approval of a state aid package for Air France.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Thank goodness for metal detectors: Michael Harrison defends freelance treasure hunters on motor cycles against the archaeology profession There is another side to the views expressed in Antony Thorncroft's article last Saturday ('Greedy for Antiquities', March 19). I agree that illegal digging must be condemned and would never support the activity of unscrupulous dealers. However, the use of metal detectors has greatly increased the number of chance finds on sites of no archaeological significance, such as trackways or byways were few. Normal archaeological methods would have been unlikely ever to have unearthed them. Many of these finds were lost accidentally or discarded as damaged, and archaeologists are able to deduce that many groups of artefacts previously believed very rare were in fact fairly common. Before the era of metal detectors most of us believed that we lived on sites which may have been continuously occupied for perhaps many centuries, or that we might live over as yet undiscovered sites. Today the surface of this country is fast becoming ploughed up and destroyed by contractors' earth moving equipment and more and more of us live on a spoil heap of junk or in a hole from which the imprint of our ancestors let alone the lie of the land has been obliterated. Thank goodness that metal detectorists on motor cycles follow the dumper trucks about the country and recover from their scrambled contents what they can. We cannot turn back the clock as regards contractors or metal detectors however much we would wish. As Thorncroft says, the old treasure trove law was interested in precious metal, usually for its melt value. Today, academic rather than monetary value, is surely more important. Yet in the discussion of how finds should be treated and arguments about who has the 'right' to ownership, this all-important aspect is overlooked. Surely that right rests with the landowner and to some extent with the finder, even if the archaeologist might claim a legitimate right of study. I suspect that the heart of the archaeologist's complaints are often that he is jealous of those who can sell and buy things for high prices; but this is no part of his academic duty. I find many archaeologists ignore this divide between ownership and the need for study. In a greedy attempt to corner everything that lies beneath the soil for selfish professional reasons, they assume that only they are sufficiently qualified and educated to hold these things in their hands and to have access to them. This is a half-baked Marxist notion and directly contrary to the important freedoms established in this country's common law. Some of these second rate academics attend conferences in which they express an arrogant determination to drive dealing out, to make it a crime, and presumably, it follows, to blight private collections by depriving them of free marketability. So far their efforts within the EC have meant only that leading dealers are all busily establishing businesses in Switzerland so that they may sell direct to the big markets in the US, Japan and Australia. Yet another blow has been struck at the heart of London as the arts centre of the world. It seems to me, leaving aside the inequality that would result in giving too much influence to a minority group, that such restrictions on the rest of us (who may in the case of several people I know be better informed than certain archaeologists) are an unnecessarily high price to pay merely to allow a few archaeologists to increase their knowledge to the optimum. I do not argue against adding to our knowledge, just that it is a barmy notion that objects jettisoned by their original owner as beyond repair, or buried by chance, and after surviving many centuries of treasure seekers, unobservant ploughmen and ignorant superstition should now in the late 20th century all have to be confiscated and reburied in reserve collections to satisfy the bead-counting mentality and overweening self importance of a small group of fanatics. Perhaps art gallery curators would then follow up by confiscating all paintings in private possession. It should then not be long before the civil servants can be persuaded to extend this droit d'elite even unto the least of Victorian kitchen chairs. In short, the underground market will only be brought out into the open by separating absolute title to an object from the obligation to make it available for academic research. All parties will then benefit. Michael Harrison is a collector and former chairman of the Antiquities Dealers Association. These views are his own and do not represent the association's.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Peugeot supply ruling upheld - European Court A refusal by Peugeot, the French car maker, to supply cars to a company specialising in parallel imports has been declared unlawful by the European Court of First Instance. The court upheld a European Commission decision that Peugeot's refusal to supply Eco System, a French car importer, was contrary to EC competition rules. The Commission found the refusal to supply hindered the importation into France of new Peugeot cars bought in Belgium and Luxembourg by French consumers who used Eco System as a professional intermediary. It also said Peugeot's action did not come within the scope of the block exemption relating to certain categories of car distribution and servicing agreements. Peugeot argued that its refusal to supply was covered by the block exemption. Although the block exemption specifically authorised the sale of cars by a distributor to the final consumer who used an independent intermediary for the purpose of purchasing the car, Eco System was not just an independent intermediary but in fact acted as a reseller, Peugeot said. Under the terms of the block exemption, it was lawful for a distributor within an exempted network to refuse to supply independent resellers. The court was not convinced by these arguments. It found Eco System was not acting as a reseller and that therefore Peugeot's actions could not be validated by virtue of the block exemption. T-9/92: Automobiles Peugeot SA and Peugeot SA v Commission, CFI 2CH, 22nd April 1993. Interpretation of the scope of the Brussels Convention In a reference from the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Court gave a preliminary ruling on aspects of the Brussels Convention, which sets out the rules for the jurisdiction and enforcement of civil judgments in the EC. The case involved the death of a German school boy while on a trip to Italy. The teacher in charge of the trip was charged in Italy with manslaughter. The boy's family intervened in the case, bringing a civil suit for damages against the teacher. The Italian court found the teacher guilty of manslaughter and awarded damages of L20m (Pounds 8,500). The German courts, on application from the family, ordered the enforcement of the damages award. The teacher appealed this decision. The appeal court held that he was liable to pay the damages as the judgment of the Italian court fell within the scope of the Brussels Convention. This decision was further appealed, and it was during the course of this action that reference was made to the European Court. The court ruled that the Brussels Convention applied to civil matters, whether they were brought before civil or criminal courts. It then had to determine whether the teacher, who at the time of the incident was employed by the local authority, was acting in the exercise of his public duties as the Brussels Convention does not apply to administrative matters, which is taken to include those matters involving the exercise of public authority powers. The court found that although the teacher was a civil servant he was not at the time of the school trip exercising his public authority powers. This was so even if under German law, he was assumed to be acting under such powers. The case was therefore covered by the Brussels Convention.

Corrigendum In last week's column, in the report of Case C-19/92: Kraus v Land Baden-Wurttemberg, the sum of money referred to should have been DM130, not DM13 and the final sentence should have read: 'However, such action by member states was limited to the extent that it could not restrict the effective exercise of the fundamental rights relating to movement and establishment rights guaranteed by the Rome Treaty.'</p>

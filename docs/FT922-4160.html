			<p>920606 FT  06 JUN 92 / Germany to act on refugees The German parliament is to speed the processing of asylum seekers and the expulsion of non-political refugees, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn. Asylum hearings will be limited to six weeks, rights of appeal reduced and 'collection camps' set up for asylum-seekers. Almost 160,000 have arrived this year. The Bundestag also passed new rules on the taxation of unearned income, which will face stern opposition in the upper house, the Bundesrat.</p>

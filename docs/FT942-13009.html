			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / People: Alan Winter lays new foundations at Trafalgar House property Alan Winter, managing director of Legal &amp; General's property division, has been given the job of reshaping the UK commercial property business of Trafalgar House, the big conglomerate which has suffered three years of heavy losses. Trafalgar House has been without a property boss since the end of last year when David Calverley, 52, resigned after 25 years with the group. Winter, 44, who will take over as managing director of the group's UK commercial property business in the summer, fills one of the last gaps in a top management team which has changed substantially over the past year. Although he is not replacing Calverley on the board, and does not have responsibility for house-building, he takes charge of one of the more troublesome parts of Trafalgar House's business. Trafalgar House was a very active property developer in the 1980s and over-extended itself at the time of the recession. Most of the old management have been replaced, the balance sheet has been repaired with a Pounds 400m rights issue, and Trafalgar House has decided to withdraw from the US commercial property market. However, it has made a 'firm commitment' to remain in UK commercial property. Winter's task will be to change the focus of the business from 'speculative development to the creation of income producing assets'. Winter, a chartered surveyor who joined Legal &amp; General from Hillier Parker in September 1989, admits he is moving into a smaller job. At Legal &amp; General he has a staff of 100 and looks after a Pounds 2.5bn property portfolio, which he says is comparable in size to that of MEPC or British Land. At Trafalgar House he will have around 50 staff and around Pounds 220m invested in property. However, Winter says that Trafalgar House has 'some interesting problems to solve' and he was tempted by the salary. He has tended to 'stay a few years and then move on' at a series of property-related jobs ranging from Ford Motor to Capital and Counties. But this pattern has not hurt his record in the industry. Last week he was runner-up in the property fund manager of the year award sponsored by his old firm Hillier Parker and Pensions World magazine.</p>

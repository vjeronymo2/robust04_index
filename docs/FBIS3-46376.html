An official from the committee said that the province  transformed more than 3,000 old enterprises last year, among  which 365 were large and medium-sized ones, about one third of  the province's major enterprises.    Liaoning, one of China's most important industrial bases  since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,  has turned over to the state more than 170 billion yuan in taxes  over the last four decades.    But recent years have shown that Liaoning's enterprises have  failed to meet the country's accelerated modernization drive, as  they are plagued by problems of aging equipment and outdated  technologies.    Statistics show that by the 1990s only 32.5 percent of the  equipment installed in the province's enterprises reached the  1980s standard, lower than the national average and about 20  percentage points lower than some of the country's prosperous  provinces.    Cao Guixin, director of the committee, said that Liaoning  has  launched a campaign to import foreign capital and technologies  to help transform the aged enterprises.    Last year alone more than 100 large and medium-sized  enterprises were reformed with foreign funds. In Dalian, a  major port city of the province, 11 machinery and chemical  enterprises and 17 electronics enterprises were successfully  updated, the official said.    He also said that in 1993 Liaoning sponsored several large  economic and trade fairs overseas, through which the province  established direct relations with many foreign financial groups  and large companies.    According to statistics, Liaoning has invested 5.69 billion  U.S. dollars in transforming old enterprises, including 2.19  billion U.S. dollars in foreign capital.    Cao said that co-operation with other countries and regions  in the transformation drive has eased the money shortages which  have plagued these enterprises for decades as well as introduced  advanced foreign management into the old enterprises.    The official assured that this year Liaoning will upgrade  its  backbone industries, major products and key enterprises through  utilizing more overseas high-technology and capital.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The development and enforcement of adequate standards governing the initial and continued listing of securities on an exchange is an activity of critical importance to financial markets and the investing public. Listing standards serve as a means for a self-regulatory organization to screen issuers and to provide listed status only to bona fide companies with sufficient float, investor base and trading interest to maintain fair and orderly markets. Once a security has been approved for initial listing, maintenance criteria allow an exchange to monitor the status and trading characteristics of that issue to ensure that it continues to meet the exchange's standards for market depth and liquidity. For the reasons set forth below, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change will provide the NYSE with greater flexibility in determining which debt securities warrant inclusion in its bond trading and disclosure systems, without compromising the benefits that the Exchange's listing standards offer to investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review, the Commission has concluded that the initial listing standards in paragraphs 102.03 (for domestic issuers) and 103.05 (for foreign issuers), as amended, should ensure that only substantial companies capable of meeting their financial obligations are eligible to have their bonds listed on the NYSE. As before, the proposed rule change will require that the NYSE evaluate an issuer's ability to cover the interest charges on its debt securities. Although the Exchange currently makes this interest coverage determination itself, <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  the amended standards will rely instead on either the issuer's relationship with the NYSE or the bonds' NRSRO rating. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 4 and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees that, to the extent the NYSE has adequate listing standards for common stock, the Exchange reasonably may assume that NYSE listed companies (and certain affiliates thereof) <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  in ``good standing'' with the Exchange <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  are in solid financial condition and do not pose a significant risk of defaulting on their obligations. Moreover, as the NYSE correctly notes, debt securities enjoy seniority over equity securities. Because the NYSE presumably would not have listed the junior equity issue unless it was satisfied with the quality of the company, the Commission is unable to conclude that the NYSE has no basis for its assumption that the senior debt issue also warrants listed status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , text accompanying note 10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to the NYSE, a company is in ``good standing'' if it is above the relevant continued listing criteria. See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Paragraph 703.19 of the Listed Company Manual. Telephone conversation between Michael J. Simon, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy; Fred Siesel, Director, Fixed Income Markets, NYSE; and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on April 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For ``unaffiliated'' issuers, the Commission finds that it is not unreasonable for the Exchange to defer to the expertise of an NRSRO, rather than conducting its own analysis of the company's financial condition, as is presently the case. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  Although the Commission would be concerned by any potential misuse of NRSRO ratings, the Commission notes that the NRSROs routinely evaluate interest coverage, among other things, when they rate bonds. In addition, their methodology, unlike the NYSE's, incorporates even more extrinsic factors, such as characteristics of the issuer's industry group. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  The Commission therefore agrees with the Exchange that, under these circumstances, NRSRO ratings can be relied upon for determinations about the creditworthiness of the issuer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See supra, note 4 and accompanying text. The NYSE's definition of the term ``unaffiliated issuer'' is set forth above, see supra note 11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telephone conversation between Fred Siesel, Director, Fixed Income Markets, NYSE, and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, the Commission is satisfied that the distinctions in NRSRO ratings drawn by the NYSE are valid. According to the S&amp;P Corporation's debt rating definitions, <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  bonds rated ``B'' (or higher) currently have the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments, whereas bonds rated ``CCC'' (or lower) are dependent upon favorable business, financial or economic conditions to meet timely payments of interest and repayment of principal. The Commission also believes that it is logical for the NYSE to assume that an unrated debt issue which is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pari passu <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with (or senior to) an issue with at least a ``B'' rating would, if rated, receive an equal (or higher) rating. Finally, to permit the NYSE to list unrated bonds that are immediately junior to an investment grade issue is appropriate because those bonds generally would be rated no more than one rating category lower ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a S&amp;P Corporation ``BB'' rating). <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Standard &amp; Poor's High Yield Directions, January 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

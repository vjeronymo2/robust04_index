			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Piotr Zajdel: "The Ecological Zero Option"] </F>   [Excerpts] The Army of the Russian Federation left Poland  with a great deal of ecological damage and "souvenirs." The most  dangerous of these are the pollution of the soil and the water  table by chemical waste and petroleum lines. The estimated cost  of the damage is approximately 52 billion zlotys [Z].    Already in the 1980's, the Polish Ecological Services tried  sporadically to control pollution from some of the Soviet  military bases. Most of these efforts failed because "outsiders"  were not permitted to enter Soviet bases. Not until May 1992 did  the situation change, after the signing of a Polish-Soviet  agreement on the removal of Soviet forces from Poland. Joint  inspections of both Polish and Russian bases began. The result  of all of this was ecological standards that were incorporated  into the agreements for transferring the former Soviet military  bases to the Poles. "We have documented the magnitude of all the  damage caused, and we have calculated the costs," stated Andrzej  Walewski, the Main Inspector for Environmental Protection.    "The Russians left without paying for the ecological damage  they committed, so, in turn, we are not going to pay them for  any of the equipment they left behind," stated Walewski.  According to him, Poland won the battle with a political  success, while the Czechs and Hungarians incurred many costs  during the Soviet pullout. "The fact that our country had  documentation on the ecological damage played a great  psychological role," stated Walewski.    Of 59 sites that were occupied by the Soviets, 35 had the  potential to be ecological hazards. The National Inspector for  Environmental Protection chose 21 sites believed to be the most  contaminated. The inspections included all of the air bases,  large fuel depots, ammunition dumps, and firing ranges.    Tests were conducted on underground water to see if there  was  chemical contamination. "Water was inspected both above and  below ground. Also, the damage done in forests and on roads and  contamination from chemical and nuclear weapons were examined,"  stated Walewski. These tests were conducted on the grounds of  the bases and around them. Hydrological tests are being  conducted on a wide scale by using bore-hole methods.  Physiochemical tests of the water and water table are being done  in specialized laboratories. The tests are conducted at  government expense, and, to complete them, it is estimated that  the cost will be approximately Z14 million.    The tests are being funded by Polish zlotys exclusively and  under the direction of the Ministry of Environmental Protection.  The Military Technical Academy will also participate in the  tests in tandem with other research groups.    The damage may be assessed at Z52.2 billion. "This is a  rather abstract sum, a sum we would have to pay in order to  fully recultivate the land," stated Walewski. [passage omitted]  The majority of the funds will come from the national budget.  The Environmental Protection group has developed a special  ranking in terms of money and in terms of which area will be  "cleaned" first. The cleaning will take place first in the most  contaminated areas. These areas are: Kluczewo, in the Szczecin  voivodship; Brzeg, in the Opole voivodship; and Swinouscie and  Borne Sulinowo in the Koszalin voivodship. Let us not forget  that the Soviet forces were stationed on Polish soil from World  War II until 17 September 1993, over an area of 70,000 hectares  and 59 bases. Their stay was legitimized by an agreement between  the People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Defence orders of Pounds 500m go to BAe and Westland A Pounds 500m package of defence orders including new trainer aircraft, helicopters and missiles for the RAF was announced by the government yesterday. The news, which caught contractors by surprise although several of the orders had been long awaited, followed confirmation last week of plans for naval craft for amphibious operations, worth some Pounds 500m. Both announcements appeared to be aimed at offsetting the negative publicity caused by recent job losses in the defence industry, including jobs at British Aerospace and naval shipyards. BAe, with Westland the main beneficiary of the new orders, yesterday announced preliminary 1991 figures showing a loss of Pounds 81m after restructuring charges of Pounds 235m. This compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 376m in 1990. The largest of the orders announced in the Commons by Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, is for 13 two-seat trainer versions of BAe's Harrier jump-jet, estimated to be worth more than Pounds 200m. A further five navy T4 trainers will be upgraded. BAe will also gain from an order to replace an estimated 100 Alarm missiles which were rushed out to the Gulf a year ago and used against Iraqi radar installations. In addition, the government plans to convert the RAF's remaining five VC10 transport aircraft so that they can be used as tankers for in-flight refuelling. The work is expected to be done at BAe's Filton site near Bristol. Westland, the Yeovil-based helicopter company, has meanwhile been promised orders valued by the company at Pounds 70m to Pounds 75m. These include six Sea King helicopters for RAF search-and-rescue duties, worth some Pounds 50m. It will receive further work estimated at Pounds 20m to upgrade Royal Navy Lynx helicopters.

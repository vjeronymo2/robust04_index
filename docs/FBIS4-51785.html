			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Moscow-based correspondent Mun Myong-ho from the </F> "Reporter's Eye" column]    [Text] "We had no time to discuss the defense industry  cooperation at all," was the remark to the ROK correspondents in  Moscow by the ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae emerging from  his talks with the Russian Defense Minister Grachev held at the  Russian Defense Ministry building on the morning of 29 April.  Defense Minister Yi also said that the ROK purchase of Russian  weaponry was not discussed.    The ROK had a lot of expectations on the talks on the issue  of defense industry technological cooperation. The Russian side  was also reported to have expected the ROK to show a minimum  positive response to the issue of purchasing Russian weaponry.  However, neither side scored any gains in what it had hoped for.    Meanwhile, the ROK Defense Ministry source released a report  in Seoul at about the same time saying that the defense  ministers of the two countries agreed at the talks on that day  that the two countries would build a system for assistance in  defense industry technological cooperation. Since this was not  a slight difference between the two reports over the same fact  that could occur in the course of conveying the report, it  should not be regarded as a communication error. One of the two  must have lied, exaggerated, or concealed the truth.    Noteworthy is the fact that an incident of this nature  occurred again two weeks after a similar one regarding ROK  relations with Russia.    The report released by the ROK Foreign Ministry immediately  after ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu had talks with Russian  Foreign Minister Kozyrev in Moscow on 14 April was that Russia  agreed to actively cooperate with the ROK on the problem of the  North Koreans escaping from the logging site in the Russian Far  East. The truth, as it turned out later, was that Russia only  reconfirmed its previous principled position.    ROK Embassy officials in Moscow are very embarrassed at the  reports which are openly released in this manner distorting the  fact and interpreting everything to one's own advantage.    We worry about the possible tendency in the government to  have an illusion that Russia may accede to our demands easily  because of its deteriorated prestige and debt to the ROK, or to  think lightly of Russia. We should prevent a recurrence of an  incident in which the people are fooled and the country loses  face by pretending that there was success when there was no  success.</p>

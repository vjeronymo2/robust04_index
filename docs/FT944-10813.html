			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / People: Finance moves Geoff Henry, 50, is to be the next chief executive of the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund. He takes over from Tony Ashmore, 57, who retires at the end of the year after ten years at the helm of the Pounds 2bn fund. The MNOPF is one of the largest industry-wide pension schemes although the decline in Britain's merchant navy means that the number of contributing members has fallen from around 40,000 in the 1950s to just 6,000. However, the fund services 17,000 pensioners and also has another 33,000 deferred members. Henry, who used to work for British Shipbuilders pension fund, has been the MNOPF's director of finance for the past nine years and managing director of its pensions administrations subsidiary for the past four years.</p>

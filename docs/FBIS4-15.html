			<p>SUMMARY                                     Crown Prince and Prime Minister Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah al-Salim  al-Sabah has used the announcement of a forthcoming cabinet  reshuffle to warn the Kuwaiti press to temper its criticism of  the government and to signal his displeasure with Kuwait's  National Assembly.                                END SUMMARY     While devoting much of his speech to a review of current foreign  and domestic economic policy issues, Shaykh Sa'd began by  directing sharp criticism at the press and, by implication, at  the National Assembly, which was dissolved in 1986 and reinstated  in 1992 following the Gulf War (Kuwait TV, 4 April).  He  reaffirmed a commitment to "constitutional democracy" as an  "irreversible option" but charged that "some practices have  exploited the atmosphere of freedom by going in for exaggeration  and excesses" and have "gone beyond the limits and controls which  the constitution laid down."  In an evident allusion to the  assembly, a majority of whose members were elected in October  1992 as independents or representatives of political groupings  outside the government, Shaykh Sa'd complained that "groupings  and blocs have appeared which are on the verge of becoming  parties" and which "undermine our unity" and "spread the spirit  of division and fragmentation in our ranks."  Although informal  political groups are tolerated in Kuwait, official political  parties are banned.  "True democracy," the shaykh explained,  entails "responsible behavior and sincere commitment to the  values and traditions of society."     Although Shaykh Sa'd refrained from explicit attacks on the  National Assembly, an article appearing in the the London daily  Al-Hayah on 2 April indicated that the principal target of his  ire is six members of the current cabinet taken from the ranks of  the National Assembly when the current government was formed as  part of a deal by which the assembly would defer some demands for  political reform in return for being allowed some direct  participation in the government.  The article cited an unnamed  source close to the shaykh as saying that the shaykh "was not  satisfied with the way some ministers, who are also members of  the National Assembly, act in their ministerial posts" and as  charging that these ministers "act in light of their alliances  and sympathy with the political forces at the expense of their  commitment to maintain solidarity among the members of the  government."  On the 6th, Al-Hayah reported considerable  speculation in Kuwaiti political circles concerning the reshuffle  but added that no official announcements are likely before 11  April.     Turning to the press, on which prepublication censorship was  lifted in January 1992, Shaykh Sa'd claimed that "some of our  papers have made of themselves an arena for the infighting of  quarreling groups and blocs," quite likely a reference in  particular to the daily Al-Oabas, which has frequently been a  thorn in the government's side.  Such papers, the shaykh added,  have engaged in "bigotry, intellectual intimidation, insults, and  discrediting" and "have become tools destroying our national  unity."  Without threatening any specific sanctions, Shaykh Sa'd  warned against "the negative consequences of the continuation of  the practice of irresponsible freedom" and added that the goal of  press freedom "is not chaos but a commitment to truth,  objectivity, and the good of the nation."     Implications     Judging from Shaykh Sa'd's speech, the reshuffle may involve both  the removal or shifting of at least some of the six ministers  from the National Assembly, as well as some movement of ministers  holding various domestic economic portfolios.  Notwithstanding  the shaykh's obvious irritation with the press and the National  Assembly, both of which have demonstrated a clear willingness to  attack the government since the restoration of parliament in  1992, his reassurances of his commitment to constitutional  government probably also reflects a recognition by the ruling  family that it must live with a degree of political pluralism and  debate given the substantially changed political climate in  Kuwait brought on by the Gulf War.

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures buying drives Footsie to all-time high Stock index futures returned to the forefront of the UK stock markets yesterday afternoon, and once again led the FT-SE 100 Index to a new closing peak. As the March contract on the Footsie broke through 3,400, the stock market turned higher in its wake, with private investors leading the way. London was encouraged by renewed strength in other European bourses and by predictions that outflows from Japanese markets will be targeted at the UK market. At best, the FT-SE 100 was nearly 32 points up at 3,369, but share prices reacted quickly when the March contract slipped back from its best levels. The final reading put the index at 3,364.9 for an advance of 27.8 on the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 18.7 ahead at 3,710.4, also a new peak and only a shade below its best level of the session. The Mid 250 Index, which extends the Footsie 100-share range across the second line stocks, has recovered rapidly from profit-taking in early November. Trading volume in the market's top 100 stocks was moderate for most of the day, but increased sharply when the surge in the futures contract opened the way for arbitrage trading, in which the leading securities houses sell the futures contract and buy the underlying stocks. However, Seaq volume dipped to 748.9m shares after Friday's near record 1.0156bn. Non-Footsie business increased to around 65 per cent of the day's total; business in second line stocks usually averages less than 58 per cent of daily totals. Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail, or customer, business on Friday reached 1.84bn, making a total for the week of Pounds 8.4bn, one of the highest weekly figures for what has been an extremely active year on the London stock market. Traders warned that the early part of yesterday's session saw mostly two-way business in the leading stocks. A genuine programme trade moved through the market without incident, to be followed later by several trades which were identified as basket trades, linked to futures trading. Some US investment business was seen in London but strategists remained cautious, warning that the final trading sessions of 1993 could well bring profit-taking now that the big institutions are beginning to close their books for the year. Many houses were prepared to be bearish at first, and an early gain of 16 points on the Footsie was almost eliminated later. 'But for the future, it would have been a quiet day,' said the head dealer at an international trading house. The appearance, in strength, of the private UK investors was no great surprise. The annual Christmas flow of brokerage recommendations is likely to increase this year and highly bullish profiles of the market will target private investors. Marketmaking houses have taken steps to meet the stock shortages provoked by the enormous upturn in futures markets and were buying stock yesterday morning to meet the expected Christmas rush. Once again, it was the merchant banking and allied sectors, prime beneficiaries of active securities markets, which stood out yesterday. Utility stocks also responded again to dividend optimism. But the consumer sectors, looking anxiously for signs of Christmas spending success, were less confident; while brewers and hotels did well, the main line store sector continued to lag the market.</p>

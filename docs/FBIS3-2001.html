			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jiling (1776 2623 3781)] </F>   [Text] Nanjing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- While inspecting Jiangsu  recently, Song Jian, State Councillor and the minister in charge  of the State Science and Technology Commission, called on those  who work in new and high technology development zones not only  to attract foreign funds and import technologies but also to  attach high importance to promoting the commercialization,  industrialization, and internationalization of the domestic  scientific and technological results and to accelerating the  pace of the development of China's new and high technology  industry.    Song Jian inspected new and high technology development  zones  in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou and new and high technology  enterprises in the Torch Plan belt of Suzhou, Wuxi, and  Changzhou from 11 to 17 February. He said that one of the  conspicuous characteristics that comes from comparing a new and  high technology development zone to an economic development zone  is that the former places even more emphasis on the  transformation of domestic scientific and technological results.  He also noted the need to formulate more preferential policies  and to provide better conditions for large and medium-sized  enterprises, scientific research institutes, and colleges and  universities to set up branches in the zone to carry out the  large-scale production of new and high technology products.    Song Jian also spoke of the need to strive to upgrade  industry's scientific and technological levels, to greatly raise  productivity, and to help transform traditional industry into  new and high technology industry. He said that because China's  new and high technology industry is now in the beginning stage,  it is essential for the development zone to provide a  development base for this budding industry and to become an  experimental and demonstration zone for establishing a new  system. He called for promoting cooperation among large and  medium-sized enterprises and scientific research institutes, and  to give support to private scientific and technological  enterprises and to big enterprise groups with an annual output  value between 1 billion and 10 billion yuan, so that they will  hold a big market share of the domestic market and compete on  the international market. Song Jian held that the absorption of  foreign capital and the import of foreign technologies are an  important way to accelerate the development of China's new and  high technology industry. He pointed out, however, the need to  assimilate, master, and upgrade imported technologies so that  they will help build China's superiority in technology.    To upgrade industry, Song Jian called for devoting efforts  to  train a large number of high-level and  internationalization-minded scientists and technicians. He also  called for the attracting of a number of doctorate and master's  degree holders and foreign-trained scholars with strong  technical backgrounds, commercial skills, and excellent foreign  language proficiency to work at leading organs and management  departments in the development zone.</p>

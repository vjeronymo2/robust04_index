The process will  take about four months, he said.    Tarand's statement was based on Foreign Ministry Adviser  Mark  Sinisoo's claim that Russia proposed June 30 as the deadline for  taking out the fuel.    The minister told BNS this is ``a case typical of the  situation in Estonia where a department does not coordinate its  activity with others.''    In Tarand's opinion, the Transportation and Communications  Ministry and the Rescue Service should certainly take part in  the dismantling of the reactors.    Kalev Timberg, the deputy director of the Rescue Service,  told BNS the service is to secure fire safety during the process  and deactivation of radioactive substances if an accident  occurs. Russia hasn't yet submitted to the Rescue Service the  dismantling blueprints, which complicates the situation, he said.    Timberg refused to comment reports that Russian military  authorities want the Rescue Service to bring to the scene  equipment able to shoot jets of water to a height of at least 12  meters.    Henno Putnik, the chief specialist of the Estonian  Meteorology and Hydrology Institute's radiation laboratory, told  BNS removal of nuclear fuel rods from reactors ``is an operation  Russian submariners often carry out.''    The dismantling of the entire nuclear reactor complex in  Paldiski is to take place in the second stage of the operation.    Tarand told BNS Finnish and Swedish specialists have offered  to help Estonia in this.</p>

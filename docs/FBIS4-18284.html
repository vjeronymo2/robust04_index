			<p>BFN     [Text] The Corsican National Liberation Front-Historic  Branch [FLNC-Canal Historique] today released a statement  claiming responsibility for the commando action at Sperone  (Southern Corsica) during which 14 people were arrested.  According to the statement there is "no question of giving up  the armed struggle."    As far as the FLNC is concerned the Sperone tourist complex  is "one of the symbols of the despoilment of Corsican land by a  speculators' mafia."</p>

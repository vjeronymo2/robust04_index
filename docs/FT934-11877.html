			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US may curtail C-17 programme The US Defence Department is threatening to cut short the troubled McDonnell Douglas C-17 transport aircraft programme at just 40 aircraft, one third of the planned fleet, writes George Graham in Washington. Pentagon officials told members of Congress in closed sessions they could economically cancel the programme after 40 aircraft; unless substantial improvements were achieved, they would seek to meet the rest of their airlift needs with alternatives such as the C-5 or converted wide-bodied airliners. At the same time, in a 'carrot and stick' approach, they said they were considering making a Dollars 400m payment to McDonnell Douglas to forestall an estimated Dollars 1.6bn of claims the company could seek against the government. The C-17 was intended to replace much of the US military airlift fleet, with the capacity to carry heavy payloads over long ranges and land them on short runways. The original plan to buy 210 aircraft was already scaled back to 120 in 1990, a fleet which would have cost around Dollars 40bn. The programme has suffered, however, from delays and cost overruns. McDonnell Douglas has signed an agreement with Malaysia allowing Malaysian participation in the manufacture of equipment for McDonnell Douglas aircraft, writes Kieran Cooke from Kuala Lumpur. The agreement, said to be worth more than Dollars 200m to Malaysia over a 10-year period, is part of an offset programme resulting from Malaysia's decision earlier this year to buy eight F/A-18D McDonnell Douglas fighter aircraft. Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysia's defence minister, said the offset programme would give the Royal Malaysian Air Force and local defence industry companies access to the lastest aerospace industry technology.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / IG Metall steps back from confrontation IG Metall, the 3.25m-strong German engineering workers' union, yesterday backed away from instant confrontation in its annual wage negotiations, accepting an employers' invitation to talks on Friday. However, Mr Klaus Zwickel, its leader, set a one-week deadline for new proposals from Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation, before the union begins the process leading to a ballot on full strike action. He warned that both sides remained far apart in their regional negotiations across the country in which the union is seeking firm job guarantees in exchange for radical cost cuts sought by the employers. 'IG Metall will not bow to any diktat from the employers,' the union leadership said. 'We do not want a conflict, but we are not going to avoid it at any price.' The union will decide on February 21 whether to hold a strike ballot, the essential preliminary to an all-out strike. Mr Zwickel's acceptance of the invitation to meet Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, Gesamtmetall's president, was welcomed by the employers as a 'last chance' to reach a solution. 'We know this is the last stage before open conflict,' Mr Werner Rieck, the Gesamtmetall spokesman, said last night. 'Both sides must sound out their final compromises.' The union leader gave some indication of a readiness to compromise, but within clear limits. He is now merely calling for 'nominal' pay rises, implying that an increase below the forecast 3 per cent inflation rate would be acceptable, rather than the 5.5-6 per cent in the formal pay demand. As far as any changes in working hours are concerned, the union is not prepared to see any open-ended deal to increase the present 36-hour week, as the employers want, but is happy to negotiate a cut in working time. The industry is due to move to a 35-hour week from October, 1995, and Mr Zwickel wants that date brought forward by 18 months, as a measure to stem the rise in unemployment. He also wants a temporary two-year deal allowing individual companies to cut working hours to as little as 30 per week, without full compensation of earnings, in order to reduce their excess capacity during the current recession. In exchange, the union wants plant-level guarantees of no redundancy. Mr Zwickel also suggested a marginal flexibility in terms of longer working hours: instead of averaging a 36-hour week over six months, with individual working weeks of up to 40 hours, the union is ready to see the period extended to 12 months. The employers say that is not the absolute change in the volume of working hours they want. 'Our common goal is to save jobs,' Mr Rieck said. 'It is not possible to do that without cost cuts. There must be flexibility in working hours upwards as well as downwards.' IG Metall fears that the employers are using their arguments for flexibility as a way of undermining the entire concept of a national wage agreement, leading to plant-level bargaining.</p>

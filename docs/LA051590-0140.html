			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 INSIDER-TRADING DEFENDANTS TAKE THE STAND;  </P> <P> TRIAL: A STOCKBROKER AND A PRINTING COMPANY EMPLOYEE IN ONE OF THE CASES  INVOLVING ADVANCE INFORMATION FROM BUSINESS WEEK TESTIFY THAT THEY DID NOT  THINK THEIR ACTIONS WERE ILLEGAL.  </P> <P> The first two men to stand trial in the nationwide Business Week insider  trading scandal took the stand Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,  each claiming that he was completely unaware that what he had done was illegal.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged in a civil insider trading  lawsuit that Brian J. Callahan, a former broker in the Anaheim office of  Prudential-Bache Securities, and William N. Jackson, a former quality control  analyst at a Torrance printing plant, obtained early copies of Business Week  and bought stock based on recommendations in the magazine's "Inside Wall  Street" column.  </P> <P> The SEC charges that Callahan, 30, of Anaheim and several brokerage clients  made illegal profits of $19,684 and that Jackson and two of his brothers made  illegal profits of $19,506. Jackson and Callahan, however, are the only two  defendants in the suit, which is seeking to recover damages equal to three  times the amount of the profits the two men made.  </P> <P> The case is one of several around the country in which the SEC is alleging that  individuals made illicit trades using advance information from a Business Week  stock column. This is the first of the cases, which appear to be unrelated, to  go to trial.  </P> <P> Jackson, 34, of Long Beach testified Monday that he did pick up a copy of  Business Week at his employer -- printer R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons -- about 2  a.m. on Thursdays between September, 1987, and July, 1988. Jackson said he then  read the magazine, including the "Inside Wall Street" column and then would  place orders through Callahan several hours later, after the stock markets  opened in New York.  </P> <P> "I traded Business Week stocks to try and make money," Jackson testified.  "Nobody said it was illegal."  </P> <P> SEC attorneys then showed Jackson a copy of a confidentiality agreement that he  had signed which forbids Donnelley employees from trading on information  gleaned from the company's financial printing business. Donnelley had posted  numerous warnings about insider trading to employees around its plant, the SEC  said.  </P> <P> Jackson said he never saw those posters. He also said he did not think Business  Week was considered financial printing because Donnelley did not take the kind  of extra security precautions such as cordoning off certain areas that it did  with annual reports or proxy statements.  </P> <P> He further testified that he noticed that the prices of stocks in the  magazine's column often went up on Thursdays when he was buying the stock, so  he assumed that the recommendations he was following were public knowledge and  not inside information.  </P> <P> "I was sure it had reached the public because the stock prices went up at least  $1 in some cases," Jackson said. "It was clearly legal."  </P> <P> Callahan testified that he thought that Jackson was getting the recommendations  from a computer program. Callahan said he did not know where Jackson worked  until just a few weeks before the SEC began questioning him in the summer of  1988.  </P> <P> "The stockbroker is first and foremost an order taker," Callahan told the jury.  </P> <P> But Jackson and a mutual friend who introduced the two both testified that they  had told Callahan about Donnelley and the early copies of Business Week.  Callahan said they were "lying."  </P> <P> The SEC produced a Prudential-Bache new-account form that falsely states that  Jackson, rather than working for Donnelley, was employed by Crucible Steel.  Callahan said Jackson told him that; Jackson said Callahan wrote that on the  form.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Kon, a Prudential-Bache broker and former colleague of Callahan,  testified Monday that he went to Prudential-Bache's management after he noticed  that Callahan's stock tips were often the same ones that appeared later in  Business Week.  </P> <P> Callahan, however, testified that he was the individual who notified his  supervisor and that he did so after Jackson told him where he was getting his  information. Callahan was dismissed by Prudential-Bache in August, 1988.  </P> <P> Callahan is a prominent Orange County figure. In the mid-'80s, he contributed a  weekly "Hot Trades" stock summary to the Orange County Register. He has been  fascinated with the stock market since age 11, when his father got him started  with eight shares of Walt Disney Co. He attended Servite High School, a  Catholic boys school in Anaheim, and was graduated from UC Riverside, where he  started an investment club. He and Jackson met in 1985 at the graduation  ceremony of a mutual friend in Long Beach.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEY TO CONDO LIVING? CONFORM AND BE HAPPY  </P> <P> Ah, the joys of living in a community where the worries of home ownership are  limited to the payments thereof. Where your home is a castle protected by the  Knights of the Association. An extended family.  </P> <P> Sometimes overextended. The carefree aspect, the feeling that you no longer  need worry about roof leaks, wall repairs, landscaping -- these are somewhat  balanced by the necessity of reporting to a higher authority for permission to  do things you have always done, no questions asked.  </P> <P> The condominium arrangement may be the answer to the question, "Am I my  brother's keeper?" You now have a father figure (the board president) and lots  of helpful (and watchful) siblings (the committee chairmen). You may not need  dad's permission to drive the car, but you might have to obtain agreement on  where to park it.  </P> <P> Rules and regulations abound; most of them are necessary, of course, for proper  relationships in community living. One must, and should, defer to the will of  the majority when one's actions might infringe on the life quality of others.  But some of the rules seem to be produced in a constant stream, like popcorn  from a popper -- a show of power from those who have it and wield it with zest.  These are the negatives of condo life.  </P> <P> Especially if you live, as I do, in a community with a view; people here, on a  clear day, look out on the blue Pacific. Which makes for more problems than  those faced by folks who live in more mundane areas. In a sea-view community,  everyone is intent on seeing the sea. Some residents, equating view with those  magic words property values, are constantly vigilant against any infringement  of their line of sight to the ocean. Let a blade of grass grow too high, and  the landscape committee gets 12 calls a day. Should a tree push its branch  skyward a few inches past the allowable height, letters of complaint pour in,  with copies to every member of the board, including past officers.  </P> <P> Hew to the rules, and woe to those who transgress. Is that tree, or bush,  planted a few inches into the "common area?" Out with it! No, you cannot put a  nameplate on the door; it would conflict with the conformity of the street.  </P> <P> Conformity is the key word in condominium life. You can be assured that no  one's home will look any better than yours. No one's will look one bit  different. When I arrive on my street (I count five before turning onto the  drive that I think will take me home), I push my garage door opener. If a door  rises, that's my house. (There will be lots of screaming if someone else has a  door-opener on the same frequency as mine.)  </P> <P> I hope someone in our community will propose the following resolution:  </P> <P> 1) In order to meet the requirements of uniformity in our community, and to  eliminate the unsightly effects of variations, be it hereby resolved that the  board of directors, in open session, limit the residents of the area to those  of a standard height, weight and hair color. At some future date, a committee  will decide on a common name for all people in the area, so that mailbox name  plates can be properly matching in appearance. All vehicles, of course, will be  of the same manufacture, model and color, since the sight of unmatched autos  detracts from the beauty of our area.  </P> <P> 2) To protect our view of the sea, there shall be no kite flying, regardless of  the height of the kite. Cars with high antennas and the wearing of hats shall  be prohibited. A special ad hoc committee will investigate the possibility of  installing retractable foliage, with control buttons to be installed in each  home. Owners will be required to train dogs not to wag their tails in the air.  </P> <P> These suggestions are, of course, intended to conform to our Rules and  Regulations, which are outlined in a book as large as the family Bible. Like  the Bible, the rules are subject to interpretation, according to the bias of  the reader. Any action taken by board or committee can be justified by a  judicious reading of some page or paragraph.  </P> <P> But fear not, folks; we are well protected. Every condominium board of  directors has a Mr. Veto to watch out for the interests of the masses. Superman  against the entrenched leadership. If a proposal is accepted by the  authorities, Mr. Veto looks for flaws -- sometimes he will even vehemently  oppose a mode of action he himself has proposed.  </P> <P> The committee chairmen include some interesting types, too. Like the ones who,  in their zest to "make this the best place in the area," will spend funds so  fast that they risk Chapter 11. Someone's gate needs a new doorknob? This is a  great time to replace all the knobs in the area. Hey, why not put on new doors,  too? If a yellow traffic line is being painted on the street, it's a major task  to keep these guys from specifying gold leaf.  </P> <P> Luckily for our bank account, these types are balanced by their opposite type  -- the protectors of the purse. They dispense the association money as if it  were the last drop of water on a 1,000-mile desert hike. The doorknob is  faulty? Just leave the door open. Front gates coming apart? Gee whiz, a board  nailed across the front will make it good as new.  </P> <P> Differences of opinion are usually argued out vehemently, then conciliated by  that other necessary individual, the Open Mind. Able to see all sides of all  questions, he manages to keep opposing sides below the level of explosion.  </P> <P> Tranquility is one of the primary aims of our association. To achieve this  noble end, the board always has the final say. Unfortunately, it usually  decides in favor of the side which is most vehement.  </P> <P> Especially if the dreaded 'S' word is heard. The phrase, "I'll sue," reduces  the bravest, most outspoken members of the board to cuddly balls of fluff --  however ridiculous the claim or flimsy the case. Suddenly that collection of  regulations is no longer relevant, and the threatening claimant can accomplish  almost anything.  </P> <P> The vast majority of the population of a condominium community, of course, does  not go to such extremes in dealing with "management." They do not threaten  lawsuits or bring objections to one board meeting after another. They do things  the condominium way; they just ignore the regulation. No parking on the east  side of the street? Who says so? Management? Well, let management park where it  wants; we'll park where we prefer. It's independent people like these who built  our country. I think they have all ended up in our condominium complex.  </P> <P> Yes, life in Condoland is frustrating, troublesome, argumentative. But there is  a positive side -- a bonding of people with a common purpose. Even those among  us who present the most intrusive ideas are, in most cases, acting in what they  believe are the best interests of all the residents (well, all except that guy  down the street). And because of this common interest -- common ownership of a  big part of what makes up our property value -- there is the opportunity,  almost the necessity, for "getting together." Meaning that we meet people we  would never have met, make friends we would never have had.  </P> <P> Never have I met so large a group of people ready to help in a time of need.  </P> <P> I love it here.  </P></p>

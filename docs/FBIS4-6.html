			<p>SUMMARY                                   Pyongyang has used the occasion of rejecting a UN statement on  the North Korean nuclear inspection issue to reinforce its  earlier hints of a willingness to negotiate with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the issue.  However,  North Korea also warned that should the United States persists in  applying "pressure" on the DPRK, it would resume reprocessing  activities.                                 END SUMMARY      Pyongyang seems to be underscoring an earlier hint that it might  be willing to try to resolve its differences with the IAEA in  talks with the IAEA itself.  This new hint of openness to DPRK-  IAEA talks came in a 4 April DPRK-Foreign Ministry spokesman's  statement ostensibly designed to reject a statement by the  president of the UN Security Council calling on the DPRK to allow  IAEA inspectors to complete their unfinished inspection  activities in North Korea (Pyongyang radio, 4 April).  While  accusing the UN Security Council of "politicizing" the North  Korean nuclear issue, the spokesman's statement contended that,  whatever "differences of views" that may have arisen in the  course of recent IAEA inspections of North Korean nuclear  facilities, they should be settled "strictly between" the IAEA  and the "inspected country."      The 4 April North Korean statement, in line with most earlier  North Korean pronouncements on the nuclear issue, also contained  a threat that seemed designed to show that Pyongyang will not  back down under U.S. pressure.  Thus the statement accused the  United States and "some Western powers" of using the UN Security  Council as a forum to apply pressure on Pyongyang, claiming that  the Security Council based its discussions on the "unjust and  biased" findings of the IAEA Board of Governors.  Once again  blaming Washington for "deliberately aggravating" the situation  in its quest to "crush" Pyongyang, the statement warned that  Washington's "total reliance" on pressure tactics has given  Pyongyang "no choice but to conduct" unspecified "peaceful  nuclear activities" that it had "unilaterally frozen" in order to  promote high-level bilateral talks with Washington.  Those  nuclear activities presumably include the refueling of the  controversial 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, with resultant  spent fuel made available for plutonium extraction.  The  statement, however, failed to call for concrete action on  anyone's part.(SEE NOTE)      (NOTE: By contrast, the 10 April 1993 Foreign Ministry  spokesman's statement that was issued in reply to an 8 April 1993  UN Security Council president's statement on the North Korean  nuclear issue called on the Security Council to take "practical  measures" to promote direct negotiations between Pyongyang and  Washington to resolve the issue.)      Implications     The absence of a call for specific action in the  Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement seemed designed to convey  the impression that Pyongyang, having urged Washington to take  unspecified steps to restore the "foundation" of bilateral talks,  is awaiting Washington's next move.

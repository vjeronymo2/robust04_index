Although [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua does not  want to admit officially that he benefited a great deal from the  work accomplished by his predecessor, Pierre Joxe, the  institutional boil has been lanced and the nationalist family  has exploded. One cannot help but notice that the government's  continuity of attitude toward Corsica scorns changeovers. By  formally establishing the islands specific nature in terms of  fiscal structure and language, Edouard Balladur has once again  shown that the "center" is intelligent enough to make  concessions to its "periphery." The reason of state includes  that kind of common sense.    However, nothing has yet been signed and sealed. The fate of  Messrs. Balladur and Pasqua's gentle approach still depends on  two unknowns. The first unknown stems from the reception given  it by the nationalists. It is obvious now that the government  has taken over part of their rhetoric on the "Corsica issue" --  the part that can be best reconciled with the imperative of the  "unity of the Republic" -- so that it can do a better job toning  down its originality. After playing the game so far, could they  accept -- in the long term -- this kind of erosion of their  ideological capital?    The reaction of "A Cuncolta Naziunaliste," a legal movement  close to the historic FLNC-Canal [Corsica National Liberation  Front], denouncing the "appearances of change" and the "reality  of dependence," bears witness to genuine confusion. The state  most certainly provides less opportunity for their criticism  than during the touchy Jacobin period, but there is nothing to  say that these nationalists will not rebound off other  resentments and, in particular, the blunders that could be made  by their local opponents. That is the second unknown. Will the  traditionalist elected representatives, who bear a great deal of  responsibility for the troubles afflicting the island, be up to  the task? While the guerilla war surrounding the succession of  Jean-Paul de Rocca Serra, the RPR [Rally for the Republic]  speaker of the Corsica Assembly, gets under way, will they yield  to the poisoned delicacy of the "combinazione" [combination]  which they habitually delight in, thus letting precious time  slip away? Will they make good use of the 3 billion francs  which Paris and Brussels are going to shower on them between now  and the end of the decade?    The past tends more toward skepticism, and we can understand  that Mr. Pasqua wants to hasten the change of generations.  Otherwise, the nationalists, which have always lived on the  denunciation of the "clan," will find an unexpected mainstay in  it.</p>

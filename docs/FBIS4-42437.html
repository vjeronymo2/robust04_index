			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Roberto Poletti at Cortina on 1 June: "Professor Miglio? An  Attack of Arteriosclerosis"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Poletti] Mr. Bossi, what can  one say! You certainly know that this morning [Northern League  ideologue] Miglio invited people not to vote for the League, but  to place their trust in the federalists campaigning in the other  parties.    [Bossi] Yes, but this does not affect me. Look, given that  we are in Cortina, I will use suitable terms of comparison, to  enable you to understand me better. The League is the big  mountain, Miglio the little stone in the stream who believes he  can destroy it. Therefore, Miglio is no more than a poor deluded  man.    [Poletti] And in this context, what is [Prime Minister]  Berlusconi?    [Bossi] The old man who cannot be older.    [Poletti] Miglio does not think this way....    [Bossi] The poor man. I just wish him good health.    [Poletti] In other words?    [Bossi] Nothing, simply that he is suffering from a  hyperchronic form of arteriosclerosis which has led him recently  to perform some equestrian circus tricks.    [Poletti] Now the test of the European elections is coming  up  for you.    [Bossi] We shall certainly do well. The fact is the European  Parliament does not, in fact, exist. It is nothing more than a  fiction. In fact we are sending an important mayor there in the  person of Formentini, because Strasbourg serves him as a  sounding box. Nothing more.    [Poletti] If you will excuse the comment, Berlusconi seems  to  be slightly more pro-European than you, at least in his  intentions....    [Bossi] Come on. If there really did exist a European  Parliament able to pass legislation -- and hence to operate --  his dealings would have no place, he would have his hands tied.  A European Parliament which really had life in it, he would not  think twice about bringing it to you on TV. And he would have  to given up everything. These recycled Forza Italia people have  every interest in putting their hands on Europe as well,  precisely in order to prevent the community mechanism from  working.    [Poletti] And our own Parliament, will it be able to work if  you begin quarreling every day?    [Bossi] Things will go well when all the others have  disappeared. The old faces, the recycled people, those who  place indifference to politics in front of ideals.    [Poletti] Berlusconi, I imagine....    [Bossi] All the recycled persons, in general. Those who want  to place a brake on the process of renewing this country. Those  who tolerate the existence of a magistrature which is rotten to  the core.    [Poletti] We are here at Cortina, in the mountains of Pope  Luciani [John Paul I]. Someone has said that you two have one  thing in common. Both of you have had a very brief pontificate.  Does saying this to decree the end of Bossi strike you as  blasphemous? And then, are Bossi and the League finished?    [Bossi] The facts will tell. For the League I foresee  success in the future. We will grow further. Absolutely. I  have come here precisely to reassure my people. And to make  sure that we force those who have come into politics to make  promises and to keep them all, from the first to the last.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (1): A choice of power - and the power of choice / The European Commissioners are frustrated over the slowness of electricity deregulation. Utilities say they are widening customers' choice but they also have other priorities Viewed from the lofty heights of the European Commission, electricity must seem one of the slowest, most obdurate industries imaginable. But the companies which make up the European power industry regard themselves as part of a fast moving world in which some will struggle to keep pace. Both sides have a point. The Brussels view reflects the Commissioners' severe difficulties in deregulating the electricity and gas sectors. While they have successfully pushed through the liberalisation of telecommunications and aviation, energy has successfully resisted serious reform. Most power companies fear the consequences both for themselves and their customers, and some are backed by their governments. But change is on the way. A small but growing number of European countries, both in and outside the EU, are opening up their electricity markets. The deregulation process in many cases has been prompted by privatisation of public utilities. Countries that have already privatised or intend to privatise parts of their power networks include the UK, Italy, Portugal, Hungary and the Czech Republic. However, even in countries which have not introduced privatisation, electricity companies face a series of tough challenges. These challenges will be under review at this week's triennial conference in Birmingham of the Union of Electricity Producers and Distributors (Unipede). The 1,000 delegates, mainly European, will also be only too aware of the contrasting growth prospects of eastern and western European countries and the attendant problems of environmental pollution. The industry faces five main issues: eastern Europe. The former Soviet-bloc countries, having broken with command economy principles, need western allies to invest in new plants as they embark on far-reaching modernisation programmes. The Czech Republic, for example, is likely to invite foreign companies to take shares of 15 per cent in its regional distribution companies later this year or next. internationalisation: this trend is growing as western companies find their own markets saturated and seek opportunities in other countries, east and west. Share swaps are possible and the trend should help the idea of a pan-European inter-connected grid. costs: public concern about pollution and nuclear safety, especially in central and eastern Europe, is raising costs at a time when consumers demand greater price transparency and the lowest possible tariffs. Western countries and companies are helping through means such as the European Energy charter, agreed by 49 states and the European Union in 1991. The charter provides a framework for western investment in central and eastern europe and for exchanges of technology. health scares: there have been widespread fears about a possible link between cancer and electric and magnetic fields (EMF) associated with high-voltage grid lines. Industry-sponsored research has found that there is no link between EMF and cancer but a growing number of cases are coming to court. deregulation: important though all of these factors are for the future of the sector, the issue which will cause most controversy and potentially make the largest impact is deregulation within the European Union. Until recently, virtually every European power company operated as a monopoly, and most were restricted from expanding outside their core business. The UK Conservative government broke this mould when it split up the mammoth Central Electricity Generating Board as a prelude to privatisation of the whole industry. The cause of reform was taken up in earnest by the Commission in the early 1990s. It has no view on whether privatisation is a good or bad thing but it argues that a single European market only makes sense if competition can be applied to electricity and gas. 'It is clearly unfair for industries in energy-intensive sectors like chemicals or metals to be obliged to compete without having access to energy on similar conditions,' Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, director-general in the competition directorate, told a recent conference. 'It is the competitiveness of the whole European industry which is at stake.' The Commission is pushing for a system called negotiated third party access (TPA) which would cajole monopoly suppliers to open up their grid networks to enable trade between large industrial power consumers and another power supplier. The system's many opponents, including most companies, most countries and most MEPs, argue that such a market would be unable to discharge public service obligations such as guarantees of supplies and uniform prices. Electricite de France, the French state utility, fears that long term planning would be made more difficult, endangering plans to build nuclear power plants. Electrabel, one of Belgium's electricity companies, agrees that TPA would make planning difficult and that the Commission is going too quickly. It says an essential precondition for deregulation should be the harmonisation of environmental and fiscal conditions in the countries, claiming that otherwise some countries would have an unfair advantage over others. The Commission and TPA opponents may reach a compromise later this year around a so-called single purchaser system, through which one body independent of the host generator would be responsible for selling electricity. TPA opponents say this would maintain the integrity of the system. TPA supporters, however, say that it would have little impact since it would not enable consumers to deal directly with companies other than the host supplier. The original draft directive has already been considerbly diluted after intervention from the European Parliament. The Commission had originally proposed that companies should have an automatic right to a network, rather than a negotiated right. Some feel it would be better to wait for reform to gather pace. At the last meeting of EU energy ministers in May, the Italians, Spanish and Irish representatives hinted they were considering ways to liberalise their markets, although they did not say how. Another change is the growing number of countries setting up independent grid networks. An essential pre-requisite of a competitive system is to run the grid system separately from the power producers, either through separate accounting or through splitting up the electricity companies. Whereas five years ago there were no separate grid companies there are now five. The pressure for change will be boosted by the expected integration of the union of the Nordic countries with the continental network. Norway, Sweden and Finland either have liberal regimes for electricity or plan to introduce them. Further ahead, some central European states might prove to be allies for the liberalisers. Poland, for example, has already separated the three arms of its electricity system. In the near future, however, much will depend on the German government which assumes presidency of the European Union next month. In recent months, parts of the Bonn administration have been pushing for third party access in Germany as a means of bringing down power prices. That, however, would cause significant political problems with France which has much cheaper electricity prices for industrial consumers. One German electricity executive says: 'We are fighting with all our might against liberalisation of the European power industry. But at the same time we have no choice but to prepare for it.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Radoje Djukic, minister for private enterprise in  the Serbian Government, attended a joint meeting of the private  enterprise council of the Belgrade Economic Chamber, a group of  private companies, an executive committee of the association  Nova Privreda, as well as other general associations of  Belgrade's independent companies. The topic of the meeting was  the program of work of the Ministry for Private Enterprise.  Vesna Tenjovic reports:    [Begin recording] [Tenjovic] The first task of the Ministry  for Private Enterprise will be above all the revision of the  taxation laws and the creation of a long-term tax system,  Minister Radoje Djukic said. Our goal will be, Djukic  emphasized, to reorganize all departments selectively to  facilitate work for as many people as possible. The  rationalization of the state administration is under way as the  economic program also envisages the reconstruction of the state.    Minister Djukic said that three sectors will function within  the ministry -- a sector for singular, private, and individual  enterprise, a sector for development and promotion of this  department, and a powerful legal sector.    There are approximately 400,000 private entrepreneurs in  Serbia. For this reason we must create a more favorable climate  for their work and then the foreign investors will come by  themselves.    Promising that the government will persist in the  implementation of the economic recovery, by which the economy  will after the abolition of sanctions integrate easier into the  world economy, Minister Djukic had the following message for the  entrepreneurs:    [Djukic] As I have said, until we have dealt with the  problem of fundamental and system solutions -- decrees and law  -- in case of excessive situations I am always free for you to  call me to resolve them ad hoc. President of the EU  entrepreneurial community Mr. (Jeanrou), who was a guest of the  Serbian Government, replied when asked by reporters what he  would do had he been in Djukic's shoes, that he would call upon  all the entrepreneurs to violate sanctions. Therefore, I also  call to violate sanctions just as you have done so far. [end  recording]</p>

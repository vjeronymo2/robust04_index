This would provide a basis for surmounting the present  economic crisis in Moldova, Snegur told U.S. Congress expert  Sergio Verona in Chisinau on Monday.    But Moldova would join no political or military CIS  treaties,  for it wanted to remain "genuinely neutral," he said.    Going over to the problem of Transdniestria, Snegur said the  leaders of the mainly Russian-speaking enclave refused to start  a dialogue with the Moldovan government, since the latter  rejected their idea of confederative structure for Moldova.    Commenting on Moldova's relations with Romania, Snegur said  those advocating unification between Moldova and Romania  "thereby put up obstacles to the economic and cultural mutual  integration of the two states."</p>

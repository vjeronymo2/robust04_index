The delegation from the Kingdom of Cambodia, led by First  Prime Minister Samdech Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime  Minister Hun Sen, arrived here yesterday on an official visit.    Ranariddh thanked China for its aid to Cambodia, on behalf  of  the Cambodian Government.    Jiang said the visit by the two prime ministers showed that  the Cambodian Government pays much attention to its friendly and  cooperative relations with China.    The visit, a great event in bilateral relations, will  promote  mutual understanding and friendship, Jiang said.    Ranariddh said his delegation held fruitful talks with  Premier Li Peng yesterday, and hoped that the visit would  further consolidate and improve Sino-Cambodian relations.    Jiang said that Cambodia's transition from a 20-year-long  war  to a period of peaceful reconstruction brought light to the  Cambodian people's common will and was also in line with the  major trend of peace and development in the region.    Jiang said the Chinese Government sincerely hopes that the  Cambodian Government will cherish the hard-won peace, further  advance the process of national reconciliation and mobilize all  the Cambodian people to build up their country.    Ranariddh said that though facing difficulties, the  Cambodians are optimistic about their future.    Under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk, they will  build Cambodia into a country of independence, sovereignty,  territorial integrity and prosperity, Ranariddh added.    Jiang described King Sihanouk as the beloved leader of the  Cambodian people and respected friend of the Chinese people,  adding that he had made indelible contributions to Cambodia's  independence.    Earlier today, the Cambodian guests laid a wreath at the  Monument to the People's Heroes and paid their respects to the  remains of Chairman Mao Zedong. They also inspected two  factories in Beijing.    They are scheduled to visit the Hainan island province in  south China tomorrow.</p>

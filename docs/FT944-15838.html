			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Analysts delve into lucky dip of retail statistics Easy profits are out, the canny consumer is king. That is the main message from the retail sector as it prepares to enter the crucial Christmas trading season. But the question that will be raised this week, as a new set of retail data is published, is how far this cautious consumer mentality is affecting sales  -and with it the tools used to measure retail behaviour. For with consumers adjusting to a new low-inflation environment, and the nature of the retail sector itself changing, making sense of the various sets of consumer data on offer is becoming an increasingly complex task. For example, the official retail sales data, to be published by the Central Statistical Office on Thursday, suggest that retail sales grew steadily this year on the back of the recovery amid heavy price competition, but fell back in August. Some analysts suspect this dip was due to the summer holiday. But others say that it points to a broader slowdown, not least because the Confederation of British Industry's survey of distributive traders, published tomorrow, has recently been adopting a more sober tone. The CSO's consumer spending data, which is published on a quarterly basis, is even more downbeat. It suggests sales of non-durable goods started to drop as early as the spring. This, however, would appear to be at odds with the Bank of England's data on the level of notes and coins in circulation, previously a good guide to consumer spending. These have been showing strong growth this year. Meanwhile consumer credit data, published last week, put borrowing at a record high. For some economists this implies that there might be shortcomings in the official statistics, not least because many retailers say their experiences differ from the findings in the official data. Mr Harry Moore, chief executive of Co-operative Retail Services, which has a variety of retail outlets including supermarkets and department stores, said he had little confidence in the figures. He said: 'I often ask myself where the devil do they get these figures from? I can't make head or tail of them. There is virtually no food inflation, for example, but we are not aware of any consumer confidence.' Mr Clive Vaughan, retail analyst at Verdict, the market research group, has been puzzled and frustrated by the data in recent months. However, economists such as Mr Chris Dillow of Nomura Research, disagree. He said: 'I think the retail data is pretty good.' The signals all appeared to be pointing to a temporary slowdown in spending as the tax increases took effect. Nevertheless, the real problem that may be confronting economists is that tracking consumer behaviour is particularly difficult because of broader changes occurring in this recovery. On the one hand, the nature of the retail sector is changing as large retailers gain market share at the expense of smaller ones and more retailers become multisector outlets. Meanwhile, as last week's inflation data showed, underlying inflation is at a record low, affecting retailers' perceptions and consumer behaviour. The CSO collects its retail sales figures from about 5,000 retailers, of which the bigger retailers generally account for most overall sales. Mr Philip Gooding, CSO statistician, insists that the survey is representative. But Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The official data do seem to hide the situation of smaller retailers.' Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, said this might explain the recent puzzling trends in food retailsales, which were showing annual volume growth of more than 5 per cent, far higher than other sectors. This might reflect the fact that big chains have been gaining market share because of supermarket price wars, he said. 'The CSO is almost certainly capturing the entire gains in market share by the large retailers, but it may be missing some of the small retailers' losses,' he said. Analysis is made even harder because the CSO collects only a limited commodity breakdown. But if the official retail sales data are faced with the problem of shifting market shares, surveys such as the CBI series face other problems. Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate economic director, believes low inflation may lead some shopkeepers to understate their sales volumes because heavy discounting leaves retailers with a particularly gloomy impression of business. In the long term, Mr Junankar says, the CBI survey - which covers 15,000 outlets - and the retail sales data have tended to track each other. But observers such as Mr May remain cynical. 'Our feeling is that the CBI tends to get it wrong nine times out of 10,' he said. This discounting environment may also be affecting other series. Most analysts believe the recent rise in the level of notes and coins in circulation reflects the fact that low interest rates and inflation make it more attractive to hold cash. Meanwhile, the recent surge in consumer credit may reflect the fact that consumers are taking advantage of cheap financing. Faced with this problem, most analysts conclude that the best solution to the discrepancies is the most obvious - to use a basket of indicators. As Mr David Mackie of JP Morgan points out, although the data might sometimes seem to be at odds, the sheer variety represents something of a luxury. Spending on services represents almost half of consumer spending but data on this sector is limited. Consequently the biggest mystery that may be confronting economists as they try to make sense of consumer behaviour this autumn may not be what is happening in the retail sector  - but what is going on in all the other non-retail areas as well.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Skachko under the rubric "Point of </F> View": "They Have Started Over, Apparently, With More Success"]    [Text] Since there has been no official interpretation, we  should recall, in an elementary manner, the texts of documents  concerning the problem under examination in order to figure out  what kind of decree our Supreme Council adopted on 3 February of  this year and in order to try to analyze the consequences of  this step for all: the text of the decree of 3 February itself,  the text of the Supreme Council decree on the ratification of  the START-1 treaty, dated 18 November 1993, and Article V of the  Lisbon Protocol to the START-1 treaty, dated 28 May 1992. It is  this particular sequence of documents that is important, no  matter what chronological view we take. So, let us have  everything in order: As the 3 February decree says, it cancels  reservations concerning the article of the Lisbon Protocol which  are found in the decree of the Supreme Council dated 18 November  1993. We look at this document and find that the article  mentioned is referred to only in its reservation 3: "Ukraine  does not consider Article V of the Lisbon Protocol binding on  it." This is all. However, 12 more reservations remain! The  article of the protocol itself says that Ukraine must join the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (DNYaZ) as a nonnuclear state.    So, how does it look? Last November our deputies disagreed  with the Lisbon wording of the status of Ukraine and made  reservations that would guarantee to Ukraine its true status as  the owner of the nuclear weapons that have ended up on its  territory, national security, and fair compensation for nuclear  disarmament which is beyond the resources of our economy. In the  process, the START-1 treaty was ratified, but neither the United  States nor Russia recognized this fact because of the  parliamentary reservations.    In keeping with reservation 11 of 18 November, President L.  Kravchuk began negotiation efforts, and the trilateral statement  of 14 January 1994 appeared. If for no other reason, this  document was interesting, to put it mildly, because nothing was  given or guaranteed to Ukraine, but almost everything that the  reservations of the parliament called for was promised. So, by  adopting the 3 February decree, the Ukrainian Supreme Council  actually responded to a promise of guarantees and assistance  with a promise-consent to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty as a nonnuclear state. It ended up being a promise by  Washington and Moscow in exchange for a promise by Kiev because,  first, Article V of the Lisbon Protocol does not provide for  Ukraine joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty urgently and  automatically. Second, the preamble to the decree of 3 February  says that Ukraine is the owner of the components of nuclear  weapons on its territory (see the ninth paragraph of the decree:  This is our status as viewed by Ukraine). Third, I repeat,  another 12 reservations remain in the November decree which call  for the signing of at least 10 state-to-state agreements and  other documents. They are supposed to regulate the problems of  international guarantees of the national security of Ukraine,  economic, scientific-technical, and financial assistance in the  process of nuclear disarmament, manufacturer warranty servicing  of Ukrainian missiles by Russian specialists, a review of  conditions and financing for inspection efforts, opportunities  to use launch silos for peaceful purposes, conditions for the  use of weapons materials from the liquidated nuclear weapons,  and compensation for them. The issues of compensation for  tactical nuclear weapons, the schedule for transferring  strategic missiles to Russia, conditions for this process,  control over dismantling, and so on are to be coordinated  separately. In a word, everything is envisioned that our  government was obligated to do in Point 2 of the decree of 3  February. Only after these conditions are met will Ukraine be  prepared to get rid of nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear country with an easy  heart.    So, it is already possible to say that by agreeing to join  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the Supreme Council of  Ukraine has now confronted the United States and Russia with a  choice of either failing to listen to Ukrainian demands in the  future, too, and bringing pressure to bear on Ukraine, pursuing  a policy of double standards in view of an indulgent attitude  toward the so-called "threshold" states which are prepared to  acquire nuclear weapons; or concluding the agreements envisioned  in the January trilateral statement as soon as possible and  satisfying everyone. At any rate, our parliament, with  astonishing success, has let everybody understand this: If you  help Ukraine you will win; if you bring it to its knees, you  will win, too, but it could be a pyrrhic victory. This may be  the greatest achievement of our parliament in the foreign arena  on 3 February.    There also were domestic achievements, because the Supreme  Council seriously dimmed the halo of the president as the only  supporter of nuclear disarmament in the Ukrainian ruling elite,  testified yet again that all branches of power are to blame for  the critical condition of the Ukrainian state, and obligated  executive power headed by the president to sign advantageous  agreements on the issues of nuclear disarmament, which it put  under strict parliamentary control. At present, the "more  compliant" president and the "noncompliant" Supreme Council are  together. However, the mutual relations between the two branches  of power are another topic....</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The troubled Peach Bottom nuclear plant in Delta, Pa., will use everything from  less comfortable chairs to a new shift rotation to prevent a recurrence of  control room operators sleeping on duty, officials said. About 60 reporters  were handed hard hats, goggles and tiny radiation monitors as Philadelphia  Electric Co., operator of the dormant plant on the Susquehanna River, conducted  its first media tour of the facility. The utility is trying to convince the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission that things have changed since the NRC ordered  the two Peach Bottom reactors shut down in March, 1987, because of widespread  sleeping and horseplay on the job by control room workers. The problems  resulted in a $1.25-million fine, largest in NRC history. Operator negligence  was so pervasive that the commission also levied fines ranging from $500 to  $1,000 against 33 current and former workers for "sleeping and-or inattention  to duty."  </P></p>

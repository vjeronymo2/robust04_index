			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] In what is some of the first reaction to suspensions  by the five groups comprising the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front], the People's Revitalizing Expression [ERP]  described the measure as arbitrary, adding that the suspension  of Joaquin Villalobos and seven deputies means their expulsion  from the party. ERP Deputy Juan Ramon Medrano dismissed the  decision by the FMLN leaders, saying it has no legal validity.    [Begin recording] [Medrano] We deplore the decision. Talk of  suspensions amounts to talking of expulsion.    [Reporter Mario Jovel] According to Juan Ramon Medrano, the  decision by the Communist Party of El Salvador [PCES], PRCT  [Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers], and the FPL  [Farabundo Marti Popular Liberation Forces] lacks validity  because it was made without the total consensus of the FMLN.  The ERP members said they did not attend Monday's extraordinary  assembly because the sole purpose was to put them on trial.    [Medrano] We call on the other side to not throw a tantrum,  literally, and to not put us on trial and tell us that they are  going to punish us for having political differences. Instead,  they should realize the political reality is different. The war  ended a few years ago. Society now needs people with a capacity  for understanding.    [Jovel] Medrano indicated there is no unity pact in the FMLN  because it ended with the war, and, therefore, now there is a  need for a new understanding.    [Medrano] An alliance pact has become necessary since the  agreements were signed because, since then, we have permanently  and consistently had these two-against-three divisions.    [Jovel] In the opinion of this organization, it is up to the  other forces within the FMLN to decide whether they will retain  a party in which the Marxist-Leninist vertical command structure  prevails, which for the EPR is no longer valid, or whether they  will make an alliance in which there is respect for the  democratic principles of all the factions. [end recording]    The National Resistance [RN], another of the groups affected  by the FMLN decision, said the suspension of eight leaders from  the FMLN Political Commission will heighten the internal crisis  of that leftist party. According to Eduardo Sancho, RN  secretary general and former guerrilla, the measure eschews  internal debate in the FMLN and limits democratic maneuvering  room to redefine the party's role.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Julian Melendez] The FMLN  internal debate went beyond the limits of tolerance. On Monday,  9 May, Eduardo Sancho, one of the FMLN deputies accused of  treason for taking the post of secretary of the Legislative  Assembly's Board of Directors, opposed the decision by the FPL,  PCES, and PRCT to suspend him and six [as heard] other deputies  from the party leadership.    [Sancho] The suspension lacks any legal or political  validity. We will continue serving as deputies and members of  the Board of Directors. I believe the FMLN has fallen under the  control of a very conservative view.    [Melendez] Hours earlier, Sancho, accompanied by RN leaders,  said the FMLN problems are based on its lack of identity, but  never on disciplinary aspects. In the former guerrilla's  opinion, what is at stake is the democratization of the FMLN.    [Sancho] I believe this is not the way to democratize a  country. A country is not democratized with those kinds  disciplinary measures. That is no the way to teach a people who  must get ready for big debates on the nation's problems.    [Melendez] The splintering within the FMLN grows every day,  but nobody wants to emerge from the crisis as a loser. The five  leftist parties are betting that they will maintain the  representation of the party. [end recording]</p>

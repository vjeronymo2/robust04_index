			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Contentious clauses may evade debate - Pensions reform The government's intention to introduce sweeping legislation to bring sex equality into state pensions and 'security, equality and choice' into occupational and personal pensions was announced in a single sentence. But the bill is likely to be one of the biggest introduced into parliament in recent years. The pensions industry expects it to include up to 140 clauses and to take until next autumn to become law. Industry officials are saying that some of the most contentious parts of the legislation - setting out how it is to be applied - may not be debated during the bill's passage through parliament, but instead be covered by secondary legislation, regulations from the Department of Social Security or 'guidance notes' from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, a non-governmental professional body. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social security committee, expressed concern yesterday that some crucial provisions, such as minimum solvency, would not be subject to political debate. Mr Field said the government could issue statutory instruments in advance so that MPs could know exactly how it intended to apply vague provisions of the legislation. In particular, the bill may not include the specifics of a new 'minimum solvency requirement' which will require pension schemes to have enough assets to pay accrued pension benefits if they are wound up immediately. How the value of those assets is to be calculated is the subject of acrimonious debate, with employers saying the plans will impose significant costs on schemes. Actuaries are questioning whether a lower-cost alternative being considered will go far enough to offer the security recommended by the government's advisory body, the Pension Law Review Committee. Ms Penny Webster, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said: 'My concern is that, depending on what solution is adopted, it could be misleading.' The main points of the legislation are: To raise the age at which women are eligible to receive state pension payments to 65 to match that of men. To give effect in domestic legislation to recent rulings from the European Court of Justice requiring employers to offer equal pension benefits to men and women. To simplify arrangements for contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, including abolishing the alternative Guaranteed Minimum Pension. Instead, employers will have to demonstrate that they offer benefits broadly equal to those obtainable under Serps to be eligible to receive rebates of National Insurance contributions. To require all occupational and personal pensions to pay benefits which rise in value each year by at least 5 per cent or the retail prices index, whichever is lower. To introduce age-related rebates of National Insurance contributions for those with personal pensions or who are members of employer-sponsored Contracted Out Money Purchase Schemes. This is intended to discourage those who opt out at a young age, when the value of the flat-rate rebate is highest, from going back in when they are older. To give greater flexibility in converting pension investments into annuities. This could help those who retire when interest rates are in a trough - they would otherwise have to buy annuities at the top of the market, earning lower retirement benefits. To put in place the recommendations of the white paper on occupational pension reform. This includes the controversial minimum solvency standard as well as an equally controversial proposal requiring companies to have member-elected trustees.</p>

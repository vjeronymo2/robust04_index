			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Investcorp leads Dollars 450m bid for Circle K INVESTCORP, the internat-ional bank formed in 1982 as a conduit for Arab money into western industry, is leading a group of investors in a Dollars 450m bid to acquire Circle K, the second biggest US convenience store chain. The chain has been operating under bankruptcy protection since 1990. Investcorp has invested in several other US retail ventures including Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany's. Under the terms of a reorganisation plan, filed by Circle K in the US bankruptcy court on Friday, Investcorp and its associated investors have agreed to pay Dollars 425m in cash, and an additional Dollars 30m after the deal has been closed. Some liabilities would also be assumed by the investors, including Spain's Corporacion CNL and the US property developers RAK Development. All Circle K's common and preferred stock would be cancelled and new shares of common stock would be issued by the purchaser. Under the plan, the net acquisition proceeds will be shared among the remaining creditors based on the priority of their claims. Mr Bart Brown, Circle K chairman, said the plan had two primary advantages. 'First, it would provide our creditor groups with substantial value, in cash; and second, it would enable the company to continue as a vigorous competitor in the convenience store industry.' Circle K ran into trouble in the 1980s after it took on Dollars 1.1bn of debt during a six-year expansion programme aimed at quadrupling its store base to more than 4,600. The company was also hit by strong competition from petrol companies which installed convenience stores at their outlets. In December, Circle K put forward a business plan which included cutting its store base to 2,200 from 3,776 and withdrawing from 14 of the 32 states where it has operations. Mr John Antioco, the company's recently-appointed president, said: 'We are continuing to take new steps to streamline operations, revamp and remodel facilities and remake Circle K into a leaner, more efficient, more profitable company with excellent prospects and enhanced opportunities for employees in the future.' The reorganisation plan is subject to acceptance by creditors and equity holders, confirmation under the bankruptcy code and consummation of the stock purchase agreement.</p>

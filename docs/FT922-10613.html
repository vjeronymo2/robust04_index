			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Marzotto declines 12% MARZOTTO, the Italian textiles and clothing group which last year bought control of Germany's Hugo Boss, reported a 12 per cent fall in group net profits to L39.8bn (Dollars 31.9m) last year from L45.4bn in 1990, writes Haig Simonian. Earnings at parent company level fell 28 per cent to L25.3bn. The decline prompted a L70 dividend cut to L280 a share for ordinary shares, L300 for convertible savings shares and L340 for non-convertible savings stock.</p>

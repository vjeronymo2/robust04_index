In an exclusive interview with JORNAL DO  BRASIL, Itamar recognized that the salary dispute among the  three branches marks the "most worrisome crisis" of his  administration, clearly establishing that there is confrontation  among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches -- the  latter two having approved wage increases that contradict that  established by Provisional Measure 434 which created the URV  [Real Value Unit].    "The Chamber of Deputies decision to reject the veto was  extremely stupid and greatly insensitive," President Itamar  said. "The judicial branch decision was illegal because it goes  against the Provisional Measure [PM]." The president said this  the day after presiding over a tense cabinet meeting, which  lasted three and a half hours at Planalto Palace. It was  attended by 14 ministers, including the military ministers. "The  balance among the three branches has been harmed," the president  said, recalling the harsh official note he released after the  meeting. "The current concern is not over the military, but  over the country," the president said, in an almost hoarse tone  which is a reminder of his recent flu.    President Itamar says the people cannot once again lose the  chance of defeating inflation due to isolated decisions like  that of the judicial branch, which would affect the government  budget and the executive branch's determination to implement the  salary equity law among the three government branches. This is  why the president confessed to some friends that this is a  serious institutional crisis.    The president will fight to the bitter end with the judicial  and legislative branches -- which still requires the Senate to  approve or reject the presidential veto on the wage increase for  deputies and senators. That is why yesterday morning he  announced that he will not release funds for such increases. A  Government House adviser recalled that Itamar has received  letters suggesting authoritarian measures and the bringing  forward of elections.    The Federal Supreme Court [STF] decided to convert the  judicial branch salaries into URV's based on the values valid on  the 20th of the previous three months instead of on the last  day. The Federal Administration Secretariat has announced that  this calculation increases the value of their salaries by 10.9  percent.    The executive branch considers this conversion illegal since  PM No. 434 clearly establishes that the conversion of public  employees' salaries must be made based on the URV of the 30th of  each month. For this reason, President Itamar considers the STF  administrative decision illegal. The STF says Article No. 186  of the Constitution establishes that budget allocations for the  executive and legislative branches must be made on the 20th of  each month. The issue, according to the president, is that  salaries are not paid on the 20th.</p>

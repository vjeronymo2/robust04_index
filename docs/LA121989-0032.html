			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: FANTASY CURBS, DISPLACES RAGE  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I often have problems in relationships because of my short  fuse. I get angry, have an outburst of rage and say things I regret. As a  result, the person walks out, never to return, and most of the time, I suffer  from loneliness. My sister tells me that she has the same kind of temper but  when she's angry she works through it in her imagination. Is this crazy? --  G.U.  </P> <P> DEAR G.U.: I don't think so. It's not a bad idea to fantasize about what you  would do if you could, and then let it go. Some people have told me that when  someone cuts them off in traffic or is otherwise rude and unfriendly, they  fantasize whipping out their make-believe revolver and shooting out the  person's tires. This harmless dream relieves their rage.  </P> <P> Dr. Ned Marcus, a psychiatrist, points out that dreams are a way of releasing  suppressed anger. Freud believed that dreams are a safety valve through which  our mean, dark, horrid impulses could escape harmlessly.  </P> <P> Fantasies never hurt anybody. You are allowed to dream about or think of almost  anything you wish, and unless you act upon the dream, there's no reason to feel  guilty.  </P> <P> Once you learn to handle your anger, you'll probably find that you are less  lonely and that your relationships are vastly improved.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Should a 6-year-old be severely punished for lying? My  husband believes they should be, and recently, when our son reported that his  teachers complimented him and told him how good he was at a given task, we  discovered that he'd lied. Indeed, he had not done the task properly and far  from being complimented, he had been kept after class because of his disruptive  behavior. -- M.P.  </P> <P> DEAR M.P.: I don't believe in "severe" punishment for a 6-year-old and  certainly not for lying. What is important for parents and teachers to explore  is why the youngster felt it necessary to lie. I suspect he may be developing a  habit of lying because of his fear of punishment.  </P> <P> When a 6-year-old lies, intelligent understanding is needed. It's fairly  obvious that your son wants his teachers to compliment him, to tell him what a  good boy he is and to reassure him that he's worthwhile and capable of doing  the tasks required. Most children want desperately to please parents and  teachers. They like and need praise.  </P> <P> If the only time a child gets the attention of his parents is when he  misbehaves, then he may deliberately do naughty things in order to draw  attention to himself.  </P> <P> Why not try to arrange a conference with your son's teacher to try to find out  what she feels your son needs? When a child consistently lies about his  performance at school, he may need some professional counseling. This may be a  cry for help.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting between a delegation of the Republic of  Croatia and a delegation of the Serbs living in the UN-protected  areas should have been held in Zagreb today. The meeting had  been agreed upon in principle back on 29 March when the  cease-fire agreement was signed. The new meeting should have  been devoted to the normalization of the situation in the sphere  of economy.    Despite an intervention by the mediators of the Zagreb  negotiations, the Serb delegation did not come to the meeting  today, probably because of the confusing situation prevailing in  those areas, particularly now that they are constituting their  new leadership. This was stated by Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the  Croatian delegation to negotiations with the local Serbs. He  added: I would like to recall that the cease-fire agreement is  only a part of a project of normalization of overall relations  throughout the Republic of Croatia, not a sort of a settlement  between the Republic of Croatia and the UN-protected areas.  Further negotiations will refer to economic issues and the  final political solution within the internationally recognized  borders of the Republic of Croatia. It is under these  conditions and with the guarantees by the United States, Russia,  the European Union, and the United Nations that we agreed to  hold Zagreb negotiations and sign the agreement itself.    The Republic of Croatia is, as it has always been,  interested  in the resumption of negotiations leading to the complete  normalization of relations and we are expressing our readiness  that these negotiations could continue anywhere on the territory  of the Republic of Croatia.</p>

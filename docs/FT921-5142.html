			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Siberian plant to be built from gas profits GASPROM, the former Soviet Union's gas monopoly, is being allowed by Moscow to use part of its export profits to raise Dollars 550m (Pounds 312.5m) for building a polyethylene plant in western Siberia, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow. John Brown of the UK and Linde of Germany have completed a Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.4m) feasibility study. But Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell, involved in the project for two years, have failed to raise capital for it, mainly because the only repayment offered by Moscow for loans was from the plant's future profits. It will produce polyethylene for the plastics industry from ethane burned off from the Urengoi gas field. Financiers will have the chance to be repaid from gas exports starting in 1993. Robert Graham reports from Rome: Moscow has given the go-ahead for a Dollars 130m oil terminal at Vostochny near Vladivostok. The contract has been awarded on a key-in-hand basis by the Russian shipping consortium Far East Shipping Company and Rosneftproduct, the republic's main oil exporter, to an international consortium led by Italy's Ansaldo Industria, part of the state-controlled company IRI.</p>

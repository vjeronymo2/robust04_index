			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 2 CONCERTOS, 1 SOLOIST AT MOZART BIRTHDAY PARTY  </P> <P> Thriving, extending its influence and still looking for a permanent home, the  Orange County-based Mozart Camerata has entered the 1990s in an aura of  promise. Some of that promise was delivered on at the ensemble's latest Mozart  birthday concert Friday night (the birthday was Saturday) in the squarish but  acoustically pleasing sanctuary at St. Andrews' Presbyterian Church in Newport  Beach.  </P> <P> Ami Porat, founder of the Classical-size orchestra -- on this occasion between  30 and 33 players -- led a cumulatively engrossing program devoted to the Piano  Concerto in E-flat, K. 271, the G-major Violin Concerto and the G-minor  Symphony.  </P> <P> The conductor's solid and unself-conscious readings again showed off the strong  accomplishments of his ensemble, a group of first-rate instrumentalists who  play as a unit and deliver stylish and energetic performances. Overall grace  and intense detailing marked the playing of the Symphony No. 40, an unforgiving  masterpiece here benignly and engagingly presented.  </P> <P> Corey Cerovsek, a 17-year-old Canadian musician currently completing his  musical training at Indiana University, was the soloist in both concertos, a  feat he produced easily and without gimmickry.  </P> <P> Cerovsek, who has said he considers himself more a fiddler than a pianist, did  make the bigger impression in the violin concerto, wherein his fluent technique  and handsome tone served the familiar work well. Yet his pianism also proved  extraordinary in achievement and musicality. The young performer's sense of  style is neither impeccable nor particularly pointed, but he made a convincing  case in his advocacy of both works.  </P> <P> Perhaps tellingly, Cerovsek's best moments came in the cadenzas of the  concertos, where his strong personality and thorough artistry shone through,  even in the most anachronistic passages.  </P> <P> Porat and the orchestra provided transparent and firm collaborations in both  works. A sizable audience, which seemed to overflow the large church, responded  with appropriate enthusiasm. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

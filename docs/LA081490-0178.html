			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COACH WHOSE TOWEL SLIPPED IS VINDICATED  </P> <P> A state appellate court has reversed the public indecency conviction of a high  school coach who held a meeting with some of his students wearing only a towel  that later fell off.  </P> <P> Jack Emsuer, a physical education teacher at Preble-Shawnee High School in  Preble County, met with the students in his office next to the boys' locker  room and which was accessible only to male students and personnel.  </P> <P> The 12th Ohio District Court of Appeals held that the ordinary observer  probably would not be offended by nudity in a men's locker room and concluded  that the state improperly applied the public indecency statute to Emsuer's  conduct.  </P> <P> case.  </P> <P> Emsuer was convicted in Preble County Common Pleas Court on two counts of  public indecency.  </P> <P> He was sentenced to 10 days' in jail and fined $100 on each count, with both  penalties suspended if he performed 40 hours of community service.  </P> <P> Students who saw Emsuer naked had complained to school officials, who took the  matter to police.  </P></p>

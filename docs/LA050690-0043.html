			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROS AND CONS OF 'DR. GRIMES' BITTER PILL'  </P> <P> The article about Dr. Grimes and RU-486 was timely and informative.  </P> <P> It was also upsetting. Dr. Grimes stated that women in Bangladesh have more  reproductive choices than do women in the United States. How sad, scary, and  upsetting that life-saving medication for women is not readily available.  </P> <P> I admire Dr. Grimes for his courage, perseverance, and concern for women.  </P> <P> What can women do to demand the availability of this breakthrough drug?  </P> <P> KATHRYN S.

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Business chiefs slam quality of legislation The quality of legislation has worsened over the last decade, according to a panel of 100 top industrialists, bankers, business executives and other opinion formers. The panel backs the view expressed last month by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, that too much legislation is rushed through without sufficient consultation with business. Four-fifths said laws were rushed through unnecessarily. There is 'too much knee-jerk reaction law', said one industrialist on the panel. A City executive said: 'Constant changes in tax, urban policy, transport etc make it hard for business to plan for the future. They also reduce the UK's competitiveness.' Seventy-one of the panel agreed that there was a lack of consultation prior to legislation, particularly with business. An industrialist said: 'Deficiencies in the consultation process mean that business is always on the outside.' There was strong support for greater efforts to reach cross-party consensus before passing contentious legislation. Two-thirds of the opinion-formers said much legislation was badly drafted. This created ambiguities that led to expensive court cases. 'Increased complexity has reduced clarity,' according to one industrialist. Another said the legislative burden was 'leading to increased costs and deterring entrepreneurship'. The panel largely agreed with Mr Davies that important legislation is often neglected in favour of overtly political bills. He said practical legislation and tidying-up measures of importance to business often waited years for parliamentary time. Two-thirds of the opinion-formers thought the quality of legislation had declined over the past decade; half that it had declined seriously. City executives were particularly likely to feel that things had got worse from a business viewpoint. One City executive said the law was 'more complex, more subject to lobbying influence, less practical, more interfering, more expensive to implement'. Several identified the Financial Services Act 1986 as a particular irritant. One City opinion-former said it had been 'largely ineffective in achieving its objectives'. Another described regulation of the financial services industry as 'farcical'. However, some industrialists and commercial managers identified the act as an example of improvements in legislation. It had been 'useful in clearing up ambiguities,' said one industrialist. Opinion Leader Research, 30 Grays Inn Road, London WC1X 8HR.</p>

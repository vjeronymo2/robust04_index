			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: Packer's raid raises Fairfax takeover stakes - A look at the bid speculation surrounding the Australian newspaper group Little more than a year after it was acquired by a consortium led by Mr Conrad Black, the future of Australia's John Fairfax Holdings newspaper group is once again in doubt following a stock market raid by Mr Kerry Packer. Fairfax shares jumped 4 cents to ADollars 2.02 on Thursday after Publishing and Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Mr Packer's privately-owned Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress), said it had bought a 5 per cent stake for ADollars 75.6m (USDollars 53.2m). The raid increased Mr Packer's Fairfax shareholding to more than 10 per cent, prompting speculation the billionaire publisher was planning to fight Mr Black for control. If he is, it will not be much of a battle. ConsPress has both the cash and the management skills to acquire Fairfax, while Mr Black's hold on the group rests on the shaky foundation of a mere 15 per cent shareholding. ConsPress has been scanning the market for takeover targets since early last year, when Mr Al 'Chainsaw' Dunlap, Mr Packer's right hand man, completed a restructuring which left the group debt free with assets of about ADollars 3bn. Fairfax was always likely to be on the ConsPress shopping list, if only because the Fairfax and Packer families spent decades fighting for control of the Sydney newspaper market. Fairfax is not the biggest newspaper group in Australia - that title belongs to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation - and its influence has dimmed since it was plunged into receivership in 1990 by Mr Warwick Fairfax, its 29-year-old former proprietor, However, the group remains one of Australia's most commercially attractive media businesses. Its main titles, the Sydney Morning Herald and The (Melbourne) Age, are lucrative generators of classified advertising revenue. It also publishes the Australian Financial Review, a monopoly business daily. The first sign that Mr Packer might be looking seriously at Fairfax came in February, when he announced that Mr Dunlap was to be replaced as ConsPress managing director by Mr Brian Powers. Mr Powers, 43, was a partner in Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US investment bank which owns 5 per cent of Fairfax in the form of non-voting convertible debentures. He was a director of Fairfax, although he has since resigned. More importantly, Mr Powers was one of the two men who ran the successful bid for Fairfax by Mr Black's Tourang consortium in 1991 (the other was Mr Dan Colson, now deputy chairman of the Telegraph). Tourang was originally structured to deliver a 20 per cent stake in Fairfax to the Telegraph, and 15 per cent each to ConsPress and Hellman &amp; Friedman. That structure collapsed in the face of political and regulatory opposition which forced Mr Packer to withdraw and impose a 20 per cent ceiling on foreign shareholdings. As a result, the Telegraph was limited to 15 per cent, enough to deliver management control of Fairfax, but not enough to keep it in the face of a determined takeover attempt. Mr Black has sought government permission to increase his stake to 25 per cent, and Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister) is likely to agree shortly, in spite of opposition from backbench MPs. But if Mr Packer is serious about bidding for Fairfax, a small increase in the Telegraph's shareholding will not be enough to keep ConsPress at bay. Fortunately for Mr Black, Mr Packer has problems of his own. Under Australia's cross-media ownership regulations, Mr Packer cannot acquire more than 14.99 per cent of Fairfax unless he relinquishes control of the Channel Nine television network, the top rating commercial station. To comply with the law, he would have to reduce his 48 per cent stake in Nine to less than 15 per cent, and convince the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), that he could not influence the network through other shareholders or managers. There has been speculation that Mr Packer might try to overcome this provision by parking part of his Nine shareholding with his son Jamie, a ConsPress manager, or with other friendly associates. ABA officials say the law is tight enough to prevent such a strategy. So would Mr Packer be prepared to sell Nine to facilitate a bid for Fairfax? Analysts say he might. Nine made a net profit of ADollars 60m last year, and is likely to benefit more than its rivals from economic recovery. But profits may be harder to generate when satellite television begins to eat into advertising revenue in two years' time. Mr Packer stands to make a substantial profit on his Nine shares, which are worth about ADollars 300m at Thursday's market price of ADollars 2.97. He paid ADollars 200m to purchase a slightly larger controlling stake from Mr Alan Bond in 1990. Against this background, Fairfax's forecast pre-tax profit of ADollars 105m in the current year could look attractive. The group is worth ADollars 1.25bn at the current market valuation, well within Mr Packer's pocket. However, Mr Packer may not have a full takeover in mind. One suggestion is that he is simply pushing up the share price to maximise a compensation payment due to ConsPress from its former partners in Tourang. Under the agreement, Conspress will receive 30m times the difference between ADollars 1 and the share price on December 31. At Thursday's price of ADollars 2.02, the deal is worth ADollars 30.6m. Alternatively, Mr Packer may simply wish to play a limited role in Fairfax, while sending a subtle reminder to Mr Black that he has the capacity to take control if he wishes. Before pulling out of Tourang, Mr Packer told a parliamentary committee that it would amuse him to hold a small stake in Fairfax. Mr Black's fear must be that it would probably amuse him even more to take control.</p>

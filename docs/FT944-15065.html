			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Merseyside union official steps down Mr Alan Quinn, a senior member of the Transport and General Workers union executive from Merseyside, has resigned on grounds of ill health as an internal inquiry starts into alleged fraud in the area's divisional office. No charges of wrong-doing are to be made by the executive against Mr Quinn. A TGWU spokesman confirmed last night that Mr Quinn, 40, had stepped down after more than 10 years as the Merseyside executive member. Mr Quinn said he was 'very sad' that he had felt it necessary to leave the executive, but added he had done so on doctor's orders. Mr Quinn was regarded as a highly influential figure on the left-dominated executive, playing an important role in determining union strategy. His position in the union was believed to have become increasingly untenable, however, after it was alleged that he had received Pounds 15,181 in expenses from the TGWU for his executive work last year. The money was to cover loss of earnings, mainly for attendance at meetings in London. The union's rules entitle an executive member to claim only Pounds 32 a day for loss of earnings. Mr Quinn's expenses were far higher than those of any other person on the executive and more than an official could have received if he had spent every day of the year on union business. Mr Quinn said yesterday that the figure for his expenses claim was 'inaccurate and not true'. He added that the TGWU's financial officer had accepted this. The election for his successor on Merseyside will take place soon.</p>

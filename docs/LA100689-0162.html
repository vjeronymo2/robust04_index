			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'UPBEAT LIVE' GETS THE MESSAGE OUT TO CLASSICAL MUSIC LISTENER  </P> <P> Helping the layman appreciate classical music is a favorite undertaking for  many writers, scholars and pundits dedicated to the world of music. Such  experts are often convincing, persuasive and charismatic. But they also need to  know how to tell a good joke.  </P> <P> For many Southland listeners, from dabblers to the more dedicated, the Los  Angeles Philharmonic offers a series of free, hourlong, pre-concert lectures  called "Upbeat Live." The presentations, given an hour before every  subscription concert, introduce the current program and offer insights from  local music personalities.  </P> <P> "Most important, we try to get the audience to trust their own ears," says Ara  Guzelimian, artistic administrator for the Philharmonic and coordinator of  "Upbeat Live" since its inception in 1984.  </P> <P> "I hate the notion of thinking of classical music as a sacred priesthood. There  is no right reaction.  </P> <P> "We try to give them information that will help them, but we stress that if you  don't like a piece, don't think that it's like oatmeal and you have to eat it.  That really destroys the experience."  </P> <P> The series opened last night with Alan Chapman, a music theorist who teaches at  Occidental College and has given several "Upbeat Live" presentations. His  discussion on the background and other aspects of the program this weekend, the  fourth symphonies of Shostakovich and Beethoven, will also be given tonight,  Saturday night and Sunday afternon.  </P> <P> "In trying to supply the key to get inside a piece I usually discover something  new about the piece myself," Chapman says. "It's not like presenting a paper at  a theory convention. Pacing is important because it's part performance.  </P> <P> "Sometimes the most important thing is the tie you wear. For me, it's the only  opportunity I have to indulge in both music history and stand-up comedy at the  same time."  </P> <P> "It's important that speakers are informed, but also relaxed," says Guzelimian.  "It shouldn't be like an evening of taking information off of stone tablets  from the mountaintops. There should also be a little entertainment in the  experience."  </P> <P> For the broad cross-section of listeners who attend the Philharmonic's  concerts, "Upbeat Live" is an opportunity to relax after the often-hectic  ritual of driving on the freeways, finding a parking place and so on.  Subscribers have been known to come from as far away as Bakersfield and the  pre-concert presentations give them a chance to pause and tune in to the music  they are about to hear.  </P> <P> One subscriber, Karen Wilson, 34, drives all the way from Hemet to hear the  Philharmonic perform and claims that she never misses an "Upbeat Live" lecture.  She works as a chemist for a large company there and paints portraits in her  spare time.  </P> <P> "I usually get some tidbit or helpful hint out of the lecture. If anything, it  lets me know when to clap," says Wilson.  </P> <P> "People say I'm crazy for driving 90 minutes every week just to hear a concert.  For me, it's always a wonderful chance to get away from Hemet for a while."  </P> <P> Wilson recalls other lectures by Chapman and how he would compare the music to  situations in every-day life. She especially remembers how he used the  comparison of an L.A. freeway to a Beethoven symphony.  </P> <P> Chapman says: "It's comparable to attempting to do several things at once. The  transitions within a symphonic work are a lot like freeway ramps. On another  occasion, I tried to compare a Bruckner symphony with a football game.  Mastering the art of the well-conceived analogy is important for a lecture like  this."  </P></p>

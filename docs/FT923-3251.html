			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Bosses give the ERM a mixed rating MOST big company bosses still support Mr John Major in his defence of sterling within the ERM, but a significant number are beginning to have doubts. Several express outright opposition. The most outspoken opponent among several chairmen and chief executives of the UK's 100 biggest companies contacted by the Financial Times before last night's currency alignment was Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, the industrial conglomerate. 'I think we ought to go in for a free float and be done with it,' he said. 'Then we'll know where we are.' It would be no good just devaluing against the D-Mark, he added, because 'that still ties us to a country which has several years of structural change ahead of it. I don't understand the general apprehension about free floating.' BTR has just announced a profits rise for the first half of the year. But Sir Owen said in his statement that the political focus on the extinction of inflation was helping to create market conditions 'resembling an economic desert'. Other opponents were less forthright and less willing to be identified. The chief executive of a textiles group said that although he thought sterling should stay in the ERM, there should be a realignment against the D-Mark. 'The key thing our industry needs is a 3 per cent reduction in interest rates and sterling at Dollars 1.75 or lower,' he said. 'I don't think we could get interest rates down on our own, but a realignment would help us out on the dollar.' The chief executive of a food group said: 'Inasmuch as the ERM helps us get inflation down, that's terrific. I wouldn't come out unilaterally. But on the other hand, I can't see the ERM surviving. What's finally going to make it crunch, God knows, but something will. The system is inflexible, and everything we do in trade and commerce needs flexibility.' The point was echoed by the chief executive of another consumer group. 'As a businessman, I don't like being boxed into a corner. I've come to the personal conclusion that we've got to realign. 'Devaluing might push the inflation rate up a bit, but I don't mind 3 or 4 per cent inflation if it gets growth back into the economy.' Even some supporters of government policy expressed reservations. A company chairman said: 'I would advocate sticking to the present ERM parities, because somehow or other we need to get credibility for sterling . . . but the price being paid is enormous, and it's not at all clear that the Germans are right in their monetary policy.' There remains a hard core of businessmen who believe that there is no alternative to the present policy. Mr Chris Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, has not always seen eye to eye with the government. On this issue, though, he said, the UK had to stick with it. 'The alternative is just too horrible. It must surely be just a question of time before German rates come down, because they can't stick it out either. It may be a horrible mess at present, but it would be crazy to make a move before the French referendum or the US elections. 'If by the end of the year the dollar is still as low and German interest rates are still as high, that might be a different matter. But in that case we'd all be in a mess. It's an illusion to think that this is just a domestic problem any more. Things are not as dire for us as they are for the Scandinavians or the Italians.' The chairman of a manufacturing multinational said: 'I wasn't a supporter originally. But having gone in, I see no alternative to slogging it out. Otherwise we would just return to the old days of boom and bust.' Mr David Lyon, chief executive of the packaging group Bowater, said: 'Getting in at the level we did provided us with a rod for our own backs. But looking out 10 years or more, I believe that is necessary and can be lived with. If you have a business which is highly exposed and is a long way from being competitive with its peers in Germany and France, that's tough. But if we want to get into Europe and into world markets, it's a good discipline. If we were to devalue by 10 per cent or so, we would all heave a sigh of relief and stop making progress.' The point about European competitiveness was picked up by Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman of the engineering group Siebe. 'I think it's screamingly painful, and it's going to be, but we have to stick to it. That's what the other ERM countries are doing, and we've got to keep pace with them. I don't think retiring into insularity is an option.' Indeed, one or two bosses took a harder line again. Sir Owen Green's counterpart at the opposite end of the spectrum is the chief executive of a consumer group. He said: 'I would put up interest rates if need be. If they went up by 2 or 3 percentage points, I think sterling would really bounce.'</p>

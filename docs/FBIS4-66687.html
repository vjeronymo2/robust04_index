			<p>CSO     [Text] News Service. Shares in government companies and  organizations will go on sale on the stock market, at auction,  and through negotiations. Sales will be done after determination  of the base sale price for cash and installment payments after a  decision by the minister in charge of the organization making  the transfer as to the nature of the transfers.    Mas'ud Roghani-Zanjani, chief of the Plan and Budget  Organization and spokesman for the Economic Council, gave a  press conference yesterday (Saturday) in which he announced the  above. He discussed the procedure for making installment sales  of transferable shares belonging to the government, the  organizations, and the government companies in the year 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995].    He said installment sales will be done at the discretion of  the minister in charge of the transferring organization. He  said: Installment sales will be done only in cases where the  buyer or buyers are seeking to buy all the shares at one time.    The spokesman for the Economic Council discussed the  procedure for installment payment sales to general applicants  and company workers and managers. He said: If general applicants  pay 30, 40, or 50 percent of the cost of the transaction for the  company, they may pay the remainder of the price over periods of  3, 3.5, and 4 years, respectively.    He discussed the fact that the cost of an installment  payment  transaction will be the cost of a cash sale of the shares in  addition to the banking system's profit on installment payment  sales in the industrial sector. He added: To provide banking  facilities for company workers and managers, if they so desire  and if conditions are otherwise equal with other buyers, these  people may pay 20 percent of the price of the transaction and  pay the remainder of the value of the shares over a period of 4  years in the form of installment payments.    Continuing, he discussed the fact that the base price of the  sale of the shares must be approved by the minister in charge of  the organization transferring the shares. He added: The public  must be informed about the transfer of the shares in an  advertisement to be placed three times in one week in at least  two high-circulation domestic newspapers and, at the discretion  of the organization making the transfer, in the Voice and Vision  of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    He said: If the organization making the transfer does not  sell the shares within one year, the designation of a new base  price will be the responsibility of the minister in charge.    He said the minister in charge of the organization making  the  transfer will be responsible for determining the type of  transfer, whether by auction, negotiation or sale on the stock  market. He said: With regard to companies, which have been  accepted on the stock market, priority will be given to sale on  the stock market.    Mr. Roghani-Zanjani discussed the procedure for determining  the base price of shares of government companies that can be  transferred. He said: The base price of profitable producing  companies will be determined by dividing the company's average  annual pretax net profit for the last three years by the rate of  capital return, with consideration for the factors that affect  the adjustment of profits.    He added: If the company's capital has increased in the year  of the transfer of the shares or the year prior to the transfer  of the shares due to cash earnings, 100 percent of the increased  capital will be added to the company's total value and the sums  kept in the company for any reason from the profits of the year  before the transfer will be added to the company's base price.    The chief of the Plan and Budget Organization discussed the  completed price of the development projects and the completed  price for semicomplete or ready to operate projects . He said:  If it has been more than one year since these projects went into  operation, the Central Bank or experts will recalculate the  completed price by adjusting the foreign exchange cost at the  current foreign exchange price and adjusting the rial costs by  the announced wholesale price indicator, and after approval by  the company's general assembly, the difference obtained will be  added to the base price of the shares.    He emphasized that before transferring shares the  organizations making the transfers are required to pay any debts  incurred by drawing cash from the Treasury for development  projects, or they must make an agreement with the Treasury  concerning the method of repayment.</p>

They are members of a workers'  deputies group from the council of the People's Republic of  Albania and include: Deputy Shaban Memia, of the Albanian  Democratic Party (APD) in Tirana, who was chairman of the  delegation; Deputy Simon Puta (AFD); Deputy Nevrus Cela (APD);  Deputy Ethem Ruka (Albanian Socialist Party); Deputy Roland  Tafili (APD); and Deputy Skender Gjinushi (Social Democratic  Party).    On 15 December, the guests were received by Sejm Speaker  Jozef Zych, and on this occasion they underscored the value and  pleasure of their visit and their opportunities for deepening  their knowledge of the extensive structural changes made in  Poland. The chairman of the delegation expressed his belief that  their stay in Poland would begin a process of cooperation  between both parliaments and countries and said that one of the  goals should be for a Polish group to visit Albania and call for  bilateral groups in both parliaments.    The Albanian deputies held talks with the heads of the  following committees: Foreign Affairs, Constitutional  Responsibility, Legislation, Privatization, and the National  Assembly Constitutional Commission.    The delegation met with the leadership of the SLD  [Democratic  Left Alliance], UD [Democratic Union], and UP [Union of Labor]  parliamentary clubs.    The deputy chief of the Sejm Chancellery, Director General  Wojciech Popkowski, briefed the deputies on the legislative  process, the Sejm's Rule of Procedure, and the powers of the  State Tribunal.    Janusz Ziolkowski, secretary of state and chief of the  Presidential Chancellery, and Iwo Byczewski, deputy secretary of  state in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, discussed the  prospects for developing bilateral relations with Albanian  members of parliament. Clarification of some of the aspects of  the Balkan situation were also discussed. [passage omitted]</p>

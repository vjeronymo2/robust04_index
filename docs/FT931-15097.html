			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Austria uses reverse FRNs in DM500m issue THE Republic of Austria joined the growing list of sovereign borrowers tapping the D-Mark Eurobond market yesterday. It chose, however, to use the reverse floating rate note structure rather than the straight Eurobonds favoured by larger-scale borrowers. Reverse floaters appeal to investors who believe D-Mark interest rates will come down soon. Austria increased its 10-year issue twice, finally settling for DM500m after launching it through Trinkaus und Burkhardt at DM300m. Bankers re-ported good demand although the pricing is less generous than seen on other recent issues of this type. The coupon is 8 1/4 per cent for the first two years, then 13 1/8 per cent minus six-month Libor thereafter. Mr Helmut Eder of the Austrian Federal Financing Agency, the agency established at the start of this year to act on behalf of the republic in these matters, said the republic would borrow the equivalent of about Dollars 3bn abroad in 1993. Austria intended to continue holding its foreign debt obligations in Swiss francs, D-Marks, yen and Dutch guilders, he said, but it would issue in those currencies which offer the best arbitrage opportunities. DG Bank also led a DM75m 10-year subordinated reverse floater for Westfalische Hypothekebank, targeted at retail investors. It offers a coupon of 10 1/4 per cent for the first year, and will then pay 20 per cent minus twice six-month Libor. Province de Quebec became the third Canadian province to tap the international markets this week, following Ontario and British Columbia, which both raised US dollars. Additionally, the Province of Alberta, which has been widely expected for several weeks to tap the international markets, raised CDollars 750m domestically. Lead-manager Wood Gundy said Quebec's CDollars 500m seven-year 8 1/2 per cent Eurobonds would provide a new benchmark in the seven-year area, given the absence of other current coupon liquid issues. The bonds were still in syndicate at the close of business, reflecting the slackening of international demand for the currency after the spate of issues seen so far this year. Other bankers said the bonds were slightly expensive and added to unsold positions. There have now been some CDollars 2.1bn of bonds issued internationally already this year. Credit Commercial de France said the European Investment Bank's FFr3bn eight-year 8 per cent issue confirmed the firmer tone of the French franc market. The issue maintained its spread of 24 basis over comparable French government bonds in early trading after breaking syndicate, said CCF, and was widely described as a successful deal. Other banks agree that investor interest has revived in the French franc after its recovery against the D-Mark. Economic fundamentals in France are good, they say, and there is widespread expectation that D-Mark rates are set to fall. The EIB is as usual using a deferred rate setting system, which allows it to lock the spread at which it can lend the funds to future borrowers. The Council of Europe's Dollars 150m two-year 4 5/8 per cent issue through S. G. Warburg should benefit from pent-up demand at the shorter end of the curve, said bankers. European investors who are happy with dollar exposure but who think yields will go higher can buy such short-term bonds as an alternative to placing their funds on deposit in the money markets, they say. Cariplo's Dollars 200m five-year issue of floating rate depositary receipts through Lehman Brothers could prove the true litmus test of Italy's renewed international acceptability after the problems of recent months, rather than the republic's successful DM5bn deal, say bankers. The paper qualifies as senior debt. Credit Foncier de France's DM1.5bn 10-year straight bonds, launched on Tuesday, were priced to give the expected launch spread of 20 basis points over government bonds. NORWAY plans to hold six bond auctions in 1993, Reuter reports. The Norwegian central bank did not disclose the size of the offerings nor maturity dates of the bonds to be issued, but said it may hold ad hoc auctions to supplement the regular auctions. The first bond auction in 1993 will be held on January 25, with an announcement planned for Friday. The other bond auctions will be held on March 22 (announcement March 12), May 24 (May 14), July 26 (July 16), September 20 (September 10) and November 22 (November 12). Settlement dates are four days after the auction.</p>

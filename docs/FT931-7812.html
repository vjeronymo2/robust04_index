			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Danes cut discount rate DANSKE BANK, Denmark's central bank, yesterday lowered the official discount rate by a full point from 11.5 to 10.5 per cent. The discount rate was raised by two points to 11.5 per cent on February 3 in order to stop speculation against the krone, which is part of the European Exchange Rate mechanism. The central bank said that since the beginning of the month there had been a substantial return of capital to the country. Mrs Marianne Jelved, the economy minister, said the bank's decision 'is clear documentation of the strength of the Danish economy', which has an inflation rate of only 1.4 per cent and a large surplus on the current balance of payments. In Madrid, however, pressure on the Spanish peseta raised fears that the Spanish authorities might today reverse their modest quarter-point interest rate cut of 10 days ago. The central banks of Spain and Portugal intervened yesterday and late last week as the peseta and escudo came under pressure. The peseta ended yesterday at 73 to the D-Mark, sharply down from 71.7 on Friday, dragging the escudo along with it. The Portuguese currency fell to 92.05 to the D-Mark from 91.47 on Friday. Currency dealers in Madrid said the peseta had performed much worse than they had expected. Some believed speculation against the currency was such that the government might have to consider a third devaluation or even pulling the peseta out of the exchange rate mechanism. However, neither step appears likely at the moment. The attack on the peseta, triggered by poor unemployment figures and uncertainty over the outcome of a general election to be held sometime this year, has left it roughly at the centre of its fluctuation band. Madrid has made clear it will do its utmost to remain inside the ERM, and the government is preparing a fiscal package to help revitalise the economy. Details of this package are likely to be announced this week. However the Bank of Spain may feel obliged to use its routine auction of certificates of deposit today to raise its official intervention rate. This was cut from 13.25 per cent to 13 per cent at the last auction. In the last few days, however, the central bank has forced overnight rates up to more than 16 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to adjust the residual component of the tier charge when there is an increase in the number of channels on a tier, the operator shall perform the following calculations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Take the sum of the old total number of channels on tiers subject to regulation ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  tiers that are, or could be, regulated but excluding New Product Tiers) and the new total number of channels and divide the resulting number by two; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Consult the above table to find the applicable per channel adjustment factor for the number of channels produced by the calculations in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. For each tier for which there has been an increase in the number of channels, multiply the per-channel adjustment factor times the change in the number of channels on that tier. The result is the total adjustment for that tier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative methodology for adjusting rates for changes in the number of channels offered on a cable programming service tier or a single tier system between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph at the Operator's discretion as set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be used to adjust permitted rates for a CPST after December 31, 1994, for changes in the number of channels offered on a CPST between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a single tier system may be treated as if it were a CPST. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operators cap attributable to new channels on all CPSTs through December 31, 1997. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Operators electing to use the methodology set forth in this paragraph may increase their rates between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, by up to 20 cents per channel, exclusive of programming costs, for new channels added to CPSTs on or after May 15, 1994, except that they may not make rate adjustments totalling more than $1.20 per month, per subscriber through December 31, 1996, and by more than $1.40 per month, per subscriber through December 31, 1997 (the ``Operator's Cap''). Except to the extent that the programming costs of such channels are covered by the License Fee Reserve provided for in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, programming costs associated with channels for which a rate adjustment is made pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) of this section must fall within the Operator's Cap if the programming costs (including any increases therein) are reflected in rates before January 1, 1997. Inflation adjustments pursuant to &sect;76.922(d)(2) are not counted against the Operator's Cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Per channel adjustment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Operators may increase rates by a per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents per subscriber per month, exclusive of programming costs, for each channel added to a CPST between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997, except that an operator may take the per channel adjustment only for channel additions that result in an increase in the highest number of channels offered on all CPSTs as compared to May 14, 1994, and each date thereafter. Any revenues received from a programmer, or shared by a programmer and an operator in connection with the addition of a channel to a CPST shall first be deducted from programming costs for that channel pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(x) of this section and then, to the extent revenues received from the programmer are greater than the programming costs, shall be deducted from the per channel adjustment. This deduction will apply on a channel by channel basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> License fee reserve. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to the rate adjustments permitted in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(3)(ii) of this section operators that make channel additions on or after May 15, 1994 may increase their rates by a total of 30 cents per month, per subscriber between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for license fees associated with such channels (the ``License Fee Reserve''). The License Fee Reserve may be applied against the initial license fee and any increase in the license fee for such channels during this period. An operator may pass-through to subscribers more than the 30 cents between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for license fees associated with channels added after May 15, 1994, provided that the total amount recovered from subscribers for such channels, including the License Fee Reserve, does not exceed $1.50 per subscriber, per month. After December 31, 1996, license fees may be passed through to subscribers pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except that license fees associated with channels added pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3) of this section will not be eligible for the 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of determining whether a rate increase counts against the maximum rate increases specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the relevant date shall be when rates are increased as a result of channel additions, not when the addition occurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deletion of Channels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When dropping a channel from a BST or CPST, operators shall reflect the net reduction in external costs in their rates pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section. With respect to channels to which the 7.5% mark-up on programming costs applied pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(xi) of this section, the operator shall treat the mark-up as part of its programming costs and subtract the mark-up from its external costs. Operators shall also reduce the price of that tier by the ``residual'' associated with that channel. For channels that were on a BST or CPST on May 14, 1994, or channels added after that date pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the per channel residual is the charge for the tier, minus the external costs for the tier, and any per channel adjustments made after that date, divided by the total number of channels on the tier minus the number of channels on the tier that received the per channel adjustment specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. For channels added to a CPST after May 14, 1994, pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the residuals shall be the actual per channel adjustment taken for that channel when it was added to the tier. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

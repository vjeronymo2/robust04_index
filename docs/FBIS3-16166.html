Russia's  head of government announced this today in a short talk with  journalists. According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, he knows nothing  "about demands Russia is allegedly making of Belarus." He is  convinced that "solutions acceptable both to Russia and to  Belarus will be found."    Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed out that the negotiations  between  Russia and Belarus "are proceeding normally." "No one has made  any demands of anyone else," the prime minister emphasized.    Advocating that an agreement on unifying currency systems be  signed as soon as possible, the Russian head of government  stated that he "opposes hasty decisions." In his opinion,  "haste will not help." The prime minister is firmly convinced  that the main thing is not only that an agreement should be  signed, but that it should be implemented.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Reuters to take over Citicorp arm Reuters Holdings, the UK-based business information and news group, is to expand in the global equity markets by acquiring the struggling Quotron data service business from Citicorp, the US banking group. The deal signals the end of Citicorp's ambitions to expand into information services, a business it once said would become as profitable as any of its banking operations. Quotron provides quotes, news and analysis of equities to professional investors and brokers in the US. A lack of investment by Citicorp has led to a decline in its business in the years since it was bought in 1986. The bank yesterday put the number of Quotron screens now in use at 'more than 40,000', a fall from 80,000 in 1986. However, the acquisition increases Reuters' share of the global equity market to about 20 per cent - slightly behind Automatic Data Processing of the US. Quotron has made losses since Citicorp bought it for Dollars 680m eight years ago. It lost Dollars 33m in the first nine months of last year, compared with Dollars 40m in 1993. The bank recognised the extent of the disaster at the end of 1991, when it wrote down its investment in Quotron by Dollars 400m. Its decision to write off another Dollars 179m demonstrates even that was too optimistic. Reuters said Citicorp had agreed to underwrite certain operating costs in connection with the deal, which was conditional on due diligence. Quotron's screens have all but disap peared from the desks of the US's large national stockbrokers. Last year it lost the accounts of both Dean Witter and Kidder Peabody, which between them had accounted for some 7,000 screens. The company has been attempting to expand its position with regional stockbrokers and smaller investment institutions. The acquisition of Quotron was one of the earliest and boldest decisions of Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, who argued at the time that the bank should seek to benefit from the expansion of financial information services. The company was chosen in 1991 to build and operate a foreign exchange trading system designed to attack Reuters' dominant share in that market. That project, known as EBS and backed by several of the biggest foreign exchange trading banks, will remain with Citicorp. The terms of the sale were not disclosed. The amount paid by Reuters will depend in part on Quotron's success in retaining its customers. Reuters shares rose 28p to 1853p as analysts welcomed the deal. Citicorp results, page 27</p>

Pregnant  women, children and patients finding themselves in hospital  resuscitation, oncological or hematological departments, as well  as persons in the ``risk group'' are subject to testing. Besides  medical workers and donors, hotel workers and diplomats are now  among those who are obligated to undergo testing in view of the  particular features of their occupations (diplomats will do so  only with their consent).</p>

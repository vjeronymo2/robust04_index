			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister of the Russian Government V. </F> Chernomyrdin by I. Yakovleva; place and date not given: "V.  Chernomyrdin: `One of the Special Features of 1994 Will Be the  Government's Realistic Approach to Promises. We Cannot Do  Everything Now, But the Decisions We Make Must Be Backed Up By  Finances': The Prime Minister of the Russian Government Answers  Our Readers' Questions"]    [Text]    [Yakovleva] Viktor Stepanovich, a question that concerns all  economic subjects: Will the reshuffling in the government cause  a substantial correction of the course of reforms?    [Chernomyrdin] The Program of Reforms adopted on 6 August  1993 and then approved by the president did not undergo any  corrections when Ye. Gaydar joined the government in September  last year. Neither are there now, nor will there be, any drastic  corrections to the government's course of reforms.    There will be a certain correction with respect to methods,  which is dictated not by personnel reshuffling but by life  itself.    [Yakovleva] Speaking of methods of pulling the economy out  of  the crisis--combating inflation and preventing a catastrophic  production decline are two ends of the same stick. Is one  direction favored over the other?    [Chernomyrdin] The government has never been divided into  two  groups--supporters of reining in the growth in the money supply  and those in favor of preventing a deep decline by pumping money  into the economy, with the resulting inflation. There has always  been agreement that we need an optimum way of avoiding both  hyperinflation and hyperdecline. The choice of some or other  measures depended on a specific economic situation.    I believe that the main task currently has been  accomplished:  we have constrained demand-generated inflation, when,  figuratively speaking, money is chasing goods. Now it is  important to halt inflation driven by costs, which is associated  with the lack of real competition in the production of most  varieties of goods. This is a slightly different task, which  transcends the boundaries of purely macroeconomic regulation of  the economy and demands different approaches capable of bringing  about an improvement in the situation. For instance, it may be  useful to introduce the practice of entering into agreements  between the government, trade unions, and entrepreneurs with  respect to setting output prices and fixing wages at a certain  level for some period of time. At the same time we do not reject  the strict financial policy of the past; control over the growth  of money supply will not be loosened under any circumstances.    [Yakovleva] On occasions you have said that the rate of  inflation is in inverse correlation to the pace of reforms. What  is your appraisal of the results of last year, keeping in mind  that many people have not been paid and enterprises have not  replenished their working capital for months?    [Chernomyrdin] Financial stabilization efforts stumble  against, on one hand, the structural crisis in the economy,  which provokes investment stagnation and production decline. On  the other hand, it runs into the actions of federal bodies of  authority, which were compelled to make promises they cannot  keep. I do not deny that the decline in the rate of inflation in  the fourth quarter of last year, when it was brought down to  12-15 percent a month, was achieved through an increase in the  government's budget liability. This is very difficult to explain  to those who were affected by it, but I am convinced that we did  the right thing. In our economy there is no other way of doing  this.    In the first quarter of 1994 budget expenditures are to  remain on the level of the fourth quarter of last year. In  addition, we will have to pay the most "burning" debts--to  defense enterprises, the Far North, the agro-industrial complex,  and the back pay to budget-financed enterprises. Back in  November I foresaw that the rate of inflation in January would  be 20-22 percent. True, the first quarter is always difficult;  we started out the same way in 1993. On average, for the first  half of the year inflation is expected to be in the range of  15-18 percent a month, and in the second half--11-12 percent; by  the end of the year we hope to bring it down to 7-9 percent.  Inflation in our country currently follows the  inertial-oscillatory pattern.    [Yakovleva] Do you see a way out of this vicious circle  where  the rate of inflation is predicated on the government not  fulfilling its obligations?    [Chernomyrdin] I do. First and foremost, the government  should not make unrealistic promises. We need to conduct our  work in such a way that we can carry out what we plan and  promise. We should not develop a program and place orders for  products unless we have the money to pay for them. This is one  of the special features of this year--a realistic policy in this  area. We will not be able to jump into everything--it is not  possible, but once we make a decision, we have to provide  financing.    [Yakovleva] Can we count on preferential credits this year?    [Chernomyrdin] I am a rather tightfisted man; I do not like  to give away and hand out. The government will not engage in  issuance of preferential credits right and left. With respect to  investment, we have a program of selective support of  production, and we intend to carry it out. As to unprofitable  enterprises, there is a law on bankruptcy and the mechanism for  its implementation. Unprofitable enterprises must be  restructured or, if this is impossible, closed. Our efforts in  the area of financial and credit policy must be reinforced by  placing the emphasis on structural and investment policy,  creating incentives for Russian producers. This will allow us to  remove the causes that force the government to make promises  that are hard to carry out.    [Yakovleva] How can we ensure effective use of state money,  to make sure that financial infusions will not be used for  consumption?    [Chernomyrdin] We now demand that a mechanism be put  together  for using credit, which will go first and foremost to the  military-industrial and agrarian complexes. Such a mechanism is  now being set up by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank  together with these sectors. Enterprises have a lot of problems  now--wages, working capital. But the important part is to ensure  that this money goes into targeted programs. For the  military-industrial complex this means covering unpaid-for  defense orders; for agricultural enterprises--preparations for  spring sowing, buying fertilizer, fuels, and spare parts, and  repairing equipment. Unless such programs are submitted,  enterprises will not get the money.</p>

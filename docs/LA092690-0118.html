Dr. Hoda  Anton-Culver of UC Irvine says the county's Cancer Surveillance Program may be  yielding earlier-than-usual diagnoses. Also, she wonders whether kidney and  bladder problems are being reported by people without medical confirmation.  </P> <P> "We plan to follow up on these figures," she says. "If they persist over the  years, that's how we discover things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HEALTH SURVEY  </P> <P> Orange County residents report high rates of these diseases.  </P> <P> Asthma  </P> <P> Orange County: 7.3%  </P> <P> United States: 3.6%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kidney/bladder disease  </P> <P> Orange County: 12.9%  </P> <P> United States: 3.7%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cancer  </P> <P> Orange County: 6.7%  </P> <P> United States: 2.5%  </P> <P> Cases as percentage of population.  </P> <P> Source: Orange County Health Surveys Marcida Dodson and Jeffrey A.

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Political correspondent Gadi Sukenik studio report] </F>   [Excerpts] Diplomatic contacts between Israel, Tunis, the  United States, and Egypt continue at this hour in an attempt to  find a way for an immediate resumption of the negotiations  between Israel and the PLO. Our correspondent Gadi Sukenik has  the details:    The contacts go on all the time with the participation of  the  Americans, the Egyptians, Israel, the PLO, as well as the  Russians and the Norwegians. The United States has threatened  'Arafat that if he does not return immediately to the peace  talks, it would veto the condemnation of the Hebron massacre by  the UN Security Council. Strange as it may seem, Israel fears  such a U.S. veto. 'Arafat might, so they think in Israel, dig  in his heels even deeper, and the entire peace process will  become even more of a mess.    Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa spoke on the phone today  with Shim'on Peres and suggested that a preparatory meeting be  held in Cairo between lower level Israeli and PLO  representatives. As we have already heard, Rabin held a long  conversation with 'Arafat. Peres and Rabin met twice within 24  hours. This evening, Peres also held a meeting with Faysal  al-Husayni.    Everything is being done with the feeling that the situation  is grave; that 'Arafat is in distress as hundreds of thousands  of Palestinians are under curfew or closure. Israel still  demands that 'Arafat return to the negotiating table  unconditionally, and only hints at a willingness to meet him  part of the way on several issues. At the same time, Rabin is  against evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron at this time,  despite the fact that he had called them a time bomb and their  presence there stupidity. [passage omitted]    Peres stand is clear. Hence it can be gathered that, from  now on, every grave incident in Hebron -- caused by either Arabs  or Jews -- will be followed by an evacuation from or moving out  of settlers in the city. The efforts to get Peres and 'Arafat  to meet as soon as possible will continue tomorrow in an attempt  to break the ice.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Manne Dipico, ANC Northern Cape </F> premier candidate, by unidentified SABC announcer on the  "Elections '94" program--live]    [Announcer] Hello, Manne. Can you hear me?    [Dipico] I can hear you.    [Announcer] How are you?    [Dipico] OK. I'm fine.    [Announcer] How are things going that side?    [Dipico] Things are pretty calm. Eerybody is out in the  street. They have not got the...[pauses] They are looking first  at the TVs, and they are looking to the radios, they are  awaiting the final results. No one wants to jump out and open  the champagne bottles before the final results are announced.  So, I can tell you there is excitement in the air, but no one  wants to open it up.    [Announcer] But what is the feeling of your party at the  moment?    [Dipico] The feeling of our party is that we feel extremely  honored. Our people, to go out in their thousands to vote, and  endured hardships, and exercised patience from the 26th to the  28th, and standing in long rows of queues for hours to cast  their votes for the first time. And we thank them very much.  They have shown tolerance, they have shown that they are  prepared to work together to be able to achieve a very stable  province, and to be able to deal with issues which are going to  affect their daily lives, in particular their basic needs, which  are of importance, particularly in our province because it is  really not developed.    [Announcer] Manne, the fight here is for the colored vote.  Do you think your party has done enough?    [Dipico] The results actually put it very clear to you that  the majority of our voters in the Province of the Northern Cape  are coloreds, which clearly put a point and a message across  that our people will never be fooled by all those who have been  going around that the colored community vote NP [National  Party], or the colored does not trust the ANC. It is a clear  message that our people know who are the right leaders. They  know which are the organizations which they can trust their  lives on. And the message of the results of the Northern Cape  clearly demonstrates that our people, even in the colored  community, wanted a change, and a change for a better future,  and the ANC can provide that. They have put their confidence in  the hands of the ANC, in the hands of the leadership, which is  tested and proven from Mandela up to the provincial leadership.    [Announcer] Thank you very much.    [Dipico] Thank you very much.</p>

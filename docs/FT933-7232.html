			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Observer: Just kidding Smith New Court obviously likes the sound of Chiltern Radio. The firm's latest research on Chiltern, called 'The only way is up', carries the immortal line 'the shares have fallen by over 100 per cent in the last year and now look cheap'. Perhaps the offending analyst should follow the example of Capital Radio's David Jensen, whose photo adorns the report, and seek alternative work as a disc jockey. He would be guaranteed a better reception.</p>

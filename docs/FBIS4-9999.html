			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 4 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina Martinez announced today that his country will  implement an open market policy. He stated that in a move to  overcome the economic crisis that is weighing heavily on the  island, Fidel Castro's administration will not "impose  limitations" on the entry of foreign capital.    During a news conference Robaina pointed out that "our visit  to Uruguay, as the first leg of a tour of the region, seeks to  explain to Latin American rulers the reality of the Cuban  situation and to announce the opening of our market to foreign  capital."    Robaina acknowledged that the economic and social  deterioration confronting Cuba has obliged its rulers to seek a  way out by "implementing an open market policy and accepting  that foreign capital--regardless of its origin--can invest in  our country free from any constraints."    The Cuban foreign minister, who arrived in Montevideo on 4  April for a three-day official visit, was received by President  Luis Alberto Lacalle at his private residence. They held a  30-minute talk.    Robaina said: "We discussed several subjects of Latin  American interest, laying special emphasis on the reality that  we Cubans are living through at present and on the possibility  of enhancing bilateral trade."    Trade between Uruguay and Cuba is paralyzed due to the fact  that the Castro administration has a $30 million debt with  Uruguay that has been outstanding for four years. Robaina  offered to repay this debt by "sending medicines and medical  equipment" to Uruguay.    The young foreign minister said that "the most promising  sectors for those investors who are interested in coming to Cuba  are tourism, biotechnology, and agriculture."    Following his meeting with Lacalle, Robaina had luncheon  with  Liber Seregni, the leader of the leftist coalition, the Broad  Front, and then had a meeting with Cubans residing in Uruguay.    The Cuban foreign minister's agenda also includes a meeting  with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu on 5 April. On the  last day of his visit Robaina will deliver a speech before  representatives from the 11 countries that make up the Latin  American Integration Association (ALADI), which is headquartered  in Montevideo.    Cuban Embassy spokesmen have reported that Robaina's tour,  which started in Uruguay, will also include visits to Peru,  Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>

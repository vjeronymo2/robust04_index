			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE COURT IS IN FULL BLOOM;  </P> <P> CONTEST: THE QUEEN OF THE 102ND TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE WILL BE SELECTED  TUESDAY FROM AMONG THE SEVEN AMERICAN BEAUTIES.  </P> <P> For 17-year-old Cara Payton Rullman, trying out for the Tournament of Roses  Royal Court was just a lark, something that she and about 35 of her San Marino  girlfriends decided to do this year.  </P> <P> For 18-year-old Dawn Christine Gray of Pasadena, the competition represents a  third, determined try for the coveted title of Rose Queen. The Rose Court is  the closest Gray has come yet.  </P> <P> "I think it's easier every year," she said of her previous attempts, "but  everything that comes up now will be new."  </P> <P> Despite different motives for entering the contest, both teen-agers ended up  teary-eyed Monday after they were named to the seven-member court. More than  700 young women competed this year at Tournament House in Pasadena in a  three-week round of judging. The contest is open to residents of the Pasadena  Community College District.  </P> <P> The seven teen-agers compose an exotic-appearing court this year, reflecting  the ethnic diversity of the San Gabriel Valley. Members include a young woman  whose parents are from India, an African-American, a Japanese-American and a  Chinese-American.  </P> <P> Those named Monday were Tisha Mei-Lin Kong, 16, of San Marino, captain of the  varsity tennis team at San Marino High School; Wendy Nicole Schnee, 17, of  Pasadena, active on the student council at Westridge School; and Jessica Leigh  Roegler, 17, of Altadena, principal violist in the John Muir High School  Symphony.  </P> <P> Also named were Harini Reddy, 17, of Arcadia, a Westridge student who takes  Indian music classes; and Andrea Sae Uyeda, 16, of Pasadena, a Polytechnic  School student and member of Zendeko Taiko, a Japanese drum group.  </P> <P> Gray, a Pasadena City College student active in the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, and Rullman, a San Marino High School varsity  cheering squad member, complete the court.  </P> <P> One of the seven will be named the Rose Queen on Tuesday. She presides over the  102nd Tournament of Roses Parade, Jan. 1 in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The parade, whose theme this year is "Fun 'n' Games," will be followed the same  day by the 77th Rose Bowl game, featuring the Pacific 10 and Big Ten conference  champions.  </P></p>

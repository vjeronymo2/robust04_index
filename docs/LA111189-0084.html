			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BERKELEY;  </P> <P> LEGENDARY BERKELEY DORM WILL CLOSE  </P> <P> After a decade of controversy over drug use and wild parties, voters in a  University Students Cooperative Assn. voted to close graffiti-strewn Barrington  Hall. The run-down dormitory that became a Berkeley legend will be closed Dec.  20. Residents will be given rooms elsewhere in the co-op system. The building  may be sold, converted to an apartment complex or reopened as housing for  graduate and upper-division students.  </P></p>

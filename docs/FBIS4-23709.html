			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Arts, Culture, Science and Technology  Minister Winnie Mandela has hit back at allegations of  overspending during her stay in Cape Town for the opening of  Parliament.    According to newspaper reports, her hotel bill came to more  than 12,000 rands. Mrs. Mandela said that by asking the state  to give a ruling on who should pay the account, Education  Director Bernard Louw was trying to undermine her position and  embarrass her. Mrs. Mandela said the newspaper reports were  incorrect, but did not elaborate other than to say that she had  been accompanied by four bodyguards, and not eight.</p>

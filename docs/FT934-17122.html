			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: NBC buys control of Super Channel NBC, the US national broadcaster, yesterday confirmed that it had bought a majority stake in Super Channel, the UK-based satellite channel which beams general programmes all over Europe. The stake has been bought from the Marcucci family of Lucca in Italy, who have controlled the channel, originally set up by the ITV companies, for more than five years. Mr Tom Rogers, NBC executive vice president and president of NBC cable, said yesterday the move reflected the US broadcaster's determination to grow 'by expanding its presence outside the US and by diversifying into cable and new media domestically'. Mr Rogers said the aim would be to keep the general entertainment and news format of Super Channel but to add more news and business programming, including the NBC Nightly News and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The executive said the NBC strategy was to turn Super Channel, which is available in 30m homes in western Europe and a further 26m homes through rebroadcasting in eastern Europe and Russia, 'into a truly premium channel'. Under the deal, which cost NBC about Pounds 40m, the American broadcaster will have a majority stake and managerial control. Together with Credit Lyonnaise it will have a total of 75 per cent. NBC yesterday declined to give the exact split. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group and other minority shareholders will hold the remaining 25 per cent. NBC executives said yesterday that the satellite television market in Europe was exploding, and that they saw signs of significant growth in the pan-European advertising market. Mr Patrick Cox, managing director of NBC Europe, will become chairman of Super Channel, but Mrs Marialina Marcucci will remain on the board. The Marcuccis, whose interests include broadcasting and manufacturing in Italy, intend to set up a significant independent television production operation in the UK.</p>

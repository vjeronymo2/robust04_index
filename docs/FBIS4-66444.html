			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline] </F>   [Text] The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)  will perform a broad-area acid-rain-monitoring survey and a  program to determine the effects of air pollution in four  Southern Chinese cities, including Liuchow (Kwansi Chuan  Self-Governing District). In November 1993, JICA dispatched its  first survey group to China. The group, in cooperation with the  PRC's National Science and Technology Committee and municipal  environmental protection bureaus, plans to draft by October 1994  a general anti-air-pollution program (to run through fiscal year  2005) that will monitor and control acid-rain concentrations in  the areas. Recently, environmental cooperation between Japan and  PRC was accelerated with the December 1993 conclusion of the  Sino-Japanese environmental cooperation pact while Chairman  Jieng Song of the National Science and Technology Committee,  PRC, was visiting Japan.    Liuchow City was chosen as the main monitoring site because  of the concentration of iron works and heat-and-electric power  plants in the city. The city's industrial production ranks the  fourth in the self-governing district and the 18th among the 190  industrial cities in the entire nation. According to Seiji  Kaiho, chief of the Second Social Development Survey Section of  JICA, Liuchow's industrial activities at times ``have a  considerable effect on the environment for residents in Hong  Kong and the Ju River delta.''    The broad-area acid-rain-monitoring survey will be carried  out by installing three or four precision measurement  instruments at each of a total of 16 sites: five sites in  Liuchow, five in Gueilin (Kwansi Chuan Self-Governing District),  two in Wuchow (Kwansi Chuan Self-Governing District), and four  in Kwanchow (Kwanton Province).    In the PRC, acid rain is defined as having a pH of less than  5.6. In 1991, rain pH of 4.29 was recorded in Liuchow, where the  acid- rain rate was as high as 98 percent. These values were  about the same as or higher than the other cities in the area;  i.e., Gueilin (4.78 and 64 percent), Wuchow (3.98-4.5 and 87  percent), and Kwanchow (4.1 and 72 percent). Thus, the  broad-area monitoring was deemed necessary.    The investigation concerning air pollution will target three  points:    (1) types of pollutants;    (2) meteorological data collection;    (3) measurement of emission components at factories, i.e.,  emission sources.    There will be 10 monitoring locations designated within  Liuchow City.</p>

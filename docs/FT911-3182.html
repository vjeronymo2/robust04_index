			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Laura Ashley losses jump to Pounds 6.7m LAURA ASHLEY, the fashion and furnishings group, yesterday announced steepening pre-tax losses to Pounds 6.67m in the year to January 26, from Pounds 1.58m. However, Mr Mike Smith, acting chief executive, said Laura Ashley had achieved its main objective to strengthen its balance sheet. 'This was a year of restructuring, rather than profit,' he said. Earlier in the year the company was involved in a refinancing. It later restructured by closing seven factories and its Units retailing chain, selling its Penhaligon, Bryants, Sandringham Leather and Helmond Printworks businesses, and cutting overheads. Laura Ashley also announced a trading link with Aeon Group which resulted in the Japanese retailer taking a stake. The rationalisation resulted in borrowings falling to Pounds 23m from Pounds 87m, reducing gearing to 25 per cent from 119 per cent. The disposals and tighter management controls helped cut stock levels by 38 per cent by the year end. Laura Ashley increased sales 10 per cent to Pounds 327.53m but higher costs and an increased interest charge of Pounds 12.44m, against Pounds 8.64m, eroded gains. UK turnover grew to Pounds 143.6m from Pounds 142.6m, although the overall figure concealed a 4.1 per cent decline in like-for-like sales. Home furnishing sales remained flat because of the depressed housing market and garment sales fell as the recession bit. The company's international operations were more resilient. North American outlets increased their sales contribution to Pounds 136.2m from Pounds 117.2m, although margins were held back by discounting. Sales in continental Europe were also strongly ahead at Pounds 40.7m, against Pounds 28.6m, and the link with Aeon led to the opening of 13 shops in Japan and an 88 per cent sales boost. Losses per share amounted to 2.6p compared with losses of 3.38p in the previous period. The company is paying a nominal final dividend of 0.1p although directors and the Ashley family are waiving their entitlements. The company is reviewing its marketing and has appointed Ms Glenne Gibson from Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte to help develop the international brand. She said this would lead to designs reflecting consumer aspirations through the 1990s. 'But we will not be phasing out all our flowers,' she said yesterday. Laura Ashley expects to appoint a chief executive soon after receiving 500 applications. Lex, Page 22; Aquascutum chief retires, Page 25</p>

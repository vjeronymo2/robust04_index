			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for  21 August.    In Mexico City, officials from eight of the nine political  parties have signed an Agreement for Electoral Transparency and  Fairness. In the agreement, the parties committed to taking  necessary steps to ensure that all stages of the electoral  process are carried out within a framework of harmony, mutual  respect, transparency, security, trust, and credibility. The  director of the National Action Party (PAN) in Mexico City said:  "Public funds should not be channeled to any political party."  (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 20 May  94)    Federal District Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez has told the  leaders of the eight political parties who signed the Agreement  for Electoral Transparency and Fairness that Mexico City will  not be held "hostage" to conflict caused by political  differences among the various parties. Aguilera Gomez said: "If  we want to live in peace, we must adopt a policy of inclusion,  not exclusion." (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 10 May 94 pp  1, 11)    The Chamber of Deputies has elected six new advisers who  will  form part of the Federal Electoral Institute's General Council  in the upcoming 21 August elections. All of the advisers meet  the legal requirement of not having belonged to or led any  political party over the past three years. The main duty of  these advisers will be to oversee the election's transparency  and honesty. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in  Spanish 1300 GMT 25 May 94)    PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos claims that ever  since the 11 May debate, attempts to tarnish his image have  increased. "I have been accused of being an attorney for drug  traffickers, a member of Opus Dei, and a member of secret  organizations," Fernandez said. He said there is an attempt to  undermine his platform in which he places his trust for  democracy's victory in Mexico. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television  Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 25 May 94)    PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos has spoken out in  favor of modifying the Federal Labor Law in an effort to  modernize it without taking back gains made in the area of  workers rights. He also said there is an urgent need to  democratize labor unions. He said: "For the sake of protecting  the workers, we must seek measures that protect jobs and create  structures that do not hinder the hiring of workers. We know  that many times false protectionism only leads to unemployment."  (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 26 May 94)    After a four-hour meeting, members of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party's (PRD) National Executive Commission  decided to accept a debate with Carlos Almaga, director of the  National Voter Registration Office. The PRD will be represented  by Samuel del Villar, and it was decided that the debate would  last 53 minutes instead of 45, as had originally been proposed.  The debate will take place at Federal Electoral Institute  Headquarters. PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo said: "Del Villar  has a knowledge of the issues -- legal as well as technical  knowledge -- and, therefore, we hope he can demonstrate what is  evident: the fact that enormous errors exist in the electoral  register."

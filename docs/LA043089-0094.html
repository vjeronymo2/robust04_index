			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOING WITH GLASNOST: A TESTIMONY BY TRAIN  </P> <P> On my last reporting trip before being expelled as Newsweek's Moscow bureau  chief in 1982, I was accused by authorities in the Central Asian city of  Dushanbe of telling young men that the Soviet Union should abolish the draft.  The basis for the charge: During discussions with young Muslims about the  Afghanistan War, I had mentioned the United States having an all-volunteer  Army. To the KGB, that was tantamount to advocating draft resistance.  </P> <P> I recently returned to the Soviet Union and found that, like so much else,  attitudes towards the West and Westerners are changing, although often  unevenly. Conversations that once would have been branded "provocative" are now  commonplace, and the authorities have largely given up trying to insulate  society from the outside world. Like their American counterparts, Soviet  citizens exhibit uninhibited curiousity about the other superpower. And, as in  the United States, there is a lively debate about possible interaction between  Western policy and Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika.  </P> <P> The most dramatic change is government willingness to tolerate, even encourage,  the opening of communications channels that present a picture of the West  wholly at odds with the old imagery. Taking full advantage of his fluent  Russian, U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr. regularly delivers speeches to  Soviet audiences, including military academies. Soviet publications have run  lengthy interviews with him which he characterizes as "absolutely fair."  Western radio broadcasts are no longer jammed and Soviet emigres are allowed to  return home for visits, spreading word about their lives in the West. A small  but growing number of Soviet citizens are traveling to the West on private  visits, not as members of official delegations.  </P> <P> Traveling by train, I found people more interested than ever in details of  Western life -- prices, wages, ethnic relations -- and comparing them to their  own situation. As a Western reporter, I encountered less fear and harassment  than before, particularly in the Baltic republics. But in provincial Russia,  old instincts die harder. In the northern city of Vologda, a young man  contacted me and made a classic KGB entrapment pitch: Would I help relay  information about "police and troop deployments in the region" to American  correspondents in Moscow?  </P> <P> Some once-standard questions were significantly absent this time: Who lives  better, the West or us? Why does America want war? They were never asked by the  people with me in the "hard" or second- class cabins of trains, since the  answer to the first question was now obvious and the second deemed laughable. A  young engineer recalled the old propaganda line that the United States was to  blame for Soviet food shortages, since the "American threat" necessitated heavy  defense spending. "Now that we have good relations, who will we blame?" Then he  grinned.  </P> <P> The only time I heard the old line was in a first-class compartment through the  Ukraine. Two middle-aged Communist Party officials claimed they knew for a fact  that "some Americans, not ordinary people, but the neo-fascists," want war. But  as we were pulling into the station, a young man who had stayed out of the  discussion attacked the two officials for representing "the era of stagnation,"  the current term for the Leonid I. Brezhnev era. Something like that would not  have happened before.  </P> <P> Deeper divisions exist on the more fundamental question of whether the West  should serve as a model for the Soviet Union. Activists in the Baltic republics  openly push for Western-style democracy and capitalism. Some Russians are  similarly inclined -- but others fear unleashing "anarchic" forces. Writer  Vasily Belov asked if I believed it was a good thing that glasnost has already  opened the doors to "narcotics, eroticism and pornography," which he clearly  identified as products of Western-style liberalism. Dmitri Vasilyev, leader of  the Russian ultranationalist group Pamyat and an avowed monarchist, argued that  "the West is not an ideal and may be even worse than what we have here."  </P> <P> But as recent elections demonstrated, many citizens, Russians included, are  eager to open their system further, emulating Western ways. Among official  propagandists for perestroika and among dissidents pushing for still broader  changes, debate focuses on a familiar question: How can the West help Soviet  reform?  </P> <P> Veteran Izvestia correspondent Melor Sturua hailed my return as a sign of the  improved U.S.-Soviet climate. He had reason to be pleased: in tit-for-tat for  my expulsion in 1982, he had been expelled from Washington. Now the slate was  wiped clean and we both were allowed to return to old stomping grounds. As a  faithful proponent of every policy twist since Stalin's day, Sturua is  currently a fervent advocate of perestroika -- and eager to discuss the West's  "moral obligation" to help the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "The experience of history shows that if you are economically strong, you are  less aggressive and more predictable," he said. The implicit warning: Without  Western aid, perestroika may fail and the Soviet Union will again threaten the  world. Somehow the blackmail element never disappears, even in better times.  </P> <P> The real veterans of battles to open up the Soviet system -- and of the prisons  and labor camps -- take a radically different view of the Western role. "The  support Gorbachev gets in the West gives him the feeling that he can delay  changes in this country," argued Sergei Grigoryants, the editor of the samizdat  journal Glasnost.  </P> <P> I heard the same argument at a meeting of Ukrainian nationalists in Lvov, but  with a more embittered edge. "In times of crisis, the West has saved the Soviet  Union and it is doing so again," Sergei Noboka declared. "The West does not  want destabilization of the Soviet Union and it will do everything to allow us  to be put away for another 15 years." Baltic nationalists expressed similar  worries, that the West would sacrifice the republics' interests on the altar of  a new detente. Most people I met had little confidence in the ability of  Westerners to understand the current situation.  </P> <P> Westerners traveling to the Soviet Union are not helped in that task by a  duplicity that still exists. In Moscow, I met an old friend who occupies a  senior academic position. He exuded utter pessimism about the durability of  glasnost and the chances of perestroika arresting the deterioration of the  Soviet economy -- but only to people he knows well. My friend described a  recent meeting with a group of visiting American Sovietologists, whom he  described as euphoric: "They said everything was wonderful." He shrugged and  smiled sadly. "So who was I to say anything different? I said it was wonderful,  too."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmet Yabuloglu] </F>   [Text] Nicosia -- TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas said that they might unite with  Turkey if the international public continues to commit injustice  in the Cyprus problem.    In a statement on the latest Cyprus development during the  meeting with Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's Republican  People's Party, who is on an official visit to the TRNC, Denktas  indicated that the Greek Cypriot side, which maintains the talks  for merely tactical purposes, is playing a game by entering the  EU [European Union].    Indicating that the TRNC side's entrance into the EU, in  which Turkey is not a member, would mean "its integration with  Greece," Denktas said: "This would mean a limitation of the  guarantee agreements. We have already given our message to the  world. By pursuing this injustice, that is, the south of  Cyprus' joining the EU, they would be securing the complete  integration of North Cyprus with Turkey. Then, that is how the  Cyprus problem will be solved. We are now facing such a  situation."    Saying that despite all their goodwill they are still the  accused side, Denktas hoped that the United Nations would  retract its mistake. He said: "The United Nations has resorted  to a method of forcing us either to accept a bad decision or  face accusations and the Greek Cypriots' entrance into the EU.  It has thus committed a great injustice. We hope they will  realize this and correct it."    In thanking Baykal for his keen interest in the Cyprus  problem, Rauf Denktas said: "We want to see the leaders of the  political parties in Turkey among us during the 20 July  celebrations."</p>

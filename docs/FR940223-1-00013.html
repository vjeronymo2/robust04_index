			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Washington State Department of Corrections proposed amending the producer-handler and nonpool plant provisions to provide total exemption from all provisions of the order for ``a plant owned and operated by a State institution or establishment which processes or packages fluid milk products.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness for the proponent testified that because the Department of Corrections buys milk products from pool plants, there is a continuing conflict between the State law under which the prison dairy is operated, and the Federal order's definition of a producer-handler. He explained that under Chapter 72, Correction Reform Act of 1981, Revised Code of Washington, the Washington State Reformatory Dairy (WSRD) is mandated to ``(1) provide a work training program for inmates, (2) imitate private industry as much as possible and thereby be self-supporting, and (3) provide quality products to government and nonprofit agencies at or below market prices.'' Thus, the WSRD is allowed, under the State law, to buy whatever milk products it needs in order to serve its clients. Such purchases have, on occasion, exceeded the quantity that a producer-handler is allowed to acquire under the Pacific Northwest order, according to the testimony.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only other witness that testified in favor of the proposal represented the Oregon Department of Corrections. Under cross examination, he indicated that there are no Oregon statutes that apply to the Department of Corrections' dairy facility. On the other hand, he also indicated that the Dairy is prohibited from selling to the private sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal to exempt State institutions was opposed by one proprietary handler and by three cooperative associations. The principal thrust of the opposition testimony was that adoption of the proposal would open the door for State institutions to compete against fully regulated handlers for Class I and Class II sales, and that the State institutions would have a competitive advantage by being exempted from the Federal order pricing and pooling regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal to totally exempt a plant operated by a State institution should not be adopted because it would make it possible for the operations to compete for commercial sales against fully regulated handlers. On the other hand, there appears to be a need to provide some relief from the very limited amount of Class I fluid milk products that such a plant may receive from pool plants under the producer-handler provisions of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the testimony on this issue, it is concluded that a State institution that is not exempt from the producer-handler limits on receipts of milk from pool plants should be able to receive more fluid milk products from pool sources than the amount allowed for other producer-handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evidence shows that the WSRD has had problems in conducting its operation in accord with its operating mandate while, at the same time, staying within the limits that the order places on receipts by a producer-handler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current limit on receipts of fluid milk products from pool plants by a producer-handler has been in effect for many years (Official Notice is taken of the Order Amending The Order Regulating The Handling Of Milk In The Puget Sound, Washington, Marketing Area, effective September 1, 1959, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 29, 1959, beginning at page 6027).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this proceeding does not deal with producer-handlers as such, it is clear that the 100 pounds per day limit as applied to a State institution is unreasonably low. This is clearly demonstrated in the testimony that in the last five years the number of inmates in the Washington State Department of Corrections institutions has increased from 6,000 to 10,000 inmates, and that growth to 12,000 is expected in the next three years. Since the Department of Corrections is authorized to purchase products that it does not process or manufacture, the need for greater supplemental purchases is clear. Accordingly, a State institution milk plant should be permitted to receive an average of 1,000 pounds per day of Class I fluid milk products from pool plants during the month. However, no change in the limit should be provided for producer-handlers that are not State institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

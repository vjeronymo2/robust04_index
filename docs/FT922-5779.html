			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (6): Schemes have matured - Youth and adult training THE Coventry and Warwickshire Training and Enterprise Council was set up in September 1990. This was a difficult moment: it was a time when a key Coventry employer, Jaguar, was making large numbers redundant. The TEC has been able to take in some, but by no means all of the 1,000 or so employees made jobless at Jaguar, under its Employment Training programme. The ET scheme, together with the Youth Training Scheme, is one of the two major programmes which the Coventry and Warwickshire Tec like other Tecs has inherited from the government's Training Agency. The ET programme is designed for the older workers, who are thrown on to the labour market in mid-life and who run the risk without retraining of becoming long-term unemployed. YTS was designed for young people between the ages of 16 and 19 with the aim of giving them vocational qualifications. The programme for former Jaguar workers is rather special in that Jaguar is making facilities available for retraining and the Coventry Chamber of Commerce is also involved along with the Coventry and Warwickshire Tec. But the TEC has also had to absorb others made jobless in the recent recession. Mr Scott Glover, the chief executive of the Tec, says that there are around 3,000 people on the ET programme at any given time. He rejects suggestions that the ET programme has just become an easy way for long-term unemployed to pick up money with no real intention of taking a job. 'Seventy five per cent of thepeople we have interviewed, and this includes employers as well as people on the scheme, have said they feel the scheme has been very beneficial,' he says. He estimates that there is a successs rate of 25 per cent of people on the scheme finding new work - 'this is not high enough of course, but it is early days in the scheme and there has been a fierce recession.' Several millions of the budget of Pounds 25m is spent on adult training. Around 56 per cent of the total goes on youth training which is the other main programme inherited from the training agency. The idea is that young people of between 16 and 19 are given funds with which they can not support themselves exist but also buy some training - either on-job training or at a college or a combination of both - which will lead to a recognised national vocational qualification (NVA). There was much criticism of the youth training scheme (YTS) when it was administered by the Training Agency. It was said that some employers 'just used young people as cheap labour' and failed to give them training. Young people on the other hand saw the YTS as a government ruse to deny them their social security money or unemployment benefit, since acceptance of YTS money implied taking a job of some kind whether it entailed training or not. Mr Glover says: 'The schemes vary from area to area. But yes, I suppose in the early days the YTS was designed to get young people off the streets. But the schemes have matured. They are not known as the youth training schemes, but just youth training. Our surveys show that 75 per cent of young people involved in our programmes are receiving training of some kind which should lead to a vocational qualification.' The Coventry and Warwickshire Tec has not gone over to the voucher scheme adopted by other Tecs. Under this system, the young person is given a voucher or credit which can then be cashed in to buy training. Instead, the Coventry Tec goes in for what Mr Glover calls 'flexible funding.' This means giving the young person as much as possible to meet his or her training needs. 'We must recognise it takes more to train an engineer than it does a typist,' he says. Funding remains a problem. There are 310,000 people in Coventry and 480,000 in wider Warwickshire. The Pounds 25m is only a fraction more than the Training Agency was spending before the Tec was set up. BESIDES the two training programmes the Tec has also taken over the enterprise scheme and is responsible for small business. The Tec wants to to do more than perpetuate old schemes. The main thrust of its aims is closer targetting. By this is meant surveys to find out what are the skills needs of the area and a closer involvement with companies, local authorities, and educational authorities to try and match those skills with the right kind of training. One recent survey showed a need for, among other things: Drivers for heavy goods, fork lift and public service vehicles. In engineering - craft technicians and engineers. Tourism, catering and hotel staff. Management skills of all kinds. All forms of electricians and electronic engineers. All modern offices skills, eg computing and word processing. This survey was taken at a time when unemployment was over 12 per cent in Coventry although much lower in Warwickshire as a whole. It showed a considerable skills mismatch. The economy of Coventry has changed over the past decade with a diversification into high technology industries away from the dependence on engineering in the automotive industry. Nevertheless, the 200 largest companies still employ nearly 40 per cent of the workforce. It is expected that some of these companies will shed further labour and that there will be a high proportion of men and women in their 50s needing retraining. One scheme which the TEC is behind is to get big companies to use their facilities to train people from smaller concerns or from business start-ups. 'This all takes time. We are evolutionary, rather than revolutionary,' says Mr Glover. He stresses though, that the Tec does not want to be a provider of training itself but wants to be an enabler or facilitator. This means the main aim is to get local companies and education bodies involved - and keep them involved.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with General Luis Feliu Ortega, deputy </F> commander of UN forces in Bosnia, and General Jose Antonio Leal  Castillo, General Ortega's replacement, in Kiseljak, by an  unidentified studio announcer -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Tomorrow in the Bosnian city of  Kiseljak, the deputy head of the UN forces in Bosnia, UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces], will be relieved of his command. The  Spanish General Luis Feliu is also the head of the Spanish  contingent in former Yugoslavia. He will hand over to another  general from our country, General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo.  On the eve of the handover we contacted both military men.  Good evening General Luis Feliu.    [Feliu] Good evening.    [Announcer] How has the conflict in Bosnia changed since you  arrived on the scene a few months ago?    [Feliu] Well, once again we are at a critical juncture. And  I say once again because exactly when I took over, at the end of  July, an important cease-fire agreement was signed by the three  military leaders and it should have been enforced once the  Geneva peace agreement was signed. And then, I chaired a series  of meetings held at the level of seconds in command of the three  military factions also to develop this cease-fire agreement.  [passage omitted]    Luckily, today there is a new glimmer of hope, an important  glimmer of hope. There is no new cease-fire because  theoretically the former one could still be enforced, but we do  have reasons to hope for Sarajevo. There are beginnings of  partial agreements on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry and this  is important because it creates the conditions to reach -- maybe  -- God willing -- a definitive peace agreement.    The work of the blue helmets has always been constructive.  But many can object that nothing has been gained, nothing  concrete. But I would tell them two things if I may. One, just  think what would have happened if the blue helmets had not been  there, think what would have happened without the humanitarian  aid and without our presence. And secondly, the blue helmets --  and this is very important -- did not come here to impose peace,  not even to negotiate it. We have to render humanitarian aid  possible and create conditions favorable to a peace agreement.    [Announcer] So you made a positive assessment of the blue  helmets' work. But do you agree with the criticisms made by  some blue helmet commanders about how the UN forces lacked means  to enforce international resolutions?.    [Feliu] Well, as for the first part of the question, yes, I  do made a positive assessment because it has been so. [passage  omitted].    As for the criticisms, I say that first I do not normally  comment on personal criticisms. And I do not think that I  should criticize my immediate superior, in this case General  Briquemont [passage omitted]. All of us would have liked to  have more forces, or at least some more forces so as to be able  to accomplish our missions better and avoid tiring or exhausting  our units.    [Announcer] As you mentioned you are leaving Bosnia at a  crucial moment, now that NATO has set an ultimatum to those who  are besieging Sarajevo. How well is the security of the blue  helmets ensured -- specially those closer to Sarajevo -- in case  of air strikes?    [Feliu] No one can ensure -- and even less so in a war --  even though it is not our war, we are in a war -- 100 percent  security. And the proof is that sadly our blue helmets have  suffered casualties - and why not recall here the Spanish  casualties. But I can say that all necessary precautions have  been taken. If there were air attacks, they would be decided by  the appropriate authorities and after an adequate analysis and  examination, taking into account the situation.    [Announcer] General Feliu, tomorrow you will be succeeded in  Bosnia as deputy head of UNPROFOR and head of the Spanish  contingent by General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo who is also on  the line with us. General Leal, good evening.    [Leal] Good evening.    [Announcer] What advice has General Feliu given you? How do  you feel as you take on this job?    [Leal] Well, optimistic and full of good will. I have only  been here for a couple of days. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] General Leal, right now international attention  is focussing on Sarajevo, but there are other, many other  flash-points in the Bosnian war. Are the Spanish blue helmets  in Mostar suffering from any kind of marginal risk because of  the ultimatum in Sarajevo?    [Leal] I do not think that there are any marginal or  additional, risks for the Spanish contingent because of the  ultimatum. All the measures have been taken to avoid these  risks.    [Announcer] So if there were to be possible reprisals  because  of air strikes, the reprisals would not reach the Spanish  contingent?    [Leal] I really do not think so. No, really not.    [Announcer] Is it your opinion, General Leal, that the  solution to the war in Bosnia is an international military  action or should this be part of a diplomatic solution?    [Leal] That is not a question I can answer particularly  well.  However, I believe that the solution to this war, like any other  war, does not necessarily have to be military action. And I  hope that it will be like that, for everyone's sake. There is  always time to find a negotiated solution.    [Announcer] General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo and General  Luis Feliu, thank you for answering this phone call from Radio  Nacional and good luck in your new jobs.</p>

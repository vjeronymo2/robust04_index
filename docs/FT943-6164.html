			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Observer: Stand and deliver Wow. The Alliance &amp; Leicester building society has become the first of its kind to release interim profit figures on a voluntary basis. Peter White, A&amp;L's chief executive, said his society had taken this historic step to be in line with best practice and to improve accountability to its members. No doubt. It may also be intended to impress upon the Treasury, which is about to launch a consultation paper looking at how societies might be made more accountable, that mutual organisations already have their members in mind. This extra information is welcome. But if A&amp;L was really keen to impress on its customers the benefits of membership, it could revive an old building societies tradition and pay them a dividend. One to watch for the full-year results perhaps?</p>

			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chrysler debt talks progress CHRYSLER'S negotiations with its bankers over the rescheduling of more than Dollars 6.8bn of the company's debt should be concluded this month, said the carmaker's chairman, Mr Lee Iacocca, yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson. Mr Iacocca said the talks were 'going very well,' thanks to the success of some of Chrysler's newly-launched vehicles and the company's improving sales outlook. An agreement should be reached by July 30, he said, but it could be even sooner. Speaking at a production launch for Chrysler's new 'LH' mid-sized car, Mr Iacocca said the company was ready to operate profitably selling between 2m and 2.5m vehicles a year over the next five years. The Chrysler chairman's comments encouraged Wall Street, where the campany's stock rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 21 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

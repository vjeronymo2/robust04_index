			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Haitians may get US jobs training Haitian refugees being held at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, will start coming home on Monday. US officials could not confirm the number of people who have asked to return, but have taken their requests to do so as a sign that Haitians see the US military presence as a guarantee of security. Although no details were given, it is understood the US intends to train as many as 1,500 of the people returning for civilian and policing jobs in Haiti. There are currently more than 15,000 refugees at Guantanamo. US embassy spokesmen said refugees would be repatriated on a voluntary basis only. US commanders in Haiti yesterday continued to develop operating regulations for their troops in co-ordination with Haiti's military command. General Henry Shelton, US commander of the joint task force in Haiti, yesterday held his fourth meeting of the week with General Raoul Cedras, the military leader, who is required to step down by October 15. In downtown Port-au-Prince, Colonel Mike Sullivan, head of the US military police units, met Colonel Michel Francois, the chief of police, who was instrumental in the 1991 coup which ousted elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. News of a meeting with the reclusive but influential Col Francois, whose whereabouts had been unclear even to US officials earlier in the week, will relieve many who have feared he was not party to the agreement to restore Mr Aristide. More US troops came out to patrol the streets of Port-au-Prince in conjunction with Haitian police. In addition, embassy officials announced that three Special Forces operating detachments were yesterday due to be sent out to the Haitian countryside to take up positions at Gonaves, Jacmel and Cap Haitien. Twelve UN observers arrived yesterday to monitor the military operation, which, although only involving US personnel on the ground as yet, is a multinational intervention sanctioned by UN Resolution 940 in July earlier this year. US defence secretary William Perry and General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the military joint chiefs of staff, will visit Haiti today to meet US forces, defence officials said, Reuter adds. They will return to Washington this evening.</p>

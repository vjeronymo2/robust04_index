Hosokawa asked Yamahana, former head of the Social  Democratic  Party (SDP), to proceed with drawing up districts for the 300  single-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives, the  officials said.    The request was made as the House of Councillors passed into  law political reform package amendments that will replace the  current multiseat districts with 300 single-seat constituencies  and 200 seats allocated according to popular vote in 11  electoral units.    The package, which also revises regulations on political  donations by corporations, will be enforced after enactment of a  law delineating the 300 single-seat constituencies, expected  this fall.    Hosokawa also asked Yamahana to study the possibility of  lowering the age of voter eligibility from 20 to 18.</p>

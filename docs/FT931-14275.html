			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (25): There's a long, long trail awinding - Jonathan S Schwarz traces the uneven progress towards a uniform taxation system HARMONISATION of tax systems in the European Community has been on the political agenda since the EC's inception. Fiscal barriers have been identified as an important inhibition to intra-community trade and investment. However, since revenue-raising by Governments is regarded as at the heart of sovereignty, the development of a European tax system has been a long and tortuous process. When the Single European Act was passed in 1987, it was recognised that taxation, unlike other targets for harmonisation, was so close to the states' national interests that majority voting did not apply. As a result, the unanimous approval of member states is required to introduce new EC tax law. Nevertheless, a unified tax system is now discernible, particularly in the indirect tax field, with new items being added to the agenda all the time. The longest standing element of European Community tax law is the common customs duty regime. A single Community customs law sets rules for the import of goods into the community and provides for their valuation. European Community regulation specifies the valuation of goods for customs purposes. Although implementation and collection of customs duty is handled by member states, collaboration is ensured by the customs co-operation council. Once goods have crossed the customs frontiers around the community, they enter into free circulation and may be traded freely without further customs duty. As part of the single market, agreements have now also been reached on the harmonisation of excise duties relating to tobacco, alcohol and fuel oils. Value added tax (VAT) is perhaps the real European Community tax. It was introduced into community law by the first VAT directive in 1967 and all states were required to adopt a common system by 1972. Not only is VAT established under community law which all members are required to implement, but because a portion of the tax collected is paid to the community directly. and forms part of its own resources, it is also a European tax. The introduction of the interim VAT regime on January 1, 1993 was a major step towards disregarding intra-community boundaries in determining how the supply of goods should be taxed. Although the method adopted is complex, it is designed to move towards a system where transactions between member states will be taxed in the same way as transactions within a single member state. While the adoption of a 15 per cent minimum standard rate of VAT has required only Germany, Luxembourg and Spain to increase their rates, psychologically it has reinforced the idea of VAT as a common European tax. Furthermore, the European Court of Justice has shown little tolerance for member states which attempt to impose turnover taxes that do not comply with community law, or fail to implement the tax directives properly. Virtually no member state has escaped judgment on this. Direct taxation has not proceeded at the same rate as the indirect tax system. Although proposals for corporate tax harmonisation have been around for more than two decades, it is only at the beginning of 1992 that two corporate tax directives entered into effect. The parent and subsidiary companies directive aims at eliminating the withholding of taxes on payments across member states' borders and eliminating double taxation on distributions paid by subsidiaries to their parent companies in other member states. The second directive is designed to facilitate tax free cross-border corporate mergers, acquisitions, divisions and share-for-share exchanges. Both directives have, however, been criticised as being incomplete and somewhat unclear as to their precise scope and meaning. Member states have also been slow to introduce implementing legislation, and the manner in which the directives have been implemented varies noticeably from one member state to another. As a result, the term 'harmonisation' is perhaps inappropriate. The Treaty of Rome talks of approximation of laws and this is a more realistic description of the manner in which these directives actually take effect. Thus while the two directives may present a picture of a common system, in practice wide variations mean that the rules of member states differ significantly and only have some common features. In the case of the mergers directive, implementation is further inhibited by the fact that in several member states, corporate law has not kept pace with tax developments, and therefore transactions which are contemplated under the directives cannot be implemented under existing corporate law. Other difficulties arise because the directive only covers corporation taxes, whereas in practice such transactions are often affected by a variety of other taxes notably stamp duties, registration and transfer taxes. In addition to the two corporation tax directives, a treaty was signed between all member states in an attempt to harmonise the rules relating to inter-company transfer pricing. The arbitration treaty provides for a common standard of measuring arm's length prices, as well as for an arbitration mechanism in the event of differences between the treatment of transfer pricing adjustments between the member states. While arbitration has been advocated as a method of resolving such difficulty by many practitioners, the treaty has yet to be ratified by all member states. Even when it does enter into effect, it has a limited initial life of six years and many doubt whether this is sufficient time to test the system thoroughly. While success in achieving a unified system in the direct tax field has been limited, in practice there has been convergence between European corporate tax systems in a number of respects. The first and most obvious is an alignment of mainstream corporation tax rates. Most countries have tax rates between 33 and 40 per cent. In addition, most member states, at least during the 1980s, attempted to broaden their tax bases and reduce rates. A variety of incentives, such as investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation, have been eliminated generally. While the taxation commissioner, Mrs Christiane Scrivener, has approved this process some countries, such as Belgium, have been concerned that excessive tax competition between states would cause undue pressure to be brought on the governments. This has not prevented Belgium along with Luxembourg from entering into competition with the Netherlands to produce the ideal European holding company location. The Ruding committee appointed by the Commission to consider the future of direct tax harmonisation in the EC produced a detailed report containing ambitious proposals for a European tax system whose introduction was to be geared to the stages of economic and monetary union contemplated by the Maastricht Treaty. Uncertainty about Maastricht and turmoil in the currency markets, which has thrown into question the very existence of the European exchange rate mechanism, has sharply halted progress towards economic and monetary union. The Commission has, however, proposed a more modest programme of measures designed to facilitate cross-border transactions within the community, including extending the current parent subsidiary directive to all forms of company and to payments of interests and royalties. A proposal has also been made to enable European groups to use cross-border losses. Mrs Scrivener believes that such measures would go some way towards eliminating tax disadvantages of cross-border investment and trade. With the Commission under fire for its alleged tendencies towards centralisation, she is reluctant to push member states too far. Jonathan S Schwarz is a partner at Paisner &amp; Co.

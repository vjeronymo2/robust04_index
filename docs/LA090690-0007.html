			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER HAYDEN AND 'BIG GREEN'  </P> <P> After reading the Hayden initiative, Proposition 128, I have come to the  conclusion that too many complex and important subjects are thrown together in  this one measure.  </P> <P> Once the thoughtful voter sifts through the 16,000-word document, it becomes  painfully clear that matters such as saving our redwood trees, food safety, the  greenhouse effect on the entire planet, carbon dioxide emissions, car and home  air-conditioning systems, water-quality standards and energy supplies cannot be  addressed in a single initiative.  </P> <P> Then, when one realizes that the $3-billion price tag attached to Hayden's  initiative will be placed on the backs of the taxpayers of California, the  voter really has to be alarmed.  </P> <P> SARA DIVITO HARDMAN  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

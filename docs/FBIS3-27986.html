Even though  there were reports of conflicts, relations in the Cabinet have  always been good, said Mr Bunchu in an interview with the  BANGKOK POST.    The Phalang Tham leader's optimism is in stark contrast to  ongoing heated debate on his party's drive for the election of  provincial governors which, observers say, could seriously  threaten the unity of the Chuan Likphai coalition government.    Prime Minister Chuan last week invited leaders and  secretaries-general of coalition parties to a meeting as the  debate heated up. Mr Bunchu said the purpose of the meeting was  not to reduce conflicts among coalition parties as reported.  Instead the leaders discussed ways to convey to the public an  understanding that all coalition members are on good terms.    Coalition conflicts over decentralisation policy, if  escalated, could make a recent prediction on Phalang Tham's  future in the coalition come true. Political activist and  university lecturer Thirayut Bunmi predicted that a government  crisis may arise between the PDP and other coalition parties  this year over either the governor election proposal or traffic  problems. And as a result the PDP may decide to leave the  coalition.    Mr Bunchu dismissed the prediction. Mr Thirayut's analysis,  he said, was based on inaccurate assumptions. "He has to make  more clarifications on what would be the causes and conditions  under which Phalang Tham could no longer stay in the  Government." He says his party has not changed its policy on  decentralisation of government. It has called for direct  election of provincial governors -- the same system now used in  Bangkok. But the party has to accept the Government's  decentralisation policy which is stated more loosely, because it  was in the minority when the policy was drawn up, he said.    Even though the party was not satisfied with that, it had to  accept the policy because it was collectively decided. Mr  Bunchu said he had tried to explain to party members that  Phalang Tham policy and that of the Government still share the  same goal of decentralising power. The Deputy Premier also said  delay in implementation of the policy is caused by the Interior  Ministry, which was assigned to carry it out. This has led  people to think that the Government is not sincere in carrying  out its plan for decentralisation.    "People have got the wrong impression that one coalition  party wants decentralisation while another stalls. This is not  true. Bureaucratic mechanisms are necessary for implementation  (of the policy)," he said. The Interior Ministry, he said, has  been told to speed up implementation. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> As weekly viewers of "Murphy Brown" (we haven't missed an episode), we want to  express our thanks to the producers and writers for having Fred Travalena as  the guest star on the Oct. 30 show. His portrayal of Don Sarasota, the absolute  worst lounge performer, was a classic. The prime-time exposure given Travalena  was long overdue.  </P> <P> Charles and Inez Scott, Ventura  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Land and Resource Management Plan for the Flathead National Forest provides the overall guidance for management activities in the potentially affected area through its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. Most of the proposed activities would occur in Management Areas 15 and 7. Forest plan direction states that Management Area 15 consists of lands where timber management with roads is economical and feasible. The management goal is to manage those lands suitable for timber production for the long-term growth and production of commercially valuable wood products, as well as provide for soil and water protection, wildlife habitat, and roaded recreation opportunities. Management Area 7 is identified as roaded timberlands in visually sensitive areas. The goal in these areas is to manage timber resources in a manner that complements and protects high scenic values, maintaining a pleasing, natural-appearing landscape. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, prescribed burning, road re-construction, and some timber harvest and reforestation may occur within Management Area 12 (riparian areas along perennial streams), Management Area 17 (riparian areas with typically intermittent streams), Management Area 3 (amenity resource values), or Management Area 1 (nonforested lands). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Actions would occur in Management Situation 2 grizzly bear habitat. Management Situation 2 includes areas which do not have distinct bear populations or do not contain year-round high quality bear habitats. The area is a part of the Northern Continental Divide Recovery Area, but categorized as unnecessary for the survival and recovery of the bear. Management considerations include minimizing potential bear mortality and human-grizzly conflicts, and maintaining habitat components. The grizzly bear is an important, but not the primary use in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public involvement conducted during 1993 has resulted in identification of numerous important issues to be addressed in the Draft EIS. Five alternatives to the Proposed Action have been developed to address the following issues: Water quality, fisheries and riparian values, visuals, forest health, grizzly bear, elk, gray wolf, fire risk, and road and travel management. Many other issues will be addressed as features common to all alternatives, or through effects analysis included in the Draft EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no-action'' alternative, in which none of the Proposed Actions would be implemented. Other alternatives will examine various levels and locations of proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purpose, as well as respond to the issues and resource values important to Crane Mountain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis will disclose the environmental effects of alternative ways of implementing the Forest Plan. The EIS will disclose the analysis of the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Effects analysis will address past, present, and projected activities. In addition, the EIS will disclose the analysis of site specific mitigation measures and their effectiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation is especially important at several points of the analysis. People may visit with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. However, two periods of time are identified for the receipt of comments on the analysis. The two public comment periods are during the scoping process (now through May 31, 1994) and in the review of the Draft EIS (anticipated between June and September 1994). The Forest Service has not yet determined whether any public meetings will be held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, will be informally consulted throughout the analysis. To meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will review the EIS and biological evaluation and, if necessary, render a formal Biological Opinion of the effects on the Threatened and Endangered Species including grizzly bear, gray wolf, and bald eagle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review in June or July 1994. At that time the EPA will publish a notice of availability of the Draft EIS in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The public comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date when the EPA's notice of availability appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of Draft EISs must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the Draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 490 F.Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this Proposed Action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the Final Environmental Impact Statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the Proposed Action, comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the Draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following this comment period, the comments received will be analyzed, considered and responded to by the Forest Service in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by October 1994. The Forest Supervisor for the Flathead National Forest is the responsible official for the preparation of this EIS and will make a decision regarding this proposal considering the comments and responses, environmental consequences discussed in the FEIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and rationale for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal under applicable Forest Service regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joel D.

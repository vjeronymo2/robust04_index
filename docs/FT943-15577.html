			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Observer: Chairmen of all battles The girls of St Trinians could not have thought up a better plot. The fate of Felixstowe College, a boarding school in Suffolk, has been thrown into the unlikely hands of Andrew Buxton, chairman of Barclays Bank, and Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq. The mind boggles at the possibilities. It all started when Felixstowe announced a couple of weeks ago that it would close at the end of this term because it had run up sizeable debts. However, this week's sale of the former dartboard in Canford School's tuckshop - a Pounds 7m Assyrian frieze - has offered a possible lifeline for Felixstowe, a fellow member of the loosely grouped Allied Schools - chairman Andrew Buxton. It seems the schools have a policy of guaranteeing each other's debts. There is therefore a possibility - albeit remote - that part of Canford's windfall could be used to bail out the distressed gentlewomen of Felixstowe. Buxton was in a huddle with Allied Schools' governors at Barclays' head office in London yesterday. However, any rescue plan might still have to be passed by Saddam, whose spokesman has described the action of selling the frieze as 'obnoxious'. Iraq said it would use all legal means to recover the carving, and the country's Revolutionary Command Council has also sentenced 'smugglers of antiquities' to death, just to raise the stakes a little. But for the parents and teachers of Felixstowe College, if not the gels, it is already a matter of life and death.</p>

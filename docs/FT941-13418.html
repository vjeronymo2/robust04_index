			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Nigeria unrest hits oil profits Oil companies in Nigeria estimate losses in production and equipment of about Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) last year through civil disruptions and protests against loss of land, pollution and inadequate living conditions, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. Shell, which produces half of Nigeria's quota of 1.8m barrels a day, recorded 108 attacks or stoppages with the loss of 12m barrels in 1993. Agip and Elf have reported smaller losses. Nigeria's oil minister, Mr Don Etiebet, said at the weekend that the government was considering tax concessions to the oil companies for developing the local communities. But this month's budget is not helping to encourage investment. The introduction of a fixed rate of foreign exchange has doubled the cost of bringing in capital.</p>

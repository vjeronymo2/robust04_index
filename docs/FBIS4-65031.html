			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>   [Text] Ankara--Members of the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party  (DEP), closure of which is being considered by the  Constitutional Court, are said to have speeded up the process  towards founding a new party.    DEP members are saying that a new party should still be  formed and the two could merge if the DEP is not closed down.  Meanwhile work is also reported to be underway for the  establishment of another party to represent Kurdish interests.  A group of Kurdish intellectuals, led by former minister  Serafettin Elci, who are said to believe in the need for another  legal Kurdish party, have reportedly stepped up preparations  with this aim in mind. Elci has left for Germany to gather  support for this venture, sources have told the TURKISH DAILY  NEWS.    The case against the DEP at the Constitutional Court is  expected to be concluded by the end of May. Pending the result,  DEP administrators have redoubled their efforts to found a new  party so as not to be left in the political wilderness. The  name of the new party, to be announced in the coming days, is  expected to be the "Democratic People's Party," while its  ideology will be based on establishing solidarity between  Turkish workers and the Kurdish people and support for  democratization.    The party aims to garner mass support by promoting working  class interests, giving it a leftist tendency.    It is also being reported that an agreement appears about to  be reached with supporters of the Kurdistan Socialist Party  (PSK), who were previously DEP members, on the subject of the  new party.    The PSK members are expected to join the new party once it  is  founded. The PSK, which is led by Kemal Burkay, has strong  support from within DEP.    A commission headed by DEP's deputy chairman and deputy for  Van, Remzi Kartal, has been established to oversee preparations  for the foundation of the new party.    The commission also aims to invite Turkish intellectuals  into  the party. Well known names such as Ismail Besikci, Fikret  Baskaya, Ragip Zarakolu, Ertugrul Kurkcu, Haluk Gerger and the  eminent writer Yasar Kemal are to be contacted in the coming  days with this aim in mind.    Leftist groups not represented by political parties, certain  union leaders and the chairmen of various associations will also  be contacted in this context.    The party's program will soon be completed sources say,  adding that the main component will be the emphasis on  "brotherhood and humanism."    The fact that the supporters of the Kurdistan Democrat Party  (PDK-Hevgirtin) [Solidarity] and supporters of the Rizgari  [Freedom] group within the DEP will not join the new party is  also among information being received.    Meanwhile, former Public Works and Housing Minister  Serafettin Elci is also working for the foundation of a legal  Kurdish party.    Prominent Kurds like Mehmet Ali Aslan, Mehmet ali Eren,  Tarik  Ziya Ekinci are working with Elci on this project. This party,  which will contain the word "Kurdish" in its name, will pursue a  conciliatory line and will ask for certain cultural rights with  a view to solving Turkey's Kurdish problem. The people working  for the establishment of this party are said to be also in close  contact with the Iraq Kurdistan Democrat Party (IKDP) of Mas'ud  Barzani.    Elci is said to have contacted certain DEP members regarding  the new party but without positive results.    However, other reports say that DEP's Central Executive  Board  member Resit Deli welcomed the idea of a new party when  approached by Elci.    Elci has also contacted the former People's Labor Party  (HEP)  former chairman Feridun Yazar but Yazar is said to have argued  that Kurds of different views should belong to different parties.    Elci has also had inconclusive talks with another HEP former  chairman, Fehmi Isiklar, and DEP general administrative board  member Altan Tan regarding his proposed new party. It is being  claimed that Serafettin Elci is trying to establish a position  as the head of a legal Kurdish party in order to be accepted as  the spokesman for the Kurds when a more conciliatory tone is  struck between the two sides on Turkey's Kurdish issue.    The Rizgari group and PDK-Hevgirtin are listed among  political groups supporting Elci.    Another important detail concerning the foundation of new  pro-Kurdish parties is the cautious approach of certain DEP  members to the whole issue.    Diyarbakir deputy Sedat Yurttas and certain other deputies  are said to be distancing themselves from the preparations for  the foundation of new parties.    They are said to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</p>

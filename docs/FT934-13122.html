			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): A mature person's pursuit - Alternative investments, Starting in stamps, 1 / The past 10 years have seen a recovery in a stamp market that is still dominated by serious collectors. On these pages we start a quarterly series of articles, offering guidance to the beginner STAMP COLLECTING is cyclical, and the circles seem to be ever-decreasing. Once upon a time, most boys, and a few girls, collected stamps. Then came the teenage years and the stamp album was discarded. In later life, with most of the major bills paid, some early enthusiasts rediscovered the appeal of stamps and became serious collectors. This is still the pattern, although today there are fewer young collectors. Stamps are not the passion they were in the past but, fortunately for the stamp trade, there are still enough new mature collectors to make this a thriving activity. And in certain parts of the world, particularly the Far East, stamp collecting has become a very big business. It is not so much the shortage of collectors that has be-devilled the stamp world in recent years as the blight of speculation. In the mid-1970s, stamps  - traditionally a hobby, which incidentally happened to provide a safe, solid, investment opportunity  - were taken over by aggressive marketing men, who managed to persuade a gullible public that stamps, virtually any stamps, were a rapidly appreciating commodity. The fact that they could be taken legally out of the country at a time of exchange controls fed the fever. Prices roared ahead. The true collectors could not compete but the greedy tumbled in. Then in 1980, inevitably, the bubble burst, and prices fell like a stone. Many stamps, and in particular British stamps, are still fetching less today than they were at the 1979 peak. But since 1983 the market has been slowly recovering. It is dominated again by serious collectors. And when something rare and exceptional appears, competition is keener and prices are exceeding the estimates set by the auction houses. At Sotheby's last month, a fine, fresh, collection of British stamps, estimated at up to Pounds 40,000, sold for almost Pounds 70,000, significantly to a Singapore collector. One consequence of the recession was that many stamp dealers, faced by rising overheads and declining revenue, gave up their premises, and now work from home, buying and selling through fairs, working for a group of regular major clients, and using the salerooms. The auction houses are now the major force in the stamp market, although, of course, leading dealers, such as Stanley Gibbons and Harmers, are still active.</p>

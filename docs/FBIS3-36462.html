Several of the weapons were  discovered with the suspects, while the rest have yet to be  found, according to the Public Communications Center of the  Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.    Specialists in the Interior Ministry still consider Army  units a stable "source of supply" of weapons to criminal  elements. Military personnel fairly often make off with guns  and ammunition in order to earn some extra money. In 1993, 6430  weapons were illegally "transferred" into criminal hands, twice  as much as the corresponding 1992 figure. Every third stolen  weapon is from the Army.    Deputy Chief of the law and order department's investigative  section Leonid Turchin says he is "astonished" by the fact that  unit and regiment commanders cannot ensure the safekeeping of  weapons and explosives, even when they are locked up in depots,  located in military bases and surrounded by high fences and  barbed wire.</p>

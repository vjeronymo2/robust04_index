			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MARCINKUS QUITS VATICAN SERVICE  </P> <P> Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus, the burly American prelate implicated in Italy's  biggest postwar banking scandal, retired from Vatican service today.  </P> <P> The 68-year-old native of Cicero, Ill., said he plans to return to the United  States and take up pastoral work in Chicago.  </P> <P> The Vatican said Pope John Paul II had accepted the resignation, after repeated  requests from Marcinkus, from his post as deputy governor of the Vatican  city-state.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-4 prelate, who acted as a bodyguard to the Pope during his early  foreign travels, headed the Vatican bank, formally known as the Institute for  Religious Works, for 20 years.  </P> <P> But in a sweeping restructuring of the scandal-tainted bank last year, the  Vatican eliminated Marcinkus' post as president.  </P></p>

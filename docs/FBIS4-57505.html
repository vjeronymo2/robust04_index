			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- Today in this capital, Cuba  and Colombia signed an agreement of understanding that will lead  to the establishment of regular flights of the two countries'  airlines.    The document was signed by Fernando Zarama, Colombian  director of national civil aviation, and Argimiro Ojeda Vives,  vice president of the Cuban Civil Aeronautics Institute (IACC).    The agreement specifies that airlines from the two Latin  American nations may offer passenger, cargo, and mail services  regularly and independently from the current weekly charter  flights.    The agreement was the result of negotiations between  delegations from the two countries with the participation of  representatives of Cubana de Aviacion and the Colombian  airlines, namely, SAM, Avianca, Intercontinental, Islena, and  Transportes Aereos Mercantiles Panamericanos (Tampa).    Also present at the talks were Manuel Leal, representing the  Association of Colombian Air Transporters, as well as other IACC  and Cubana de Aviacion officials.    During the signing ceremony, Zarama described as important  the agreement that established bilateral aeronautics relations,  which reflect the friendship and solidarity that exist between  the two nations.    Meanwhile, Colombian Ambassador to Cuba Ricardo Santamaria  underscored the coincidence between the conclusion of the  negotiations, a visit to Cuba by the Colombian Navy's school  ship "Arc Gloria," and the conclusion of a visit to Havana of a  delegation of businessmen interested in investing in the island.    Santamaria said the happy conclusion to the negotiations was  the product of the Cubans' constructive attitude. He said that  Cuba can count on Colombia as a loyal and friendly partner.    Ojeda underscored Cuba's satisfaction with the agreements  and  the need for unity and cooperation between the region's airlines  from underdeveloped countries in order to survive and offer the  services that their peoples require.    He said the ceremony took place on the 65th anniversary of  Cubana de Aviacion and pointed out that it contributes to the  development of relations between Colombia and Cuba.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Austria links its future to Union in strong turnout: 66.4% Yes vote in referendum gives big boost to EU confidence Austrians yesterday gave the European Union its first big vote of confidence in several years, with 66.4 per cent voting in a national referendum in favour of joining the Union. The turnout for the referendum, 81 per cent, was equally impressive, in contrast to the low participation in European parliamentary elections in many countries yesterday. Late in the afternoon, when the scale of the result became known, enthusiastic crowds waving EU flags gathered at main political party headquarters in Vienna and in front of the federal chancellery shouting, 'We are the champions'. Mr Alois Mock, the Austrian foreign minister, said: 'It proves that Austrians are determined to play their part in building the new Europe.' It is also a boost for pro-EU forces in Norway, Sweden and Finland where EU entry referendums are due in the autumn. The wide margin of victory of the Austrian Yes vote brought hope of a long-awaited lift to Nordic EU supporters who have struggled to impart any momentum so far to their campaigns. More immediately, the Austrian Yes vote comes before three important party congresses on the EU issue in Finland, Norway and Sweden next weekend, and a parliamentary no-confidence vote due on Wednesday in Finland. Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, welcomed the Austrian decision last night as 'an important signal' to Swedes. 'That the result was so strong was based upon the wish to influence the development of Europe. The argument for influence won, and won big,' Mr Bildt said. Only in Finland, where fear of neighbouring Russia is a major factor, is the Yes campaign leading the referendum race in the opinion polls. In Sweden and especially in Norway, the No campaigns hold a strong lead. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister facing a No campaign with well over 50 per cent support in the opinion polls, said Austrian entry to the EU strengthened the opportunity to build bridges between western and eastern Europe. The Norwegian No campaign had argued that the EU would shut out poorer former eastern bloc countries. The Austrian vote will be well received by the country's central European neighbours. The Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia all hope that their interest in joining the EU will be taken up by Brussels soon after the current applicants become members. Respectable majorities in every province in Austria backed EU entry. Even in Tyrol, where resentment over pollution from alpine lorry transit has provoked strong anti-EU sentiment, the majority Yes vote was 56.4 per cent. The handsome scale of the national majority raises questions about the accuracy of opinion polls in the past week, which indicated a very close race. Government officials said yesterday their own polls showed many people were shaken by scare stories put out late in the campaign by the anti-EU camp. It was claimed, for example, that Austria, once it joined the EU, would have to supply water to Spain and could be forced to build nuclear power stations. Anti-EU campaigners, led by Mr Jorg Haider, the populist rightwing leader of the Austrian Freedom party, combined these stories with posters recommending that if people had any doubts they should vote No. But late last week, the pro-EU camp responded strongly, dismissing the scare stories and emphasising the importance of the vote for the country's future security and prosperity. Austrian leaders plan to sign their accession treaty at the EU summit in Corfu on June 24. The country then becomes an official observer of EU institutions from July 1 until its official entry on January 1 1995.

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF plunges 35% THOMSON-CSF, the French state-owned military electronics company, yesterday announced a big drop in net profit to FFr1.5bn (Dollars 277m) last year from FFr2.34bn the previous year, and a small cut in its dividend to FFr6 a share from FFr6.80. The 35 per cent fall in profits was on a smaller decline in turnover, which dropped by 2.8 per cent to FFr34.2bn. Its financial results were dragged down by a 15.5 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank which last week reported provisions and a loss amounting to FFr1.8bn. Thomson-CSF's share of that loss was FFr256m, against a FFr556m profit a year earlier. Mr Alain Gomez, Thomson-CSF president, yesterday forecast this year's result should not be any worse than last year's, 'with a probability, which is not negligible, that it will be better'. This prediction appeared to be based on the hope of a better performance from financial investments. These include a stake in Althus Finance which provided Thomson-CSF with a profit of FFr613m last year, up from FFr225m in 1991. Mr Gomez said contraction of defence budgets gave no reason to expect an upturn this year in military business. By contrast, Dassault Aviation, the French aircraft maker, yesterday announced a higher net profit for 1992 - FFr180m - than it had previously signalled. It said it would double its dividend to FFr6 a share. Last month, Dassault executives had predicted that net profit last year would be about the same as the FFr103m in 1991. The company said cost-cutting had helped lift profits more than it had expected.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster politicians agree to abandon talks effort - Brooke Meeting NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders agreed yesterday to abandon attempts at starting formal negotiations on the province's future until after the general election. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, aimed to minimise recriminations as he put efforts to resume 'round table' talks on hold during a 90-minute meeting at Westminster with the province's four main political leaders.

The appointment of a Labour secretary might lead to further delays in fresh negotiations - particularly if it was Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, who is committed to eventual Irish unification by consent and is unlikely to win the confidence of Unionists. Mr Brooke agreed a joint statement with the leaders emphasising the 'great potential' of political dialogue. Ministers will continue to meet MPs from the province on economic and other matters. Mr Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland minister, is to meet nationalist and unionist representatives with the aim of promoting debate on alternative forms of government for the province. The statement agreed by Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Mr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, backed the broad structure of talks proposed by Mr Brooke. It went on: 'However, they concluded with regret that it was not possible in present circumstances to proceed to launch fresh substantive talks on the lines envisaged.'</p>

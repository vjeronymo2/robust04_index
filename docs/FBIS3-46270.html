			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Hong Fei (7703 7378)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- As of 1  January 1994, China is practicing a new financial and tax reform  program, including the tax sharing system that makes new  arrangements for central and local financial powers. The  purpose of the tax-sharing system is to recover some of the  financial power previously delegated to local governments,  strengthen the financial power of the central government,  rectify the lopsided situation in recent years in which the  central government and local governments shared 30 and 70  percent of financial power respectively, and gradually return to  the normal 70:30 ratio between central and local financial  powers. This is aimed at checking the unhealthy tendency of  localities blindly expanding investments, which leads to an  overheated economy, strengthening the authority and  macroeconomic regulation and control capability of the central  government, and ensure the high-speed, stable, and healthy [kuai  su wen ding jian kang 1816 6643 4489 1353 0256 1660] development  of the national economy.    The main contents of tax-sharing system reform are as  follows:    First, the central government concentrates the necessary  financial resources. The financial and tax revenues directly  collected by the central government should account for over 60  percent of the country's total financial and tax revenues.  Second, taxation is divided into central taxes, local taxes,  and taxes shared by the central and local governments. Central  taxes include customs duty, consumption tax, central enterprise  income tax, product tax, railways, banks, insurance tax, and so  on. Local taxes included business tax, local enterprise income  tax, personal income tax, agricultural tax, urban construction  tax, and so on. Taxes shared by the central and local  governments include value-added tax, resources tax (marine  resources tax belong totally to the central government),  securities transaction tax, unified industrial and commercial  tax, and so on. Third, the central and local governments set up  taxation organs respectively. Fourth, the central government  implements a system of making refunds and shifting payments to  local governments. Some of the central financial revenues will  be refunded to local governments in the form of allocations lest  the local governments will receive less financial revenues than  before the reform.    Under the financial pattern practiced over the years in the  past, which came into being with the implementation of the  central policy of "decentralizing power and giving up profits"  to local governments and which was called the "contract system  under which each unit is responsible for its own surplus or  deficit," the country's financial and tax revenues favor the  localities. Under such a system, the proportion of the central  financial revenues in the GNP has dropped and its macroeconomic  regulation and control capability weakened year after year.  Statistics show that central financial revenues accounted for  well over 30 percent of the GNP in 1978 but dropped to only 14  percent in 1992. Meanwhile, the central financial revenues  accounted only for 38 percent of the country's total financial  revenues, much lower than the 60-odd percent level in other  countries generally. As a result, the central financial  deficits are getting more serious while the local finance enjoys  an ample surplus, and this has given rise to a situation whereby  the central government is poor while the local governments are  rich.    However, the substitution of the "tax-sharing system" for  the  "contract system under which each unit is responsible for its  own surplus or deficit" is likely to cause some losses to a few  coastal provinces and municipalities, where the economy has  developed quite rapidly in recent years, and touched off some  objections in discussions last year. For this reason, Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji, who took charge of financial and economic  work, went to 16 provinces and municipalities including Hainan,  Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Tianjin at  the head of work teams to discuss with local leaders the  interest relationship of the tax-sharing system. It is said  that, after careful calculations, some provinces, which  previously had entertained serious misgivings, discovered that  the effect of the tax-sharing system was not so big after all  and, therefore, supported the central policy with pleasure. On  the other hand, some interior provinces in western China, such  as Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Gansu, have heartily welcomed the  tax-sharing system, holding that not only will this measure  increase the financial resources of the central government but  enable the central government to allocate more funds to help the  backward regions develop their economy and thus gradually narrow  the gap between the interior and the coastal regions. They  consider this beneficial to the overall situation.    Jin Xin, director of the State Administration of Taxation,  said that the "tax-sharing system" would be implemented  gradually. He predicted that it would take five or up to the  end of this century to attain the target of raising the  proportion of the central financial revenues to over 60 percent  of the country's total financial revenues.</p>

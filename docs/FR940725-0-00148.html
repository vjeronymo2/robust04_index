			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Respiratory protection and other personal protective equipment and clothing must be provided in accordance with Subpart I of part 1915.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previous &sect;1915.12(a)(2) prohibits workers from entering areas containing concentrations of flammable gases or vapors at or above 10 percent of their LELs. The only exception to this rule is contained in the previous &sect;1915.13(a)(2) for highly volatile residues. (This provision has not been carried forward into the final rule. See the summary and explanation of final &sect;1915.13, later in this preamble, for a discussion of the reasons why this exception has been dropped.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also contained a general prohibition against employees entering spaces containing hazardous concentrations of flammable gases or vapors. However, as noted earlier, proposed &sect;1915.12(d) also provided exceptions for emergencies and for brief duration entries. The proposal would have required the same precautionary measures required by the final rule, except that respiratory equipment and other personal protective equipment was identified as being required, under Subpart I, through means of a note following proposed &sect;1915.12(d)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained earlier, OSHA has decided to permit entries for emergency rescue and for short duration entries to install ventilation equipment even if the space contains a hazardous atmosphere. No one objected to the precautionary measures proposed in &sect;1915.12(d), and they have been carried forward into the final rule. The proposed note regarding the use of respiratory protection and other personal protective equipment has been converted into a requirement (&sect;1915.12(b)(3)(iv)). Even though employers are already obligated to comply with these requirements under Subpart I, OSHA believes that providing a mandatory reference in the text of the regulation will serve to emphasize the importance of the required personal protective equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has concluded that entry made following the requirements contained in the exception to &sect;1915.12(b)(3) will protect employees by controlling and minimizing the hazards involved. No ignition sources may be present in the space so that, if the atmosphere becomes flammable, there will be no energy source to ignite it. The atmosphere in the space must be maintained above the UEL, and the atmosphere must be continuously monitored to minimize the possibility that a flammable atmosphere could develop. Lastly, personal protective equipment must be worn to protect the employee from exposure to the hazardous materials involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) of final &sect;1915.12 sets precautions to be taken before employees enter areas that present hazards related to toxic atmospheres. Paragraph (c)(1) of final &sect;1915.12 requires spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained gases, liquids, or solids that are toxic, corrosive, or irritant to be:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Inspected visually by a competent person to determine whether or not toxic, corrosive, or irritant residue contaminants are present, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Tested by a competent person before initial entry by any employee, to determine the concentration of toxics, corrosives, and irritants in the air within the space.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The previous &sect;1915.12(b)(1) requires the following spaces to be inspected and tested by a Marine Chemist, industrial hygienist, or other qualified person:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Cargo spaces and other spaces containing or having last contained bulk gases, liquids, or solids of a toxic, corrosive, or irritant nature,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Spaces that have been fumigated, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Spaces immediately adjacent to these two types of spaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of proposed &sect;1915.12 would have continued the previous language without change, except that the proposal specified that the tests had to be performed by a Marine Chemist, a certified industrial hygienist, or a U.S. Coast Guard authorized person. Although this may have appeared to be a departure from the previous standard, the NPRM explained that the proposal simply codified OSHA interpretation of the previous standard. The NPRM also requested comments on the proposed definition of ``certified industrial hygienist.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most commenters agreed that a Marine Chemist or a Certified Industrial Hygienist was qualified to perform the toxicity tests required under &sect;1915.12(c) (Ex. 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;12, 6&hyph;13, 6&hyph;20, 6&hyph;23, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33). They noted that the intensive training in toxicology and in appropriate control measures these persons receive makes them uniquely qualified to test and inspect confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA agrees with these comments, and the final rule recognizes that tests and inspections for the presence of toxic, corrosive, or irritant substances may be performed by Marine Chemists and Certified Industrial Hygienists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rulemaking participants expressed some disagreement, however, over whether or not a Coast Guard authorized person had the proper qualifications to test and inspect areas for hazards related to the toxicity of various chemicals. Some believed that a Coast Guard authorized person would be qualified to perform the required tests and inspections (Ex. 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33). These commenters stated that the use of a Coast Guard authorized person would be limited to situations in which a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist was not available. Several other commenters argued that a Coast Guard authorized person is not required to receive training in hazards related to the toxicity of various chemicals (Ex. 6&hyph;13, 6&hyph;15). In fact, the U.S. Department of Transportation (Ex. 6&hyph;13), which administers requirements in Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations related to Coast Guard authorized persons, stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Testing required by 46 CFR 35.01, 71.60, and 91.50 is primarily concerned with oxygen deficiency and combustibility prior to conducting hot work. ``Coast Guard authorized persons'' who would be expected to conduct such testing under Coast Guard regulations should not be considered equivalent to a Marine Chemist or Industrial Hygienist for the purpose of evaluating toxic hazards in shipyards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

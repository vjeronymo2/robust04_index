			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Roberto Melendez] </F>   [Text] Jorge Tello Peon, commissioner of the National  Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD], revealed that high-ranking  officials from that agency are conducting investigations  throughout the country to locate "high crime areas," and thereby  effectively attack organized crime. He announced the dispatch of  15 special groups from the Federal Judicial Police [PJF]  Narcotics Division to hunt and capture the drug trafficking  "capos," so as to dismantle the drug dealing rings.    He added that those units, assigned primarily to the  northern  part of the country, consist of 40 graduates of the Training  Institute run by the Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic [PGR]. That department is backing their training to  combat the "narcos" presumed to have connections with those in  the United States and in Central and South America.    He claimed that the principal goals of those groups are to  capture, among others, Benjamin, Javier, and Ramon Arellano  Felix, the presumed material perpetrators of Cardinal Posadas  Ocampo's assassination; Luis Hector Palma Salazar, alias "El  Guero"; and Amado Carrillo Fuentes and Juan Garcia Abrego. There  are apparently clues leading to these subjects, and "their  operating methods are now known."    According to Tello Peon, the INCD's first commissioner, this  year the activities of the agency headed by him will be  consolidated. It has approximately 800 police agents trained in  63 subjects. The topics include antiterrorism, constitutional  law and, particularly, respect for human rights and guarantees.    He added that the graduates have been prepared also for air,  land, and sea interception, noting that the training in  investigation is to be reinforced this year.    An effort has been made to devise data processing and  communication systems, and to obtain equipment and technology.  The high-ranking commissioner also claimed that great progress  has been made in locating crime areas, indicating that the  narcotics agents' effort would be focused on these areas.    He added that the police agents and those from the Federal  Public Prosecutor's Office assigned to the INCD would work  jointly and cooperatively with the PGR's circuit  representatives, and with military, state, and municipal  authorities.    He observed that, last year, the Attorney General's Office,  specifically, the Federal Judicial Police, headed by Rodolfo  Leon Aragon, confiscated over 44 tons of cocaine base, and made  "arrests of prominent persons associated with the drug traffic."  He remarked that "members of the INCD also participated in these  operations."</p>

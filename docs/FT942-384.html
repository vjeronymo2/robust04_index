			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: McInerney losses rise to IPounds 8.5m Losses at McInerney Prop-erties, the Dublin-based housebuilder and property group, increased from IPounds 2.65m to IPounds 8.51m (Pounds 8.4m) during the 1993 year. Poor trading conditions in its leisure property division and the loss on the disposal of a Portuguese resort were blamed for the higher than expected deficit. The disposal cost, including associated trading losses, was IPounds 2.71m. Trading losses rose from IPounds 1.03m to IPounds 5.41m on turnover of IPounds 31.6m (IPounds 32.9m), of which continuing operations accounted for Pounds 27.9m (Pounds 28.2m). Losses per A share were 13.9p (6.2p); fully diluted the deficit was 6.6p (2.7p). The deficit on shareholders' funds rose from Pounds 715,000 to Pounds 8.29m at the year end. The group said it retained the support of its bankers but was seeking an equity injection or the formation of a strategic alliance. Prospects were improving this year. The Irish housing market was enjoying strong sales reservations, which should result in increased completions in the second half of the year. Sales at Four Seasons Fairways, a Portuguese leisure development, were above target.</p>

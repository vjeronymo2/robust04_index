			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Texas Instruments doubles net income TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, yesterday reported a more than doubling of first-quarter net income, due to strong growth in its semiconductor business. The company reported net income of Dollars 85m, or 89 cents a share, before accounting changes, compared with Dollars 40m, or 35 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues totalled Dollars 1.88bn, up from Dollars 1.69bn. Profits from operations totalled Dollars 140m, compared with Dollars 63m. The company said this rise was 'driven by faster-than-market revenue growth in application-specific products' in the semiconductor business. The company's defence electronics business had maintained stable margins at levels that met TI's goals for return on assets, the company added. Its information technology business operated at a small loss for the quarter. Mr Jerry Junkins, chairman, said the company expected 25 per cent growth in US semiconductor demand, 28 per cent growth in Asian-Pacific, and 13 per cent growth in Europe. The world semiconductor market could reach at least Dollars 70bn in 1993, up 17 per cent from 1992, and 'it could go higher based on the current strength of orders in the US'. In view of this, the company planned capital spending of Dollars 650m in 1993, about Dollars 220m more than in 1992, with the emphasis on equipment to support the manufacture of differentiated products. Mr Junkins said a key element of the company's semiconductor strategy was to increase the percentage of differentiated products in the portfolio, which would make its product mix better aligned with growth markets. In the first quarter, the company's results included royalty revenues of Dollars 94m, including one-time royalties of Dollars 22m from previously announced agreements with personal computer manufacturers.</p>

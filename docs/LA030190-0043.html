			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL DIVISION II SEMIFINALS;  </P> <P> HAPPILY FOR SAN PASQUAL, PLAN A WORKS JUST FINE  </P> <P> The thing about contingency plans is this:  </P> <P> They're nice to have sitting in the shadows. They're a welcome addition if  needed, but it's just as well if they aren't.  </P> <P> Wednesday night in a San Diego Section girls' Division II basketball semifinal  at Mira Mesa, San Pasqual stuck instead to its original scheme and in doing so  easily defeated El Cajon Valley, 71-59.  </P> <P> San Pasqual was seriously challenged just once, when El Cajon made a run early  in the fourth quarter and closed the gap to 50-42. But it didn't worry San  Pasqual much.  </P> <P> "I wasn't too concerned," San Pasqual Coach Terri Bamford said. "That's why I  called a timeout."  </P> <P> The Golden Eagles then went back to the 12- and 13-points lead it had  established early on, and the victory was theirs.  </P> <P> The night before, things weren't quite as rosy for second-ranked San Pasqual  (24-4). During Tuesday's practice, junior center Becki Callahan, a significant  part of Plan A, sprained her right ankle.  </P> <P> Callahan said she was in therapy twice during the day, but it wasn't until  pregame warm-ups that Bamford decided to play her.  </P> <P> "We watched her during warm-ups," Bamford said. "She couldn't really go off it  right."  </P> <P> But she did so adequately enough to score 18 points, behind teammates Nikki  Gannon (20) and Valerie Ryan (19).  </P> <P> So what was the plan had Callahan been unable to play?  </P> <P> "Wendy Hill," Bamford said.  </P> <P> Bamford would have started Hill at center and moved another player to forward,  where Hill started.  </P> <P> As it turned out, both players got themselves in foul trouble. Callahan had  four at the half, Hill four going into the fourth quarter. Hill fouled out with  7:31 to play, and four minutes later, Callahan followed her to the bench.  </P> <P> "I was a little worried," Callahan said.  </P> <P> San Pasqual went to the 2-A final in 1987, won Division II in 1988 and lost in  the first round last year, Bamford's first.  </P> <P> Debbie Duhaney scored 32 points for El Cajon (21-6).

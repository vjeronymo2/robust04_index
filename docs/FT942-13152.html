			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading It was a largely dull session in the futures and options market yesterday, with thin trading and few noteworthy features, writes Christopher Price. Dealers reported a lack of buying or selling interest almost from the start, and the June contract on the FTSE 100 spent most of the session drifting slowly down. In fact, June's opening trade at 3,138 turned out to be the high of the day, after which a lack of buying enthusiasm rather than selling pressure saw June slip back. GDP figures in line with market expectations stemmed the drift for a short time, but the weak gilts market continued be a negative influence and June continued to lose ground. A weak opening on Wall Street added to the slide and June hit 3,101 shortly before the close, its low of the day. A slight spurt towards the finish saw June end the session at 3,102 with volume a lowly 10,128 contracts. However, in after hours trading, June brightened up, reflecting a turnaround in sentiment on Wall Street, the contract ticking up to 3,109. Lasmo topped the stock options list once more - at 2,269 contracts, with takeover talk again said to be inspiring investors' interest. Glaxo was second at 1,072. Total options volume was 18,414 contracts, compared with over 29,000 on Friday.</p>

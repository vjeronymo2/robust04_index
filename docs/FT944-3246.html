			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Albright &amp; Wilson returns to market: Tenneco hopes to raise Pounds 600m from flotation of UK chemicals group Albright &amp; Wilson, one of the oldest names in the UK chemicals industry, is returning to the London stock market with a flotation its US parent hopes will raise at least Pounds 600m. Its return to public company status should rank it as the UK's fifth biggest chemicals company behind Imperial Chemical Industries, Courtaulds, BOC Group and Laporte. The company, which makes specialist ingredients for household goods and foods, including Sainsbury's own-brand washing powders and Coca-Cola, lost its independence in 1978 when Tenneco, the US diversified industrial group, paid Pounds 115m for the 50.2 per cent of the company it did not own. The transaction would be Tenneco's second large disposal in a year. Earlier this year, it had successful public offerings of 55 per cent of the Case Corporation farm and construction equipment supplier. Both deals are part of Tenneco's goal 'to become less cyclical', said Mr Dana Mead, chairman. He said Tenneco would buy back Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m), or about 7.2 per cent, of its common shares. The flotation and buy-back were not directly related, he said. The proceeds might go towards acquisitions, said Mr Mead, adding that it would be some time before Tenneco would make a deal in the Dollars 1bn-range that Wall Street seems to expect. The Albright &amp; Wilson flotation is scheduled 'for the first quarter of 1995'. The company had sales in 1993 of Pounds 609m, up from Pounds 583m in the previous year. In common with the rest of the chemicals industry, profits have recovered strongly. In 1993, operating profit post exceptionals was Pounds 60m, compared with Pounds 44m in 1993 and a loss of Pounds 22m in 1992. No forecasts were made yesterday of the current year's profitability, although further restructuring charges are likely to affect the pre-tax figure. Mr Robin Paul, chief executive, said that a restructuring undertaken in 1991 had regrouped speciality operations, which have 'since been growing at 20 per cent a year-plus on profits'. The company now has three divisions: surfactants, phosphorus derivatives and phosphates, and specialities. The strategy to reduce dependence on commodity goods was 'to have 20 per cent of the company's worldwide turnover from products introduced in the last five years by 1998', said Mr Paul. Today the figure is 14 per cent. Mr Paul acknowledged that there was little growth in one of its main product areas, washing powder phosphates, which are banned in several countries on environmental grounds. He said sales were steady thanks to new markets in Asia and Latin America. Mr Mead said there had been talks with several chemicals companies about a direct sale of the Albright &amp; Wilson businesses. They failed because potential buyers 'wanted to cream off what they regarded as the better parts'. He said a flotation was more uncertain but that they would get a better price. With the divestiture of Albright &amp; Wilson, and the majority offering of Case, the only remaining division of Tenneco that is not included in Mr Mead's 'core' businesses is the New Jersey-based Newport News Shipbuilding company.

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: P&amp;G plans to divest its pulp interests PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant, yesterday took a step away from vertical industrial integration when it announced it was putting up for sale its large interests in the pulp business. The company has retained Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, to find buyers for the business, which employs 3,200 people and is expected to have sales in 1992 of around Dollars 800m. About half of its output is sold to Procter &amp; Gamble itself for use in a variety of products. However, Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman, said a review of corporate goals into the next century had concluded that the commercial pulp business was not 'a good fit with P&amp;G's long-term strategic interests'. He said the group's aim was to be 'more globally focused on our core consumer businesses in healthcare, beauty care, laundry and cleaning products, paper products and food and beverages'. He added that the decision did not mean that P&amp;G would eliminate all internal vertical integration of raw materials. These decisions were to be made on a case-by-case basis. P&amp;G has been in the pulp business for 70 years and its operations include a cotton linters pulp plant in Memphis, Tennessee, and wood pulp plants in Oglethorpe, Georgia, Perry, Florida, and Grande Prairie, Alberta. It also has timber assets in Georgia and Florida and sawmills in Georgia and Alberta. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, affirmed the company's Double-A senior debt rating in the wake of the announcement. It said the proceeds of the sale were likely to be used to fund P&amp;G's international diversification, so total debt was unlikely to be reduced significantly. Mr Artzt said the company had analysed the benefits of vertical integration and had concluded that it would be better off working with raw materials suppliers than producing materials internally.</p>

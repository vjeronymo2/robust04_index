			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / End reliance on US, says envoy EUROPE must develop an independent army to tackle security threats on the continent rather than rely on the US to come to the rescue, Mr James Dobbins, outgoing US ambassador to the European Community, said yesterday. In a reference to recent divisions within the alliance over how to respond to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, Mr Dobbins said: 'The American people, in my judgment, are unlikely to support a long-term US troop commitment to Europe if they see its purpose as protecting rich, prosperous Europeans against two-bit outlaws like Serbia.' Mr Dobbins, who was speaking in Brussels at the Centre for European Policy Studies, acknowledged his speech was drafted before the latest alliance moves to end divisions over how to respond in Bosnia. But they also mark a shift in thinking in some US circles toward a sharing of burdens in the post-cold-war era, between the Nato alliance and an emerging European defence identity, probably the Western European Union, particularly where there was no vital US interest involved. Mr Dobbins also urged the EC to integrate Russia, along with other east European countries into a new Euro-Atlantic community. He suggested parallels between Russia's position in 1993 to Germany's position in 1945.</p>

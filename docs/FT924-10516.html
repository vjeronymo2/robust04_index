			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Shiseido suffers on fall in consumer spending THE rising cost of collecting unsold goods from retailers was partly responsible for Shiseido, the leading Japanese manufacturer of toiletries and cosmetics reporting a 7.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the half year. Shiseido's pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September fell to Y15.43bn (Dollars 126.12m) from Y16.72bn a year earlier, on a 4.9 per cent increase in sales to Y201bn. The company is maintaining its interim dividend at Y5.5 a share. Net profits fell by 7.2 per cent to Y7,602, with earnings per share down to Y19 from Y26.30 in the first half of the 1991. The fall in profits reflects the downturn in consumer spending which has spread through the economy over the past year. Shiseido spent Y2bn (Dollars 16.3m) to collect stocks of unsold items from retailers' shelves. The collection of this stock which was repriced following the abolishment of the commodity tax in 1989 was originally planned for the second half of the year. Shiseido is forecasting a slight rise in full-year pre-tax profits to Y32.5bn, up 0.8 per cent from 1991 on sales of Y406bn, up 4.4 per cent.</p>

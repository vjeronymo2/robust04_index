			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Savill, Irish correspondent: "Workmen </F> Shot Dead by Loyalist Terrorists"]    [Excerpt] Loyalist terrorists shot dead two Roman Catholic  men and slightly injured another as they worked at a sheltered  housing development in north Belfast yesterday.    The attack by the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force took place  as the Government planned its response to Sinn Fein's questions  about future policy on Northern Ireland.    The two dead men, both electricians, one in his 40's and the  other in his 20's, were believed to come from the mid-Ulster  area.    Their names were not being released until relatives had been  informed.    Witnesses said the men were hit by automatic fire during  their lunchbreak as they sat in a car on a building site in the  Tiger's Bay area of the city.    Police later made several arrests and seized firearms during  raids in the area.    The murders bring to 17 the number of terrorist killings in  the province in the past month.

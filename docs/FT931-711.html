			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (11): A legacy and a challenge - Premier Goh Chok Tong must work harder to assert his authority AT THE end of last year, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, put his political neck on the block. Mr Goh resigned from parliament and stood in a by-election in his own constituency. There was no doubting that Mr Goh and his governing Peoples Action Party (PAP) would win. The crucial factor was the margin of victory. In the event Mr Goh and the PAP gained 72 per cent of the vote. Such is the nature of Singapore politics. If Mr Goh and the PAP had not achieved a resounding victory in the by-election the prime minister's future could have been in doubt. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's prime minister for nearly 30 years till he handed over power to Mr Goh in 1990, told voters that the future of Singapore would be in jeopardy if Mr Goh and the PAP did not win by a big margin. 'There is a danger that a significant percentage of voters may believe they can score points against the government by reducing the PM's votes and leave their neighbours to vote for the PAP,' said Mr Lee. 'I ask them to pause and to consider the effect on their own future ..If the by-election result is poor, you will cast a shadow on the PM's authority and put Singapore and your own future in doubt ..If you deny the prime minister a strong endorsement by a much lower percentage of votes, then you would have shot yourselves in the foot.' The need for such overwhelming victories at the polls is partly to do with the problems Mr Goh has faced coming to office after such a dominant leader as Mr Lee. It is also a reflection of the PAP's political culture. Mr Goh has not had an easy time asserting his political authority. Mr Lee towered over Singapore's politics and virtually every facet of the country's life for more than 30 years. Mr Lee resigned from office to make way for a second generation of leaders in Singapore, among them Mr Goh. But Mr Lee did not leave the political stage. Far from it. He became senior minister in Mr Goh's cabinet. Mr Lee did not hesitate to criticise if he felt the running of the country was not being carried out properly. In an effort to establish his own political mandate, Mr Goh called a general election in mid 1991. The PAP won 77 of the 81 seats in parliament and 61 per cent of the popular vote. The result, though highly respectable by the standards of most governing parties elsewhere, was considered a serious setback by the PAP and by Mr Goh. More opposition MPs than before had been allowed into parliament. The PAP had seen its vote slip to its lowest level since the late 1960s. Mr Goh did not feel his political legitimacy had been established. That finally came with the by-election last December. But in the interim, various factors had strengthened Mr Goh's position. There is a widely held belief in Singapore that Mr Goh was not Mr Lee's preferred choice as prime minister. Mr Lee had carefully groomed his own son for the job. Lee Hsien Loong, a reserve brigadier-general known as 'BG' Lee, is cut very much in the same no-nonsense mould as his father. Mr Goh was seen only as an interim prime minister - in the job until BG Lee, 40, was thought ready to assume office. BG Lee had distinguished himself as Minister for Trade and Industry and as one of Singapore's two deputy prime ministers. But last November it was announced that both BG Lee and Ong Teng Cheong, another deputy prime minister, had cancer. BG Lee has been away from the political scene for several months. Mr Goh says that the younger Lee has responded well to treatment and it is likely he will take up his duties again soon. Mr Goh has taken over the important post of PAP secretary general from the elder Mr Lee and put his own people in key positions, including placing a former aide as head of the powerful internal security service. Mr Goh appears confident and denies any suggestion that he is an interim prime minister, or of any conflict with Mr Lee. 'The important thing is the relationship between myself, the senior minister, BG Lee and my colleagues. We know the nature of our relationships. I know what role I'll be playing in Singapore ..I was hoping, frankly speaking, that I could contemplate my retirement in the year 2000 ..I see myself in this job for quite some time to come, even had there been nothing wrong with D-PM Lee.' But Mr Goh and the PAP do have problems. If the PAP vote continues its downward trend in general elections it is not inconceivable that within a few years there could be up to 20 opposition MPs. There are those who see this as an inevitable development in a maturing political and economic environment. The governing party is a highly disciplined, secretive organisation that carefully selects its members. After more than 30 years in power the PAP and government have become synonymous. The party still very much reflects Mr Lee's image. Mr Raj Vasil, a writer on Singapore politics, says the elder Lee is the party in the eyes of Singaporeans: 'The PAP does not have much of an identity independent of the (then) prime minister and the government headed by him. Its image, identity and appeal are almost entirely derived from the personality of the prime minister ..' So far, there is little sign that the PAP is willing to countenance more opposition or wishes to change its image. A sizeable section of the Singapore population seems to feel that its economic needs are being largely ignored by a government and party which is seen to have grown elitist, too focused on the increasingly affluent, English educated middle class. This group feels life is becoming increasingly expensive. It feels it is missing out on the fruits of Singapore's economic success. Many of these people - Chinese dialect speakers living in housing estates - were once the bedrock of PAP support. Opposition parties are still small and tend to lack coherent alternative policies. In the past government has used various methods to undermine the opposition. Many talented Singaporeans have been reluctant to oppose government. But the PAP itself is also short of talent - a fact acknowledged by Mr Goh late last year when he said his cabinet was ageing and needed to be revitalised with new political talent. 'My job is to make sure that the drop in the PAP vote doesn't come about. So when there is a one per cent drop, I get worried ..if the PAP can succeed in recruiting very able people, honest, dedicated, committed, to join the party, we think the PAP is going to be in government for a long, long time.'</p>

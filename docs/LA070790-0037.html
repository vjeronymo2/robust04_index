			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND NOW A FEW WORDS ABOUT OUR ANNOUNCERS  </P> <P> I would like to congratulate Ken Brett on again being the master of redundancy.  </P> <P> Some of my all-time Ken Brett favorites:  </P> <P>  -- "Wally Joyner just completed an unassisted double play by himself."  </P> <P>  -- "The Baltimore Orioles team is experiencing many problems this year  collectively as a group."  </P> <P>  -- "The average age of the Chicago White Sox team is 26 years per man."  </P> <P>  -- "We have already had the plate umpire carried off the field barely under  his own power."  </P> <P> It is amazing to me the Angels continue to retain a guy who is the most  inarticulate announcer in baseball. When you add analysis/paralysis Al Conin  with Ken, they form an incredibly bad team -- simultaneously and at the same  time.  </P> <P> S. PALMER  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

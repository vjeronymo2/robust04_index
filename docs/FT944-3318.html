			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Sanctions on jobseekers could stop all benefit Unemployed people who face penalty sanctions under the government's proposed Jobseeker's Allowance scheme, to be introduced in April, could lose unemployment benefit for up to 26 weeks - the whole period of entitlement. According to a leaked briefing document, jobseekers could be sanctioned for reasons including leaving a job voluntarily or without just cause, refusing to work, or failing to attend an interview or mandatory course. The document, obtained by Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington, says: 'Sanctioned jobseekers will no longer receive (even) reduced rates of benefit unless they can demonstrate hardship. 'If hardship is demonstrated, 20 per cent or 40 per cent reduction of the personal allowance will be made, normally after the first two weeks of a sanction. Most sanctions will be fixed at two weeks, others may last 26 weeks.' Hardship payments will only be available to people with children, or with caring responsibilities, or who are pregnant or have a pregnant partner, or who are sick and disabled or who have a partner who is sick or disabled. There will be no access to the Social Fund for living expenses for people who are ineligible for hardship payments. The document says arrangements have still to be considered fully, but most unemployed people will need to attend the Jobcentre regularly, generally every two weeks, to review their search for work. Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, has estimated the scheme will mean a Pounds 100m net cut in government spending on unemployment in 1996-97, the first year, and would then save Pounds 200m each succeeding year.</p>

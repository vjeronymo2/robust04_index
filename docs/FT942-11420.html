			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (1): The drift towards managed trade - Economic downturn has forced governments to rethink export strategies and take a more interventionist line / Exporting policy GOVERNMENT POLICY: FT Exporter analyses recent changes made by western governments in their approach to promoting and supporting exports A government's dedication to free trade often looks better on paper than it does in practice. This is especially so during recessions. Faced with a rising toll of job losses it is all too easy for beleaguered administrations to look for ways of raising barriers to foreign imports in an attempt to protect domestic industry. Hardly surprising then that over the past few years there has been a perceptible drift towards managed trade measures in the world's industrialised economies. Most of these have been afflicted by economic downturns from which they are only just recovering. In the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development unemployment has risen to 8.2 per cent of the labour force. In European OECD countries, where unemployment rates exceed 10 per cent, the problems are even more acute. The last set of forecasts from the organisation predicted that the jobless total among its members would rise to 35m by the end of this year. The big differences in output growth in the industrialised world have had a marked effect on current account balances. In Japan, for example, the trade surplus - measured in US dollars - has continued to grow, reflecting weak domestic demand because of the recession, and continued growth in exports, particularly to East Asia. Even so, compared with 1992, growth in export volume declined significantly, while growth in the volume of imports picked up. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit increased last year. As its economic recovery gathered speed, imports rose while exports grew only slowly, with sales to other OECD countries virtually stagnant. Figures on trade between European Union countries need to be treated with caution - a new system for measuring trade flows in the single market is still suffering from teething problems. However, even with the understanding that the figures are likely to be revised, the data suggest that the EU moved back into surplus on its trade balance last year as the four biggest EU economies recorded an improvement. Of these, only the UK continued to run a deficit, albeit a smaller one than in 1992. Four months in, and initial projections for this year suggest that the EU trade surplus will increase while its current account deficit will almost disappear. However, a widening of the US trade and current account deficits is also expected, with only a slight decline in Japan. The trends in trade brought about by the varying fortunes of the industrialised world as it has weathered recession have worked against the momentum for trade liberalisation created by the Uruguay Round trade agreement. A report from a working party of the OECD's trade committee* says: 'It is feared that these could lead to further protectionist pressures.' The working party is right to be concerned. There has been a move away from the aggressively laissez-faire policies of the past decade towards more interventionist trade strategies. According to the report, over the past few years the following trends have been observed: the continued recourse to bilateral measures involving quantitative controls, operating outside the framework of established multilateral rules and disciplines. For example, the US's attempts to seek numerical goals for reducing Japan's trade surplus. the continued use of anti-dumping investigations as a protectionist tool. According to the report, the number of anti-dumping investigations jumped to a record in the year to July 1993. an increase in the number of unresolved, long-standing trade disputes. Even where direct protectionist measures have not been adopted, governments appear to be rethinking their export strategies, placing a greater emphasis on government assistance, whether through helping companies win big overseas contracts, tied-aid, or the extension of export credit guarantees. In the US the Clinton administration is mobilising the resources of the federal government in order to help US business compete aggressively for large overseas contracts. Earlier this year it announced plans to establish a commerce department advocacy centre, to co-ordinate all US government support on behalf of US companies and mobilise resources for nearly 100 important government procurement projects abroad. The idea is that it will devise the same kind of intense intergovernmental strategy for economic ends as the government does for political and security objectives. Indicative of the change in attitudes was a comment from Jeffrey Garten, commerce department undersecretary for trade, that under the new administration, government advocacy would go beyond the usual representations by ambassadors or visiting senior officials to making strenuous efforts 'involving everything from financing to foreign policy pressure'. 'The US has ceased to be a peerless defender of completely free trade,' says Gerry Holtham, international economist of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank. 'They now see their strategy much more in terms of 'if you free your trade, we'll free ours'.' In France a series of reforms and the introduction of new policies has increased the flexibility of Coface, the French export credit agency, now gearing up for privatisation. In the UK, the department of trade and industry has put a more interventionist stamp on its dealings backing, for example, a 10-year strategic research effort by the aerospace industry. These developments reflect the importance that governments have attached to exports as economic downturns have taken their toll on domestic industry. Such efforts do not threaten to undermine recent efforts to liberalise trade. But there is still a danger that as domestic industry wakes up to the implications of free trade, and presses governments for protection, the world will lurch back towards aggressive unilateral policies and managed trade, moves which would strike at the very heart of these recent gains.

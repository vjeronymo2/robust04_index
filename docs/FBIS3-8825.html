			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, March 15 (AFP) -- Sadako Ogata, the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], expressed grave concern  Tuesday over the fate of 100,000 civilians in the besieged  Bosnian enclave of Maglaj. Following talks here with Croatian  Foreign Minister Mate Granic, Ogata said the situation in the  northern Moslem enclave, which has been under siege from Bosnian  Serb forces for nine months, was "of great concern to us."    Bosnian Serb troops continued Tuesday to defy a United  Nations Security Council demand issued a day earlier to lift the  siege immediately to allow access for humanitarian convoys. Aid  has been unable to reach Maglaj by road since October. The  besieged communities have since then been forced to rely on air  drops. Ogata said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, whom she  asked Tuesday to "exert his influence" over the besieging  forces, had promised to look into ways of resolving the impasse.  "I'm doing my very best to get access to this pocket. This is a  very important urgent measure to take," for the 100,000  civilians deprived of necessary aid inside the enclave, she  added. The Bosnian Serbs' continued intransigence was "really  against the promise that the three parties, including very much  the Serbs, have given me on November 18th." On that date the  warring parties pledged to halt fighting in and around the  Maglaj pocket to allow aid convoys access. Ogata stressed that  the humanitarian situation in other parts of Bosnia had  "improved enormously." "I do have to give recognition to all the  parties in that sense," she added. "Conditions on the ground in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are improving a great deal, and we are able  to deliver (aid) much, much more easily all over the country."    Ogata is due to travel to Sarajevo Wednesday morning for  talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnia's UN  Protection Force commander, General Sir Michael Rose. Wednesday  afternoon she is hoping to visit both Croat and Moslem sectors  of the southern Herzegovina city of Mostar.    Ogata is due back in Geneva late Thursday after inspecting a  sector of northern Croatia placed under UN protection.</p>

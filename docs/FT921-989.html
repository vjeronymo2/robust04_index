			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / How Labour's broadcast lit the fuse for campaign clash THE UNFOLDING of what may be judged as a key day in the 1992 election campaign began early, only hours after Labour's election broadcast about the delay in surgical treatment for a five-year-old girl, write Ivo Dawnay and Diane Summers. Early morning: The Daily Express claimed the broadcast had been exposed as a 'fraud', with Mr Alan Ardouin, the child's consultant at Kent and Canterbury Hospital, quoted as saying the facts had been distorted and the operation delay was because of a switch from manual to computer records. Breakfast time: Mr Ardouin claimed on Radio 4's Today programme that the delay was due to an administrative blunder, not an illustration of a 'two-tier' National Health Service. When this was spotted 'we admitted her within three weeks'. Immediate reaction: Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, accused Labour of 'techniques that would not have been out of place in pre-war Germany'. He said Labour's use of the case was 'absolutely disgraceful'. Labour's news conference: Reaction to the charges that Labour had distorted the facts was combative but defensive. Mr Neil Kinnock, the leader, said: 'We are not telling the 'Big Lie' we are telling the 'Big Truth'.' Mid afternoon: Labour shifted to the offensive as it disclosed a letter from Mr Ardouin to the child's father appearing to blame shortages of nursing staff, consultants and hospital funds. Late afternoon: The hospital said the girl had been placed on a 'routine', not a 'soon' waiting list. The reason was 'not clear'. Early evening: Mr Roger Moate, the girl's parents' Conservative MP, said the consultant's letter 'made no sense'. Last night: With the girl's parents giving differing views about the broadcast, Mr Chris Patten, Conservative chairman, claimed the consultant's letter had been written before the hospital realised the girl should have been on the priority list.</p>

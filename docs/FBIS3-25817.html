			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- In a circular it issued  recently, the State Council General Office urges all local  authorities to guide the flow of workers from rural areas during  the Spring Festival.    The circular says: In recent years, owing to the flow of  surplus labor in rural areas into nonagricultural sectors, the  number of rural workers moving from region to region has grown  constantly. While the sizable flow has promoted economic  development in various regions and improved the people's  livelihood, it has also given rise to problems which have upset  production, living order, and social stability. The problems  are particularly noticeable during the Spring Festival.  According to departments concerned, the total flow of rural  workers from region to region will soar dramatically this year.  This being the case, all localities and departments concerned  must work together to intensify preparations, tighten  management, and take timely steps to guide the flow.    The circular urges all regions and departments concerned to  provide the needed services and guide the flow by tightening  macroscopic management and developing the labor market so that  labor resources in rural areas can be developed, used, and  rationally deployed; and so that, on the premise of ensuring  agricultural development, surplus labor in rural areas can be  guided to relocate rationally and flow in an orderly manner, and  economic order in society can be maintained.    The circular says: All regions and departments concerned  must attach importance to guiding the flow of rural workers  during the Spring Festival. Leading comrades should be assigned  to take charge of specific projects, and responsibilities should  be fixed at various levels. Moreover, measures to guide the  flow should be drawn up on the basis of past experience.  Certain organizational, managerial, and publicity projects must  be accomplished beforehand. Labor departments in all localities  must have more efficient control over employment as well as the  flowing labor force. They must always keep abreast of the  situation and promptly notify government leaders and relevant  departments. They must work with railway and communications  departments in organizing round trips home for contract workers  over the Spring Festival. In accordance with the volume of the  flow and the destinations of rural workers, railways and  communications departments must draw up transportation plans  ahead of time and accomplish all the necessary preparations,  including transportation arrangements. All regions and  departments concerned must actively support the work of railways  and communications departments. To assist departments concerned  in guiding the flow of rural workers, public security  departments must maintain security and order at railway stations  and ports where rural workers gather, and firmly crack down on  train and highway robberies and all other lawless conduct.    The circular stresses: During the Spring Festival, all  regions and departments concerned must, as required by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, intensify  their work in studying and drawing up policies and measures to  develop the labor force and labor market in rural areas while  studying ways and means to promote agricultural development.  Through intensive agricultural development, more township and  town enterprises and tertiary industries should be established,  the construction of small towns should be expedited, and surplus  labor in rural areas should be encouraged to relocate locally.  Meanwhile, we should continue to sum up and popularize the  experiences of various regions in helping each others with labor  services. In accordance with the needs of the labor market, we  should, through the organized import and export of labor, guide  surplus labor in rural areas to move rationally and in an  orderly manner.</p>

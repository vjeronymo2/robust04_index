Man Mohan Adhikari, president of the Central Committee of  the  Nepal Communist Party (United Marxism-Leninism), said the  situation on the Korean peninsula had become strained again and  an atmosphere of war had been created entirely because the  United States had violated the agreed conclusions reached at the  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York.    "The Nepalese people and the world's peaceloving people are  voicing full support to the Korean people who are advancing  under the banner of socialism and communism, firmly rallied  around the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il," he declared.    Chairman of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party Narayan Man  Bijukchhe said his party will always stand firmly on the side of  the Korean people as in the past and fully support the  self-defensive measures of Korea.    Javier Diez Cansenco, general secretary of the Mariateguista  United Party of Peru, stated that his party will make all  efforts in support of the Workers' Party, the government and the  people of Korea in their just struggle against the moves of the  U.S. imperialists and the International Atomic Energy Agency  leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of  war.    Alberto Moreno, general secretary of the Central Committee  of  the Communist Party of Peru (Red Motherland), stressed that his  party will always stand firmly on the side of the Korean people.</p>

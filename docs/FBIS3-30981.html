			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Knin, 12 Feb (TANJUG) -- The constitutive  session of the new [Serb] Krajina parliament has ended with the  election of a speaker and two deputy speakers of the assembly,  and with the formal swearing into office of Milan Martic as  president [of the RSK (republic of Serbian Krajina)]. At the  proposal of the Serb Radical Party [SRS], the Assembly, by a  majority, elected political scientist Branko Vojnic from Beli  Manastir as its speaker, while Marko Atlagic and Dr. Milan  Ernjakovic, Krajina Serb Democratic Party [SDS] candidates, were  elected as deputy speakers. Mirjana Rodic was elected as  assembly secretary. Thus all assembly officials were elected  from the ranks of the Krajina SDS-SRS coalition.    At the end of the constitutive session, and at the proposal  of RSK president Milan Martic, the assembly adopted a  declaration of solidarity with the struggle of the Serb people  in the Srpska republic [RS], in the wake of the open threats and  the NATO pact ultimatum. [passage omitted]    In the declaration of solidarity with the struggle of the  Serb people in the RS, and in connection with the NATO pact's  ultimatum, it is stated that this Assembly "received the news of  the NATO pact Council's decision to deliver an unacceptable  ultimatum to the RS with deep disappointment."    Such behavior by NATO pact members, the declaration goes on  to say, is profoundly unjust. The intention to use armed forces  against the right of a people to self-determination runs counter  to democracy itself.    "The RSK assembly demands of the state executive organs and  of the armed forces that they consider air attacks by NATO to be  hostile aggression and that they prevent this by all [available]  means, and that they assist the defense of the RS in other ways  according to their capabilities. The full consequences of an  attack on the RS will be borne by the NATO pact members and the  United Nations," it says at the end of the declaration.</p>

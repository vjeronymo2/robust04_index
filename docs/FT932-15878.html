			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: FBD With the Irish insurance activities remaining the mainstay of the business, FBD Holdings lifted pre-tax profits 23 per cent in 1992, from IPounds 9.33m to IPounds 11.5m. The final dividend is 2.5p for a total of 4.5p, a rise of 25 per cent over the previous 3.6p. Earnings per share were 17.47p (13.02p). Insurance pre-tax profits came to IPounds 8.8m (IPounds 9.2m), after writing off IPounds 800,000 realised losses on stocks and shares. Market share was increased and the customer base broadened. Underwriting losses were cut by IPounds 300,000 to IPounds 3.2m. A significant improvement came from property, leisure, IFSC and other activities. Net profit was IPounds 2.7m, against IPounds 100,000 which included a write-down of IPounds 1.1m in property values. Most of the increase stemmed from better sales of properties in Spain and Ireland. The balance sheet had to take a IPounds 4.2m reduction in quoted investments and exchange translation. The decline has largely been reversed since the year-end.</p>

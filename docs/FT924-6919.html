			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Defiant Serbs mark 'liberation' battle A YEAR AGO, corpses littered the streets of Vukovar and not a single building had escaped damage from the bloody three-month battle for control of the Croatian town. Today, the Serbian tricolour flag hangs from burnt-out windows in the once-picturesque town on the banks of the River Danube. Serb leaders yesterday held a celebration to mark the 'liberation' of Vukovar, in which their fighters had routed Croat forces. It was a solemn occasion. Some 3,000 people died in the battle for Vukovar. Weeping women laid wreaths at the graves of loved ones as Serb fighters looked on. But few admitted remorse for the devastation of the town and defiance was in the air. 'No one will ever again step on the Serbs now,' said Mr Zoran Milivojevic, an irregular from central Serbia who had fought in Vukovar. The cemetery, where Serbian and Croats graves lie next to one another, now offers the only testimony of the community's once harmonious mixed population of 50,000 Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs. Only a handful of Croats remain in the town, mainly wives of Serbs. Serb leaders yesterday vowed they would never cave in to international pressure against the rump Yugoslavia - which consists of Serbia and Montenegro. Major Veselin Sljivancin, an army commander of operations in Vukovar warned that 'Europe and the rest of the world must realise we would be traitors to those who died, to give in.' At a ceremony in the bombed-out town centre, families of those fighters killed in battle received medals for bravery. A cold rain fell on the crowd which listened to a defiant Mr Vojislav Seselj, an ultra-nationalist and paramilitary leader linked to the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. 'Serbia will never be brought to its knees. The international community is trying to weaken Serbia . . . but it will not succeed in breaking up Yugoslavia,' he vowed. Above the crowd, Mrs Milka Kovacevic, 61, and a Serb, sat in a flat she now calls home after hers was destroyed by shelling. She was not attending yesterday's ceremony and was thankful to be alive with power and running water once again. Mrs Kovacevic was one of some 8,000 Vukovar inhabitants to hide in a cellar while above her head Serb fighters backed by the Yugoslav Army fought against Croat forces. Plastic covered the windows and the ceiling appeared to be falling down. 'I don't care who is in power as long as there is peace,' she said.</p>

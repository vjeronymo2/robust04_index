			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by 'Ali Feyz: "The Pricing Plan"] </F>   [Text] Putting price labels on consumer goods has become  compulsory. But apparently both the sellers and the buyers  doubt the positive impact of this plan; and the question is why?  The initial impression was that at least the buyers would have  welcomed this plan, which would at least clear up matters. But  this is not what happened. The sellers also have their specific  reasons for considering this plan impractical and temporary. In  order to explain these stances, we should consider the  psychology of Iranian society. This society has learned that  there is no stability in decision-makings and that such acts are  more of a propaganda nature rather than facts. Therefore, both  the buyers and the sellers consider this plan to be temporary;  and if the government makes them observe the tagging of goods,  both sides will continue to be careless.    Moreover, the pricing policy and tagging is facing a more  serious problem. Prices cannot be kept low artificially. An  economy based on a free market follows specific laws. Profit is  the main factor in the market and something which cannot  tolerate any laws or limitations. And each time the government  exerts pressures from the outside, goods are very easily moved  underground and under-the-table deals are made. And this  situation, which is known as black marketeering, will thrive in  Iran. It is surprising how this policy has been tested so many  times and proven to be insufficient, yet it is not given up.  Iran's business economy is not in a situation where it can be  controlled. Part of the well-off society in Iran wants to show  off. The purchasing power of these so-called nouveaux-riches is  so high that the black market business cannot fail to thrive.  It is not a secret to anyone that there is a shortage of goods  in many fields. Therefore, the more goods that are taken  underground, the higher their prices and the demand for them  will be. In such a situation how can one hope that the pricing  plan and the tagging of goods will be successful?    The fact that the existing high prices of goods and services  have roots that go deeper than mere profiteering should not be  ignored. The production of many goods is not as high as demand,  and imports are facing many fluctuations because of the great  problems with foreign exchange. It is because of this that  fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates immediately affect  prices. If we consider that the tagging of goods as the  government intends will work, each salesman will have to sit  down and watch how the dollar rate is fluctuating. Is this  really possible?! It is quite doubtful. As long as the  necessary balance between production and consumption or between  the shortage of goods and imports is absent, no pricing policy  will help to stabilize prices. We have experienced this several  times in the past. This time too, we are experimenting with  this unsuccessful experience.    The very fact that both the buyers and the sellers have not  taken this plan seriously automatically shows that there is lack  of confidence in it. And since this is the case, it is  surprising that a pricing policy which both sides looked on with  mistrust has been adopted. We think that this policy does not  conform with the true economic conditions in the country and is  nothing more than a temporary measure. But if it turn out the  opposite, then we should say that something is very wrong in  society, and this will be an exception that cannot be explained  by any economic criterion. At any rate, these comments should  not be interpreted as a saying that pricing is completely  useless. The issue is one of economic realities, in which  pricing is one of the various outcomes of production and is  completely different from political decision- making.</p>

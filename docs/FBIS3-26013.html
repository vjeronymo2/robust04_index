			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xi Yongnian (6741 3057 1628) and correspondent </F> Song Wenjie (1345 2429 2638)]    [Text] Lanzhou, 23 Jan (XINHUA) -- China has made another  step forward in catching up with the advanced world level in  nuclear physics studies. A medium-energy, heavy ion  radioactive, singular nuclear secondary beam [zhong neng zhong  li zi fang she xing qi yi he ci ji shu liu xian 0022 5174 6850  4418 1311 2397 1410 1840 1142 8381 2702 2945 4787 2631 3177  4848] was recently built in Lanzhou, and the device produced  over 30 types of neutron-enriched [feng zhong zi 0023 0022 1311]  radioactive singular nuclear beams.    The secondary beam was built at the Lanzhou State Laborary  of  the Heavy Ion Accelerator. The 40 meter-long piece of equipment  has more than 20 sets of magnetic lenses, four sets of beam  probes, primary and secondary target chambers, and complex  probing and identifying equipment. It has 40 expansion  parameters [he tiao can shu 0668 6148 0639 2422]. Its main  features are primarily those of crushing nuclei with  medium-energy [zhong neng dan he sui lie 0022 5174 1734 2702  4295 5933] and transfering response [zhuan yi fan ying 6567 4448  0646 2019]. Scientists can use the Argon-40 beam, with energy  of 25 megavolts from each nucleus, generated by the heavy ion  accelerator to bombard an aluminum-27 nuclear target and produce  more than 30 kinds of radioactive singular nuclear beams,  including magnesium-30, carbon-15, and lithium-9. The energy  generated by the secondary beams ranges from 15 to 20 megavolts  per nucleus, and their atomic numbers are 2 to 14. Chinese  scientists will use this secondary beam to study superheavy  nuclei, the possibility of synthisizing nuclides, astrophysics,  and application of nuclear technology.    Knowledge about nuclear physics used to be acquired  primarily  through the studies of stable nuclei. Since the 1980's,  products created through reactions from primary targets have  been reused as bullets, or "secondary beams." The use of  secondary beams has diversified the combination of "bullets" and  "targets," creating unprecedented opportunities for acquiring  new knowledge about atom nuclei. Using radioactive, singular  secondary beams to discover and identify new nuclides and study  new decay modes and decay characters are new means of  experimentation in the world, and China is currently the fifth  country in the world possessing this advanced means of  experimentation.    The Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS] has listed the  construction of this secondary beam, which is one of the  projects China has launched with the aim of catching up with the  advanced world level, as a subsidiary project for the Eighth  Five-Year Plan period. The construction has been successfully  completed as result of the great support and assistance from the  State Science and Technology Commission, the CAS, the State  Natural Sciences Foundation, and the Lanzhou State Laboratory of  Heavy Ion Accelerator.</p>

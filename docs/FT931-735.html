			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Pessimism is a Euro-disease: America Whenever I read a British newspaper, some politician seems to be trying to explain away economic hardship by referring to the 'world recession'. Don't believe it. Much of Europe admittedly is peculiarly depressed; lengthy dole queues seem to be accompanied nearly everywhere by weak political leadership and public apathy. There are few historical precedents for the continent's combination of ailments, which includes civil war in the former Yugoslavia, German xenophobia and a wave of corruption trials in Italy. Even France, labouring to defend the franc, was recently described by the Washington Post as 'rarely in a more disgruntled mood'. In the 19th century, Europe could be forgiven for mistaking itself for the world, most of which it either owned or governed. But today it is ludicrous to pretend that the gloom and doom afflicting Europe is a global phenomenon. In much of the rest of the world the economic outlook is promising and the quality of political leadership as high - if not higher - than in recent decades. Outside Europe, many people are eagerly awaiting the 21st century, which they expect to mark a huge improvement on the past 100 war-torn years. To put Euro-gloom in perspective, consider first the outlook for the US. The economy has been growing steadily for nearly two years following a brief and relatively mild contraction in the winter of 1990-91. Growth at an annual rate of nearly 5 per cent at the end of last year will not be sustained; but most forecasters are confidently predicting several years of growth of at least 3 per cent. The unemployment rate peaked at 7.7 per cent (far below the double-digits feared in Europe), is now 7 per cent and is expected to fall to about 5.5 per cent - effectively 'full employment' - by the end of President Bill Clinton's first term. Unlike the cautious British electorate, Americans had the courage to vote for change last November and are now benefiting from a revival of the legendary Yankee 'can do' spirit. The Democratic Congress has moved swiftly to endorse the White House's economic plan, meaning that excessive budget deficits will be curbed, albeit slowly. Mr Clinton will shortly unveil his strategy for reforming the nation's flawed healthcare system. This will be followed, probably next year, by proposals to improve the quality of US education and worker training. If the outlook for the US is bright, it is positively dazzling in much of east Asia. The region remains politically immature, but during the 1980s it grew more than twice as fast as either Europe or the US. Most forecasters expect continued dynamism, even allowing for Japan's serious (but surely temporary) difficulties. 'Fuelled by China's economic boom,' argues Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street brokerage, in a recent circular, 'Asia-Pacific growth should reach almost 8 per cent in 1993 following 7 per cent last year.' East Asia as a whole is now a more important trading partner for the US than Europe - which is one reason why the US media typically quotes the dollar in terms of yen rather than D-marks. Euro-pessimists must also contend with improved economic performance throughout the developing world, which enjoyed economic growth of about 6 per cent last year and may grow nearly as fast this year. The world has not been in, nor is heading for, a recession, let alone a depression. Even in industrialised countries, annual growth has not yet dipped below 1 per cent and will probably accelerate next year to more than 2 per cent. Viewed from Washington, the gloom pervading Europe is puzzling. For four decades, the continent was divided by an Iron Curtain and needed the protection of a US military shield. Yet in the mid-1980s when the Kremlin was still building its stockpile of SS20 missiles and Berlin was a lonely outpost in communist east Germany, western Europe was far happier than today. It enjoyed political stability and economic prosperity and seemed prepared to make the modest sacrifices needed to secure the potentially huge benefits of greater economic and monetary integration. The reduced burden of military spending following communism's collapse and the enhanced opportunities for trade with the new democracies of eastern Europe ought to be creating still greater regional prosperity rather than a torrent of mealy-mouthed complaints. European politicians pretend that the world is facing intractable economic problems comparable with those of the 1930s. Sky-high unemployment and lakes of budgetary red ink are seen as all but inevitable. The success of east Asia and the US shows that this is nonsense. If Europe is in secular decline, it has only itself to blame; it has simply lost sight of the virtues - thrift, hard work, flexibility and risk-taking entrepreneurship - that underpinned its startling success in the 19th century. With hindsight western Europe perhaps grew too comfortable in the cosy, controlled world created after the second world war, when its destiny was effectively in the hands of the US and the Soviet Union. On its own again for the first time since the inter-war years it is again showing a singular lack of political vision and will.</p>

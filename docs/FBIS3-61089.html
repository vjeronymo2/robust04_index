That all state institutions, industrial, commercial,  financial, and transport enterprises, banks, and private  individuals under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation  shall proceed from the fact that the restrictions established as  of 1962 by the UN General Assembly on relations with the  Republic of South Africa in the political, economic, financial,  scientific and technological, cultural, sports, and other fields  are canceled.    2. That the abolition of the restrictions specified in  Clause  1 of this decree shall not extend to military and  military-technical cooperation prohibited by current decisions  of the UN Security Council.    [Signed] O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Council  of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation    [End box]    "Russia, as distinct from the United States, where the 1986  Anti-Apartheid Act has been in operation, never adopted  independent decisions restricting trade relations between the  two countries--it subscribed to the sanctions imposed against  South Africa by the United Nations," was how Leonid Safonov,  chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Africa Desk, commented to  KOMMERSANT on the title of the Council of Ministers' decree.  Nonetheless, it is well known that (aside from the sanctions)  trade with South Africa in Soviet times was held back by one  further essential factor--ideology: relations were maintained  merely with the ANC, the opposition at that time, and its  leader, Nelson Mandela.    Now both the ideological and economic restrictions have been  lifted. But Boris Kolokolov, deputy minister of foreign affairs  of Russia, specified in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT  correspondent that together with the restrictions on arms  supplies, the embargo on trade with South Africa in oil and  petroleum products imposed by the UN Security Council in 1977  remains in force also. It is expected that all restrictions will  be abolished only after the first free elections have been held  in South Africa, a black and white government of national trust  created, and a constitution adopted, that is, not before May  1994.    It should be observed for fairness' sake that trade between  Russia and South Africa, in spite of the international  sanctions, has been conducted, nonetheless, and particularly  actively in recent years. It is interesting here that the  information on the extent of bilateral trade made available to  KOMMERSANT by Russian and South African departments differs  considerably. According to data of the Russian side (the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the Trade and  Industry Chamber of Russia), commodity turnover in the past year  was not in excess of $800,000, with the significant  preponderance of Russian exports ($500,000), what is more. South  African statistics, meanwhile, put reciprocal commodity turnover  in the first half of 1993 alone at $100 million.    Russian specialists see as the reason for this disagreement  in the data the fact that South Africa's statistics record  contacts at all levels--as distinct from the Russian statistics,  which only take account in practice of deals between major  (primarily state-owned) companies. Indeed, "unclassified  commodities" in fact representing nothing other than small-scale  wholesale consignments of wine (of excellent quality, in  experts' estimation) and a variety of consumer goods, costly and  not so costly, and not necessarily manufactured in South Africa,  what is more, account in the South African statistical summary  for a large part of the trade turnover--$80 million.    In the trade in "classified" commodities, on the other hand,  imports into Russia of products of agriculture and food industry  (approximately $3.5 million), textiles and wool ($7 million) and  electronic equipment and precision instruments ($370,000)  accounted for the bulk of these. In addition, a pronounced place  in trade is occupied by products of chemical industry (imports  from South Africa, $290,000; exports, $80,000).    Civil servants from the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations of Russia and the South African Embassy believe that  the very modest amounts of commodity exchange do not correspond  to the two countries' possibilities and interests. As Leonid  Safonov put it, "One has the impression that Russian  entrepreneurs' ideas of Africa are shaped on the basis of the  novels of Louis Boussenard." Meanwhile, according to him, not so  much merchandise as unique technology could represent the main  interest in South Africa for the Russian side. The knowhow of  the Sasol firm, for example, permitting the production of liquid  fuel from coal. It is this technology that under the conditions  of the embargo on oil supplies has enabled South Africa to  provide for 70 percent of the country's liquid fuel  requirements. The technology of South African mining companies  permits mining operations in very deep mines--up to 5 km. Many  of South Africa's medical developments are assessed as being far  above those of America and Europe. As we know, it was in South  Africa that the world's first human heart transplant operation  was performed, almost entirely with local equipment, what is  more.    In turn, as specialists of the Russian Trade and Industry  Chamber believe, national entrepreneurs also have things to  offer contracting parties in South Africa. According to  information from the Trade and Industry Chamber, the well-known  South African firms Strategic Material Supplies, Balmoral,  Feninx Steel, and Development Resource Group have given the  Russian side their requests for structural and high-alloy  stainless steel, pig iron, hot-rolled sheet steel, and billets  for rolled products. The firms Ace, P.B. International, Latitude  Links, Plumb Contracts, and Bregowa are interested in supplies  from Russia (and, possibly, other CIS countries) of cathode  copper, tungsten, aluminum, zinc, titanium, magnesium, electric  cable, and wire. Through the mediation of the Trade and Industry  Chamber office in Pretoria, they have established direct  contacts with the Tsvetmeteksport and Sovkabel all-Russia  joint-stock companies, the Inferkom group, and the  Zarubezhtsvetmet VAP [expansion unknown], and, according to  KOMMERSANT information, precontract agreements have already been  concluded. Interest is being shown in South Africa in Russian  cement also.    In addition, the Trade and Industry Chamber office has  reached agreement on the sale via the Rusaf Trading, MANNCONN,  Cinofoto, and Midas firms of test consignments of motorcycles,  Krasnogorskiy Plant cameras, experimental Aviatika airplane  models, and Vikhr boat engines, and also 3 million meters of  viscose fabric. As the Trade and Industry Chamber observed, the  prospects of supplies to South Africa of aviation equipment on  leasing terms and the creation of a system of its maintenance  are considered quite good, and there are opportunities for the  joint creation of a system of passenger shuttle helicopter  routes.    Purchases of tropical fruit and animal husbandry products  (which are not inferior in terms of quality to their American  and Australian counterparts, but which are cheaper) could be of  interest in South Africa to Russian importers.    Specialists of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  advise entrepreneurs to think seriously of consolidating on the  South African market to consider the quite complex domestic  political situation in this country. Despite the fact that  President De Klerk and the leaders of the ANC are endeavoring to  avoid civil war, both white and black extremism is a reality,  nonetheless. And even after the elections on 27 April 1994 and  the formation of a coalition government, racial conflicts cannot  be ruled out. It would thus be advisable to take account of the  political instability factor when concluding contracts--and,  accordingly, stipulating the parties' responsibility in the  event of drastic changes in the political situation.    In addition, it is essential to take account also of the  following fact. An agreement on trade and economic cooperation  has been concluded between Moscow and Pretoria which proclaims  the principle of most-favored-nation status in trade. It was  signed on 22 October, that is, before the Council of Ministers'  adoption even of the decree on measures in connection with the  abolition of sanctions in respect to South Africa. But the  cooperation agreement is of a framework nature, that is, it  describes merely the most general principles of mutual  relations. Two documents of fundamental importance for the  development of business--on the protection of investments and  the avoidance of dual taxation--have yet to be signed. Mutual  contacts at expert level on these matters continue, but owing to  the general situation in South Africa, these documents will not  be signed before the elections. Thus, prior to the conclusion of  these agreements, a favorable customs tariff will operate in  respect to the commodities imported into Russia from South  Africa, but taxes on the profits obtained from commercial  activity will be collected by both sides. The same thing applies  to the income tax for persons who are not public servants--if a  citizen of Russia receives his earnings in South Africa, he must  pay tax both in Russia and in South Africa.    Foreign citizens working in South Africa are taxed here,  according to this country's laws, on a par with ordinary  citizens of the country and are required to pay a progressive  income tax. True, the interest computed for foreign individuals  and companies (which are not managed and not controlled by South  Africa) has since 3 June 1993 been exempted from income tax.    KOMMERSANT NOTE: According to information of the  Embassy of South Africa, foreign shareholders are taxed at the  rate of 15 percent of the sum total of the dividend. The maximum  rate of income tax in South Africa is 43 percent, and the level  of income subject to the maximum tax depends on sex and family  situation. Thus, for married men this income has to be 80,000  rand (approximately $27,000) or higher, and for single men,  $56,000 rand ($18,600). Value-added tax is 14 percent. The rate  of profits tax is 40 percent.    To return to the question of how promising South African  technology is for Russian entrepreneurs, it is worth mentioning  that the purchase thereof would seem highly beneficial from the  taxation viewpoint. The point being that in accordance with  Russian legislation--even with the absence of an agreement  excluding dual taxation--Russian entrepreneurs are exempted from  the payment of VAT when purchasing rights to technology. Customs  duty, on the other hand, may be paid off in equal installments  over the whole of the period of which these rights are acquired  (and in practice such terms make it possible to reduce annual  payments to negligible amounts).    And, finally, it is essential to take account of the fact  that there is in South Africa the concept of "white" and "black"  business, and even the interests of entrepreneurs of different  races are represented by particular associations--the Afrikaner  Businessman Institute of Commerce (AHI, represents the interests  of "white" business) and the National Federative South African  Trade and Industry Chamber (NAFKOK, the association of black  entrepreneurs). The commercial interests of Russian businessmen  in South Africa are protected by the Trade and Industry Chamber  of Russia office, which opened in Pretoria in the summer of  1992. In the year that it has been working in South Africa, the  Trade and Industry Chamber office has concluded an agreement on  cooperation with both the above-mentioned associations, and also  with the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB). In addition,  protocols on cooperation with the South African Foreign Trade  Organization (SAFTO) and the Mining Chamber have been signed.  All these organizations represent the interests of about 80,000  South African companies--practically all which are of more or  less note among the country's entrepreneurs. Inasmuch as trade  relations between Russia and South Africa are as yet of a  sporadic nature and Russian entrepreneurs lack, as a rule,  permanent partners in South Africa, the Trade and Industry  Chamber office could help them in their search.</p>

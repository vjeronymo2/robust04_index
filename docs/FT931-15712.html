			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / BA to pay Virgin Pounds 610,000 in 'dirty tricks' case: Branson claims 'total vindication' after High Court settlement MR RICHARD BRANSON and his Virgin Atlantic airline yesterday won near record libel damages of Pounds 610,000 at the end of a two-year 'dirty tricks' legal battle against British Airways. In scenes of high theatre outside the High Court, Mr Branson claimed 'complete and total vindication' for his company which had accused BA of trying to put it out of business. In charging BA with going 'beyond any limits of commercially acceptable practice', Mr Branson listed details of his rival's campaign to discredit Virgin. These included: The illegal use of Virgin Atlantic computer information. The poaching of Virgin passengers by bogus Virgin representatives. The shredding of documents relating to Virgin activities. The spreading of hostile and discreditable stories to destabilise Virgin. BA, which will also have to pay about Pounds 3m in legal costs, apologised 'unreservedly' to Mr Branson in court for alleging that Virgin Atlantic, in claiming BA was conducting a 'dirty tricks' campaign, was only seeking publicity. The settlement represents a deeply embarrassing climbdown for BA and for Lord King, the airline's chairman, and is intended to avoid a long and potentially even more damaging libel action at a time when BA is in the midst of an ambitious international acquisition strategy to become a global airline. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, said his airline was taking steps to ensure 'regrettable incidents' undertaken by BA employees did not occur again. In a special message to BA staff intended to bolster morale, Sir Colin said the 'overwhelming majority' of the airline's workforce had no involvement whatsoever in the campaign against Virgin. He urged them not to be distracted by the publicity surrounding the affair. BA accepted it had impugned Virgin's good faith and said it hoped to build a new and less confrontational relationship with Virgin. After the court hearing, Mr Branson claimed some people within BA had been frightened by the competitive challenge posed by his much smaller airline. He also demanded that BA directors give a full explanation of a separate, covert operation targeted at Virgin and carried out, he alleged, by private investigators. He warned Virgin would not hesitate to take new legal action if it became the victim of further unfair, competitive practices. 'We now wait to see whether the leopard has changed its spots,' Mr Branson added. In the agreed statement read out in court, BA emphasised that the company's directors were not party 'to any concerted campaign' against Mr Branson and his airline. But yesterday's court proceedings were prolonged by argument concerning the role of Mr Brian Basham, a City public relations consultant employed by BA, in the affair. The settlement agreed by the two airlines named Mr Basham as the man responsible for conducting a campaign to plant 'hostile and discreditable stories' about Virgin and Mr Branson in the press. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr Basham's counsel to have his client's name deleted from the settlement statement, the court heard that Mr Basham denied the document accurately reflected his actions. He told the court in a written statement that 'at no time did I act without the knowledge or approval of the British Airways Board'. His statement also said he tried to discourage BA from spreading 'disparaging and unsubstantiated rumours' about Virgin and Mr Branson. Under the terms of yesterday's settlement, BA and Lord King will pay Mr Richard Branson Pounds 500,000 damages with an additional Pounds 110,000 payment to Virgin Atlantic. BA will also pay all costs, estimated at about Pounds 3m. Before departing in a taxi down Fleet Street, leaving behind him an agitated mob of photographers and reporters, Mr Branson said outside the High Court he bore no grudges against Lord King.

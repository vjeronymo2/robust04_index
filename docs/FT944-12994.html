			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: M &amp; S weak Leading stores group Marks and Spencer was restrained by a mix of technical and fundamental factors and failed to benefit from the market bounce. Expiry of options early in the week apparently prompted an influx of stock and several big blocks of shares were said to be overhanging the market. The weekly in-house magazine from rival John Lewis, published yesterday, pointed to relative weakness in sales and there was a feeling the Lewis figures reflected a wider trend. The shares shed a penny to 416p and other stores groups were also weak. Kingfisher slid 4 to 473p against suspicion that the company was beginning to talk quietly and cautiously about Woolworth's trading. Sears softened a half to 108 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons Were it not for the difficult markets in which it operates, the interim figures from Allied-Lyons would be truly disappointing. The excuse for the mere 3.4 per cent rise in profits from wines and spirits was the run-down of US stockpiles of European drinks, built up during last year's transatlantic trade dispute over oilseeds. But any distortion on that score must surely be offset by gains on currency movements. Similarly the 10.5 per cent rise in brewing profits conceals a distressingly weak start to the Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture, which is not included in the previous year's figures. Evidently Allied, having had its hands full with the competition policy aspects, misjudged the extent of discounting in the beer market when the venture was finally launched. Retailing and, in a more modest way, food manufacturing, look better. But the former generates little cash. So it is difficult to see anything other than a slow reduction in the group's Pounds 2bn debt, especially if the flow of proceeds from disposals slows and pension contributions resume. Allied has also slipped a further Pounds 43m of provisions on to its balance sheet, largely to cover restructuring at Carlsberg-Tetley which will entail additional cash outlays. The consolation to investors daunted by such a hard slog is a yield approaching 5 per cent. That looks doubly attractive with base rates at 5.5. From Allied's perspective, the Bank's timing was indeed precise.</p>

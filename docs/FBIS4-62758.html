			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 18 TASS -- An investigation into the  explosion at aviation ammunition depots of the Pacific Fleet  showed that the explosion was caused by outrageous negligence  and lax discipline of the guards.    The explosion occurred 100 kilometers off Vladivostok at  16:00 local time. A fire broke out which caused other  explosions with unexploded shells scattered within the range of  over 10 kilometers. The fire reduced to rubble 200 out of 800  wagons with ammunition, a service room for the guards,  soldiers' barracks and other constructions and partially damaged  the railway. It was only on Sunday that the fire was  extinguished. Luckily, there were no casualties among the  guards and the personnel of the ammunition depot.    According to preliminary estimates made by experts, civilian  constructions in nearby settlements of Novonezhino and Romanovka  were out of reach of fragments of shells scattered by the  explosion. Later, numerous damages of buildings and economic  facilities were detected. Over 2,000 people were evacuated from  the villages of Novonezhino, Romanovka, Smolyaninovo. A total  of 22 civilians who were injured by broken glass smashed out by  the explosion applied for medical aid.    Conter-intelligence officers of the Pacific Fleet  established  that one of the soldiers on guard, after his shift was over,  found an electric igniter of a gun-powder rocket accelerator and  began to disassemble it with a knife. The knife set the  gun-powder accelerator on fire and the soldier threw it into the  bushes, setting dry grass on fire. Rocket shells piled up  nearby caught fire and several minutes later an explosion  occurred.    The soldier and his teammate who was nearby escaped from the  scene of the explosion without notifying the command about the  accident.    The military prosecutor's office of the garrison has  instituted criminal proceedings. An investigation into the  explosion continues.</p>

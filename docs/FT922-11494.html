			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Investment rising in Romania THE LEVEL of foreign investment in Romania showed a modest increase in the first quarter, according to the country's development agency. A further Dollars 54.4m had been pledged by the end of March, bringing the total in the period beginning January 1990 to Dollars 323.1m, said the Romanian Development Agency (RDA), a state-funded body responsible for attracting foreign investment. Western European investors continue to provide the bulk of foreign capital - 66 per cent - followed by the US with 12 per cent, and Middle Eastern countries with 8.5 per cent. Small and medium-sized companies, mainly concentrated in the trade and tourism sectors, remain the principle conduits for foreign investment. Foreign partners were now participating in more than 10,000 local companies; only 42 companies had secured foreign investments of more than Dollars 1m apiece. However, the RDA believes larger companies were becoming more interested in Romania. Colgate-Palmolive, Siemens and Alcatel had recently stepped up their involvement.</p>

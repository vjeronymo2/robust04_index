			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Bank chief may postpone retirement Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has been asked by the board to postpone his retirement, and is not now expected to retire until the end of 1996, the bank said yesterday. Mr Pitman, who is now 62, was previously expected to leave his post at the end of 1995. Even on that basis he would be continuing well beyond the bank's normal retirement age of 60. Assuming the bank's Pounds 1.8bn offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is allowed by the courts to go ahead, the transaction itself is not expected to be completed until the second quarter of next year, and the task of making the deal work will continue well beyond that date. In other moves announced yesterday, Mr John Davies is to retire as deputy chief executive at the end of October this year, but will remain a director and become a deputy chairman after the annual meeting in 1995. At the same time, Mr Michael Thompson, a deputy chairman, will retire from the board. Mr Alan Moore, director of corporate banking and treasury, will become deputy chief executive and treasurer from the beginning of November 1994.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REACTION TO ANTIVIVISECTION 'ADVER-TORIAL'  </P> <P> About "TV 'Adver-torial' Makes Fur Fly" (Greg Braxton, May 24), on Students  United Protesting Research on Sentient Subjects (SUPRESS) and its  antivivisection commercial:  </P> <P> It's amazing how many people are uninformed about vivisection. This is such an  important issue and yet the laboratories strive to keep their activities  secret.  </P> <P> Only by hiding can they continue their mass torture and slaughter.  </P> <P> Does anyone in media-savvy Los Angeles still fall for the  "we-have-a-responsibility-to-the-public" line handed out by Robert Blagman,  local sales manager of KCOP Channel 13 (which refused to broadcast the  commercial)?  </P> <P> Is it necessary to remind programming executives of the rash of  sensationalistic TV-tabloid news shows? Violence? Sexploitation?  </P> <P> Also implicit in the attitudes of stations refusing to run the eye-opening  commercial produced by Javier Burgos is that we viewers can't handle disturbing  information (bloodied corpses on nightly newscasts notwithstanding!).  </P> <P> Perhaps even more important, the "suits" are once again underestimating the  intelligence of viewers.  </P> <P> MARY PROTEAU  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STERN AT 70 -- ARTIST-STATESMAN PAR EXCELLENCE  </P> <P> He started studying piano when he was 6 years old. But at age 8, he saw a  playmate's violin and decided he liked that better.  </P> <P> The playmate grew up to be an insurance agent. Isaac Stern became a violin  virtuoso.  </P> <P> Stern turned 70 this summer and, a luminary's life being what it is, the  birthday is being celebrated over and over this year by an international  community of music lovers.  </P> <P> It already has been marked in Paris -- where President Francois Mitterrand  named him a commander of the Legion of Honor -- and in San Francisco, Chicago,  New York and Israel. Amsterdam and London are next.  </P> <P> While some men are soldier-statesmen, Stern is an artist-statesman. He toured  the Soviet Union in 1956, before official bilateral cultural exchanges existed.  An Academy Award-winning film, "From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China,"  recorded his 1979 visit to the Shanghai Conservatory.  </P> <P> With his wife, Vera, whom he met in Israel in 1951, Stern founded the  America-Israel Cultural Foundation. He was also an original member of the U.S.  National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> In 1960 Stern led the campaign to save Carnegie Hall, one of this nation's most  famous landmarks, from the wrecking ball. In the 1980s he helped raise $60  million for renovations.  </P> <P> "Stern is first and foremost a great artist, but he also has a very developed  sense of social responsibility," said James Wolfensohn, chairman of Carnegie  Hall.  </P> <P> The standards Stern has adhered to through his long career have sustained, even  enhanced, his passion for violin playing.  </P> <P> "I adore it," he said in a recent interview. "I get more pleasure out of music  than I ever did."  </P> <P> The musicianship that evokes that pleasure is much admired by Stern's  colleagues.  </P> <P> "Isaac is quite an extraordinary musician," violinist Itzhak Perlman said.  </P> <P> "He was never part of any particular school of violin playing. He was his own  school. As a player, he's an extreme individualist and yet, because his  interpretations are always thought out, they seem logical. There's an eloquent  simplicity to his music-making that makes it seem just right."  </P> <P> Stern is known in the music world for his generosity to talented, younger  musicians. They play for him. He offers suggestions. He becomes their  advocates.  </P> <P> Stern calls working with younger colleagues the most pleasurable aspect of his  musical life.  </P> <P> When Stern plays chamber music concerts with young musicians, "he insists the  fees be split equally among all the performers, no matter how junior," Yo Yo Ma  recently wrote.  </P> <P> Stern said the life of a musician has changed unalterably during the course of  his career. Speed of travel means that no corner of the globe is unreachable.  </P> <P> What has stayed constant, Stern said, is the attention that must be paid to  musical problems, to rethinking musical interpretations.  </P> <P> "Music is the essential ingredient of a civilized life," he said. "It has  nothing to do with the glitter of the occasional gala. You need it as you need  bread."  </P></p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Xenova raises Pounds 19.7m via US share placing XENOVA, a British bio-technology group, has raised Dollars 30.3m (Pounds 19.7m) through a private placing of shares in the US at Dollars 5 a share. It is thought to be the largest financing arranged by a European biotechnology group in the US. Mr Louis Nisbet, chief executive officer of Xenova, said the main reason for going to the US for funds was that the US market had a good history of financing young hi-tec businesses in the health care field. The financing, arranged by Paine Webber, brings to a total of Dollars 56.4m the equity Xenova has raised since its foundation in 1987. Existing investors, who include venture capital groups, institutional investors and Genentech, the Californian biotechnology company, took 15 per cent of the new shares being sold. Genentech's total investment in Xenova so far is Dollars 10.3m. Mr Nisbet said the group was looking to a public listing in the next one to two years. This could be in the US or possibly jointly in the US and UK. Xenova's specialisation is developing small molecule drugs derived from natural products such as fungi and plants, found anywhere between 'Amazonia and our backyard' Mr Nisbet said. At present it has drugs in pre-clinical trials and hopes to start human trials in the next 18 to 24 months. The drugs are aimed at three categories of disease: cancer, immune-inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular disease. It is collaborating with a number of large drug companies, but has retained substantial marketing rights, particularly in Europe.</p>

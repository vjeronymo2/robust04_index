The NP was reacting on Monday to  suggestions by Mr Mandela in his speech in Potchefstroom's  Primoso township that "coloureds" and Indians who voted for the  NP were "traitors".    It said the ANC leader's words were a complete contradiction  of his earlier call for all parties to be allowed free access to  all communities. "This is once again proof that the ANC talks  with a forked tongue. The sort of see-sawing contained in the  ANC's pronouncements indicate to us that they intend to continue  with a hidden agenda once in power. They are portraying typical  communist tactics to appease the electorate they are about to  pounce on."    The NP demanded a reconfirmation from the ANC that it would  not promote political intolerance.</p>

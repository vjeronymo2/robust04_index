			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Letter: Too complex Sir, As an engineer more highly regarded overseas, the implication that specialist engineers cannot communicate well and think laterally ('Engineers and a welding job', February 25) is unfair. Although the article correctly noted that part of the blame for our low status rests with engineers, the real problem with engineering is it is too complex for many City folk to understand.

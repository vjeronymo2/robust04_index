			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index regains the 2,800 level BEAR PRESSURES on the UK stock market relaxed yesterday and share prices staged a spirited recovery, comfortably regaining the 2,800 mark ahead of the extended weekend break. With both government bonds and stock index futures in better heart, the FT-SE Index regained 26 points of the week's loss, encouraged by renewed buying of the retail and consumer sectors still seen as immediate beneficiaries from economic recovery. Trading volume, sluggish at first, took in some small trading programmes and was boosted in late dealing when Wall Street opened the new session with a gain of 13 points on the Dow Industrial Average. The London market closed at the best of the day with the FT-SE Index up 26.3 at 2,813.1. Yesterday's recovery reduced the week's fall on the Footsie to 29.9 points, or around 1 per cent. The focus put on the blue chips this week by selling pressure from stock index futures has been was reflected in a relatively better performance by the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which climbed by 21.7 to 3,132.1 yesterday. The Mid 250 Index has lost only a few points this week and remains well within 1 per cent of the all-time peak reached on March 19. While the cut in bill rates by the Bundesbank was seen as no more than a technical adjustment, this fresh evidence of the downward drift in rates in continental Europe encouraged what was at first a slow recovery in UK government bonds. By the close of trading, long-dated UK gilts were ahead by around 11/32 . Index-linked government issues, the bond market's inflation-hedged securities, eased by about  1/4 of a point. The day's Seaq total of 526.1m shares finally measured well against Thursday's 542.1m, which was worth Pounds 1.14bn in retail business. Non-Seaq business returned to more average daily volume, making up some 62 per cent of yesterday's business. Market traders said that the market appeared to have returned to calmer waters after the stormy sessions seen at the beginning of the week, and hoped that this week's setback was nothing more than an expected shakeout inside an established trading range. However, investors still appeared to be avoiding the overseas earning stocks yesterday as sterling remained firm, and there were doubts overhanging prospects for Wall Street.</p>

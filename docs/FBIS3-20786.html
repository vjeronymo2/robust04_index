			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Milos Markovic: "There Are Still Pianos To Be </F> Bought"]    [Text] However much Mr. Avramovic has insisted that his  "life and works" have been confined entirely to the functions of  an expert, he learned quite well the basic political premises  which his program must rest. The first is the persistent  reminder that it was Slobodan Milosevic who initiated the  drafting of this program, although Avramovic only loses thereby  -- if he is successful in doing what he set out to do, he will  have to share the glory with someone, and if he fails, he will  be only yet another in the line of the discarded and forgotten.  The other thing he knew he had to be mindful of (along with  trifles such as the hard line against criticism, especially  coming from the independent media, and the mentioning of Milan  Panic only as a "bizarre detail in Yugoslav history") is the  rejection of any similarity with the reform dating from the  times of Ante Markovic. To that end he even offered the  uninformed public the assertion that Markovic's program, unlike  the present one, did not even aim to cover the public deficit.  Anyone with a good memory will recall, however, that that  program was centered on the fiscal sphere. For those who do not  remember, it is sufficient to reflect on the fact that the  Yugoslavia of that time, which was indeed larger, had built up  almost $11 billion in foreign exchange reserves, so that it did  not have to be so concerned about a budget deficit running to a  few hundred million dollars, while the entire present project is  actually based on $300 million.  <H5>  Bringing Foreign Exchange Out Into the Open </H5>   It is perhaps not logical to discuss right at the outset the  political connotations of what is clearly an economic program  whose initial results cannot be denied. The "foreign exchange  specialists" in the street market even have such a high opinion  of the superdinar that they are demanding no less than 10 German  marks [DM] for 7 dinars. The Bureau of Statistics has published  figures that the monthly level of inflation has dropped from a  figure in the millions to 880 percent, although this was rather  clumsy advertising concocted to support the program.  Hyperinflation is literally cut short overnight, in the economic  discipline there is no particular difference between one  thousand percent and a million percent, so they should have  waited a while before publishing the first results. The most  recent information from the banks indicates that in the first  two weeks of the program's implementation the economy and  individuals have sold no less than DM70 million, although, given  the immense shortage of both old and new dinars, the high taxes  and current bills for electricity, other utilities, telephone  and similar costs--there is reason to be skeptical about what  that figure means.    The program for reconstruction of the monetary system,  however, after the heady joy at the dinar in one's pocket being  worth something after all, indeed even in shops that now have  more goods, might well end in a hangover of realizing that life  was better when people were running from store to store with a  handful of bad checks.    The calculation is fairly obvious. The economic policy  proposed for this year envisages an average net paycheck of $30,  which comes to about DM50 (new dinars), a distinction being  made, it is true, between what are called the effectively  employed and those on mandatory leave, but even the former would  not earn more than some DM60 (dinars). Pensions would of course  be about 15 percent lower.    Anyone who in recent days has received the bills we  mentioned  for electricity, water, or telephone, anyone who has had to  travel either by rail, bus, or air, will quickly note that an  average earning of that amount does not guarantee even a daily  loaf of bread and liter of milk. Although they have been  extricated somewhat more honestly than previously, the very last  household reserves of foreign exchange will have to "come out  into the open" on behalf of mere survival. Everyone will finally  have to take seriously the reason why a socialist leader at one  time estimated that individuals were still holding about DM2  billion. In order to take them away.    It is much the same with the economy. Just as the public is  being served its favorite autocratic hot-and-cold policy (large  price increases followed by loudly trumpeted partial  reductions), so economic policymakers, although this is the job  of the legislative branch, not theirs, are playing with taxes  and fees on public and private firms. Coming after DM10,000,  DM1,000 seems like an outright gift, and every drop of 1 percent  in the tax rate seems like a gift from heaven. Given the  circumstances that have prevailed up to now, every serious  enterprise "took refuge" in foreign exchange, but now it is  being force to sell that foreign exchange, since without dinars  it cannot do business and meet a payroll.    There is no economist who could have anything against  introduction of money that carries a real value or against real  market prices for everything. This is truly the only basis on  which on which a successful economy can be built. Nevertheless,  the world has never recorded an example of a ruined economy  combined with sound money, social peace maintained by not laying  anyone off, and an anti-inflation program "which makes things  better the very first day."    Avramovic's current program is good in that it will show  everyone the degree to which the economy has been destroyed and  what the standard of living of the population has been reduced  to. In essence it legalizes everything that has been happening  in the recent past, along with a noticeably hypocritical concern  for so-called "old" foreign exchange savings depositors and  naive support of the opposition in the formation of some kind of  committees of inquiry to study the business operation of the  private quasibanks.  <H5>  An Unprecedented Combination </H5>   People have been robbed repeatedly -- this program makes  them  clearly aware of that. And in a postscript it says that they are  even in debt to the state and for that reason will have to sell  what little foreign exchange they have left. Avramovic's cutting  of the Gordian knot at the same time legalizes the right of all  those who in the time of the Wild West amassed great wealth,  either as private bankers, war profiteers or political bigwigs.  The period of Balkan-style primitive accumulation of capital  seems to be over. The time has come for them (the bigwigs) to  assume even formal authority thanks to a solid and stable  domestic currency, and for most of the population to finally  realize the extent of their own pauperization and the place  assigned them.    The public, deceived so many times, but always ready to  accept fairy tales, myths, conspiracy theories, and similar  stories without reservation, is already putting stock in the  reasons why this program must succeed, similar to the hope it  invested last year when the prophecy was that everything would  change beginning in September. Namely, there is no reason to  doubt that production will grow, and that the social product  this year, just as in the projection of economic policy, will  really increase by 5 percent. According to that story, which is  not without a certain amount of rational analysis, the sanctions  have to be removed soon, because the government and those close  to it, who have been trading in petroleum and everything else  under the sun, have already derived enough benefit for  themselves from the blockade. And now, supposedly, they are in  good humor and will be doing everything for removal of the  sanctions. Or, more simply, they have amassed all they want, and  now they will presumably give us something.    However, whereas real estate is cheaper than it has been  since 1957, according to a TV ad of one of the real estate  firms, and prices on the art objects market have literally been  cut in half, stock should not be put in this theory. There are  still pianos to be bought.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Europe will still need a monetary system No currency system lasts forever. The one that lasted longest was based on an intrinsically valuable commodity, gold, and arose from evolution rather than conscious government planning. But each attempt at a paper replacement has eventually come to grief. Whenever exchange rates are fixed or semi-fixed, longing eyes are turned, from many different points of the political compass, on the supposed benefits of floating rates. Whenever rates are floating it is not long before demands are made for 'stability', and schemes are hatched for the regional or worldwide pegging of rates. A good case can be made in principle for saying that either extreme of purely floating rates or completely fixed rates, such as the gold standard or the now somewhat visionary EMU, would be better than the limping compromises with which the world has struggled. But until there is sufficient international government we shall have to continue limping along with mixed systems. National authorities will never be prepared for long to treat the exchange rate with indiff erence, like the price of tomatoes. Nor, on the other hand, will they give absolute priority to maintaining a parity over all other objectives at all times  - whatever they say. The postwar Bretton Woods system, in which exchange rates were tied to the dollar, served the world fairly well. So long as US inflation remained low, all that other countries had to do was to maintain their dollar parities as long as possible, while they imagined they were carrying out Keynesian demand management policies. Whether Bretton Woods could have remained without the inflationary financing of the Vietnam war we shall never know. But it usually takes a shock of this kind to shatter a system of pegged exchange rates. In the case of the ERM, the shock has been the costs of German unification and the German government's unwillingness or inability to finance these costs through normal budgetary means. As a result an interest rate policy which suited German needs has been prohibitively tight for other countries concerned to fight recession. It may have been too high for Germany too. In coming months German interest rates are likely to drop to levels which, had they been reached a little earlier, would have avoided the crisis of the ERM. One lesson is that, if a currency system is to work, the anchor country must concern itself with the stable growth of nominal spending in the whole area, which is something the Bundesbank has resolutely refused to do. Another lesson is that an independent but accountable central bank needs to have clear and unified leadership. An assembly of provincial notables, each of whom had one vote, might have suited Germany during its reconstruction period of the 1950s when the dollar was the only international currency that counted. It is hopeless for a leading world financial power, which is also at the heart of the European Community. A better model is the New Zealand Reserve Bank whose governor, Don Brash, is personally responsible for success or failure. In a famous essay in favour of floating rates (in Essays in Positive Economics, published in 1953), Milton Friedman argued that insisting on fixed exchange rates, and making domestic costs adjust, was like refusing to shift the clock for summer time and exhorting people to get up earlier instead. But this analogy tells against some of the more far-fetched claims for floating rates. For a frequent resort to exchange rate changes can be compared to shifting the clock by changing amounts every day in the illusory hope of saving people the need to make the slighteest adjustments in their habits. If depreciation becomes not a very rare resort, but a way of life, employers and trade unionists become used to it and project further depreciation and inflation into their expectations. The great gain that the ERM produced for France was that it broke through the cumulative cycle of depreciation and inflation. A European currency system will have to be rebuilt for two reasons. One is that a single market is incompatible with volatile and unpredictable exchange rates. There may be other and even more severe obstacles, such as different national rules and practices. But currency instability cannot be brushed aside by reference to futures and forward contracts. Secondly, monetary policy cannot be indifferent to the exchange rate. For it is the main link between a country's price level and that of the rest of the world. The severe recessions in Scandinavia have shown that abandoning the exchange rate peg does not thereby enable a country to 'go for growth'. The different British experience is due both to the fact that the recession began much earlier and the use made of the period of ERM membership and tight money before that to foster a competitive and non-inflationary atmosphere. Much now hangs on the European Monetary Institute which is due to start next January as successor to the Basle committee of EC central bankers, and which will attempt to co-ordinate monetary policy among EC members. It has been accepted by all members, including even the UK, which has insisted on the opt-out from full monetary union. A consistent monetary policy for the whole Community, aimed at a non-inflationary growth of spending, is both desirable for its own sake and as a precondition of exchange rate stability.</p>

This is stated in a telegram sent  by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to the chairman  of the Sevastopol City Council, Viktor Semyonov, reports the  newspaper "Slava Sevastopolya."    The telegram says that the Russian delegation at the talks  on  the Black Sea Fleet is prepared to discuss with the Ukrainian  delegation, within the shortest possible period, the problems  associated with the drafting of an understanding, according to  which the Fleet with its entire infrastructure in Crimea is to  be used by Russia and fly Russian flags.    For its part, the Russian delegation will pay for the part  of  the Fleet, including the infrastructure, which in line with  previous agreements should be part of Ukraine, says the telegram.    On Tuesday, in an interview with Interfax, the Ukrainian  Foreign Minister favored the idea of the Fleet's problem being  solved on the basis of the Yalta agreements, not the Massandra  ones.    In the summer of 1992, the presidents of Ukraine and Russia,  Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin, signed near Yalta the  agreement according to which Russia and Ukraine would create  their Naval forces on the basis of the Black Sea Fleet. During  their creation, the Fleet would be subordinate to both  presidents.    On September 3, 1993, in Massandra (Black Sea southern  coast), the two presidents signed agreements according to which  Ukraine was to hand over to Russia its part of the Fleet as  repayment of the debt for earlier supplies of Russian energy.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yemelyanenko: "The Russian-Speaking </F> People of Kazakhstan: Mounting Wave of Protests"]    [Text] For the quiet small town in North Kazakhstan three  6,000-strong rallies at a time -- on April 26, May 1 and 9 -- is  almost a historical event, because the old residents recall  nothing like this for 70 years. "Perhaps, we would not assemble  in the street," says Valery Lyubushin, deputy of the regional  assembly, freed recently, "had it not been for the arrest of  Boris Suprunyuk, one of the organizers of the meeting."    Valery Lyubushin and Boris Suprunyuk were detained on April  12 when it became clear that despite the ban by the authorities,  the protests by the Russian-speaking communities -- Ukrainians,  Russians, Germans and others -- would take place all the same. A  week before the non-sanctioned meeting Suprunyuk and Lyubushin  were arrested without an accusation. The picket of Cossacks near  the Procurator's office demanded that they be set free. But only  Valery Lyubushin was released, and a meeting with Suprunyuk was  promised. But instead of that Petropavlovsk learned from Radio  Liberty and Voice of America broadcasts: "Boris Suprunyuk has  been accused of fomenting national discord and has been  transported to Alma-Ata."  <H5>  `Down With Tyranny!' </H5>   The participants in the marches in support of the prisoner  were emboldened by the protest of Russia's Foreign Ministry and  the status of a civil rights champion, given to Boris Suprunyuk  by Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch.    "Had it not been for international support, people would not  dare to speak aloud about the oppression of "non-natives,"  deputy of the city Soviet Galina Kalyuzhnaya said with  conviction. The reputation of Suprunyuk, an extremist and rebel,  restrained the suppressed irritation of those non-Kazakh, who  were dissatisfied with the national policy of President  Nazarbayev. But his arrest caused an explosion in society. The  cause of the persecutions of Suprunyuk in Petropavlovsk is  believed to be from his consistency in demanding re-registration  of the Russian community of Kazakhstan. The thing is that on the  eve of elections to the new parliament all national associations  of the republic were shut for re-registration by a decree of  Nursultan Nazarabayev, issued in December 1993. As it was  promised -- till the opening of the new parliament.    More than two months have passed since its formation, but so  far only the Kazakh movement "Kazakh-tili" has been officially  registered. The others are still outlawed. "We, Germans,  participated intentionally in the meeting of April 26 together  with other Russian-speaking communities," says Viktor  Shlotgauer, member of the presidium of the society "Revival."  "We are not registered under the pretext that we are rejecting  the wording: 'Kazakh Germans.' It is clear that this is being  done to split all the Russian-speaking people -- Poles,  Byelorussians, Armenians, Germans."    Every year around 200,000 Germans, allowed by the quota,  leave Kazakhstan for Germany. There is a queue for many years,  but the 37,000 who remain prefer to move to Russia where,  according to them, life is easier. The outflow of Germans  increased, as soon as Alma-Ata compelled everyone to choose  their citizenship by March 15, 1994. This date has been extended  for another year. This is due to the requests and protests by  the Russian-speaking communities against combining the adoption  of citizenship with the transfer of all documents to the state  language -- Kazakh.    Before the spring of 1994 the keeping of documents in the  Kazakh language seemed to be a distant future, but at the  meeting of April 26 in Petropavlovsk the demands were clear: to  set up a free economic zone with Russia and introduce the second  state language -- Russian.  <H5>  South Against the North </H5>   "We are called chauvinists, but what can be done if in  Kokchetav, Pavlodar, Ust-Kamenogorsk and Tselinograd up to  60%  of the population are Russian-speaking, and in Petropavlovsk and  Kustanai almost 100%," says Valery Lyubushin. "Should all  these  people move to the Kazakh language? It would mean shutting down  schools, institutes, factories. It's absurd!" Therefore, those  participating in the rallies demand that the border with Russia  be opened, that settlements of accounts be made easier with the  enterprises of neighbours -- Novosibirsk, Omsk, Kurgan, as well  as equal taxation with the South. It is already "equal" --  100%  of the profit the regions assign to Alma-Ata. But the greater  part goes to the Kazakh South, which has created a free economic  zone with China and Central Asia, and a lesser part -- to the  Russian-speaking North.    "So far the conflict is not of a vividly outlined national  character," says Valery Ilyin, leader of the local branch of the  Socialist Party. "People went out into the street because they  are not paid wages for six months and spend a year on an  emergency leave -- the plants stand idle because of ruined  contacts with Russian suppliers. But even the ordinary citizen,  mostly indifferent to politics, is not blind. He sees that for  him there is no money, but Kazakh migrants from Mongolia are  paid substantial travelling expenses, loans, even interest-free."    Their actions run into absurdity: the wave of renamings  swept  the cities which never had other names. Petropavlovsk  participated in a meeting, on learning that the city had been  renamed into Kzylzhar. "It is fantastic only at first glance,"  says Valery Lyubushin, teacher of the local pedagogical  institute, "but our lecturers teaching in the Kazakh language  get 15-20% more than Russian-speaking teachers. All the  leading  posts are occupied by the representatives of the Kazakh nation."    The election results to the new parliament show that this  policy contributes to the formation of Kazakh statehood,  infringing the national self-consciousness of other people. Out  of 170 deputies 105 are Kazakhs. And this happens when over  60%  of the republic's population are Russian-speaking.    The privileges for the Kazakh nation together with  unemployment played their role: in 1993 a total of 365,000  Russian-speaking people left Kazakhstan and moved to Russia.  From Mongolia and China 105,000 Kazakhs returned to the republic  and are now settled in the North. The results of the "soft"  forcing out policy on Russians and the resettlement of Kazakhs  on their lands were not kept waiting. In 1994 alone there were  clashes in 5 Cossack villages (stanitsas) between the local  Cossacks and Kazakh migrants.  <H5>  Cossacks and Kazakhs </H5>   "We are not questioning Kazakhstan's sovereignty, but we are  not going to leave our lands," says Viktor Achkasov, chieftain  of the banned association of Siberian Cossacks. "Six percent  Serbs succeeded in upholding the right to existence and we are  more than 70%. We shall withstand!"    Viktor Achkasov openly wears the Cossack uniform and carries  a whip, banned by a decree of President Nazarbayev, whose stand  is unequivocal: "In the socio-political forces of Kazakhstan  there are no Cossacks," he told Boris Yeltsin at the latest  talks in Moscow. As is known, Russia kept mum. The Cossacks  believe this is "in reply to the right of taking Baikonur on  lease." "In this way the life of one million people has been  crossed out," Achkasov argues with the President of Russia. He  is convinced that non-recognition of the Cossack community leads  to the radicalization of that part of society. "You see, if  earlier a mere juridical recognition suited us, then today many  chieftains insist on autonomy, right up to the reunification  with Russia," says Achkasov. These demands made at the meetings  set the Kazakhs against Cossacks, threatening the republic with  a split.    After the events in Petropavlovsk the North grew quiet in  expectation, Alma-Ata promises to release Boris Suprunyuk "after  the completion of the investigation." Suprunyuk, according to  his wife Luiza, continues his hunger-strike and will insist on  an open political trial. He was backed up by all the national  communities of the North and Cossacks who declared that they  will openly carry arms, just like in Russia. "If the events that  took place in Topolevka and Pokatilovka continue, we shall put  force against force," ataman Achkasov says openly. --  Petropavlovsk    [Box, p 3]  <H5>  MN File: </H5>   Boris Suprunyuk, 58, is a journalist and chairman of the  Russian-speaking community in North Kazakhstan. In August 1993  he turned down Kazakhstan citizenship and adopted Russian. Twice  he was arrested. In 1988 the communist nomenklatura suspected  him of a "mental disorder". He was set free two months later  with the diagnosis: "healthy". In April 1994 he was arrested for  refusing to give a written undertaking not to leave his  residence in Petropavlovsk.    [Box, p 3]  <H5>  MN File: </H5>   On March 14-16, 1994 there was a clash in Topolevka and  Pokatilovka stanitsas (Taldy-Kurgan Region) between Cossacks and  Kazakhs during the celebrations of the Moslem holiday Navruz. Up  to this day the villages are cordoned off by the forces of  Kazakhstan's Interior Ministry. Twenty-five representatives of  the Cossack community and 15 Kazakhs were arrested.</p>

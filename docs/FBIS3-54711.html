			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 Dec [date as received] -- "Russia can and  must resolve the problem of settling the Georgian-Abkhaz  conflict," thinks Sandro Kavsadze, chairman of the Georgian  State Committee for Human Rights and International Relations.  He made the statement at a news conference on preparations for  the second round of the Geneva talks on the settlement of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict scheduled for 11 January 1994.    "Our main aim is to settle the conflict by peaceful means.  One cannot wait any longer because killings and deportation of  people are still going on," Sandro Kavsadze stressed.    Summing up some results of the first round of the Geneva  talks which were held at the end of November and beginning of  December, he appreciated Russia's assistance in holding the  talks. Among the results was the memorandum on Mutual  understanding which included an obligation by the parties to  refrain from using force for the period of the negotiations, an  exchange of POW's based on the principle of "everyone in  exchange of everyone," and measures for resolving the refugee  problem. The talks also covered the necessity for Abkhazia's  economic revival and recognition of its autonomous statehood by  the parties. As regards the second point, the Georgian  spokesman clarified that "Abkhazia should have an autonomous  statehood, but the question is what statehood."    As for Russia's role in the conflict settlement, Sandro  Kavsadze thinks the involvement of Russian armed forces under  the aegis of the United Nations is necessary in order to create  guarantees for security in the region. The Georgian spokesman  stressed: "We are trying to convince Russia that there is no  alternative."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video with Japanese subtitles on </F> NHK "exclusive" interview with PLO Chairman 'Arafat by NHK  correspondent Norikazu Hashimoto in Tunis on 8 April; from the  "NHK News" program -- 'Arafat's remarks processed from English]    [Text] Negotiations on the establishment of Palestinian  self-rule have been deadlocked over a month following the  slaughter of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied Hebron in  February. In connection with this, PLO Chairman 'Arafat  strongly expressed dissatisfaction with the Israeli Government's  attitude because it is most likely that the withdrawal of the  Israeli forces will not meet the deadline of 13 April.    He made the following remarks in an exclusive interview with  a NHK reporter accompanying the United Nations' news gathering  team for Middle Eastern affairs in the evening of 8 April, which  is the morning of 9 April in Japan.    [Begin 'Arafat recording] This means that he [not further  identified] forgets everything concerning the 13th of April.  For how long they will continue maneuvering? But I am sorry to  say that they are continuing their maneuvering to prevent the  implementation of what had been signed in the White House last  September. This continuous delay from the Israeli side...  [pauses] giving the chance for all the extremists from the two  sides to damage the peace process. And because of this delay,  our people have lost their candid... [corrects himself], have  lost their confidence with this peace accord. [end recording]    Moreover, PLO Chairman 'Arafat disclosed that to provide a  breakthrough in such a deadlocked situation, ha has asked for  cooperation of the nations which are involved in the peace  talks, including the United States and Russia.    [Begin Hashimoto recording] Chairman 'Arafat repeatedly used  the phrase "the delay by Israeli maneuvering," thus strongly  criticizing Israel. But it can be said that his remarks reflect  the Palestinians' irritation and sense of crisis because  progress -- such as the withdrawal of the Israeli forces -- in  peace talks has not been clearly seen despite the agreement last  September on launching negotiations on establishing Palestinian  self-rule. Digesting schedules one by one toward establishing  the self-rule government will not only lead to promoting mutual  trust but also give impetus toward achieving peace. For that  reason, PLO Chairman 'Arafat is increasingly irritated at the  continuous delay. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Turkish clash looms over new president TURKEY appeared headed for a possible constitutional crisis yesterday after the death of President Turgut Ozal. Mr Ozal, 65, who collapsed on Saturday from heart failure, was a reformer who for many in the west symbolised Turkey's return to democracy and transition to a market economy. His death is unlikely to signal a shift in Turkey's pro-western foreign policy. But with no obvious successor and with party strengths in parliament finely balanced, diplomats say there is a real danger the coalition government of Mr Suleyman Demirel may become bogged down in infighting. If no consensus emerges after four parliamentary ballots to choose a new president, the constitution calls for general elections for a new assembly. Having dominated the Turkish landscape, steering the country through the Gulf war and the subsequent Kurdish refugee crisis, Mr Ozal had latterly become more isolated from the political process. His loss will perhaps be most keenly felt by the Kurdish minority, which had come to look on him as informal patron of their campaign for greater rights. His death comes as the government tries to frame a response to the recent Kurdish ceasefire call. The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but while the Motherland Party (Anap) was in government Mr Ozal *something in here (HP) * accrued considerable powers, particularly in foreign policy. With the first parliamentary ballot to choose a new president due on April 27, two names have already been put forward. Mr Husamettin Cindoruk, parliamentary speaker, has made little secret of his presidential ambitions. A lawyer who acted for Mr Adnan Menderes, the former prime minister executed by the military in 1961, Mr Cindoruk has increasingly alienated government support with his maverick performance, particularly his public opposition to the recent government ban on private TV and radio, and his defence of the legal immunity of Kurdish deputies. A more popular choice would be the deputy prime minister, Mr Erdal Inonu, the physicist son of Turkey's second president. Apart from the family name, he is widely respected and as a reluctant politician would have no difficulty in remaining non-partisan, something Mr Ozal found so difficult. Much will depend on his party, the Social Democratic Populists (SHP). They may argue that his departure could damage their standing at a time when they face defections to the newly revived People's Republican Party (CHP). Some deputies suggest Mr Demirel himself might also proffer his candidacy.</p>

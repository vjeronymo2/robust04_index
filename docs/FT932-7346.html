			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Spending review vital, says Major: PM stresses need for cuts but will uphold election pledges on welfare MR JOHN MAJOR last night sought to calm the political storm over the Treasury's scrutiny of the welfare state with an assurance that its conclusions would respect 'the spirit as well as the letter' of his general election manifesto. In a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times during which he rejected attacks on his leadership style and left open the possibility of an early cabinet reshuffle, the prime minister defended the spending review as essential to allow the government to 'save where we can, to spend where we must'. Speaking last night in 10 Downing Street, Mr Major also acknowledged that the looming summer battle over next year's public spending total has sparked a cabinet debate on whether to maintain for another year the formal pay rise ceiling applied to public sector workers. Extension of the present 1.5 per cent ceiling is being sought by a number of Whitehall spending departments, but the idea is vigorously opposed by the Treasury. The prime minister would say only: 'We will be discussing that in the very near future.' Mr Major confirmed the fundamental nature of the expenditure review - focused initially on health, social security, the home office and education - being carried out by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, commenting: 'Don't make any mistake about that. We will have to select priorities.' But he refused to be drawn on reports in recent days suggesting that Mr Portillo wants to combine a range of new charges in the National Health Service with closer targeting of social security benefits. Although clearly irritated at some of the reports, he said that ruling out publicly on a 'one-by-one' basis changes in any individual benefit or service would undermine the review. Mr Major insisted that the government's decision to examine the principle of universal welfare benefits was not designed to restrict the benefits to those reliant on income support. His comments came as Whitehall officials pointed out that suggestions the government planned to tax child benefit ignored the immense complexities of such a move under an independent tax regime for husbands and wives. Acknowledging the concern of people - particularly the elderly - whose income keeps them not far above the social security net, the prime minister said: 'We do have a particular concern for people on modest incomes who have worked through their lives to provide for themselves rather than depend upon the state. What we are not in the business of doing is sweeping away necessary spending. But we can't let the total grow faster than the economy can support.' Clearly stung by the political uproar, he added: 'We are emph-atically not targeting special reductions on the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. We have a responsibility to the poorest and most vulnerable members and we will meet that.' Pressed on the calls from ministers and backbench MPs for an early cabinet shake-up which could see Mr Norman Lamont's departure as chancellor Mr Major replied: 'In due course, I have no doubt I will (reshuffle) but when that will be, I have no intention of telling anybody.' In a clear reference to the growing attacks on Mr Lamont, he added: 'I will tell you now - neither now nor at any stage in the future are my reshuffles going to be preceded by assassinations of my colleagues. When, and if, I reshuffle my cabinet, I hope the first that anyone will hear about it is the day on which it begins.' The prime minister dismissed charges from sections of the Tory party that he had not offered decisive leadership. He had stuck with a firm counter-inflation strategy when the 'easy option' would have been to relax policy. He had also rejected the escape route of a referendum on the Maastricht treaty despite the rebellion in his own party. Mr Portillo's review was not simply a reaction to the growing borrowing requirement. Citing longer-term pressures on expenditure, Mr Major said: 'We have got to look across the whole range of public expenditure to see where it is possible to trim back in order to meet the essential growth areas. That would have needed doing whether or not we had a deficit.' Pressed on the government's pledges in last year's manifesto to maintain and increase in line with inflation the universal state pension and child benefit, he said: 'We are sticking to our manifesto pledges - the spirit as well as the letter, of course.' A fuller account of this interview with John Major will appear in tomorrow's FT. In it, the prime minister sets out his agenda for change in the European Community and addresses the question: are you a consolidator or a radical Conservative? Politics and Parliament, Page 13</p>

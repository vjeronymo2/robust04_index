			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Hungary mounts rescue of 10 commercial banks The Hungarian government yesterday unveiled a two-stage Dollars 1.4bn bailout for 10 commercial banks whose capital has been wiped out by loan losses. In the first stage later this month the state will inject Ft110bn (Dollars 1.1bn) to restore solvency to Magyar Hitel Bank, Kereskedelmi Bank and Budapest Bank, the country's three largest commercial banks, and five smaller financial institutions. On average the banks have negative capital equivalent to about 15 per cent of risk-weighted assets and the infusion is needed just to raise the banks' capital adequacy to zero. The rescue is necessary before the closing of the 1993 accounts to rebuild confidence in the troubled banks after a World Bank aide-memoire declared them 'technically insolvent'. A further recapitalisation in the first half of 1994 will include two more banks and raise capital adequacy ratios to at least 4 per cent at a cost of an estimated Ft30bn. The government hopes that its support will speed privatisation of the banks and that the contribution of new investors will provide the final boost to take capital adequacy ratios to the 8 per cent standard set by the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. Hitel Bank has the largest call on the government's funds with a capital need of over Ft50bn. It is the largest commercial bank and main lender to the engineering companies which have suffered most from the collapse of Comecon markets. The latest commitment comes on top of the state's assumption of bad debts from the banking sector at a cost of Ft100bn in 1992 and a similar Ft40bn exchange earlier this year. The government is spreading the burden by effecting the recapitalisation through 20-year bonds. Yesterday's announcement nevertheless takes to nearly Ft300bn the total cost of Hungary's efforts to shore up its banking system. In return, the finance ministry is exacting a heavy price in terms of lost independence for banks participating in the government's 'consolidation' scheme. The capital increase will dilute the shareholdings of existing investors and the ministry has said it intends to demand a controlling golden share in any bank in which its stake does not reach 75 per cent.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Adam board comfortably survives meeting THE CHAIRMAN and board of Adam &amp; Company, the small Edinburgh-based private banking group, whose banking subsidiary lost twice its capital in irregular foreign exchange futures dealing, yesterday comfortably survived an extraordinary general meeting held to consider the affair. There was no call at the meeting for the resignation of either Sir Charles Fraser, chairman, or of Mr James Laurenson, deputy chairman and managing director, and two shareholders asked for the opportunity to put more money into the bank. Sir Charles, a leading Edinburgh solicitor and company director, told shareholders that if the senior executives and directors who were 'technically responsible' for the loss were to resign, 'you would have no Adam &amp; Co.' The company was too small to sustain the departure of its top executives. But he said: 'I apologise unreservedly to shareholders for what has happened. An expression of remorse is entirely appropriate.' Adam &amp; Co, a bank which caters for wealthy individual clients, suffered a loss of Pounds 21m in its London treasury department due to operations by its foreign exchange dealers who 'acted as a rather inexperienced gambler at a roulette table,' he said. Although the loss wiped out the bank's Pounds 10m capital, Adam &amp; Co was rescued by Mrs Francoise Schlumberger Primat, a 75-year-old director, who agreed immediately to inject Pounds 21m into the bank by means of an issue of perpetual convertible non-cumulative preference shares which carry no coupon till 2003. The Schlumberger family of France, whose fortune is founded on its company which operates systems for measuring the flow of oil wells, was already the largest shareholder in Adam &amp; Co, following Adam's acquisition of Continental Trust in 1986. Adam &amp; Co - then the first new Scottish bank since 1844 - was created in 1984 by Scottish private and institutional investors and named after the economist Adam Smith. Sir Charles told about 120 shareholders in a sober and attentive gathering at the Caledonian Hotel in Edinburgh that the loss occurred in a discretionary currency portfolio set up for a client and came to light on August 26 when the two dealers involved disclosed the situation. Losses were incurred, he said, 'at an early stage in the management of the portfolio.' But the dealers were 'extremely nervous about reporting such losses' and believed they could avoid doing so by 'rolling contracts forward in the expectation of a reversal of the trends which had created the losses.' Because of the accounting techniques employed by the dealers neither the client nor the senior managers or directors of the bank were ever aware of the extent of the overall exposure. The quarterly reports 'on almost all occasions indicated that there were no outstanding forward contracts at the reporting date. This we now know to be totally untrue.' The dealers were backing the US dollar against the D-mark at a time when the US currency was falling steadily. 'The dealers acted as a rather inexperienced gambler at a roulette table and continued to bet on the same outcome, backing the dollar against the deutschemark and doubling up as the situation became more desperate.' Some 22 outstanding rolled-over positions were concealed. Fictitious deals were also booked to the portfolio account and, according to a specially commissioned report by Price Waterhouse, the dealers had 'thought of everything, even to the extent of selecting counterparties which they thought would not be approached by the auditors.' The two dealers, Peter Wood, 31, and Richard Turnbull, 27, were immediately suspended and are now no longer employed by the bank, Sir Charles said. The chairman said that such 'operations can only be carried out by knowledgeable dealers who are prepared to manipulate the bank's reporting systems in order to avoid detection.' The control over the management of the discretionary portfolio was 'clearly not adequate.' Sir Charles said that Adam &amp; Co had decided to stop operating discretionary foreign exchanges portfolios and close its London foreign exchange dealing room, retain only the one in Edinburgh. Price Waterhouse is now finalising its 'forensic' report on the affair and how it escaped detection which will be sent to the Bank of England. The chairman said that fewer than 20 client relationships had been terminated because of the affair and the bank, which is a subsidiary of Adam &amp; Company Group, now has net assets of Pounds 12.2m. A major clearing bank had confirmed the validity of Adam &amp; Co's controls and highlighted areas where they might be strengthened. Until the deficit on reserves of Pounds 18.8m has been eliminated shareholders cannot receive dividends from the bank, which made a profit of Pounds 1.2m before the exceptional loss. The bank is therefore considering a scheme, which would require court approval, to eliminate the deficit on reserves by reducing the nominal value of the share capital of the bank. Although some shareholders raised critical points at the hour-long EGM, one shareholder, Mr Jimmy Walker, a fund manager, quoted Henry Ford's words: 'History is bunk.' Adam &amp; Co must look to the future and give its shareholders the chance of subscribing new capital through a one for one rights issue.</p>

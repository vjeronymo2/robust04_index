			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- The Russian State Duma  rejected on Wednesday a communist proposal to "declare null and  void" the upcoming Russia's joining the NATO "Partnership for  Peace" plan which is to be signed by Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev in Brussels today.    Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov said in the lower house  that the NATO partnership plan is "US expansionism aimed against  Russia".    He compared it to the notorious "Barbarossa" plan of Adolf  Hitler which was used to invade the former Soviet Union exactly  53 years ago - on June 22, 1941 when Nazi Germany attacked the  USSR.    However, the Duma voted down the communist proposal to  include the issue into the agenda.</p>

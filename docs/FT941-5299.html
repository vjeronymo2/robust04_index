			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Israeli economic reforms praised by IMF The International Monetary Fund has praised Israel's economic reform programme as laying the conditions for high and sustainable growth but warned against complacency over inflation, Julian Ozanne writes. In a report released in Jerusalem yesterday, the IMF backs Israel's central bank which has clashed with the finance ministry over increasing interest rates to meet an inflation target of 8 per cent for 1994. Inflation last year ended at 11.2 per cent. The fund welcomed the interest rate increase and said maintaining the full independence of the central bank was important to macro-economic credibility. The fund said the primary focus of Israel's monetary policy should be 'attainment of the inflation target'. The fund generally praised the economic reform drive but said the process should be reinvigorated, particularly in the areas of privatisation policy, banking sector reform, labour market reform and the further liberalisation of the trade and capital accounts.</p>

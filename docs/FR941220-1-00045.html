National Costs of the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Under Option 1, annualized national treatment and waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost is projected to total $86 million for the proposed MCL of 500 mg/L, of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which $8 million is estimated for monitoring and State implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With State authorization, the 1,500 systems assumed to choose public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification/education and Alternative Water account for $7 million of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total, or about $5,000 per system. The Agency assumes that, despite the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of Option 1, 25% of the systems (approximately 500) exceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sulfate MCL would choose either central treatment or regionalization,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a total cost of $71 million. Possible reasons for choosing central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment would be to avoid a permanent requirement for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification/Alternative Water provision and its associated administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and logistical costs and activities, or to comply with other existing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future regulations on other contaminants. The difference in cost to large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems choosing central treatment rather than Option 1 is a factor of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 3 to 5. EPA assumes that this additional cost would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dissuade large systems from choosing central treatment. For costing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes, it was assumed that all transient systems not choosing central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment would install a POE device, and all CWS and NTNC systems not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choosing central treatment would use bottled water or POU devices. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reality, the Agency recognizes that there would be a mixture of choices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among system types, and that the choice of a POE by a small system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutes ``central treatment'' for that system, since all water is treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the technology used for the POE would be a BAT technology such as RO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small transient systems could legally choose a POE device under any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed options, and since their cost cannot be counted under both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centralized treatment and Option 1, their costs have been included under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the heading ``non-centralized treatment''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Options 2 and 3, the total cost of the rule is approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $16 million, which also includes $8 million for State implementation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring costs. The implementation of Options 2/3 would be much less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costly than Option 1, but would involve all 2,000 systems, compared to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,500 systems which would choose public notification/education and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Water in Option 1. Consequently, the cost of implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be $8 million rather than the $7 million for Option 1. The target  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population would be reduced to infants and the water allocated reduced to 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liter per day. Although more infants would be included by large systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choosing this option, infants comprise less than 2% of the population at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any given time. The difference in cost to large systems choosing central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment rather than Options 2/3 would be at least an order of magnitude.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA assumes that this additional cost would dissuade large systems from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choosing central treatment, and therefore that all systems would choose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 1. Implementation of Options 2 and 3 would be identical, except for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the content of the public education/notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Option 4, the total national cost of the rule is $147  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million. For costing purposes, it was assumed that all systems would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> install central treatment, rather than request a variance. For some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smallest systems, the central treatment installed consists of a POE device,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which functions on the same principles as a treatment plant (e.g., reverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> osmosis). Since some percentage of systems would, in reality, request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance and comply by public notification/education and Alternative Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision, the cost for Option 4 is somewhat of an overestimate. At the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same time the cost for Option 4 is an accurate estimate of what the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be for central treatment for all affected systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under all options, approximately 2,000 systems, most serving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations less than 500, are expected to exceed the sulfate MCL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Assumptions Used To Estimate Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> For each system size category, for both ground and surface water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, the projected number of systems with contamination above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate proposed MCL was determined from the occurrence data. The number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems exceeding the MCL was then merged with a compliance decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matrix, which gave the relative likelihood that a given system would choose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various treatment, compliance and waste disposal options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For systems choosing central treatment, the resulting estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were then multiplied by the unit engineering costs, which include both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital and O&amp;M costs. Although pre-treatment costs were included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates, the operation of reverse osmosis by some systems with very high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influent sulfate levels may contribute to the need for additional post-treatment corrosion control to comply with the lead and copper rule. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would likely affect only systems with influent sulfate concentrations above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 750 mg/L because more than one-third of the influent stream would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated. These costs would be added to the costs of the BAT, but would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect EPA's conclusions on affordability because they would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insignificant compared to the overall costs of the central treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of cost estimation, the Agency assumed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of either POU or POE is the same. Each system is assumed to install  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POE, since the cost of one POE is generally less than the cost of multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POU units. For example, in a gas station, a POU unit would be needed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the men's restroom, the women's restroom and the water fountain in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public area. In this scenario, it might be cost-effective to install one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POE unit versus three POU devices. Several sources were used to estimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the capital and O&amp;M costs for POU/POE units, including (1) ``Point-Of-Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatment of Drinking Water in San Ysidro, New Mexico;'' March, 1990; (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Network for Environmental Management Studies Research Report on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affordable Drinking Water Treatment for PWSs Contaminated by Excess Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Natural Fluoride;'' December, 1991; and (3) ``Very Small Systems Best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available Technology Document;'' First Draft; September, 1993. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations included some of the following assumptions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Laboratory costs including four bacteriological analyses and two sulfate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The replacement frequency for both the particulate filter and the carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post filter is assumed to be twice per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The purchase price for the POU devices ranges from $329 to $665  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on the number purchased at one time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The cost for installation is assumed to be $79.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The cost for a one year maintenance service contract is assumed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $508 per unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bottled water costs are based on data provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> International Bottled Water Association. The cost includes cost of water,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery, and labor. Water is estimated at $1.06 per gallon. People are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed to consume 0.53 gallons per day. The Agency estimated 1 delivery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per week with a round trip distance of 25 miles costing $0.28 cents per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mile. The Agency also estimated one hour for each delivery at a labor rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of $14.70 per hour. For Options 2 and 3, where bottled water is provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only to infants, the water allocation is one liter per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUSTOMER SUES L. B. BANK IN $100 DISPUTE  </P> <P> Jeffrey Johnson of Lakewood is mad at his bank. He has filed a small claims  suit against it. He says he has persuaded several of his friends to close their  accounts there. And at a recent business seminar, he urged others to avoid  doing business with that bank.  </P> <P> All because he says the bank cheated him out of $100.  </P> <P> "What they did isn't right," said Johnson, 35. "I think that business  institutions need to act in good faith with the people doing business with  them. They need to learn that if they act against that good faith that they  won't stay in business long."  </P> <P> The object of his wrath is Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank of Long Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Counted the Money Twice  </P> <P> The dispute began early last month when Johnson, a computing consultant from  Lakewood, went to the bank's Seal Beach branch to cash a $100 check. To hear  Johnson tell it, all went well. He said he took his money, counted it twice to  make sure he had received the correct amount, and then went home.  </P> <P> But that night, Johnson says, he got a call from the teller asking if he had  noticed an extra $100 in his wallet. A few days later, he says, he received a  letter from the bank informing him that he had been given an extra $100, an  assertion Johnson vehemently denies. To make things right, the letter went on  to say, the bank had withdrawn the additional $100 from his account.  </P> <P> "We apologize for our error and appreciate your cooperation with the action  necessary," said the letter, signed by Jeffrey C. Hagan, assistant vice  president.  </P> <P> Hagan said the letter was based on a close reading of the teller's audit tape,  a computer printout that automatically records every transaction at a teller's  window. Included in the material he sent Johnson was a copy of the tape showing  a dispersal on the date in question of $200 -- ten $20 bills -- to Johnson.  Also included was Johnson's canceled check for $100. "I am sorry he feels that  we're in the wrong," Hagan said in an interview, "but I am required to go by  what our paper documentation shows us."  </P> <P> Denise Hatfield, the teller involved, said she definitely remembers handing  Johnson $200, but declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Six Similar Cases  </P> <P> Senior Vice President and Cashier John Henrichs characterized the teller's tape  as a "very complex and highly reliable" method of recording bank transactions.  "The teller can't take a dollar out of the drawer without putting it on the  tape," Henrichs said, adding that the bank has experienced about six such  disputes over the last 15 years, all of which were decided in its favor.  </P> <P> He said a state law allows banks to seize the assets of customers to offset  verified financial obligations.  </P> <P> After punching a series of numbers on a computer keyboard and thereby recording  the transaction, bank officials say, tellers remove the money from a drawer and  generally count it twice before giving it to a customer.  </P> <P> In Johnson's case, said Senior Vice President Charles Hagan, who is Jeffrey  Hagan's father, there were "some unique characteristics . . . that caused the  error." He said he could not reveal them because of the pending litigation. He  also said the teller who handled the transaction has been with the bank for  several years and is highly regarded.  </P> <P> "We feel that the customer in this case is making this claim in innocence," he  said. "He really doesn't believe that he got the money."  </P> <P> After receiving the bank's letter, Johnson immediately fired off a letter  demanding repayment of the $100. "What I don't understand," he wrote, "is why  you insist on victimizing me when you can't possibly demonstrate that I  received this money. It can't be demonstrated because it never happened."  </P> <P> When he did not receive a response, Johnson filed a suit in the Small Claims  Division of Long Beach Municipal Court asking that the money be returned. A  hearing is scheduled Feb. 27.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Customer Is 'Outraged'  </P> <P> In the meantime, Johnson is closing his account at the bank. "I am outraged,"  he said in an interview last week. "I think it's terrible what they've done.  The bank shouldn't bill customers for its own clerical errors; having such a  policy is destructive and not good business."  </P> <P> Charles Hagan, calling Johnson's response vindictive, said the bank has not  experienced a flurry of account closures as a result of the incident. "There's  nothing we can do about that kind of behavior," he said of Johnson's  determination to be a walking bad advertisement for the bank. "It's part of the  emotions that get involved in these transactions."  </P> <P> But he also said that the bank intends to vigorously defend its position to the  legal limit, including an appeal if necessary. "We will defend on principle,"  he said. "Our processes are reliable and trustworthy. There has to be some  authority in these transactions."  </P> <P> Johnson recently returned to Farmers &amp; Merchants to cash some new checks  before closing his account. However, he said that this time he brought a friend  along to act as a witness, and asked for a copy of the teller's audit tape  verifying the amount of the transaction.  </P></p>

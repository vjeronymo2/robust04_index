			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- China plans to increase  the maximum term of imprisonment for copyright violators from  five years to seven, in a revised version of a draft regulation.    This was revealed today by Wang Shuwen, deputy director of  the Law Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), at  the eighth session of the NPC Standing Committee, which opened  today.    He was speaking on the revised version of the Draft  Regulation on Penalties for Copyright Infringement, based on the  previous review by the NPC Standing Committee and opinions from  relevant government departments, localities, legal and financial  experts.    The original draft provided that people who obtain  "extremely  big sums" of illicit money from the crime, or whose crimes are  "especially serious," will be sentenced to two to five years in  prison or dealt with administratively, and/or will be fined.    The new draft changes the prison term to three to seven  years.    The former draft said that the lesser criminals of this kind  will be sentenced to less than two years in prison, and/or  fined. This ceiling is raised to three years in the latest  draft.    Wang asked the NPC Standing Committee to further review the  draft for an early promulgation.    "The draft is now basically feasible," Wang said.    The revised draft also lists what constitutes criminal  copyright violation, including pirating books, movies,  videotapes, computer software and producing and selling forged  paintings.    Wang said that the revised draft would better protect the  legal rights of the copyright owners and promote the management  of the cultural market.</p>

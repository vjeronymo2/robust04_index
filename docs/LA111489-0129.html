			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BUSY BANK BANDIT STRIKES FOR 6TH TIME  </P> <P> One of Orange County's most prolific bank robbers struck again Monday, racking  up his sixth holdup in less than a month by robbing an Orange savings and loan  association office, the FBI said.  </P> <P> The latest holdup by the man called "the Tijuana bandit" came after four  robberies on Friday committed by another bandit.  </P> <P> Despite the flurry of robberies, however, the FBI's supervisory agent in Santa  Ana said that his office finished the federal fiscal year Sept. 30 showing a  reduction in the number of bank holdups -- 254 in the 1988-89 fiscal year,  compared to 316 the previous year.  </P> <P> Agent Bucky Cox credited the formation of a team of FBI and local police,  called the Bank Robbery Apprehension Team, and the start-up of a hot line for  tipsters in Orange County (800-442-2244) as key factors.  </P> <P> In the latest holdup at about 9:50 a.m. Monday, the armed robber showed a note  demanding money to a teller at the American Savings branch at 111 Main St. in  Orange, Cox said. He left with an undisclosed amount of cash.  </P> <P> He has been dubbed the "Tijuana bandit" because of his habit of wearing a straw  hat with "Tijuana" embroidered on it. But he switched to a white, Panama-style  hat on Monday.  </P> <P> The robber wore sunglasses, a blue blazer and a white dress shirt. He was  described as middle-aged with a brown-and-gray mustache, Cox said. He is  believed responsible for five other bank robberies in Irvine, Tustin and Santa  Ana since Oct. 26.  </P> <P> A second robber hit four thrifts in quick succession Friday. Cox said that  robber was being called "the Vet," because he struck on Veterans Day.  </P> <P> The second bandit held up American Savings, 8231 La Palma Ave. in Buena Park;  the Bank of California at 11900 Brookhurst Street in Garden Grove; Central  Federal Savings at 10081 Valley View St. in Cypress, and Fullerton Savings,  1201 E. 17th St. in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The man is described as being 25 to 30 years old, 6-foot-2 and slender. He wore  jeans and a baseball cap over his light-brown, curly hair. CHRIS WOODYARD  </P></p>

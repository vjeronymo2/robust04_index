			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Deal boosts hope for early peace in Bosnia Hopes for a pre-Christmas peace settlement in Bosnia were boosted yesterday evening after an announcement by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman that Serbs and Croats had reached agreement on a three-way carve-up of Bosnia which would satisfy Moslem demands for a third of the country. Mr Tudjman was speaking after a day of talks with his Serbian counterpart, President Slobodan Milosevic. The two leaders, and their Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat proteges, had been asked to come up with a plan in line with European Union-backed peace proposals. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators for former Yugoslavia, had urged the two leaders to agree to a proposal giving the mainly Moslem republic an extra 3-4 per cent of territory, in addition to that offered under a previous plan. This would bring the republic's share of Bosnian land to one third, a demand already conceded in principle by the Serbian and Croatian sides. The EU has promised an end to economic sanctions against Serbia and economic aid for Croatia in exchange for a lasting peace settlement in Bosnia. Mr Tudjman said that, under the deal reached with Mr Milosevic - which has still to be approved by the Moslems - Bosnian Croats would receive 17.5 per cent of the territory, leaving Bosnian Serbs with slightly less than 50 per cent of the former Yugoslav re-public. Mr Mate Boban, Bosnian Croat leader, also told reporters that Croats would satisfy Moslem demands for access to the Adriatic Sea. The Croat side had offered the Moslems land on the Prevlaca peninsula. But the offer was rejected by the Bosnian government yesterday. Its spokesman noted that the peninsula was more than 100km from the proposed Moslem republic. The government has demanded land near Neum, further north on the Adriatic coast. The talks are due to move to Brussels today, where they will be joined by EU foreign ministers. Meanwhile, the UN yesterday suspended its humanitarian airlift to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, after one of its aircraft was hit by machinegun fire. In Serbia President Milosevic's Socialists announced they had won 122 of 250 parliamentary seats contested in weekend elections, with 90 per cent of the votes counted. But party officials privately predicted that they would capture 126 seats, which would give them an absolute majority.</p>

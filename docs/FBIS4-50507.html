			<p>BFN     [Text] May 23 will mark the 43rd anniversary of the  peaceful liberation of Tibet. A spokesman for the United Front  Work Department of the CPC Central Committee recently spoke to a  XINHUA reporter on development and construction in the Tibet  Autonomous Region and the central government's policy on the  Dalai Lama.    Question [Q]: What major changes have taken place in Tibet  over the past 43 years?    Answer [A]: On May 23, 1951, the central government and  local Tibetan government signed a 17-article agreement on the  peaceful liberation of Tibet that effectively made it a reality.    The peaceful liberation of Tibet was a major component of  the  emancipation cause of the Chinese people. Since then, Tibetans,  like members of other nationalities in China, have fully enjoyed  equal rights and embarked on the road to freedom and happiness.    Over the past 43 years, Tibet has undergone tremendous  changes, from backward serfdom to modernization. The 1 million  serfs have become masters of their own destiny, while large  numbers of Tibetan workers, intellectuals and cadres have become  mature and taken up the task of building and managing Tibet.    With the support of the central government and the  assistance  of other provinces and cities, as well as through the efforts of  Tibetan people, Tibet has scored great achievements in various  fields.    Last year, Tibet hit an all-time high in its grain  production  by harvesting a yield of 620,000 tons, and the number of large  domestic livestock rose to 23.2 million. Its modern industry,  which started from scratch, registered a total output value of  470 million yuan, (US$54 million), and its energy, transport  and telecommunications facilities improved markedly.    In the meantime, traditional Tibetan culture has been  promoted, and gigantic progress has been made in the fields of  education, science, culture and public health. Living standards  for Tibetans have risen substantially, and the Tibetan  population has soared to 2 million, double the 1950 figure.    Policies of the Party and the government on nationalities  and  religion enjoy wholehearted support from Tibetans and patriotic  personages from all walks of life in the region.    To date, Tibet is presenting a picture of vitality and  prosperity.    Tibetans have made great contributions to maintaining the  unity of the motherland and among all nationalities and to the  country's modernization drive.    In the future efforts of reform, opening up and  establishment  of a socialist market economy, the central government will  continue to pursue policies conducive to Tibet's economic growth  and improvement of the living standards for Tibetans. It will  continue to mobilize people of all nationalities in China to  assist Tibet in speeding up its development. It will combine  its policy to assist Tibet with the region's self-development  efforts and gear its economic assistance to the overall  situation of reform so as to enhance the strength, vitality and  sustained power of Tibet for development, thus achieving common  prosperity.    Q: It is a historical fact that Tibet is an inseparable part  of China. However, the Dalai Lama remains in exile and engages  in activities which aim to split the country. What are the  policies of the central government toward the Dalai Lama? Have  there been any changes in them?    A: The basic position and attitude of the central government  toward the Dalai Lama and his followers have been clear and  consistent, and they remain unchanged.    As long as the Dalai Lama recognizes that Tibet is an  inseparable part of China, completely abandons his idea of  independence of Tibet and stops engaging in activities to split  the motherland, the central government will welcome an earlier  end to his life in exile and greet his return to China to  contribute to the unification of the motherland, national unity  and Tibetan economic development and perform something good for  the prosperity and happiness of the Tibetan people.    In 1979, Deng Xiaoping made it clear to a private  representative of the Dalai Lama that "the issue of fundamental  importance is that Tibet is a part of China. That is the  criterion with which to judge what is right and what is wrong".    When answering questions from a reporter of XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY on May 19, 1991, Premier Li Peng reiterated the central  government's policy, "there is only one fundamental principle,  that is, Tibet is an inseparable part of China. There is no  room for bargaining on that point. The central government has  always been ready to hold talks with the Dalai Lama, but he must  stop engaging in activities to split the motherland and change  his position on so-called independence of Tibet. Negotiations  can be held on any questions, but not on the independence of  Tibet."    These policies of the central government remain unchanged.    The issue of Tibet is China's internal affair. Any attempt  to internationalize the issue of Tibet will not succeed and will  be firmly opposed by the Chinese people.    Q: According to foreign news media, the Dalai Lama recently  claimed on separate occasions that he has made maximum  concessions in a series of initiatives and proposals in line  with the framework for negotiations which defines that all  questions except the independence of Tibet can be negotiated.  Is that true?    A: It would be a great advance if the Dalai Lama had  genuinely abandoned his stand for the independence of Tibet.  But it is regrettable that we have seen no signs of such  progress so far.    The Dalai Lama has never recognized that Tibet is an  inseparable part of China since he went into exile, neither has  he stopped his activities to split the motherland.    His claims and proposals have continually centered on his  stand for the independence of Tibet. Even recently, he still  referred to Tibet as a captive nation, saying "I firmly  believe... we will eventually lead our captive nation to freedom  and peace in dignity". His so-called concessions are nothing but  an adjustment in his tactics. In essence, he still sticks to  his stand for the independence of Tibet.    Q: It is said that the central government has made  painstaking efforts to negotiate with the Dalai Lama. But the  Dalai Lama has alleged on many occasions that the central  government is unwilling to talk with him. What are the real  facts?    A: Up to now, the Dalai Lama has not abandoned his stand for  the independence of Tibet. This is the largest obstacle to  negotiations.    The central government has made genuine efforts to help  bring  about negotiation and urge the Dalai Lama and his followers to  abandon their position for the independence of Tibet and return  to China. All these endeavors have fully demonstrated the  sincerity and patience of the central government.    Since 1979, related departments of the central government  have on many occasions received the Dalai Lama's private  representatives and listened attentively to their reports of the  Dalai Lama's intentions. Some of them were met by leading  members of the central government.    When the Bainqen Lama died in early 1989, Zhao Puchu,  president of the China Buddhist Association, personally handed a  letter to the private representative of the Dalai Lama, inviting  him home to attend the mourning activities.    Such an invitation, coming out of pure religious motives,  could have been an excellent opportunity for the Dalai Lama to  meet with members of domestic Buddhist circles after spending  over 30 years in exile. However, the Dalai Lama turned it down.    In the latter half of 1989, in the wake of the changes in  global situation, the Dalai Lama suspended contacts with the  central government. In the same year, he brazenly divided China  into several parts, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia and  Manchuria, in a map used in his book Freedom in Exile.    Since China's domestic situation had not turned in the  direction the Dalai Lama had anticipated, in 1992, he asked to  resume contacts with the central government. Relevant central  government departments received his private representatives on  two occasions in 1992 and 1993.    The reason the central government has not publicized its  contacts and talks over the past 10-odd years with the private  representatives of the Dalai Lama is that departments involved  have made it clear to the Dalai Lama's private representatives  at each of their meetings that the present contacts between the  two sides are still secret associations which should not be made  public. The Dalai Lama's private representatives also have  agreed not to release details of the talks. But it is  regrettable that the Dalai Lama's side has broken its promises  time and again. It not only publicized these contacts, but also  distorted what had been said at the talks, in an attempt to  mislead the public.    Q: Why have the bilateral contacts not produced any results?    A: The reason that past contacts did not yield fruit and  negotiations cannot commence lies in the fact that the Dalai  Lama's side has not yet reached a common understanding with us  on the fundamental issue that Tibet is an inseparable part of  China. They have even referred to this cardinal principle  adhered to by the central government as a precondition and  obstacle to negotiations. We never think this is the case but  see it as the basis and guarantee for the success of  negotiations.    Q: It Is evident that the responsibility for inability to  hold negotiations lies with the side of the Dalai Lama. Is  there any possibility for progress of the Dalai Lama's side  continues to refuse to budge from its original position?    A: In China, there is a saying which goes: "When the melon  is ripe it falls off its stem; where water flows, a channel is  formed." This means that when conditions are ripe, success will  naturally follow.    Everything has its own law of development, and some matters  will not become obvious nor be widely perceived if they have not  reached a certain stage. The central government will continue  its efforts with full sincerity and patience. After all, the  Dalai Lama is a Chinese citizen. We hope that in his remaining  years, the Dalai Lama will abandon his stand for the  independence of Tibet, end his life in exile and return to the  motherland.    Negotiation is the only appropriate way to resolve this  problem. We hope that the Dalai Lama will size up the  situation, go with the tide of historical development and make  the right choice.</p>

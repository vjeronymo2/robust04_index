			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Books: The battle against grey - Lynn MacRitchie enjoys a very personal Jarman production CHROMA by Derek Jarman Century Pounds 15.99, 151 pages A writer afflicted with Aids, a painter who now can but dimly see, a film maker who sometimes these days cannot focus his own eyes, Derek Jarman has chosen in his latest film and now his latest book to contemplate the phenomenon of colour. Chroma, printed in sober black on white and deliberately unillustrated, does not attempt to saturate the reader in the essence of its subject, as his film Blue did in a grand and glorious gesture. Research for the Blue Concert in Kyoto, he explains, had thrown him 'deep into the spectrum,' and in Chroma he shares the fruits of his labour. This is no list of simple facts, however. Chroma is a typical Jarman production - personal above all, mixing anecdotes of daily life with selected gems from the writings of ancient and modern scholars, scientists and artists, all on the subject of colour. In its pages, colours are celebrated above all for the complexity of their actions on the senses, the myriad ways in which they become manifest, entwined with human activity, inevitably eliciting emotional and irrational responses. The section headings encapsulate this, the mundanity of familiar concepts - 'White Lies', 'On Seeing Red', 'Grey Matter', 'Green Fingers', 'A Purple Passage' - exploded in the unpredictable sparkle of the text. Jarman's has been a life of colour, alive for him as it must be for all painters, the foremost object of their attention and perennial subject of their enquiry. The love of colour, however, could not save it, or its disciple, from a battle against grey. 'Grey was the colour of the Slade,' he writes, where Jarman's tutor claimed to know nothing of 'modern colour' and said almost nothing about his pupil's work. But in his shared student flat, a tide of white washed away the pastels of the 1950s and opened the door for the rainbow coloured dazzle of hippy graphics, white being, after all, the representative of light 'without which no colour can be seen,' as Leonardo wrote. Jarman is not in search of theoretical purity, preferring books in which the authors 'put themselves and their prejudices into their writing,' as he himself does so engagingly. He likes Pliny especially for writing, 'In the good old days painting was an art,' and mourning the cult of expensive materials over quality of work. In the section on red, Jarman links his love of colour to his love of gardens, another sustaining passion from his childhood. 'Red first shouted at me from a bed of pelargoniums . . . I was four.' Later he tells us, 'My red pelargoniums, the colour of flaming June, have never died. Each autumn, I take cuttings, and though they are confined to a few flower pots, when I look at them I see the past. Other colours change . . . but the red is constant . . .' His mother's red cheeks, red lips, painting his nails with her red nail polish, his father shouting at him, red in the face, his father who did not want him to be a sissy. Later, the world of sex was also red, red light districts, red lights on police cars, caught red handed . . . And now the red is that of hospitals, this part of the book written on a hospital drip and dedicated to the doctors and nurses at Barts. 'I know my colours are not yours,' Jarman writes. 'Context changes the way we perceive them,' just as the context of the writing of this book inevitably turns it from an amusing bricollage to a gesture of extraordinary generosity, a tribute to the continuing need to create and communicate on the very edge of darkness.</p>

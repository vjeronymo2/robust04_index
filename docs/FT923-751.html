			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): BES losses I BOUGHT Pounds 5,000 worth of shares in a BES company on March 5 1986 (ie. under the old regulations). I received income tax relief on the whole of my investment at the top rate of income tax which applied at that time. The company was wound up on April 7 1992: no dividends were ever paid and the disposal proceeds were nil. Am I entitled to any capital loss relief on the original investment or on the net cost after tax relief? Is any indexation due? On the facts outlined, the answer is no. Section 150(3) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says: 'The sums allowable as deductions from the consideration in the computation for the purposes of capital gains tax of the gain or loss accruing to an individual on the disposal of shares issued before March 19 1986 in respect of which relief has been given and not withdrawn shall be determined without regard to that relief, except that where those sums exceed the consideration they shall be reduced by an amount equal to a) the amount of that relief; or b) the excess whichever is the less, but the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a disposal falling within section 58(1).' So, as you will see, the cost of your shareholding for CGT purposes is Pounds 5,000 - Pounds 5,000 = NIL on which indexation can be claimed.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

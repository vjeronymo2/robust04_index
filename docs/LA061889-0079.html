			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $96 TICKET THAT POLICE GAVE TO YOUNG BICYCLIST  </P> <P> Re "The 15-Year-Old Bicyclist Who Got a $96 Ticket" by Joanne Thomas (June 11):  </P> <P> Isn't it a shame that Mrs. Thomas is "outraged with the Irvine Police  Department" for issuing a ticket to her son for failure to stop his bike at a  stop sign? What does she think a stop sign is for? Why does she condone his  breaking of the law? What message is she giving him by "fighting in court" when  she knows he is guilty?  </P> <P> You break the law, you pay! And whose fault is it that she must take "time off  from work and valuable court time" to fight this heinous crime? This woman  needs help in positive parenting. I would never condone my children's behavior  in a similar situation.  </P> <P> B. WALL  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

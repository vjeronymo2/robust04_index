			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roberto Morejon commentary from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] Soon, Cuban unions will start debating the need to  implement policies to reorganize national finances and to  increase efficiency in all economic sectors. The fact that  485,000 grass-roots leaders are the first to receive training to  better organize discussions at work centers reflects the labor  leadership's interest in [words indistinct]. Workers will voice  their opinions on the viability of planned economic measures at  open and democratic assemblies. The implementation of such  measures or others has been postponed until a national consensus  is reached.    In recent years, the population has created an excess cash  flow that amounts to 10 billion pesos because of a smaller  product supply. This resulted in a lack of motivation, work  inefficiency, and a thriving black market.    In addition, the state operated with a budget deficit  estimated at 4.2 billion pesos by late 1993 because expenditures  exceeded treasury revenues. The financing of education, health,  and social security increased the budget deficit because Cuba  did not have access to international loans.    Cuban workers, therefore, will voice their opinions on the  best ways to reorganize national finances, such as the  possibility of establishing a tax system and reducing or  eliminating subsidies for family basket products and channeling  those funds to people who have lower incomes.    At union assemblies supported by their leadership, Cuban  workers will suggest ways to face current irregularities, such  as the fraudulent accumulation of personal wealth. Cuban unions  will also discuss the fact that certain workers are not working  as efficiently as their positions require. Meanwhile, there are  people who reach legal employment age but turn down job offers  because they think such jobs do not match their educational  level.    Cuban unions will also discuss costs, profitability,  efficiency, and productivity at these meetings, which seek to  become another forum for collective reflection, just as the  Cuban parliament already is.</p>

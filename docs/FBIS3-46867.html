The first mission  will involve 84 U.S. experts in the largest such mission since  searches began in 1988.    The commander of the U.S. expert team, Major General Needham  said that he was satisfied with the progress obtained during his  mission in Vietnam. Mr. Needham did not believe that the  Vietnamese Government still keeps the remains.    The commander-in-chief for the U.S. Asia-Pacific Command,  Admiral Charles Larson will visit Vietnam from 16 to 19 January  for discussions on MIA. Larson is scheduled to meet officials  from the American Office of MIA in Hanoi as well as Vietnamese  officials and the team of American experts searching for MIA in  Southern Vietnam.    The next joint search operation between Americans and  Vietnamese, which is to start today in Vietnam, will last three  weeks. Other separate operation will begin in Laos on 12  January. Moreover, four U.S. congressional delegations are  expected in Vietnam through the end of January whose experts  arrived in Hanoi on Saturday.</p>

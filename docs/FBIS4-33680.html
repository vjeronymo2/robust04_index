			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded; from the NTV </F> newscast]    [Text] With five days to go until the beginning of the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Cartagena de Indias is the stage  of intense preparation work.    The Ibero-American Justice Ministers Meeting in Cartagena is  analyzing judicial cooperation, measures to fight organized  crime, and family welfare. The goal is to put law and justice to  the service of integration through cooperation accords.    [Andres Martinez, Colombian minister of justice; identified  by caption] "Integration can be devoid of content if it is not  accompanied by precise judicial norms. Normative dispersion can  become an acute obstacle for progress in the field of  integration."    Regarding this meeting, Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat  pointed out Cuba's potential contribution to the meeting.    [Amat] "We have brought the example of our organization  regarding subjects that I believe are extremely important: the  family; the problem of abandoned children; the problem of  adoption. These issues are included in the summit. We have  significant experience in these fields."    Amat also spoke about the interest that these issues might  spark among participants in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit.    [Amat] "The repercussions these might have lie basically in  acceptance by the states involved in the results of this work,  the search for a common denominator in the legal and legislative  character to make law the guiding force in relations among  countries, and of course, to seek by this path a strengthening  of ties and greater integration, which is the end goal."    Cuban Ambassador Jesus Martinez described the relations  between the two nations as satisfactory. He made these  statements during a solidarity meeting with Cuba held in  Barranquilla and attended by representatives of unions and the  Colombian Workers Federation.    [Martinez] "The Colombian Government has taken the step of  reestablishing ties with Cuba. It seems to us that it is only  fair that we see this step as positive."    Cuba and Colombia reestablished diplomatic and commercial  ties in October 1990, and between January and April 1994, Cuban  imports topped the list of Colombia's imports. These exports  have grown 16-fold in this quarter and totalled $21 million.  Colombia imports Cuban steel, salt, generic medicine, vaccine,  and biotechnology products.    Regarding negotiations for Colombian oil, Ambassador  Martinez  explained:    [Martinez] "The procedure is established. There is political  will, but as of now, there is no accord to conduct this type of  project. We do think that either now or later, by direct  purchase or through oil refining, we have the technical  conditions and possibilities to develop this type of relation."    During the meeting, the Colombian union leaders expressed  interest in the Cuban reality and their support for Cuba.    [Unidentified speaker] "Viva socialist Cuba! [Crowd: Viva!]  Viva socialist Cuba! [repeats] [Crowd: Viva!] Down with the  economic blockade of Cuba! [Crowd: Down with it!] Viva the unity  of the Colombian people! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the unity of the  Cuban people! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the solidarity of the Cuban  and Colombian peoples! [Crowd: Viva!] Fighting united! [Crowd:  We will win!] Fighting united! [Crowd: We will win!] [repeats].</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Ending an eleventh-hour political and legal drama that threatened to postpone  San Diego's City Council elections, the city and the Chicano Federation reached  an out-of-court settlement of the federation's lawsuit, thus allowing the first  district-only council election since the City Charter was adopted in 1931. U.S.  District Judge John S. Rhoades tentatively accepted a settlement of the  class-action suit aimed at increasing the council's size and altering the way  district boundaries are drawn. Rhoades had promised to hold hearings Monday on  the federation's call for postponement of today's election if the two sides  were unable to settle the 20-month-old suit.  </P></p>

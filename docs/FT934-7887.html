			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Cambridgeshire County Council votes to ban cycles from two pedestrian streets Cambridgeshire County Council has voted to ban cyclists from two central pedestrian streets in Cambridge. Cycle City, as it is known to CB enthusiasts, will no longer welcome bicycles between 10am and 4pm, on Sydney Street, a shopping thoroughfare, and Market Street (above). A survey showed that while 2,800 pedestrians used Sydney Street per hour, so did 430 cyclists. The ban, designed to improve safety and enhance the environment for shoppers, has split public opinion, both between town and gown and between the main parties. The Labour-controlled city council is against the ban, while the Labour group on county council supported the Tories, who introduced an experimental ban in the summer of 1991.</p>

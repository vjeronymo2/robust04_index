			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> HESELTINE SEEKS THATCHER POST  </P> <P> Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine today announced a bid to oust  Margaret Thatcher from the British premiership she has held for 11 years and  rejected criticism that it was wrong to force the contest during the Persian  Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Heseltine, 57 and a self-made millionaire, said he would run against the "Iron  Lady" in a ballot beginning Tuesday for the leadership of the ruling  Conservative Party.  </P> <P> Whoever wins will be prime minister. Aides said Thatcher, 65, is "determined to  fight and win." But some politicians said she is fighting for her political  life.  </P> <P> A first ballot of elected Conservative legislators is scheduled for Tuesday,  when Thatcher will be in Paris for a 34-nation European summit. Heseltine is  not expected to win outright. He would need 159 of 372 votes to force a second  ballot, if all legislators voted.  </P></p>

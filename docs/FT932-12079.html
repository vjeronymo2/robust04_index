			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / OFT may refer compact disc industry for inquiry THE UK music industry was taken aback yesterday by hints that the Office of Fair Trading may soon refer the compact disc industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The strong indications came from Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, during an ill-tempered House of Commons hearing into the high price of compact discs. Sir Bryan told the national heritage committee that he still had an open mind on whether the UK music industry operated a complex monopoly on CDs. He added, however: 'What I can say is there is enough information there to make me concerned about the situation.' Last July Sir Bryan announced that he was reopening the inquiry into CD prices only three months after Sir Gordon Borrie, his predecessor, said there were no grounds for an MMC inquiry. Sir Bryan said yesterday that the lower price of CDs in the US had persuaded him the issue needed to be examined again: 'One has to accept that sometimes different directors-general, while applying the same policy, will reach different conclusions.' Matters that needed to be explored, he said, included restrictions on the CD imports from the US and whether contracts between artists and music companies created 'a limited monopoly situation'. Sir Bryan said he would announce his decision in two to three weeks. His evidence to the committee was preceded by sharp and occasionally raucous exchanges between MPs and music company officials. Statements by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the committee's Labour chairman, that the industry was engaged in a 'rip-off' were greeted with shouts of 'disgusting' by music executives in the audience. The attack on the industry was an all-party affair, with Conservative MPs Mr Toby Jessel and Mr John Gorst adding their criticism of CD prices. Mr Kaufman's previous elaborate courtesy wore thin as Mr Rupert Perry, UK chief executive of EMI Records, and Mr Maurice Oberstein, executive vice-president of PolyGram and chairman of the British Phonographic Industry, said lower prices would jepordise investment in new talent and the health of the UK music industry. Mr Kaufman regaled his audience with accounts of his CD buying in both the UK and the US. When Mr Oberstein, the New Yorker who has become the UK industry's most senior and colourful figure, said: 'I don't think making profits is a dirty word,' Mr Kaufman retorted: 'I spend a disproportionate part of my parliamentary salary contributing to your profits.' As the two repeatedly interrupted one another, Mr Kaufman said it would be preferable if each spoke in turn rather than conducting a 'kind of duet'. Mr Kaufman added they sounded 'rather like one of Sondheim's more complex works'. A music executive complained to a neighbour that addressing the committee was like 'talking to nursery school children'.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Novell warns on earnings NOVELL, the US computer software company, warned that third-quarter European sales were weaker than it had anticipated and it expected earnings per share for the period to be flat relative to 1992. Analysts had expected earnings per share of around 27 cents, but some cut their forecasts to around 23 cents, against the 21 cents the company registered in the third quarter of last year. Novell, which is based in Utah and specialises in software to link computers in local area networks, recently acquired Unix System Laboratories from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. It said that because of the European weakness it expected total third-quarter revenue, including about Dollars 8m from Unix System Laboratories, to be roughly flat with its second quarter.</p>

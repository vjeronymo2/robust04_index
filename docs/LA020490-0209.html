			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHO OWNS THE BOWERS MUSEUM?  </P> <P> The city of Santa Ana ran the Bowers Museum for 51 years until 1987, when it  appointed the nonprofit Charles W. Bowers Museum Corp. to manage the  institution's day-to-day affairs. The city still owns the museum and gives it  an annual $1-million stipend, but the eventual goal is to make the corporation  support itself.  </P> <P> Meanwhile -- "inadvertently," according to Bowers board President Arthur V.  Strock -- "there were some clauses in the agreement between the board and the  city that puts long-term grants at peril. (In 2008), all the assets of the  museum, present and future, revert to city ownership. . . .  </P> <P> "It's hard to go to an individual or institution and say, 'Gee, we'd like you  to give us $1 million to build a gallery or to buy a painting, with the  knowledge that we can't assure control of it for the indefinite future. It was  a mistake on everybody's part."  </P> <P> City Atty. Edward J. Cooper, however, said the agreement between the city and  the Bowers Corp. "protects the continuing operation of the museum" by providing  "an incentive for the corporation to prove itself."  </P> <P> The 20-year agreement works like this, Cooper said:  </P> <P> For the first 10 years, the Bowers receives the same operating budget from the  city (basically, the amount it received in 1987, plus a cost-of-living  adjustment). For the succeeding 10 years, the city handout will be reduced by  10% yearly, until the museum is running completely on money from other sources.  </P> <P> If the corporation is unable to run the museum, control will revert to the  city.  </P> <P> Cooper said the city "would probably know by the 15th year whether or not the  Bowers was able to stand on its own two feet. I think it's reasonable to say  that the Bowers Corp. would then receive a very long-term lease" from the city.  </P> <P> But in the meantime, Cooper added, donors should have no qualms about the  long-term future of their gifts. A donor may specify that any gift be used only  by the Bowers Corp. and that it be returned if the museum reverts to city  control.  </P> <P> "We would encourage donors to become actively involved," he said, "and simply  make that a term or condition of the donation."

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Bulls ride roughshod over doubters - The Emerging Investor 'If making money is a sin . . . welcome to hell,' reads an advertising sign in Bombay proclaiming the virtues of stock market investment. All over the city there are people taking the message to heart - from the crowds milling in the narrow streets around the Bombay Stock Exchange, to the foreign investment bankers who have taken up residence in the luxury hotels. Bombay is in the midst of its biggest stock market investment boom in over two years. The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading shares has risen by about 35 per cent since early May to reach a new all-time high last Wednesday of 4,588.18. The previous record of 4,546 was set in April 1992, at the peak of a rally which collapsed when it emerged that the market was being fuelled by suspected illegal share-financing operations organised by Mr Harshad Mehta, a leading stockbroker. The ensuing Rs40bn (Dollars 12.75bn) scandal cast a cloud over Bombay's financial markets that is only now beginning to lift. The most bullish stockbrokers are certain that the index is now in sight of 5,000. The more cautious point out that the market has already risen by more than 70 per cent since its low of 2,633 in the middle of last year, and is riding for a fall. But those who think a correction is overdue are in the minority. The bulls' case is built on a strong revival in the economy. Three years after the start of economic reform in 1991 plunged much of Indian industry into a prolonged recession, there are signs that many companies are recovering. In the year to March 1994, exports grew 22 per cent. The first few months of 1994-95 have seen a pick-up in domestic demand, particularly for consumer goods, and this should be sustained, given that the monsoon seems to have distributed ample rains. Moreover, the bulls expect interest rates to fall by about 1 percentage point when the Reserve Bank of India sets monetary policy later this month for the October-March half-year. This would bring minimum commercial lending rates to 14 per cent, compared with a high of 19 per cent in 1991-92. All this, say the bulls, is feeding growth in corporate profits, which rose 75 per cent at the net level in 1993-94 and are forecast by stockbrokers to increase a further 40 to 50 per cent in the current year. According to the bulls, these increases justify current price/earnings multiples for leading shares, which trade at about 53 times their net earnings for 1993-94, and 35 times likely earnings for 1994-95. The bears do not deny that the economic outlook is better than at any time in the past three years. But they believe that in their rush to buy, investors have pushed share prices far beyond levels justified by economic logic. 'Prices are simply outrageous,' says Mr Pradip Shah, managing director of Crisil, a credit rating agency. 'The economy is good but it's not that good.' Mr R Balakrishnan, senior vice president at DSP Financial Consultants, a securities company, argues that the rate of profits growth has been exaggerated by one-off technical changes, including the liberalisation of foreign exchange rules and in accountancy regulations covering depreciation. 'Underlying profits growth is moderate,' he says. He and other bears warn that shares are being driven up mainly by the flood of money entering a market which is too small to cope. Domestic investors' appetites have been whetted by the sight of foreign fund managers, who were allowed into India only in late 1992, chasing Indian stocks. Even although the total market capitalisation of the Bombay market is now nearly Dollars 150bn, daily turnover is quite low - below Dollars 100m - because so little stock is freely traded. The families that control most listed companies typically hold 25 to 75 per cent of the issued capital. Other long-term holders such as development banks are also infrequent sellers. Very little is left for foreign fund managers and other new investors to buy. The difficulties in acquiring shares are accentuated by the cumbersome trading, settlement and transfer procedures, which mean it can take six weeks for sellers to receive payment and three months for buyers to secure full ownership of their stock. Although stockbrokers and bankers are trying to improve the process, they only expect dramatic changes after the Bombay Stock Exchange and the newly-formed National Stock Exchange launch computerised on-screen trading, and a computerised share depositary is established to handle share transfers smoothly. On-screen trading on the NSE could start this year for top stocks and on the BSE next summer, but a fully-fledged depositary is two or three years away. These difficulties have already persuaded some foreign fund managers to slow their purchases of Indian stock or to switch to the Euroequity issues of Indian companies. After averaging Dollars 251m a month in the first half of 1994, net foreign buying of Indian equity fell to Dollars 89m in July and Dollars 80m in August. Given that many investment funds dedicated to India have yet to invest, this slowdown is likely to be temporary, but it shows that fund managers are paying heed to price levels. They are also diversifying their purchases from the large capitalisation stocks, which tend to trade on the highest multiples, to smaller issues, where price/earnings ratios are as low as 10. Mr Shah believes that this is where the best value is now to be found in the market - but it is also where the problems of acquiring stock are the greatest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Friday   Week on week change Stock                          Country    2/9/94      Dollars    %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Int.

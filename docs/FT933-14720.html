			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Observer: Gone missing? It's hard to believe, but it sounds as if something rather important may be missing from the new Battle of Britain memorial atop the white cliffs of Dover. The granite statue of a young pilot, which was unveiled last Friday with a minimum of publicity by the Queen Mother, is meant to be a permanent tribute to those who served in the most famous air battle of the Second World War. Although it has taken some time to raise the money, there is no shortage of big names on the Battle of Britain memorial trust notepaper. Robin Leigh-Pemberton, who stepped down as governor of the Bank of England at the start of the month, is patron, air chief marshall Sir Christopher Foxley-Norris is president, and the trustees include defence minister Jonathan Aitken and Lord Tebbitt, a former chairman of the Conservative Party. Hence it could be rather embarrassing for all involved if a couple of famous names really have gone missing. According to one old airman who attended the ceremony, squadron leader Boleslaw Drobinski, the badges of the 302 and 303 Polish squadrons are not among the 66 squadrons which decorate the memorial. The 303 squadron, which Drobinski commanded, was probably the most famous of all foreign squadrons serving with the RAF. Hard to believe that such a high-falutin' lot could have committed quite such a resounding faux-pas.</p>

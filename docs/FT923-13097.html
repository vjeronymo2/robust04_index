			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Blue Arrow jury had 'understood the issues' THERE is no evidence that the length or complexity of the year-long Blue Arrow fraud trial caused the jury any difficulty, the Court of Appeal was told yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, who brought the prosecution for the Serious Fraud Office, told the court that all the available evidence, notably questions asked by the jury throughout the trial, demonstrated they had understood the issues involved. Mr Purnell defended his decision to maintain a large indictment against the defendants - a move defence lawyers have alleged led to the trial becoming unmanageably and unfairly large. Mr Jonathan Cohen, Mr David Reed, Mr Nicholas Wells, all former County NatWest executives, and Mr Martin Gibbs, a former UBS Phillips &amp; Drew director, are appealing against their convictions of conspiracy to defraud. The appeal continues.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM angered by revolt over MPs' allowances DOWNING STREET yesterday made known the prime minister's anger at the outcome of the Commons vote on MPs' allowances in the early hours that led to a government defeat - the first of his premiership. Mr Major watched as Conservative backbenchers defied ministerial pleas for restraint in a vote giving MPs a 38 per cent increase office expenses - Pounds 7,000 higher than the recommended figure. The government feels the rebellion, costing some Pounds 8m, would send the wrong signals to business and the public sector at a time when modest pay increases were being sought to keep the downward pressure on inflation. Some ministers, including Mr Major, are expected to forego the increases as an example to their colleagues. Coming in the wake of the prime minister's intervention last week to allow top public servants only 4 per cent against the up to 24 per cent recommended by a pay review body, the vote provoked grumbling among Whitehall civil servants whose pay claims have been held down. Officials said that Mr Major had made a point of being present for the vote and regarded the government's proposal of a 14 per cent increase to Pounds 33,190 in MPs allowances as 'generous' in the prevailing economic climate. Several Conservative MPs were unrepentant, however, claiming that the increase now approved - taking total allowances from Pounds 28,986 to just under Pounds 40,000 - was necessary to meet growing workloads. They reiterated the point that the new money would meet the costs of hiring equipment and staff and should not be confused with a salary rise. However, several MPs admitted that some of the increase would be enjoyed by their wives, who worked in the Commons as secretaries. Another countered that the real impact of the increase would be felt as helping provide new infrastructure and equipment for campaigning in constituencies. 'In effect, it is a state subsidy of the political parties by the backdoor,' he said. 'I opposed the rise but I will have to take it or my opponents will have the better of me.'</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Platinum leads precious metals lower PLATINUM LED a general retreat of precious metals prices yesterday after hopes were raised of tension easing in South Africa, by far the biggest producer of the white metal, by the African National Congress's expression of willingness to hold talks with the government. Earlier in the week grave concern about racial unrest in the South African homelands had lifted the platinum price to the highest level for four weeks. Monday's violence in Ciskei was reflected in a Dollars 2.80-a-troy-ounce rise and further gains were prompted in mid-week by fears that threatened mass action by the ANC might disrupt the Bophuthatswana operation of Impala, South Africa's second biggest producer of platinum. Those fears helped to push the price to Dollars 364.15 and ounce in London before profit-taking was encouraged late on Wednesday by assurances from the country's biggest producers that they were not expecting output to be affected. The selling continued on Thursday and quickened yesterday with the added encouragement of the ANC statement and the dollar's improved fortunes on the foreign exchanges. In the afternoon the London platinum price was fixed at Dollars 356.25 an ounce, Dollars 4.85 below Thursday's level and 95 cents down on the week. Though the gold market remained technically weak its price followed platinum's early rise, albeit at a respectful distance. What remained of those gains were wiped out yesterday, however, and the price closed on the London bullion market at Dollars 340.25 an ounce, down Dollars 1.25 on the week. Silver was noticeably weaker than the other precious metals throughout week and after falling 6.5 cents yesterday the London price closed at 369.5 cents an ounce, down 6.5 cents on balance. Base metals prices were mostly lower at the London Metal Exchange, led by copper, which breached with unexpected ease support at the equivalent of Dollars 2,420 a tonne for three months delivery. Traders attributed the market's weakness to continuing concern about the world economy's slowness to emerge from the recession, liquidation of Chinese long positions and increased shipments from Russia. In sterling terms copper appeared to finish the week with its tail up, gaining Pounds 25.50 in the three months position yesterday to reach Pounds 1,267.75 a tonne, down Pounds 9.75 on the week. But the rally was entirely attributable to the continuing dollar rally. In terms of that currency the three months position was down Dollars 16.50 on the day and Dollars 111.50 on the week at Dollars 2,397.50 a tonne. Traders said the next downside chart objective was Dollars 2,380 a tonne. The currency factor had no such cushioning effect on the dollar-denominated LME nickel market. The three months position was marginally steadier during the second half of the week but still ended Dollars 142.50 down on balance at Dollars 7,012.50 a tonne. Twice it had touched a 2 1/2 -year low of Dollars 6,915 a tonne as sentiment was undermined by depressed fundamentals and negative technical factors, which encouraged speculators to liquidate long positions. Some producer support was noted, as well as modest Chinese buying, but this was insufficient to reverse the trend. Zinc prices joined in the general downtrend this week, as the supply squeeze worries that had been bolstering them appeared to ease. After breaching support at Dollars 1,380 a tonne on Tuesday the three months price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,341 a tonne, down Dollars 51.50 on the week, and the cash premium - a reflection of the squeeze fears - narrowed from Dollars 44.25 to Dollars 24 a tonne. Dealers warned, however, that the zinc market remained vulnerable to renewed supply tightness in the final quarter of this year, which is attributed to options-related operations by a group of producers and a leading trade house. Coffee prices at the London Futures and Options Exchange began the week with a continuation of last week's rise but quickly fell under the influence of a depressed New York market. Concern about oversupply of the arabica coffee variety traded in New York helped to push the September futures price there below the psychologically-important 50 cents a lb mark at one point. Oversupply is not at present a problem for the London's robusta coffee market but, as often happens, sympathetic pains caused it to abandon its upward course and the November position closed yesterday at Dollars 769 a tonne, down Dollars 19 on the week.  ------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium   -2,025 to 1,359,000 Copper      +1,700 to   278,800 Lead        +2,075 to   156,725 Nickel        +486 to    44,388 Zinc          +325 to   353,625 Tin           -195 to    14,735  ------------------------------------</p>

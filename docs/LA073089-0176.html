			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A 64 BOOSTS STEWART INTO LEAD IN MICHIGAN  </P> <P> Payne Stewart, displaying the skills that have made him one of the PGA Tour's  top money-winners, shot an eight-under-par 64 Saturday for a one-stroke lead  over Hal Sutton in the $1-million Buick Open golf tournament at Grand Blanc,  Mich.  </P> <P> Stewart was at 14-under-par 202 after three rounds on the 7,014-yard course at  Warwick Hills.  </P> <P> Sutton, co-leader with Doug Tewell after two rounds, shot a 68. Sutton could  have tied Stewart, but his 20-foot birdie attempt at No. 18 stopped inches  short.  </P> <P> Stewart started the third round three strokes behind the leaders but birdied  five of the first seven holes to make the turn at 11 under par.  </P> <P> Stewart got to 14 under par with a birdie on No. 16, a 580-yard, par-five hole.  He lost a shot with a bogey on the par-three 17th, then got it back with a  seven-iron shot from behind a tree that led to a four-foot birdie putt on the  final hole.  </P> <P> Sutton sandwiched a bogey between two birdies and made the turn at 10 under  par. But three birdies on the back side kept him in the chase for his first PGA  Tour victory since 1986.  </P> <P> Tewell shot a 70 and was at 205.  </P> <P> Vicki Fergon, who nearly missed her tee-off time because of beach traffic, shot  a four-under-par 66 to share the lead with Chris Johnson after two rounds of  the $225,000 LPGA Atlantic City tournament at Somers Point, N.J.  </P> <P> Fergon and Johnson, who shot her second straight 68, had 36-hole totals of  four-under-par 136 and were one stroke ahead of first-round leader Nancy Lopez,  who shot a 70 on the 6,020-yard Sands Country Club course.  </P> <P> Betsy King, a five-time winner this year, was tied with Amy Alcott, Rosie Jones  and Susan Sanders at 138. King had a 70, Alcott a 67, Sanders a 68 and Jones a  69.  </P> <P> Harold Henning shot a seven-under-par 65 to take a two-stroke lead over Dick  Hendrickson after two rounds of the $275,000 Newport Cup seniors tournament at  Newport, R.I.  </P> <P> Henning had eight birdies and one bogey and was at nine-under-par 135.  Hendrickson, who shot a 68, was one stroke ahead of Chick Evans and Tom Shaw.  </P> <P> Brandie Burton of Rialto, Calif., won three of the first four holes and hung on  for a 1-up victory over Camie Hoshino of Hilo, Hawaii, to win the U.S. Girls'  Junior Amateur golf title at Pine Needles Resort in Southern Pines, N.C.  </P> <P> David Duval of Ponte Vedra, Fla., survived a late charge by Austin Maki of  Costa Mesa, Calif., to win, 1 up, in the final of the 42nd U.S. Boys' Junior  Amateur golf championship at Singing Hills Country Club in El Cajon.  </P></p>

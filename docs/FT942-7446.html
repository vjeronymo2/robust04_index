			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: JVC records pre-tax loss for third consecutive year JVC, the Japanese maker of video cassette recorders and other audio-visual products, yesterday reported a consolidated pre-tax loss for the third consecutive year and passed its dividend. The company cited the strong rise of the yen and weak demand in Japan as key factors behind a 6 per cent fall in sales to Y726.5bn (Dollars 6.9bn) from Y768.9bn a year ago and a pre-tax loss of Y26.8bn, against a loss of Y25.5bn last time. The net loss for the year to March 1994 was Y19.6bn, compared with Y43.1bn last time. Sales of the company's mainline audio-visual products suffered from sluggish consumer spending in Japan while information equipment, such as cordless phones, also saw a 6 per cent decline. In terms of regional performance, JVC suffered a fall in demand in Japan. But sales in Asia were strong and contributed to profits in spite of the foreign exchange losses the company incurred on the yen's appreciation. JVC depends on export markets for 50 per cent of its overall sales. For the parent company alone, JVC posted sales of Y507.7bn, down 1 per cent from Y513.2bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y19.5bn against a loss of Y26.1bn last time. Efforts are being stepped up to restructure the company in a bid to return to profitability. Business divisions have been reorganised, staff has been consolidated and inventories have been reduced. New, advanced products such as the hi-definition VCR are expected to become core products and help boost profits. JVC last week announced that its president, Mr Takuro Bojo, would resign to be replaced by an executive from Matsushita, the consumer electronics company which owns a 52 per cent stake in JVC. The company does not see a strong recovery but expects to return to profitability in the current year, with consolidated sales rising to Y750bn. On a parent company basis it sees sales rising to Y530bn and pre-tax profits of Y1bn for this year.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: A look at the Pop era THE 1960s, it seems, are always with us, at once so ambiguous and so positive, so hopeful and so meretricious, so stylish and so vulgar. How we believed then, in that false dawn, when we would throw off the shackles of the stuffy, academic past, reform the art schools and so move forward into that brave new world. Up to a point we did, forgetting that it was precisely that old formal academic grounding, with its emphasis on observation, understanding and technique, that allowed us the luxury of our precocious posturings. If last autumn's Pop Art Show at the Royal Academy taught us anything, it was that the British variety was so much the better made than the American, richer and more complex in its references and associations, for all the superficial gloss. For Ready Steady Go at the Royal Festival Hall (until February 23, then on an extensive tour well into 1993), the South Bank Centre draws upon the Arts Council's own collection of work of the 1960s, bought at the time, cheap and cheerful. The title may naturally evoke the generality of Pop, but it does so with a gentle, perhaps unconscious irony. What it offers is another look at those supposed Pop artists in company with those of their contemporaries similarly engaged with the currency of American art, albeit the nouvelle vague of hard-edge and post-painterly abstraction. There on the one hand are Blake, Hockney, Kiff, Hodgkin, Caulfield, on the other Hoyland, Huxley, Ayres, Riley, Moon, Denny, Irwin and Sedgely; and somewhere in between come Tilson and Smith. What comes through is a sense of a well-mannered and thoughtful engagement, responsive to what was going on in the world but still its own creature, an authentic national school, distinct in its sensibility from any other, and certainly no worse. As such it was the staple of our official representation in major shows and festivals at home and abroad throughout the period. But it was never the whole story, and the absence here of such artists as Auerbach, Freud and Kossoff, to say nothing of that far larger group of older figurative artists centred upon the Academy, the Royal College and the Slade - Weight, de Grey, Coker, Middleditch, Symons, George, Buhler, Greenham, Coldstream, Gowing and the rest - is conspicuous. Perhaps other shows are mooted to put the record straight, but serious questions remain about the nature of our public patronage, that at every period would seem to celebrate quite arbitrarily work of a certain kind above all others, a matter not of merit at all, though that may be high enough, but of pure luck. Figurative painters were by no means the only ones to suffer, then or later. A positive response to American abstract expressionism in the late 1950s was all very well, but the fashion soon changed. The awkward fact is that some of our very best painters suffered long neglect in consequence. The Pomeroy Purdy Gallery (at Jacob Street Film Studios, Mill Street SE1, until February 22) is showing the work of four of them, dating not from the 1960s but from the years either side of 1980. Two are in Ready Steady Go, but then John Hoyland had yet to evolve from the colour-field towards actual expressionism, and Gillian Ayres was to be all but ignored for the next 15 years. Here her paintings are at their most mysterious and atmospheric, the surfaces dense and impacted, the colour rich and deep, the spaces unspecific. They are neither better nor worse than her more recent work, that is more open, graphic, more particular in its suggestion of landscape: only different, and very beautiful. Basil Beattie, who has lately emerged as among our most authoritative painters, seemed then to be painting the paintings one might almost hope Hoyland would paint now, for being freer in the gesture, less dry and flat in the paint itself, and more open in imagery and surface. Here Hoyland's prints are so much the more confident, integrated and expansive in the handling. And there is Brian Fielding, who died in 1987. He showed seldom, and so slipped through the net, but to his peers and students he was a constant standard and abiding influence and example. His paintings here are in the true character of his work, the sensibility at once oriental and occidental, the surfaces flat yet deep, the statement painterly yet calligraphic. He held such contradictions in perfect balance, with deceptive ease and true conviction.</p>

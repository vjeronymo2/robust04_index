			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Brittan in struggle over E Europe portfolio Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, is fighting an uphill battle to keep control of relations with central and eastern Europe in the new European Commission, Brussels diplomats said yesterday. With a French-led campaign to cut Sir Leon down to size apparently making headway, the senior British commissioner is pinning hopes of preserving his bureaucratic empire on Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. Sir Leon's camp welcomed Mr Kohl's election victory this week, on the grounds that the German leader will prefer a free-trader committed to early enlargement of the EU to the emerging democracies of central Europe. The British hope he will pass on the message to Mr Jacques Santer, who takes over as Commission president next January from Mr Jacques Delors. But UK officials remain worried that Mr Kohl may tip support to France, whose senior incoming commissioner - Mrs Edith Cresson, a former French premier - is said to have expressed interest in the eastern European dossier (which also includes Russia and the former Soviet republics). Handling relations with central and eastern Europe is rated as the plum job in the new five-year Commission headed by Mr Santer. One of its chief tasks will be to lay the groundwork for the entry of Poland, the Czech republic and Hungary, and possibly Slovakia and Slovenia, into the EU around the turn of the century - a daunting challenge but also one with a guaranteed high political profile. Sir Leon's credentials rest mainly on his role in the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation and his successful lobbying for more generous EU market access for central and east European exporters. But Mr Santer's problem is that he does not have enough good jobs to share around in the next Commission, which will expand from 17 to 21 commissioners, assuming Sweden and Norway join Austria and Finland in supporting membership in referendums next month. Mr Santer will attempt to reach agreement among his new colleagues on a share-out of portfolios at a meeting in Luxembourg at the end of the month. Already, the session is being billed as a test of his grip on his new colleagues and his clout with member states. Responsibility for the external relations portfolio is currently shared between three Commissioners: Sir Leon, Mr Hans van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister who handles political affairs, and Mr Manuel Marin, the long-serving senior Spanish commissioner, who is responsible for development aid, Latin America and most of the Mediterranean. The carve-up is dogged by inefficiencies, overlap and personal rivalry. Mr Marin is understood to have won control of Latin America and expanding responsibility in the Mediterranean, in exchange for yielding the dossier relating to the Lome convention, the trade arrangement with 60 African, Caribbean and poorer Pacific countries, mainly former European colonies.</p>

Description of the Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would apply to each aerospace manufacturing and rework facility that is a major source, as defined under section 112(a) of the Act. A major source is one that emits or has the potential to emit, considering controls, 9.1 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (10 tpy) or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants for all activities conducted at the facility. An aerospace facility is defined as a facility that produces in any amount an aerospace vehicle or component, or a facility that reworks (or repairs) these vehicles or components. Aerospace operations at any major source that conduct both aerospace and non-aerospace work would be subject to the proposed standards, regardless of the relative proportion of aerospace and non-aerospace work at the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the proposed rule applies only to major sources, the EPA requests comment on whether all or some of its requirements should be applied to non-major sources. The Agency solicits available information from state and local air pollution control agencies and others on the nature, number and location of non-major aerospace facilities, the quantities and types of hazardous air pollutants they emit, the impact of these emissions on health and the environment, and the extent to which these emissions already are controlled. Comments also are requested on the economic and other impacts that would result from applying requirements of the proposed rule to these smaller sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, aerospace facilities are covered by the SIC codes listed in Table 2. However, facilities classified under other SIC codes may be subject to the proposed standards if the facility meets the definition of a major source and the definition of an aerospace facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on information obtained through the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce_Bureau of the Census, there are an estimated 2,869 aerospace facilities that will be subject to the proposed standards. Of this number, 1,395 manufacture or rework commercial products, and 1,474 manufacture or rework military products. The combined HAP emissions from these facilities are estimated to be over 189,000 Mg/yr (208,000 tpy).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these facilities, there are numerous subcontractors that manufacture or rework aerospace vehicles or components. The subcontractors may work directly for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,i1,xls30,r75 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 2._Aerospace Manufacturing SIC Codes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1SIC Code  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Description <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 3720  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Aircraft and Parts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3721  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3724  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Aircraft Engines and Engine Parts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3728  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Aircraft Parts and Equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3760  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Guided Missiles, Space Vehicles, and Parts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3761  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Guided Missiles and Space Vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3764  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Space Propulsion Units and Parts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3769  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Space Vehicle Equipment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0163 intable --> 1 <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Aerospace Rework SIC Code <!-- PJG 007 0163 intable --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 4581  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Airports, Flying Fields, and Services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> OEM or rework facilities, or indirectly through first line subcontractors. Since many of these subcontractors perform various types of work, they are often classified under non-aerospace SIC codes. Consequently, an estimate of the number of subcontractors cannot be made. One company alone, however, employs the services of over 5,000 subcontractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Affected Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would limit organic HAP emissions from the following sources at aerospace facilities: cleaning operation, primer application operation, topcoat application operation, depainting operation, chemical milling maskant application operation, and the handling and storage of waste. The proposed rule would also limit inorganic HAP emissions from primer, topcoat, and depainting operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic HAP emissions from primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations occur from the evaporation of the solvent contained in the coatings. These emissions occur during the application of the coatings on aerospace vehicles or parts, which may take place in large open areas, such as hangars, or in partially or fully enclosed spaces, such as within spray booths.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic HAP emissions from cleaning and depainting operations occur from the evaporation of the volatile portion of the cleaning solvents or chemical strippers. Cleaning emissions are nearly always fugitive in nature and occur at essentially every processing step. Emissions from depainting are typically fugitive in nature since the operation is carried out within a large hangar or in open tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

However, it should be noted that the State costs reflected in the above chart may include costs that are currently being, or will be in the future, spent by States to provide medical assistance under programs other than Medicaid. Additionally, we believe that costs for waiver growth may be limited as a result of the fiscal capacities of the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act, the estimated average per capita expenditure under a home and community-based waiver may not exceed 100 percent of the estimated average per capita expenditure that the State reasonably estimates would have been made if the waiver had not been granted. All States have assured HCFA of this as a condition of waiver approval. Thus, under the law, this final rule is expected to be technically budget neutral with the exception of the costs associated with the elimination of the bed capacity test. However, section 9502 of COBRA and sections 9408 and 9411 of OBRA '86 have negligible costs associated with them overall. It is difficult to determine and may be impossible to assess precisely whether these changes would substantially affect the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We expect coverage of home respiratory care for ventilator-dependent individuals to have a similar impact. This new program also allows home care as an alternative to institutionalization. New programs may be added as alternatives to institutionalization as a result of this final rule with comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not expect that the adoption of this final rule with comment period will result in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, or local government agencies in any geographic region. Employment in institutional care is more capital intensive; home and community services are more labor intensive. Increased costs or revenue losses may be experienced by providers (both their owners and employees) that formerly served institutionalized recipients. Although an institutional provider of services may be adversely affected by the existence of a waiver in its area, it may choose to provide services covered under a home and community-based waiver, and the adverse impact probably will be offset by increased business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, home and community-based waivers and respiratory care for ventilator-dependent individuals generally may result in services being furnished in different settings, often by different providers, with possibly some losses in revenue by some providers offset by increases to other providers. We do not consider this redistributive effect to be significant. We do expect recipients to benefit from a deinstitutionalized life and from the services that may be provided under these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> D. Rural Hospital Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a metropolitan statistical area. We have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final rule with comment period will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> E.

Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Sections 440.180, 441.301 and 441.303 of this final rule with comment period contain information collection requirements that are subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The public is not required to comply with the information collection requirements until OMB approves these requirements under section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507). A notice will be published in the Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when approval is obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

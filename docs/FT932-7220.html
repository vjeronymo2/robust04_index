			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Telephone sales The government is clearly learning on the job when it comes to pricing privatisations. For BT 2, it refined the book-building process to avoid selling shares too cheaply. Now it is bribing fund managers with preferential treatment if they buy the company's shares ahead of BT 3. Given the attractions of the issue, that may be enough to prevent institutions selling to beat the price down ahead of the tender. Indeed, in other circumstances, the tactic might be considered an inducement to ramp BT shares into the float. The normal retail discount will be required if private investors are to see even modest gains. Once the Treasury has lost its financial interest in BT, uncertainty about regulation will increase. The likely timing of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into British Gas - which may arrive on ministers' desks just after the BT issue - falls at an uncomfortable time. Yet the MMC will doubtless be careful in framing its recommendations with regard to the impact on other privatised companies. While the trend is towards tighter regulation, experience suggests that the unknown attitude of Mr Don Cruickshank, the new director-general of Oftel, will be the deciding factor. Perhaps the main hint about the postion of Mr Cruickshank will come from the degree to which he forces BT to account separately for the parts of its business. Such action might foreshadow an attempt to split BT, although Oftel has not so far taken that line. It would, however, make plain where the power for the cash-generating machine comes from.</p>

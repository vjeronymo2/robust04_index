			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Salzburg sound of economic music When I recently arrived in Salzburg for a symposium on European unemployment, I had a shock as I crossed the bridge into the city. For the fortress seemed to have gone psychedelic in a variety of brilliant colours. There was the old grey, an area repainted in brilliant white, which was supposedly the original colour, and an intermediate area covered by builders' green netting. Yet this variety of colour in some ways symbolised our work. For thanks to the initiative of Professor Herbert Giersch of Kiel, a founding member of the German Council of Economic Advisers, 10 economists from a wide range of the political spectrum managed to agree on a common manifesto. They included Richard Cooper, a former Carter appointee, Patrick Minford, who was close to Margaret Thatcher, and Wolfgang Rieke, recently of the Bundesbank. The Salzburg manifesto pinpointed three 'proximate roots of high unemployment': pay and associated labour costs which price workers out of jobs; intermittent periods of low demand growth; and capacity shortages which emerge in many countries in the recovery phases while unemployment is still high. Unlike some market economists, the Salzburg authors admitted that forces such as globalisation and technical change had an adverse effect on unskilled workers, which showed itself in unemployment in Europe but in low pay in the US. Nevertheless we rejected any kind of protection to keep out imports from poorer countries, and wanted to tackle the problem of low pay by persuading other citizens to 'use the tax and transfer system to top up low incomes by direct payments'. These principles are the key. For the practical application must vary from country to country and would require many pages of institutional detail. To the extent that unemployment is a structural problem, it cannot be tackled by a single brushstroke measure such as leaving or joining an exchange rate arrangement. In the end we agreed on nine points: There has to be an appropriate macro-economic background. 'Inflationary dashes for growth should be strictly avoided. But once inflation is at low levels, monetary authorities have as much responsibility for avoiding nominal demand deficiency as inflationary excess.' There was a specific recommendation that 'the European Monetary Institute should monitor the development of nominal gross domestic product at an EU level'. Labour markets have to respond more quickly to market changes. I cannot claim that we solved the problem of why pay and associated costs are so often above market levels. But the manifesto urged that settlements reached by collective bargaining should not rise in real terms in the years to come so that productivity growth could be translated into an expansion of employment. 'Equal pay for equal work' stands in the way of full employment. This was not an anti-feminist rearguard action, but a reference to the need to take on new workers at less than existing pay rates, to try to combine pricing into jobs with the realities of insider power of those already at work. The market incomes of unskilled workers in the west are likely to move nearer to those in developing countries. But there would be levelling up as well as down. Moreover as real income in advanced countries would benefit from the extra trade, there would be a surplus to channel towards those most hard hit by economic change. There is a need to invest in human capital to reduce present disparities in earning power. The Salzburg writers gave the theme a new twist by rejecting 'credentialism' - that is multiplying the paper qualifications - and urging credit vouchers for trainees. Physical investment is needed too - but not generalised fiscal subsidies, which too often encouraged capital-intensive projects. The best contribution governments could make was to reduce their own structural budget deficits. In a carefully negotiated aside we noticed 'that a Japanese current account surplus - provided it is not achieved at the expense of a depressed economy  -is a contribution to world savings'. This was not a digression but recognised the inter-relationship of world capital markets and world real interest rates. Top-up payments for low-income households are preferable to other devices such as minimum wage legislation or high benefits. But to carry the more hardline German participants we had to underline in several different ways that these top-up payments would be subject to means tests. There should be no link between the dole and previous earnings if the benefit is financed from taxation. There is a risk that the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty will limit employment 'and should be watched carefully'. Agreeing this point was some achievement among 10 signatories, only two of whom were British and half of whom were based in Germany. Many heartaches could be saved if a German government had the courage to take the same attitude in European political discussions.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Parent to boost capital of CS First Boston by Dollars 400m CS Holding, the Swiss financial group, confirmed yesterday its plans to provide its US-based investment banking subsidiary, CS First Boston, with a capital infusion of about Dollars 400m. The move is being made in an effort to boost CS First Boston's earning power. Mr Gerhard Beindorff, a spokesman for CS Holding, said yesterday that work on an equity capital increase for CS First Boston of about Dollars 400m was at 'an advanced stage'. It will be the second large infusion of capital at CS First Boston in four years. In 1990, its parent provided Dollars 300m in equity capital as part of an Dollars 800m recapitalisation plan aimed at restoring confidence in the bank, which was struggling at the time under the weight of troubled loans. When this latest infusion is completed, probably at some point in this quarter, CS First Boston will have capital of Dollars 1.7bn. This is still relatively small by the standards of its biggest Wall Street rivals such as Salomon Brothers (Dollars 5.3bn in capital), Goldman Sachs (Dollars 5bn) and Morgan Stanley (Dollars 4.5bn). Equity capital is crucial for investment banks. The larger their capital base, the more they can use their own money in the financial markets for proprietary trading and underwriting activities, and the more likely they are to earn a high credit rating which allows them to conduct derivatives business with clients. In recent years, a large share of investment banks' profits have come from capital- intensive businesses such as proprietary derivatives trading. The decision to provide the capital infusion comes a month after CS Holding increased its stake in CS First Boston from 68.5 per cent to 75.7 per cent by purchasing the stakes of five foreign institutional shareholders.</p>

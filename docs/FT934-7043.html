			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / People: Cash, debt and worry beads Greece's central bank governor, Efthymios Christodoulou, bowed out at the weekend in response to pressures from the recently elected socialist government, writes Kerin Hope. The socialists had been expected to sack him because of his close connections with the opposition New Democracy party, but, even so, the timing of his resignation was a surprise. His presence at the Bank of Greece was seen as a guarantee that exchange rate policy would be stable while the socialists worked out ways to tackle economic problems. The favourite to take over is Ioannis Boutos, a former economy minister close to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. The socialists, meanwhile, have persuaded Nikos Kyriazides, a former IMF executive director, to come out of retirement for the newly created job of debt manager at the Finance Ministry. Greece's domestic debt, now over 120 per cent of GDP, is ballooning to Latin American proportions. Kyriazides, 66, former deputy governor of the Bank of Greece, should be the right man. At the IMF, he had much to do with debt restructurings for Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. And when it comes to talking to the European Commission, he can draw on experience as chief Greek negotiator in the run-up to Greece joining the Community. Kyriazides, one of the few Greek bankers who flips a string of worry beads while he talks, sounds confident he can find a way to restructure part of the Dr5,000bn (Pounds 13.8bn) owed by the government to Greece's commercial banks that will get EU approval. But he is leaving nothing to chance. His worry beads are blue, the colour that in Greek eyes brings good luck.</p>

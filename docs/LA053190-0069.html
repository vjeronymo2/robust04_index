			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISANDROSY AND MILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS' BATTLE TO BAR MEN  </P> <P> The column from the assistant professor of theology, about alleged "man-hating"  at Mills, was curious ("In Academe, Misogyny Meets Its Match: Misandrosy," by  Patrick M. Arnold, Commentary, May 14). Here is a Jesuit priest who is  currently writing a book on masculine spirituality -- obviously a special kind  of man.  </P> <P> Now the good father is upset that the women of Mills College prefer the company  of other women in their continuing studies.  </P> <P> Does he write a sweet, well-reasoned note, gently chiding Mills students for  seeking the companionship and support of their sisters? Hell, no! This product  of an all-male seminary -- who would probably react furiously were even a  "spiritual male" to enroll in a convent -- this temperate priest did a Jimmy  Breslin: He wrote a nasty, intemperate, bigoted, name-calling, woman-hating  diatribe.  </P> <P> As a man whose sister was a nun and whose brother was a priest, I am ashamed of  Arnold and his "toxic-sexist" soul. Fortunately, the women of Mills won't hate  him, only pity him. His essay reflects one of the reasons they do not wish to  study with men.  </P> <P> RONAN O'CASEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

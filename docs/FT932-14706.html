			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / GM right-hand drive car deal GENERAL MOTORS is to supply Toyota of Japan with right-hand drive cars for the Japanese market, the US motor group said yesterday. The two companies agreed that GM would manufacture right-hand drive cars with the Toyota badge in the US which would be marketed in Japan through the Toyota dealer network, GM Japan said. The agreement was reached between Mr John Smith, GM president and Mr Tatsuo Toyoda, president of Toyota, in the US on April 5, GM said. Toyota would neither confirm nor deny the deal, which was revealed by GM as Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, visits Washington for his first meeting with President Bill Clinton. Car and car parts exports to Japan have become an increasingly important issue for the US. When former President George Bush visited Japan last year Japanese motor manufacturers agreed to make efforts to import and locally procure more US cars and car parts. However, there has been increasing criticism in the US of what is seen to be a lack of progress by the Japanese companies in carrying out their proposed procurement plans. Toyota, at the time, indicated it would make efforts to purchase Dollars 9.2bn (Pounds 6.1bn) worth of car parts worldwide by 1994. Of this, Dollars 5.28bn was expected to be purchased from the US, including local procurement by Toyota's US manufacturing facilities.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Heinz drops TV adverts in move to direct marketing HJ HEINZ, the food manufacturer that brought the British public such memorable advertising campaigns as Beanz Meanz Heinz, is planning to create a new slogan - Heinz Meanz Direct Marketing. Mr Tony O'Reilly, the flamboyant chairman and chief executive of the Pittsburg-based international food group, is planning to end UK commercial television advertising for his products this year and instead concentrate on direct marketing. Mr O'Reilly, whose career in marketing took off after he created the Kerrygold campaign for Irish butter in his early 20s, believes the era of mass marketing is giving way to more targeted selling techniques. The Heinz plan to give up television advertising would be one of the most radical marketing moves in recent years by a food manufacturer. It comes as manufacturers of branded food products are facing growing competition from cheaper, own-label goods produced by supermarkets. The Heinz account is one of the longest established in television advertising. Heinz has already built up a database of 5.6m homes in the UK that are heavy users of the company's products. Mr O'Reilly plans to send special discount vouchers directly to those homes, thereby bypassing conventional advertising media such as television and newspapers. The discount vouchers will be for individual Heinz products, such as baked beans, but also for groups of Heinz lines. Mr O'Reilly has decided that direct marketing is the most cost effective way of maintaining loyalty to the brands. The Heinz chief executive sees the plan as the start of a 'guerrilla' campaign against theincreasing power of the large supermarket groups, which, he believes, sometimes treat branded products cavalierly. Mr O'Reilly wants to take control of discounting policy for his brands rather than leaving it to the discretion of supermarkets. He is concerned that Heinz products are often treated as mid-market products when they should be priced and displayed as premium brands. The Heinz chief executive is planning to send out his discount vouchers unannounced and expects supermarkets to honour them. In particular, he hopes stores will support Food Manufacturers' Federation rules against 'mis-redemption' - accepting vouchers in lieu of payment for any product as opposed to those intended. If Heinz goes ahead with its plan and proves that direct marketing to its best customers works, it could be a blow to ITV.</p>

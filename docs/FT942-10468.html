			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (15): Brewing up new ways to boost production - Tea and coffee are crucial elements of the economy Evian Muriu, group manager for the central tea and coffee group of Brooke Bond Kenya, points proudly to a series of small rectangular pits recently dug in the ground between rows of tea bushes in a plantation in central Kenya. The staggered holes are a simple method that could have a powerful effect in preventing soil erosion. Their creation is one of a number of recent measures designed to boost productivity at the Mabroukie tea estate, and on other plots controlled by many different farmers around the country. It is a reminder of the importance placed by growers on investment in tea, at a time when the drought of the past few months has threatened a sharp drop in productivity for one of Kenya's main generators of foreign exchange. Last year, tea sales to other countries earned an estimated Ks18.6bn, or 28 per cent of all exports. It was second only to tourism at Ks21.3bn as a source of foreign exchange, and contributed an estimated 10 per cent of the world's crop. In a measure of the traditional significance of tea and coffee to the Kenyan economy, a national law forbids farmers to pull up any bushes of either crop to convert land to other uses. The most recent National Development Plan - while calling for self-sufficiency in food - continues to urge the maintenance of the cultivation of export crops such as tea. Companies such as Brooke Bond stress their continued commitment to tea, and point to a new breeding programme for 'the golden clone' of high-yielding varieties. They say their main restriction is lack of access to new land to plant for additional tea crops. More challenging is boosting productivity in some of the smaller farms, which account for about 55 per cent of the crop spread between some 200,000 producers. According to a recent report by the US agricultural attache in Kenya, an increase in monthly advance payments and elimination of a 5 per cent presumptive tax on growers have helped boost incomes, while a remaining problem is inadequate processing capacity during peak periods. Productivity - achieved through a combination of rising yields and growing land under cultivation - has continued to rise consistently in the past few years, increasing almost uninterrupted from 56.7m kilos in 1975 to 211.2m kilos last year. In 1994, month-on-month figures have been down sharply on last year following drought, although rain in the past few weeks has begun to restore confidence. Liberalisation has brought substantial changes to the sector. There are now no price controls on tea, factories can market their output without government involvement, and exporters can hold on to earned foreign exchange. At least half of all production must still be sold by auction, which has converted from shilling to dollar sales. One challenge for Kenyan tea is to diversify its markets - something that marketing efforts have failed to achieve. About 60 per cent of tea consumed in the UK is Kenyan, and represented last year more than 39 per cent of all foreign sales. A further 26 per cent went to Pakistan and 15 per cent to Egypt, with little spread of market share in the past few years. Foreign sales have not grown as fast as increased production. While tea remains highly lucrative, coffee has until recently undergone a substantial slump which has forced many growers away from the crop - if necessary simply neglecting their bushes if they do not want to risk pulling them up. Coffee output in 1992-93 dropped to 73,000 tonnes from 90,000 tonnes a year earlier. Once it was a mainstay of the economy responsible for a boom in the country, reflecting the high quality, premium-priced arabica beans it produces. Then world prices collapsed. Last year it accounted for just Ks11m or 16 per cent of exports. Some observers are optimistic that things are now beginning to recover. Export earnings can now be retained in dollars, and producers can receive proceeds of the sales of their own crop rather than simply taking their proportion from pooled sales organised by the Coffee Board. At least equally important, world coffee prices are beginning to recover. But it will take several seasons before a consistently improved price will be reflected in higher yields.</p>

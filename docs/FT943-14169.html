			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: US regional banks top market expectations A clutch of US regional banks exceeded market expectations with second-quarter figures reported yesterday, reflecting stronger loan demand. Bank of New York saw net income jump by nearly half to Dollars 176m, or 87 cents a share, from Dollars 118m, or 57 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1993. The bank's net interest income was 9 per cent higher than a year earlier, thanks to a slight increase in its lending margin and a shift to higher-yielding assets, such as credit card outstandings. Wachovia, based in North Carolina, also beat most estimates, with net income of Dollars 134m, or 78 cents a share, compared with Dollars 123m, or 70 cents a share, last year. Asset growth and lower loan loss provisions accounted for the advance, the bank said. Average loans during the quarter grew by Dollars 2.7bn, or 12.7 per cent, it added. First Union, meanwhile, recorded a 5 per cent increase in loans compared with the previous three months, a rise of Dollars 2.2bn. Net interest income was Dollars 775m, up from Dollars 708.2m a year before. Net income of Dollars 229.6m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, compared with Dollars 226.7m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, a year before, ahead of market expectations.</p>

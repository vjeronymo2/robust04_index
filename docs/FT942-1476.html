			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Trade News: S Korea names candidate for WTO The contest for the first head of the World Trade Organisation widened yesterday when South Korea said it was nominating Mr Kim Chul-su, its trade and industry minister. Mr Kim is the fourth declared candidate. President Carlos Salinas of Mexico formally entered the race on Wednesday, following Brazil's nomination of Mr Rubens Ricupero, its finance minister, and Italy's endorsement of Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former trade minister. The Seoul foreign ministry said Mr Kim had a 'good chance' of election by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's 123 members, four-fifths of which are developing countries. Canvassing for Mr Kim among trading partners has only just begun, according to South Korean officials in Geneva. Many developing countries would in principle like to see a Third World candidate head the WTO, which will succeed Gatt next year. The Gatt job has always gone to a European. But developing country support could split on regional lines. To complicate matters, the US, which last year backed Mr Peter Sutherland, the EU nominee as Gatt director general, is said to favour Mr Salinas. The EU is not helping its own cause by delaying endorsement of Mr Ruggiero as part of the horsetrading over the EU presidency and other top jobs. Under Gatt rules, the appointment of a director general must be made by consensus, after consultations being conducted by Mr Andras Szepesi, Hungary's Gatt ambassador and current chairman of the contracting parties (members). The final decision will be taken by members at their annual meeting in December. Mr Kim, 53, is a career civil servant who headed negotiations on intellectual property protection with the US in 1989 which averted trade sanctions threatened by Washington.</p>

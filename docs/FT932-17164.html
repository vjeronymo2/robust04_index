			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Naples probe turns to judges THE Naples investigation into links between politicians, businessmen and members of the Camorra, the local mafia, yesterday extended to embrace the judiciary. Two senior judges were yesterday served notice that they were under investigation for collusion with the Camorra, while there was speculation that a further five judges were also involved. It is the first time such a direct accusation has been made against the Naples judiciary, despite the long nurtured suspicion that an essential link in the protection of the city's extensive network of organised crime was cover from the courts. In the past week, Palermo magistrates have also revealed they have sent dossiers on one of Italy's best-known appeal court judges, Mr Corrado Carnevale, to Rome. Mr Carnevale, dubbed 'the sentence killer', has presided over a number of appeals of prominent mafiosi and found technical arguments to reduce their sentences. New accusations may also be on the way about Christian Democrat activities in Sicily after police seized party documents on Wednesday. The involvement of the judiciary in the corruption scandals threatens to pose delicate problems. It is often the younger investigate magistrates who are digging up evidence while the judges hearing cases in court have taken a very restrictive view of evidence and proof, causing 75 per cent of all prosecutions to fail. The two judges named yesterday were Mr Armando Cono Lancuba, prosecutor general at Melfi, 100km from Naples, who for a long time operated in the city's courts, and Mr Alberto Lamberti, already under disciplinary proceedings and the subject of an assassination attempt in 1982. They are understood to have been named by Mr Pasquale Galasso, a former Camorra boss, who is now co-operating with the authorities under a plea bargaining programme. Mr Galasso, who looked after the business interests - valued at L1,500bn (Pounds 684m) - of the Camorra head, Mr Carmine Alfieri, has provided the authorities with the names of dozens of businessmen and politicians linked to organised crime. His confessions, combined with those of a Christian Democrat deputy, have enabled the police to uncover the city's extensive corruption network in under two months. On one day alone the Naples police served 115 arrest warrants. The significance of developments in Naples is that only here did the Christian Democrats and Socialists hang on to their votes in the elections of April last year. This has been the stronghold of patronage politics.</p>

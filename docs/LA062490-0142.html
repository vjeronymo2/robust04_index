			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LACK OF HOSPITALITY?  </P> <P> I recently returned from a cross-country automobile trip between Arroyo Grande,  Calif., and Tampa, Fla., and discovered there is a lack of hospitality provided  tourists who cross into California. From New Mexico eastward to Florida, every  state provides a welcome station after the border is crossed.  </P> <P> California doesn't offer that service. When you cross into California from  Arizona, there is an agricultural checkpoint, but no welcome station.  Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama not only provide a major welcome station  with clean restrooms and plenty of personnel to answer your questions, but they  offer maps and brochures.  </P> <P> Maybe California has a good reason for not having a tourist welcome station at  the border, but it seems to be a penny-wise, pound-foolish policy.  </P> <P> ARNOLD STONE  </P> <P> Arroyo Grande, Calif.  </P></p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Future of German energy industry in doubt: Cross-party talks fail to decide on the country's nuclear power industry and its subsidised coal mines THE FUTURE of nuclear power in Germany and the fate of its highly subsidised coal mines are both in doubt after the collapse of a year-long effort to negotiate a cross-party compromise on energy. The governing conservative-liberal coalition in Bonn failed to reach agreement with the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) on Wednesday night, primarily because they were unable to agree on whether nuclear power has a future in the German economy. The ramifications are considerable. It means that the hotly-debated issue of how to dispose of Germany's nuclear waste is undecided. That leaves question-marks hanging over Britain's multi-billion pound project for nuclear waste reprocessing at British Nuclear Fuel's Thorp plant at Sellafield, and over similar reprocessing contracts with France's Cogema. It means Germany's power generators - led by RWE in the Ruhr, Veba's PreussenElektra in Hanover, and Bayernwerk in Munich - still have no secure planning framework in which to decide on their next generation of power stations. They may be fuelled with domestic coal, imported coal, brown of soft coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, or renewable energy sources: all that is certain is that all is uncertain. The nuclear power station manufacturers, led by Siemens KWU, do not know if they should go ahead with developing a new generation of extra-safe nuclear reactors, or abandon the project because they will never have a domestic market. They believe there is a huge future export market, but fear that the loss of a domestic nuclear industry will cause many of their top nuclear engineers to leave the country. It means that two politically-explosive plans for nuclear waste disposal - at the Gorleben salt mines and the Schacht Konrad disused coal mine in the state of Lower Saxony - are left half open. And it puts the whole future financing plans for the embattled German coal mining industry, already suffering a severe squeeze because of the downturn in steelmaking, in doubt. The industry requires massive subsidies to the end of the century to maintain a production of 35m tonnes a year for power stations. The German government, the coal mining industry and the power generators, all link a viable future for coal with the maintenance of nuclear energy: they say that only by cross-subsidising the high cost of burning German coal (its price is currently about DM280 (Pounds 114) a tonne, compared with DM80 for imported coal) with low-cost nuclear power can they afford to buy the domestic product. The whole subject of energy supply in Germany is fraught with political pitfalls. It concerns not simply ideological differences between left and right, and between environmentalists and the industrial lobby. It also concerns acute regional rivalries, between the federal states and the Bonn government, between north Germany and the south, and within industry as much as within the political establishment. South Germany is pro-nuclear. The Ruhr is pro-coal. And north Germany could happily survive with imported coal and gas. Control of the nuclear power industry is shared between the states and the federal government in Germany's decentralised system. They share responsibilities for licensing nuclear power stations. That means that even if the central government wants to maintain nuclear power in the national energy balance, it has to co-operate with SPD state governments, several of which rule in coalitions with fiercely anti-nuclear Greens. The attempt to forge a cross-party, cross-industry consensus was launched a year ago by the unlikely alliance of Mr Gerhard Schroder, the SPD premier of Lower Saxony, who heads a red-green coalition there, and the bosses of the two largest energy utilities, Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chief executive of RWE, and the late Mr Klaus Piltz, chief executive of Veba. They came from opposite directions. Mr Schroder, who faces state elections next March, wants to lift the threat of high-level nuclear waste disposal at the Gorleben salt mines. He also wants a clear commitment to the abandonment of nuclear energy in Germany, so that he knows precisely how much low-level waste may be dumped in Schacht Konrad. The energy utilities need planning certainty for the next generation of power stations. And they also need a plan to dispose of their steadily-accumulating nuclear waste. They are locked into contracts for waste reprocessing with both BNFL and Cogema, which will produce 40m tonnes of plutonium. That in turn has to be reconverted into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel elements back in Germany, which can then be burned in their power stations. That process is now blocked by the red-green coalition in the state of Hesse, where the environment minister, Mr Joschka Fischer, is the Green party's most articulate anti-nuclear advocate. He has simply prevented the MOX element plant at Hanau being completed. The utilities may be forced to ask Cogema and BNFL to convert their plutonium into MOX elements in France and Britain. That solution is certainly under debate. But in the long run, both the utilities and the German political parties are looking actively at the alternative option to reprocessing - direct disposal of nuclear waste. Last week, after months of painful negotiation, Mr Schroder and Mr Klaus Topfer, the Bonn environment minister, thought they had managed to negotiate a successful compromise. It included amending the German nuclear law to allow direct disposal of nuclear waste as an alternative to reprocessing; it would give the present generation of nuclear power stations a confirmed working life of 35 to 40 years; it would launch a search for alternative waste disposal sites to Gorleben, while allowing Schacht Konrad to be used for low-level waste; it would allow a prototype nuclear reactor of a new 'extra-safe' generation to be licensed in Germany; and it would guarantee long-term subsidies to the coal mining industry of DM7bn a year from 1997-2000. On Monday night, the deal was vetoed by the national executive of the SPD. On the one hand, it failed to give adequate guarantees for the coal mines. On the other, it clearly left open the 'nuclear option' which the SPD has rejected. Now the governing coalition has promised to attempt to force the necessary decisions through the Bundestag and Bundesrat, the two houses of parliament, without cross-party support. It means that the chances of success are considerably reduced. It could leave the nuclear industry in doubt until 1995, along with the coal mines, and the French and British reprocessing industries. 'We know we do not make the situation easy for our neighbours,' Mr Topfer admitted yesterday after the collapse of the talks. 'We cannot decide these things in national isolation.' Mr Topfer believes that in the long run, Germany must switch from reprocessing its nuclear fuel to direct disposal: it is much cheaper, he believes, and it will not produce plutonium. But the collapse of the talks makes that switch more remote, not less. 'It is rather less probable that we will get a change in the nuclear law (to allow direct disposal),' he said. 'It is more likely that it will remain as it is. That will not be in the interests of the SPD. But then, that is life.'</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Pound falls to new low in ERM: UK interest rates threatened as weaker European currencies come under pressure INTERVENTION by the Bank of England to buy sterling for D-Marks yesterday failed to prevent the pound hitting a new low against the German currency in the European exchange rate mechanism. As UK pension funds and other large investors switched money out of pounds into D-Marks in nervous trading, expectations rose that the UK government might be forced soon into an economically damaging increase in interest rates to prevent the pound breaching its ERM limit. Investors were also worried by the news that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had abandoned a planned trip to Spain, apparently to turn his attention to the UK's economic problems. The fresh turbulence in the ERM seriously unsettled other weak currencies including the lira and the peseta. It came in spite of Monday's cut in interest rates in Germany and the 7 per cent devaluation of the lira. The pound's difficulties could be worsened if Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty delivers a No vote to European economic and monetary union. This could prompt further selling of the more fragile currencies in the system in favour of the D-Mark and further damage investor confidence in the ERM. The pound closed against the D-Mark in London last night at DM2.78, 3 1/4 pfennigs down on the day and at the lowest level since Britain joined the ERM 23 months ago. At this point it is just one fifth of a pfennig above its DM2.778 floor, at which government action is required through either large intervention to buy pounds or an increase in base rates, now 10 per cent. The impact of the pound's woes spilled over into share and bond markets, which lost virtually all the gains made on Monday after news of the first cut in German borrowing rates in five years. On the London stock market, the FT-SE index of leading shares closed down 52.1 at 2,370.0, and UK gilts ended a point lower. The purchase of pounds by the Bank of England was thought to be relatively modest. It came amid extreme investor nervousness about the prospects for sterling. On the sterling money market, the three-month interbank rate, an important indicator of where the market thinks base rates are moving, closed at about 10 3/4 per cent,  1/2 a percentage point up from the previous close. The lira, which had strengthened on Monday after the weekend devaluation announcement, fell nearly 2 1/2 per cent yesterday against the D-Mark, breaching its central ERM rate. It bottomed out during the day at L811 to the D-Mark, before rising to close in London at L805.8. The lira's decline was closely followed by the peseta, which fell through the central ERM rate of Pta65 against the D-Mark, which the Bank of Spain has been defending for months. The dollar held steady in London at DM1.4855 and edged higher later in New York. Selling of financial assets was not confined to the UK, as investors elsewhere in Europe and in the US inclined to the view that the reductions in German interest rates and the lira's devaluation were unlikely to provide more than a modest boost to the European economy. The Paris and Milan bourses closed down 2 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively, while government bonds in several countries were marked lower. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 48.9 lower at 3,327.92. Tokyo brokers said weak overseas markets were partly responsible for a fall in stocks in early trading this morning.

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Now Istanbul cares how it is treated - An ambitious Dollars 6bn sewerage programme for the 21st century THE previous mayor of Istanbul promised to make the waters of the Golden Horn as blue as his eyes. Mr Nurettin Sozen, the present incumbent, is no less ambitious. He is spending Dollars 6bn on a water and sewage programme for the city's projected 20m population by the year 2010. It involves new reservoirs, several thousand miles of supply pipe, 15 sewage plants, and a Dollars 1bn plan to divert a river 150 miles away on the Asian mainland. For Turkey's largest city, water supply is not a new problem. If the complex of aqueducts is any measure, the issue has taxed city planners from Byzantine times. But today the waters of this part of the Levant are no longer so sweet. There is not a single biological sewage treatment plant for a population of 9m people. Officials say more than 90 per cent of the city's effluent is dumped untreated into the Bosporus or the Sea of Marmara. The remainder is only partly screened. Omerli lake, Istanbul's principal water source supplying half the city's drinking water, is in danger of contamination. Mr Ergun Goknel, head of Iski, the Istanbul water authority, estimates that 600,000 illegal settlers have built homes on nearby public land and are discharging their effluent into the reservoir. The Berlin water authority has been contracted to look at ways to protect this vital watershed, a project funded by a Dollars 11.2m credit from the Norwegian Nordic Bank. Iski is also talking to the World Bank about a Dollars 1bn programme to protect the reservoir shoreline and provide existing settlements with full water and sewage treatment. The World Bank and other soft loan agencies seem set to play a central role in all of this. Already the German government agency KFW has a water supply project for European Istanbul. Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF) is looking at a proposal to redirect the Melen river some 150 miles from the river mouth on the Black Sea to supply the Asian half of the city. Iski has also had to put its own financial house in order. About half Iski's financing requirement is expected to be provided by internal revenues. A few years ago, Iski was raising bonds to fund its working capital needs. Today, unlike many municipal authorities in Turkey, Iski shows a strong financial improvement, with water sales not charged for down to 32 per cent in 1990-91, down from 50 per cent the year before. Mr Goknel has introduced new billing methods, made improvements to reduce system losses and adjusted the tariff to reflect inflation, now 70 per cent. The corridors of Iski's head office are inundated with foreign equipment suppliers and local construction groups awaiting the latest round of tenders. Taylor Binnie, the UK water consultant, has already designed sewage systems for both sides of the Golden Horn - the North and South Halic schemes. The southern section was completed in 1988 at a cost of Dollars 50m. The following year, the new municipality ordered that all waste water sea discharges had first to receive full biological treatment. The treatment plant and sea outfall at the end of the North Halic section had to be redesigned. Tenders are expected to go out next year for the plant, but until it is built in five years time, sewage on the European shore north of Halic will continue to empty into the Golden Horn and the Bosporus untreated. Earlier this month, Binnie now part of the Acer construction group, was commissioned to design the next phase of the sewage network. The scheme for the Asian side will intercept the old sewage collectors and streams which now feed directly into the Bosporus. Under an earlier agreement with Iski in 1983, Binnie had devised what seemed an ingenious method of utilising the Bosporus' natural powers for sewage purification. The attraction of the scheme was that it utilised the awesome Bosporus current, avoided both an extensive pipelines network and treatment plants, and thus required little land acquisition, a big problem in a crowded city. Under Iski's new environmental rules, however, Binnie was required to find a site suitable for a large-scale treatment plant. It chose Riva, 30 miles away on the Black Sea coast. The engineering involves construction of the main interceptor through the mountains to the treatment plant. According to project manager Mr Jan Pavel, the interceptor will be as wide as the tunnels in the London Underground railway.</p>

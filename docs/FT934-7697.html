			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (35): Homeowner Mr Li feels very secure - Housing reform HAVING crammed three generations into his recently purchased Yantai apartment, Li Xitian has combined the traditional Chinese family arrangement with the modern Communist party dream of owning your own home. A party member at a Yantai storage company, Mr Li has set an example for his fellow workers, most of whom are yet to be convinced to swap a minimal monthly rent for housing loan repayments and the uncertain legal protection offered by the Yantai municipal government. 'I feel very secure. I really feel that I own the apartment and will be able to pass it on to my son and grandson,' said Mr Li, who would not have bought it had he only been entitled to 'occupation rights', as is the case under other experiments in Chinese housing reform. In the past, party members have been expected to lead the way in political purity campaigns. Now Mr Li is a model homebuyer, having traded in a rent of Yn69 a month for an apartment priced at Yn23,000. He had saved half the amount and borrowed the remainder from friends, who will expect him to become a lender if they, too, decide to invest in a home and hence in China's economic reforms. Housing reform began in Yantai, in east China, six years ago. However, workers and their work units, which own most of the country's housing space, are still reluctant to participate in a programme linked to the government's drive to strip away the many welfare functions of Chinese companies. After the early fanfare, Yantai baulked. Sales were frozen after 1989, partly because of an unfinished ideological debate over ownership, but primarily because work units did not want to sell apartments at a loss. Meanwhile, the local government was reluctant to push rents to a level that would increase the incentive for tenants to buy at market value. The government has restarted the experiment this year, convincing 11 work units, including Mr Li's Yantai Supply and Storage Transport Company, to participate. Yantai has ruled that all apartments built before December 1990 are 'old' and will be sold at a discount, while those finished after that date are 'new' and the selling price must reflect the cost of construction. Yantai's experiences will be studied by other local governments, which have been delegated the responsibility for setting a timetable for reforms over which there is little dispute back in Beijing. It is agreed among economic planners that housing should be exposed to the market, but it is also recognised that sudden change could produce the 'social instability' feared by the Communist party. The central government was responsible for 90 per cent of housing investment before 1978, but its share was cut to 16 per cent by 1990, and has fallen further. By reducing its funding, Beijing has increased the pressure on local governments to develop housing policies or face a heavy burden in direct and indirect subsidies. In Shenyang, an industrial centre in the north, where 38 per cent of state-owned companies are losing money, reforms are to begin early next year. But Mr Ai Tingjun, the city's vice-mayor, said: 'Solving the housing problem will not be easy.' OFFICIALS in the northern Beijing district of Haidian would agree. They have suspended a scheme to sell apartments to tenants, many of them academics from the universities and research institutes dotted around the area. Academics complained that planned rent increases were excessive, and demanded special treatment as they were unable to take a second job to supplement their income and could not raise the money to buy a home. Yantai, which increased rents in 1987 in the first phase of reform, plans to lift charges again to cover the costs of construction and then to reflect the market value of rents. The first change is due to come 'in the years before 2000' and the second 'in the years after 2000', according to a cautious Mr Wang Qingyuan, president of the city's real estate management bureau. Private buyers outside the work unit system remain a small minority. Mr Wang estimates that only 3 per cent of 'commodity houses' built by government authorities are sold to individuals, generally get-rich-quick business people or families backed by relatives overseas. The remaining apartments are bought by work units or state institutions. Even Yantai officials, who are at least trying to reform housing, have a limited view of the market's boundaries. For example, if Mr Li or another apartment buyer wants to cash in the asset value and return to the subsidised rental market, he must wait at least five years and will never again be allowed to buy an apartment through the work unit. And, Mr Wang explained, the capital gains must be shared with the work unit and the government, though the precise formula of taxes and charges for the unprecedented event of a quick resale has yet to be finalised.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Franc denial The governor of the Central Bank of Central African States (BEAC) yesterday denied reports that his bank would no longer accept CFA franc notes issued by its West African equivalent, Reuter reports from Yaounde. Both banks decided at the beginning of August to ban the export of CFA notes and stop buying them back from banks outside the zone, in a bid to halt massive capital flight from franc zone countries.</p>

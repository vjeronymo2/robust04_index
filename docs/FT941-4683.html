			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / People: Maxwell: new man for the Pru John Maxwell, ousted from his job as chief executive of plasterboard manufacturer BPB Industries after only nine months, has turned up in the position of corporate development director for the Prudential, Britain's largest insurer. Chief executive Mick Newmarch says he is very pleased to have Maxwell aboard, and that his new recruit turned down at least two other 'very senior' jobs in favour of the Pru. Maxwell was reckoned to have done a good job as finance director of BPB, but to have found the transition to chief executive difficult in an industry he previously knew nothing about. He was also criticised for spending too much time talking to the City. Between 1986 and 1992, however, he had run the Provincial Group, the UK's largest privately-owned financial services company, and had also previously had experience at Grand Metropolitan and Rank Xerox. Two years ago, Newmarch brought in Laurel Powers-Freeling as head of group strategy, but, unlike Maxwell, not on to the main board. She has, according to her wish, recently transferred to line management, supervising the Pru's attempts to reach higher networth, more financially aware customers, says Newmarch. Now that the overall strategy has been enunciated, it is Maxwell's job to monitor its implementation. At the same time, Sir Martin Jacomb, 63, becomes a non-executive director. Jacomb has recently stepped down from the deputy chairmanships of Barclays Bank and Commercial Union. A former deputy chairman of the Securities &amp; Investments Board, he was a central architect of the City's self-regulatory structure, whereas Newmarch is a vociferous advocate of a single tier of statutory regulation for retail financial services. 'I concede I honestly hadn't contemplated that,' says Newmarch, who points out that his own concerns about self-regulation pertain to retail rather than institutional business. 'We have had a series of conversations, but we haven't discussed that. No doubt he'll offer his opinion, but he'll also listen to ours.' Jim Sutcliffe, deputy md of the home service division, also joins the main board.</p>

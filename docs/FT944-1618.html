			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (4): Czech sell-off broader than it is deep - While official declarations talk of the success of the privatisation programme, a number of problems remain The official rhetoric is triumphant. Privatisation in the Czech Republic is complete, victory declared. A programme of mass asset sales for vouchers covers 1,500 companies. According to the government, once shares from the second and final wave of sales for vouchers are distributed in February, 80 per cent of the economy will be in private hands. But while Czech privatisation has been broad, a question remains over how deep. Privatisation has broken the umbilical cord between the state and enterprises. Managers are now to a large extent free of governmental interference. Fears that mass distribution of shares would leave owners, each with a tiny fragment, impotent have proved unfounded. About two thirds of Czechs participating in the mass privatisation scheme entrusted their vouchers to special investment funds. These can take stakes of up to 20 per cent in individual companies. In the second wave of mass privatisation alone, 349 funds and about 2m individuals bid for shares, but the 15 largest institutions picked up 40 per cent of what was on offer leaving share ownership more concentrated than in the UK or US. But while managers have proved surprisingly responsive to their new owners the funds themselves seem unsure of what to do with their sudden power. The few western-controlled funds behave like their western counterparts, but most are passive. Attempts to revamp management often run into opposition from the largest domestic funds. ZB-Trust, a subsidiary of a German-Czech bank, says it initiated shake-ups but could never gather sufficient support from other shareholders. Institutional investors in the UK or US, while rarely forcing management changes, do drop the shares of companies with which they are unhappy. The large Czech funds do not. 'The majority of funds are very bureaucratic,' says Mr Tibor Nemes, director of the capital markets department of Ceska Sporitelna. ''Call me in a week after our investment committee meets and then we can decide,' they say.' Lack of experience is part of the problem. Mr Nemes talks dismissively of 'so-called fund managers' and says: 'They are not fund managers, they have no experience.' Another explanation is that fund managers are not primarily interested in pleasing their investors. The fee structure for Czech fund managers encourages them to increase the worth of the holdings they control, but not necessarily the return to shareholders. Standard fees are 2 per cent of net asset value a year. But there are many other ways of making fund management pay. At one extreme are the fraudsters that use their control to enrich themselves with little regard for shareholders. But some respectable fund managers also charge obscure 'management fees'. A more serious concern is that three of the top four fund managers are subsidiaries of state-influenced Czech banks. 'You take a company controlled by government and you sell to a bunch of funds controlled by banks controlled by government,' says Mr Harvey Schuster of Corus, a Czech-American fund. Government and banks deny that commands pass down this chain. But the banks' dual roles of lender and owner, through their funds, are confused, although they maintain that Chinese walls divide the parent company and its fund management subsidiary. Mr Alex Angell of brokers Wood &amp; Co suggests a conflict of interest exists. 'Large banks' funds have been using their influence to maintain banking links with the parent company,' he says. Bank funds may also be reluctant to file for bankruptcy and force a write-off on to the lending arm. Banks have brokerage as well as fund management subsidiaries. The temptation is to milk the fund management unit through excessive brokerage fees. However, none of this detracts from the broad success of the Czech Republic's mass privatisation. Abuses by fund managers occur in countries with far longer traditions of stockmarket capitalism. There is, moreover, a tradition of compromise in Czech business life. The passivity of the voucher funds may reflect that as much as encourage it. 'Czechs are much more likely to sit round a table than to pull the trigger,' says Mr Daniel Arbess, a partner at lawyers White &amp; Case. The Czech economy is still evolving. The dominance of funds may be a transitory phase. Already some western investors have bought them out in order to take control of Czech companies. Welsh Water's acquisition of a Czech water utility is a good example. Shares in SPT Telecom, the telecoms utility, are due to be distributed only next February in the second wave but New York hedge funds and Swiss private investors have already engaged in futures contracts to buy shares allocated to privatisation funds. It becomes harder to cast voucher privatisation as a mere restructuring of public ownership. Banks, the owners of fund managers, are moving into private ownership as they make rights issues to build up their capital base. Fund managers are themselves improving under the discipline of the market. ZB-Trust is the best regarded of the Czech bank funds. 'We want to be a professional investment company. Not just for voucher privatisation. We want to be good because we plan products in the future and we want to build up a track record,' says Mr Ales Barabas, member of the board of parent Zivnotenska Banka. The ultimate market discipline for fund managers is the threat of takeover. 'They are like any manager of any business; if it can be taken over they are going to care more,' says Mr Richard Wood, managing director of Wood &amp; Co. The threat is there. Funds are worth less than the sum of their parts. Out of 18 funds followed by Wood &amp; Co, 11 trade at discounts of more than a half to net asset value. Wood &amp; Co is trying to identify a small fund and help take it over for a demonstration effect that would revalue investments in all funds. 'That would be a theatrical event,' says Mr Wood. 'Once people see that it can happen discounts would decrease dramatically.' Some fund managers have foreseen takeover bids, however. The Harvard fund management group - run by controversial entrepreneur, Victor Kozeny - has instituted a 'poison pill' arrangement that makes it all but impossible to seize its funds. The Czechs have adopted the tricks of capitalism as well as its nobler principles.</p>

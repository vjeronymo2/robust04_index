			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The quest for sales in arid ground - A man who makes light-weight drills MANY people have bright ideas for equipment suited to the Third World. Peter Ball of Eureka is one of the few to turn them into a viable business. Ball went to Cambodia this summer to test a light, easy-to- use drilling rig he has designed for Oxfam. He is shortly returning there for the Irish agency CONCERN which has ordered one of his larger, standard models. He also has an inquiry for Somalia. Roger Newton of Oxfam says that the Ball drill with its deep reach has been very successful in enabling Oxfam's Cambodia team to tap vital water. Ball has been involved in drilling since 1972 when, after an engineering apprenticeship, he went to Ethiopia with a team from Tear Fund. The drill bit got stuck in soft ground down the first hole; but, in the harder rock of Tigray, they provided water for about 25 villages. In the early 1980s he won for his then employers, Hydreq, a Littlehampton drill-manufacturer, a contract for water for 44 villages in Nigeria's Kano state. A British engineer was planning a long-term water supplies. But the project also took a long time, requiring three years for the contract negotiations. Ball believed he could speed things up if he could get appropriate equipment into African hands. He left Hydreq and spent six months designing his own rig. The result is a drill, the standard model of which, with associated equipment, costs Pounds 18,000, half the price of conventional gear. But the big saving, he says, is in management time, operator-training and workshop back-up. A crew can go off into the bush with a Eureka rig on a trailer towed by a Land Rover. The rig is mechanical, not hydraulic, which makes it easier for operators inexperienced in handling equipment. A Honda engine rotates the drill: the operators apply the downward force. It can be used in both hard and soft rock. It has a mud tank in which rubbish from the hole settles out of the drilling fluid, allowing this to be reused. Normally engineers use a mud pit but Peter Ball had noticed that Nigerian drillers found it hard to get these pits the right size. With a recommendation from Robin Temple-Hazell, a Bath hydrologist who has spent a lifetime prospecting for water in Nigeria, he got an order for his first rig from a World Bank-funded agricultural project in Bauchi state. The Nigerians wanted to see a videotape of the rig before they would pay the air freight. But it worked well, and Ball has sold over 30, built for him by CSA Engineering of Capel, near Dorking. Eureka turned over Pounds 175,000 in the last year, yielding a small profit of Pounds 5,000 for reinvestment and providing Ball and his wife  - who looks after the books - with enough to live on. They finance the business with an overdraft secured on their home. The bulk of Ball's rigs are used to provide water for irrigation. He is sad that only four are working on village water supplies and that he has made no sales outside Nigeria and Cambodia. Consultants are conservative. Tenderers often want two competitive quotes; and Eureka does not have a direct competitor. You have to wait for chances, and hang in, he says. Village water contracts commonly go to outside contractors. Ball argues that, since one bore hole with hand pump can supply only 120 people, villages need a local rig to keep on drilling after the contractor has gone. Interesting aid agencies in his rigs proved difficult until Oxfam approached him. It had found a light rig (designed by an East European) more adaptable and less expensive in Cambodia than a conventional rig mounted on a lorry. Ball's Eureka can drill an eight-inch hole to a depth of 60 metres. Oxfam asked him to design a lighter six-inch, 30-metre version. The new rig has in fact drilled to 45 metres in Cambodia and is adaptable to different types of rock and ground and to different tasks. One of Oxfam's aims is to use it to find sites for dug wells, which can supply more villagers than a hand pump. Dry British summers brought Ball inquiries about bore holes for garden watering. These gave him a chance to use the Eureka rig in Britain and brought so many orders that he teamed up with another drilling firm. About a third of the holes they bored are for gardens, a third for golf courses and a third for farms. They drilled a 12-inch hole to water the greenhouses at Ford Open Prison. But 1992's wet summer dried up orders, and Ball's focus is again overseas. Eureka UK Ltd, 11 The Quadrant, Hassocks BN6 8BP: 0273-844333</p>

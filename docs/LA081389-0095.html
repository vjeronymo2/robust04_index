			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Striking ethnic Russian workers in the Soviet Baltic republic of Estonia  pledged to continue their protest action against a new local voting law that  disenfranchises recent immigrants, many of whom are Russians. Izvestia, the  Soviet government newspaper, said that 40,000 workers are on strike. A  spokesman for the Estonian Popular Front movement, set up last year to promote  autonomy and democratic reform, told Reuters news agency in Moscow by telephone  from the capital, Tallinn, that there was no sign of any disruption in the  city. However, Vladimir Vinogradov, a spokesman for the Russian group  Interdvizhenie, organized as a counter to the Popular Front, said the strike  against the new election law will continue.  </P></p>

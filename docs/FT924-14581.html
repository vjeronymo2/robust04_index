			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Employers deliver gloomy assessment of growth THE Japanese government's official target for growth of 3.5 per cent in the year to next March was hanging by a thread last night after employers' leaders delivered a gloomy assessment of the economy's prospects despite the emergency package announced in late August. The Federation of Economic Organisations told the government it would have to take further measures to stimulate the recovery after a survey of its leading members found that most expected growth of 2.6 per cent this year. Many Japanese economists, financiers and industrialists regard sustained growth of below 3 per cent to be a 'growth recession' in an economy which in the late 1980s was used to expansion of more than 5 per cent a year. The employers' doubts were given added weight by a flurry of reports in which economists reduced their forecasts for growth over the next two years to well below the official government target. With the initial euphoria over the August package fading, the government is under increasing pressure to consider tax cuts next year to revitalise the economy. Mr Shizuka Kamei, vice-chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy affairs research council, renewed calls from within the party for the government to force the Ministry of Finance to relax its opposition to increased borrowing to finance higher public spending. Mr Kamei said there would be a tax shortfall of Y5,000bn (Pounds 24.6bn) this year. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the Employers' Federation chairman called on the government to introduce an additional programme to stimulate the economy after delivering the bleak survey results to the Economic Planning Agency. The Federation said a majority of companies welcomed the emergency Y10,700bn package announced in August, but criticised both the government and the Bank of Japan for acting too late to stimulate the economy. Although most employers believed the economy would recover from next spring, many forecast that it would then grow only slowly. Several doubted whether the Y8,600bn public investment programme which forms the core of the special package could be implemented by next March. The Federation called for cuts in income and corporation taxes, a review of land and securities taxation, looser monetary policy and an examination of whether indirect taxes should be raised to finance tax cuts elsewhere. The Japan Research Institute also called for a further Y4,000bn cut in income taxes, while the Nomura Research Institute called for an additional package of Y6,000bn. Japan's machine tool industry is facing a severe contraction after a 45 per cent drop in new orders in August, compared with last year. The Machine Tool Builders Association said the fall mainly reflected a prolonged slump in orders from the car industry, which is cutting back on investment. Orders from the car industry fell 55.4 per cent from the year before. The association warned that the decline in orders was likely to last for several months as investment plans are cut back to reduce costs and raise profitability.</p>

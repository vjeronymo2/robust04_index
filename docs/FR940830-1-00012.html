			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order for any CDC-owned business to participate in the 8(a) program, SBA would apply the basic management and control requirements imposed by the Small Business Act for 8(a) program participation. Thus, the proposed rule would require that CDC-owned applicant concerns must be managed by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would also make changes, as needed, in various other eligibility and 8(a) contracting requirements. These changes are identified below in the section by section analysis of this proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section By Section Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a section by section analysis of each provision of SBA's regulations that would be affected by this proposed rule: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 121.906(b)(1)(iv) and 121.1106(b)(1)(iv) would be amended to permit a small business non-manufacturer to supply other than a product made in the United States for a small business set-aside or 8(a) contract where the procuring agency makes a non-availability determination pursuant to &sect;25.102(a)(4) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. There has been some confusion as to whether a non-manufacturer could qualify as a small business if there was such a non-availability determination under the Buy American Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. SBA did not intend to exclude non-manufacturers from small business set-aside and 8(a) contracts where such a non-availability determination has been made. This clarification should clear up any ambiguity in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 121.1104 would be amended to impose its provisions on competitive as well as sole source 8(a) contracting opportunities. Heretofore, this regulation was inconsistent with competitive contracting procedures. Other minor changes for purposes of improved clarity would also be made to this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 121.1703(b) would be amended to clarify that only the AA/MSB&amp;COD can appeal a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code assigned by a procuring agency contracting officer to either a sole source or a competitive 8(a) requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> discussion relating to proposed &sect;124.307(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.100 would be amended by adding definitions of the terms ``CDC-owned concern'', ``Clear and convincing evidence'', and ``Community Development Corporation or CDC''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``Unconditional ownership'' in &sect;124.100 would be amended to explain that a disadvantaged owner may use his/her ownership interest (e.g., stock) in an applicant or 8(a) concern as collateral for financing during the normal course of business without affecting his/her ``unconditional'' ownership in such concern, provided that complete control of the ownership interest remains with the disadvantaged owner absent any default in fulfilling the terms of the financing. However, events of default must be defined in commercially reasonable ways. Events of default beyond those that are deemed commercially reasonable could lead to a conclusion that unconditional ownership is not in the hands of the disadvantaged owner. This clarification is not intended to require a concern to obtain financing through a financial institution or to preclude, for example, seller-financed transactions. It is intended only to permit financing terms that are reasonable within the marketplace. This change is essential to ensure that applicant and 8(a) concerns have the flexibility they need to raise necessary capital. The requirement that disadvantaged owners ``unconditionally'' own and control an applicant or 8(a) concern should not restrict a firm's ability to raise capital under normal commercial terms and conditions to assist it in becoming viable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would eliminate the definitions for ``local buy'' and ``national buy'' requirements from &sect;124.100. All requirements other than construction requirements would be open to eligible 8(a) Participants nationally. To the extent possible, SBA seeks to lift restrictions that are otherwise not imposed in procurements conducted other than through the 8(a) program. This would result in all eligible 8(a) concerns nationally being able to submit offers in response to competitive 8(a) solicitations. In addition, a Program Participant could market and seek sole source 8(a) requirements nationally. Construction requirements would be exempt from this change because section 8(a)(11) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(11), requires, ``to the maximum extent practicable,'' that 8(a) construction contracts ``be awarded within the county or State where the work is to be performed.'' The proposed rule would make necessary changes in &sect;124.308(d), &sect;124.308(f), revised &sect;124.311(d), (old &sect;124.311(e)), revised &sect;124.311(e) (old &sect;124.311(f)), and revised &sect;124.311(f) (old &sect;124.311(h)) to eliminate the local and national buy concepts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would make minor technical changes to &sect;&sect;124.101(a), 124.101(b), 124.102(a), 124.103, 124.104, and 124.109(d) to recognize that CDC-owned concerns would be eligible for participation in the 8(a) program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 124.101(a), 124.104 and 124.206(a) would be amended to clarify that the AA/MSB&amp;COD's decision to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program participation would be based on whether the applicant concern complied with each of SBA's eligibility criteria at the time the concern's completed application for admission to the 8(a) program is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing or, in the case of a request for reconsideration, at the time the reconsideration application is deemed to be complete by SBA's Central Office. A change in circumstances submitted by an applicant concern subsequent to the date that an application or reconsideration action is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing would not be considered, unless it causes a loss of eligibility. The structure of the concern, including all necessary corporate formalities, would have to be in place prior to the Office of MSB&amp;COD's processing of an application or request for reconsideration. A disadvantaged individual's ability to immediately change the applicant's structure or effect a change in its control so that actual control of the concern is in the hands of disadvantaged individuals and/or other eligibility criteria are met would not satisfy the requirement that they be met at the time of the completed application. The rule would specify, however, that SBA, in its sole discretion, could request clarification of information contained in the application at any stage in the application process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Thai Airways offer sells well THAI investors have responded eagerly to the public offer of 40m shares of Thai Airways International, and brokers expect the issue to be oversubscribed, Reuter reports from Bangkok. 'It has become a fashion to hold a share with good fundamentals,' said a broker at Ekachart Finance and Securities. 'People want the share because it is the first state enterprise to enter the stock market, and it's cheap.' The national carrier on Monday began offering to the public its Bt10 shares at Bt60 each. Subscriptions close on March 27.</p>

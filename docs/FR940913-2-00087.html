			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. KRT did not, during the period May 1, through October 31, 1992 make every good effort to recruit and employ women. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. On February 4, 1993, OFCCP notified KRT that its untimely filing of the first personnel activity report, its failure to specifically request affirmative action job orders when it contacted the Job Service, and its failure to make every good faith effort to recruit and employ women during the period from May 1, through October 31, 1992, violated the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. KRT's second personnel activity report was due on May 10, 1993, and was to cover the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. On May 7, 1993, KRT filed with OFCCP a letter stating that there had been no hiring activity, and hence no contact with linkage or recruitment sources, during the period covered by the second report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. OFCCP contacted and visited KRT during June and July 1993 in an effort to confirm KRT's representation that there had been no hiring activity during the six months preceding the May 7, 1993, letter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. KRT's letter to OFCCP of May 7, 1993, misstated KRT's hiring activity during the preceding six months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. During the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993, KRT failed to maintain personnel records including hire dates, termination dates and applicant information as required by the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. KRT hired at least twenty seven individuals during the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. KRT did not contact the linkage organizations agencies regarding vacancies filled during the period from November 1, 1992, through March 30, 1993, and did not request those sources to supply applicants for any of these positions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. On September 14, 1993, OFCCP notified KRT of its determination that the company had violated its obligations under the Conciliation Agreement. OFCCP provided KRT 15 days in which to respond. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. KRT failed to demonstrate within the 15-day period that it did abide by the terms of the Conciliation Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. On July 12, 1994, OFCCP filed an Administrative Complaint in this matter and served upon KRT Requests for Admission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. To date, KRT has not answered either the Administrative Complaint or the Requests for Admission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Conclusions of Law <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Office of Administrative Law Judges has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Sections 201, 208, and 209 of Executive Order 11246, and 41 CFR 60&hyph;1.26 and 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;30 of the Secretary of Labor's implementing regulations, and is empowered to issue a final order determining whether KRT is in current violation of its obligations under the Executive Order and its implementing regulations and to recommend appropriate remedies and sanctions. 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. KRT is a Government contractor, subcontractor or Federally assisted construction contractor within the meaning of the Executive Order. At all material times KRT has been subject to the contractual obligations imposed on Government contractors and subcontractors by the Executive Order, and the implementing regulations issued thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. At all material times, KRT has been required to abide by the affirmative action requirements set forth in 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. KRT breached its obligations under the Conciliation Agreement entered into on June 16, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. KRT's actions as described in the Findings of Fact, above, violate Executive Order 11246, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Executive Order, and its implementing regulations authorize sanctions, including contract cancellation and debarment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 209 of the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Sanctions are appropriate when, as here, a contractor has failed to abide by the terms of a conciliation agreement, and is in violation of the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Under the applicable regulation where, as here, a defendant fails to answer an administrative complaint or to request a hearing within 20 days of service of that complaint, its right to a hearing shall be deemed waived and the Administrative Law Judge shall order the sanctions and remedies sought in the administrative complaint. 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. For these reasons, I order that all of KRT's Federal contracts and subcontracts immediately be canceled and that KRT or Construction Associates, its officers, agents, subsidiaries, and successors (including Construction Associates), be declared ineligible to receive any Government contracts or subcontracts or for extensions or other modifications of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts, for a period of at least 210 days, and thereafter until KRT has demonstrated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it is currently in compliance with the provisions of the Executive Order and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that it has undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance, including identifying and making whole any victims of its past noncompliance, and that it will carry out employment practices in compliance with the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

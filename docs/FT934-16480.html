			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Tales of human interest: The Council of Europe is an important defender of minority rights This weekend, in Vienna, the Council of Europe will hold its first ever summit meeting. The most common reaction to that piece of information is blank incomprehension. Remarkably few people seem to have any idea what the Council of Europe is. Even among those who know of its existence, many imagine it as yet another talking shop which, while it may once have had a useful role, could be dispensed with now. They could hardly be more wrong. In the words of Mr Jeremy Greenstock, assistant undersecretary at the UK Foreign Office, it is 'the one institution in Europe at the moment which is matching its machinery to its rhetoric'. The Council suffers, of course, from confusion with the EC, and that is understandable. Its headquarters are in Strasbourg, and its parliamentary assembly uses the same chamber as the European Parliament. To make matters worse, the EC has twice-yearly summits under the name of 'European Council'. But it was the Council of Europe, not the EC, that drew up the European Convention on Human Rights - a unique document in that it allows individuals to seek redress against their own government in a supranational court. The existence of a commission to investigate such complaints and a court to hear them puts this convention in a quite different category from the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which is habitually violated by many of the governments that have signed it. The Council is a club of democracies, and it takes that description very seriously - unlike the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which in 1990 proclaimed all sorts of high-sounding principles and then opened its arms to a whole host of ex-Soviet and ex-Yugoslav republics, some of which do not even pretend to apply those principles. The Council has been much choosier. To qualify, you have to have both an executive and a legislature which clearly derive from free and fair, multi-party elections. You must have a free press and - the most contentious point - you must make a show of respecting minority rights. Above all, you must sign and undertake to ratify rapidly the human rights convention - including, nowadays, its provisions on the right of individual petition and on the compulsory jurisdiction of the court. Slovakia only scraped in last June, after promising to repeal laws that discriminated against ethnic Hungarians, notably by banning the use of non-Slovak Christian names on official documents. And last week the parliamentary assembly voted to admit Romania, despite doubts about its human rights record. In both cases, Hungary was persuaded, with some difficulty, that the rights of Hungarian minorities could be better safeguarded by obtaining undertakings from the states concerned, and then monitoring their implementation, than by keeping them out in the cold. (There is a valuable precedent for dealing with backsliders: in 1970, Greece, then under military rule, resigned from the Council, forestalling expulsion by minutes, after being found guilty of torturing political prisoners. It was readmitted after the restoration of democracy in 1974.) Other former communist states that have gained admission are Hungary itself, Poland, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. Latvia, Albania, Russia, Ukraine, Croatia, Belarus and Moldova have applied for membership, but have yet to meet the standards set. Their leaders will have a special meeting with the existing members on Friday morning, before the summit proper gets under way. Why are governments so keen to get in? The Council has no divisions and no 'cohesion' funds. It can guarantee no one's security, and has little to offer economically. But the badge of belonging to the club of European democracies is important to the self-respect of post-communist countries, and to the legitimacy of their governments. Moreover, although there is no formal connection between the Council and the EC, it is unthinkable that the latter would consider an application from any state the former had rejected on human rights grounds. So the Council has gained in importance since the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe. It is playing a significant role in bringing the two halves of Europe together again - a role the summit is intended to solemnise. It will also discuss at least two areas where the Council's machinery badly needs improvement. On the table will be proposals to streamline the human rights procedure, so that it no longer takes five or six years for the average case to reach a conclusion; and a draft additional protocol to the human rights convention, dealing specifically with the rights of national minorities. Unhappily, on both issues the UK government (which will be represented by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor - Mr John Major being otherwise engaged at his party's annual conference) is dragging its feet. It wants to keep a two-tier structure for the court of human rights, with provision for appeals  -although the court is already effectively an appeal court, addressed only when domestic legal remedies are exhausted  - and it objects to any justiciable protection of national minorities on the grounds that these are too difficult to define and (according to Mr Greenstock) more than 200 linguistic groups within the UK might qualify. Given the gravity of ethnic conflicts, the fragility of new democracies, and the need for legal remedies as an alternative to violence, these objections seem rather frivolous. Is Britain determined to fiddle while eastern Europe burns?</p>

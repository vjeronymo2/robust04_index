			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Speaking to this station, Costa Rican  President-elect Jose Maria Figueres offered to cooperate with  President Cesar Gaviria as the new OAS secretary general and  said that Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus' reaction  is purely personal.    [Begin recording] [Figueres] I congratulate President  Gaviria  and tell him that Costa Rica and other Latin American OAS member  countries will always be willing to support worthwhile causes in  Latin America.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the United States had  its hand in the election?    [Figueres] There was a democratic process in which every  country voted for the person it regarded as the best to  consolidate leadership at the OAS. Therefore, I congratulate  President Gaviria for his victory.    [Reporter] Your opinion on Foreign Minister Niehaus' remarks  on the behavior of other countries' foreign ministers and the  United States?    [Figueres] I am sure that Foreign Minister Niehaus spoke  from  a personal viewpoint and that his position does not represent  the Costa Rican Government's position, let alone that of the  government that will assume office on 8 May.

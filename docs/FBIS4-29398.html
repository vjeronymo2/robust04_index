			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk by </F> FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW correspondent Nate Thayer, in  Beijing on 11 June: "Nude, Absolutely Naked"]    [Text] Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk has revealed that  North Korean President Kim Il-song had asked him on June 1 to  pass a message to the United States about tensions on the Korean  peninsula, but "I have had no opportunity to tell (U.S.)  officials," the king told the REVIEW.    "Kim II-song is my best friend," Sihanouk said, "He told me  this: `please tell your American friends, brother Sihanouk, for  my part I will not be the aggressor in a possible war . . . but  if the Americans or others start the war we are ready to  respond. We are prepared to face a big war and it will not be  victorious. We will be able to resist and avoid defeat. They  will be able to destroy the infrastructure of Korea, but we have  our underground equipment and we will be able to resist even an  atomic war'."    Sihanouk quoted Kim as telling him: "We do not need to  negotiate with the UN or others, but we need direct negotiations  with the United States of America."    According to Sihanouk, Kim said: "The reason we refuse  inspection in depth is just this: we only have secret defence  systems and organisations and the Americans know, perhaps, that  we have no nuclear weapons, but they want to know what exactly  our defence system with conventional weapons is. That is the  reason they want the UN atomic agency to make inspections in  depth. We cannot accept that. Besides the question of our  sovereignty and national dignity and pride, we have our secrets."    Kim told Sihanouk: "Please compare us to a man: They want us  to take off our shirt, our coat, and now our trousers, and after  that we will be nude, absolutely naked. What they want us to be  is a man without defence secrets, just a naked man. We cannot  accept that. We would rather accept a war. If they decide to  make war, we accept the war, the challenge we are prepared for."    Sihanouk told the REVIEW: "I think the warning should be  taken seriously. On the one hand, Kim II-song wants me to say a  few words to America. So I have a golden opportunity with you  to tell America . . . the words were not hostile at all. But  he says `we are prepared, and if America wants a war with us,  OK, we accept' . . . on the other hand, Washington more or less  despises Sihanouk .... He (Kim) prefers negotiations--even  without positive results--the continuation of negotiations . . .  he said tell your American friends, but I have had no  opportunity to tell the officials. No, I don't, need to tell  the officials, as I have been telling you; (anyway) they despise  me."</p>

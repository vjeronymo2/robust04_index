			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (19): A tour of the gnomes' grottos - Night-life: Though it may not be that exciting, Zurich has something for everyone, from Latin American music to a panorama bar Compared to that of London or Paris, Zurich's night-life is small town stuff. Still, there is something for almost everyone, from Latin American music at the old stock exchange to the Jules Verne panorama bar for the star-struck. On the right bank of the Limmat, night-life centres on the medieval part of Zurich, stretching along Limmatquai between Central and Bellevue. The Polygon (Rothus, Marktgasse 17) offers a variety show and dancing, while the Limmatbar (Limmatquai 82) with its loud music, attracts a young clientele. For a drink and to observe the night-life in full swing, the bar of the Konigstuhl (Stussihofstatt 3) is recommended. You can watch the comings and goings of le tout Zurich from the comfort of an enormous black and white striped sofa. Or have a peaceful, pre-midnight drink at the Splendid Hotel's piano bar (Rosengasse 5). After midnight, the bar tends to become very noisy and crowded. Close to Bellevue is the Odeon (Limmatquai 2), featuring big chandeliers and marble walls. Once frequented by Zurich's artists and writers, the Odeon lost much of its glory when the bar was split in two and the balcony removed. One side of the bar now houses a chemist and all efforts to restore it have come to naught. A few steps up the hill from Bellevue brings you to the quiet Kronenhalle bar (Ramistrasse 4), which is attached to the famous restaurant and where the drinks are good. Or head south across Bellevue to the Spaghetti Factory, known as something of a meat market. On the left bank, traders and bankers often convene at the Old Fashion Bar (Fraumunsterstrasse 15) for after-work drinks. Another yuppy favourite is the Savoy Hotel Bar on Paradeplatz. For something more exotic, try the Jules Verne bar (appropriately in Uraniastrasse 9) for a view of Zurich by night or some serious star-gazing. Take the lift in the Brasserie Lipp on the ground floor to the 11th floor to reach Zurich's only panorama bar. Be prepared to wait for a place. When Jules Verne closes at midnight, make your way to the nearby Roxy disco in Beatengasse 11. Kaufleuten at Pelikanplatz is favoured by the city's young bankers and beautiful people. The front part of the bar is narrow and noisy, but if you go through the connecting door at the back of the bar and around the corner, you will find yourself in a ballroom with a long bar, comfortable velvet sofas and a gleaming parquet floor. This part of the bar turns into a disco at weekends and is sometimes used for concerts during the week. As a fitting conclusion to your tour of the gnomes' grottos, go to the old stock exchange building (Bleicherweg 5) where the erstwhile main trading ring has been converted into a Latin American bar, the El Cubanito. Unlike the stock exchange, it is open only on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>

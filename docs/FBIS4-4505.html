			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement issued by Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Chang Ki-ho on 1 April, the government appraised it was an  appropriate measure that the UN Security Council [UNSC] urged  North Korea to accept additional inspections and requested the  Secretary General of the International Atomic Energy Agency  report the result of the negotiation.    The government said the UNSC presidential statement reflects  the international community's deep concern over the seriousness  of the North Korean nuclear issue and the resolute will to  resolve the issue.

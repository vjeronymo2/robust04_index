			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Police chiefs seek deal on Sheehy CHIEF constables yesterday presented the government with compromise proposals aimed at negotiating around some of the more contentious recommendations of the Sheehy report. The Association of Chief Police Officers said in its formal response to the Sheehy inquiry into police roles and responsibilities that there were 'alternative solutions to the identified problems which are less complex, less costly, and at least equally effective'. Relations between Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, and the police service have soured since the report was published in June. Last week Sir Patrick described police critics of his proposals as 'demagogues.' The response seeks to cool the debate, expressing gratitude to the inquiry for identifying areas of concern and saying many of the recommendations offered 'substantial potential benefits'. But it remains critical of many of the core recommendations. It says that, while sympathetic to linking pay to appraisal, the Sheehy recommendations for performance related pay are too complex, and the recommendations for a lower starting rate would endanger recruitment and retention of high-calibre officers. Proposals to abolish the ranks of chief inspector, chief superintendent and deputy chief constable failed to recognise operational requirements, while recommendations for fixed-term appointments were out of all proportion to the problems of underperformance. Moves already under way to introduce a flatter management structure have, say the chief constables, led to the disappearance of 350 senior posts since 1990 - a figure that is likely to reach 1,000 in the next two or three years. The recommendations will face further criticism at the conference of the Police Superintendents Association later this week. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, who is due address the conference on Wednesday, is consulting on the proposals month.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (9): Cheaper loans absorb less of your income - Housing market ON THE FACE of it, there are good grounds for optimism in the housing market. Base rates fell from a high of 15 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent at the end of January. Mortgage rates correspondingly dropped from 15.4 per cent to 7.99 per cent over the same period. With mortgage payments so comprehensively reduced, housing affordability has increased. A statistical analysis undertaken by the FT shows that, with mortgage rates of 7.99 per cent, servicing the loan on an average-priced house now takes 17.8 per cent of average gross income, compared with 45.1 per cent in 1990 when base rates were 15 per cent. This affordability ratio is almost down to 1972 levels of 17.35 per cent. The calculation divides average monthly earnings by the amount needed to finance an 80 per cent mortgage for the average-priced house at prevailing interest rates. Prevailing tax reliefs are taken into account. As affordability increases, the hope is that first-time buyers will return to the market, pushing up demand and prices. But the problems afflicting the market are many, and the single remedy of falling interest rates appears to be inadequate. Confidence. Building societies and estate agents are the first to admit that this is what the market now needs. Mortgage rates have fallen as low as they are likely to go. Only half a percentage point of the one point base-rate cut on January 26 is being passed on to mortgage holders. Building societies are now thinking of their savers rather than their borrowers and, if there is another base-rate cut, they are unlikely to pass on more than a fraction of it. In any case, mortgage rates are historically low. You would need to go back to October 1971 to find mortgage rates of 8 per cent, and even further back  -to April 1968 - for rates of 7.63 per cent. The question is no longer affordability but confidence. With unemployment continuing to rise and green shoots of recovery stunted, people still feel economically insecure and prefer to reduce their debts rather than to spend money. Prices. Another reason why first-time buyers are holding back is nervousness about the level of house prices. Whenever the floor appears to have been reached, another Halifax house price index shows prices dropping yet further. Expectations last year that prices would finally stabilise were dashed when the Halifax index showed that house prices had fallen by just under 8 per cent in the year to December 1992. The problem of negative equity - where the value of the house has fallen below the size of the loan - may be a problem confined almost completely to the south-east, where price falls have also been greatest. But the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research group, estimates that the problem affects one in five homes bought in the last five years to November 1992. Potential buyers still have to be convinced that they are not buying a falling asset before they enter the market. Supply. Lack of demand and high levels of repossessions, caused by the inability of some homeowners to meet their mortgage payments, have combined to increase the availability of housing stock. Repossessions have a further depressing effect on the market by dragging down prices, too. According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, repossessions fell from their 1991 peak of 75,540 to 68,540 at the end of last year. The main reason for the 9 per cent drop was increased willingness on the part of lenders to accept lower payments until the borrower could afford to pay more. Partly as a result of this, more than 350,000 households were six months behind in their mortgage payments by the end of December - the highest figure ever and an increase of 28 per cent on the 1991 total of 275,350. Although Mark Boleat, director-general of the CML, is optimistic that repossessions will continue to fall, others are not so sure. John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expects repossessions to increase next year, and high levels of repossessions to continue for the next three years. This oversupply of property is likely to continue to act as a drag on house prices. The Pounds 750m announced in the Autumn Statement by the government for housing corporations to buy up 20,000 empty homes should ease some of the oversupply, although this figure is thought to represent only 10 per cent of the total number of empty properties on the market. These negative factors are likely to inhibit a quick recovery of house prices, despite low mortgage rates. Halifax, the largest mortgage lender, says it expects prices to stabilise this spring, with its estate agents reporting a significant increase in demand by prospective buyers to view houses. But it does not expect to see any price increases until the second half of the year, leading to a more sustained recovery in 1994. Mr Wriglesworth has become more optimistic about the prospects for recovery. He has abandoned his forecast of a drop of 5 per cent in house prices by the end of this year, and now expects no price change. While homeowners may not regard these projections with much joy, they do indicate that the property market may finally be at its floor. This means that those who have held back from buying could afford to be less cautious, though they do not need to hurry because the indications are that they have plenty of time before prices start to rise. This is also likely to be the time to take out a fixed-rate mortgage. The problem is that the lowest rates come from the shortest-term fixes - fixing for a long term may involve paying more than your current variable rate. That might be a hard pill to swallow. It is important, however, to watch out for stiff early-redemption penalties, the cost of tied-in insurance-related products and high application fees. These bear particularly hard on short-term fixes.</p>

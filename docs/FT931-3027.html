			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Lower-rate band widened by Pounds 500 but allowances frozen - Tax allowances This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. THE Chancellor proposed to: increase the width of the lower rate band by Pounds 500 to Pounds 2,500 from 1993-94, and by a further Pounds 500 to Pounds 3,000 from 1994-95; keep at their current level the rates of tax, the allowances, and the basic rate limit above which higher rate tax is paid. The increase in the lower rate band will benefit all taxpayers with an income more than the new lower rate limit (a minimum of Pounds 5,945 for someone under 65) by 48p per week. The tax reductions, including any tax overpaid from April 6, will generally be in pay packets on the first pay day after May 17. A total of 4.9m people - an increase of 1m over 1992-93 - will pay tax at the lower rate only in 1993-94. The intention is to continue towards establishing 20 per cent as the basic rate of tax. The statutory indexation provisions will be overridden. These adjust the main allowances and tax thresholds in line with the percentage increase in the retail prices index unless parliament decides otherwise. The yield in 1993-94 from holding all allowances and thresholds unchanged would have been Pounds 730m (compared with statutory indexation). Against that, the widening of the lower rate band will cost about Pounds 370m. So the net yield of these income tax proposals will be about Pounds 360m. New tax tables including the wider lower rate band will be sent shortly to employers. The design of the tables has been improved. They will be applied on the first pay day after May 17 when employees will begin to get the benefit of the widening of the band. Because no change is being made in the allowances, most current code numbers will continue to apply in 1993-94. Some employees will however already have received a different code number for 1993-94 because of a change in their circumstances. People whose codes include adjustments for car benefits will also get new codes to take account of the Budget changes to these. This is the last year in which Budget changes to PAYE codes will be made after the tax year has already started. The move to a unified Budget in November will mean that in future most people will get their final new codes before the start of the year. Self-assessment and simplification of personal tax A major reform of the system for assessing personal tax will be introduced. The reform is designed to make the process of making tax returns and payments simpler and fairer. The new system will apply from the 1996-97 tax year. Legislation in the 1994 Finance Bill will: abolish the complex 'preceding year' basis of income tax for the self-employed; give all those who complete tax returns the option of self-assessment that is working out their own tax bill; give them one tax statement, with one tax bill, for all their income. These proposals pave the way for the most fundamental reform of personal tax administration in almost 50 years. The proposals are expected to affect about 8m people. They are the 4m people whose main source of income is from self-employment or investments, and some 4m employees and pensioners who receive tax returns. The Inland Revenue has published two consultative documents on proposals to simplify the system for assessing personal tax. In response there has been wide acceptance that the existing system should be reformed, and that the proposals are generally the right way forward. The chancellor has therefore decided that the changes should proceed. The proposals are designed to make things simpler for most of the self-employed, and make personal tax easier to understand. And self-assessment will allow taxpayers more control over their tax affairs, if they take up the option of working out their own tax bill. The changes are fully consistent with, and will help, the Inland Revenue's programme of change leading to improved service for the taxpayer. The new rules will apply to everyone who receives a tax return, and will first apply to the tax year 1996-97. The proposals will not affect the large majority of employees for whom the PAYE and deduction at source arrangements already collect the right amount of tax, and who are not sent returns to complete each year. Nor will they affect people who claim repayment of tax on bank and building society interest and dividends, using the new simplified claim forms. The returns for 1996-97 will be issued in April 1997, and the first completed self-assessment returns will be due at the beginning of 1998. Taxpayers who ask the Inland Revenue to work out their tax bill will have to complete their return by October 1997. The main proposals will be spelt out in more detail, following further consultation, this autumn. But, briefly, they are to: tax all income on a common current year basis, with trading profits being taxed in the year of assessment which includes the accounts year-end; bring together all of a taxpayer's income on one tax statement, with one tax bill; allow taxpayers to choose whether to assess themselves and work out how much tax is due on their total income for the year or to ask the Inland Revenue to make the assessment on the taxpayer's own figures. Despite the administrative benefits of fiscal accounting (that is to say, requiring taxpayers to align their accounts with the fiscal year), the Chancellor believes that it would be wrong to compel people to draw up their accounts to any given date. At present people with more than one source of income can be taxed on a variety of preceding year and current year bases, with different tax payment dates. And for the self-employed there are special rules for assessing the profits of the first three and last three years of the business. The Chancellor's proposals are designed to sweep away these complications. The rules for the transition to the new system of taxing the self-employed will be framed to maintain the flow of tax to the Exchequer, while ensuring that businesses are not taxed twice. They will therefore be assessed to tax for the transitional year 1996-97 on the average of their profits for that year and the previous one. This means that, broadly, the equivalent of one year's profits will not be taxed. This will balance the additional liability incurred when the business was started and the first year's profits formed the basis of assessment for more than one year. There will be further discussions about the form of the transitional relief when a business ceases after the change. Taxpayers who complete returns will normally have to deal with the Revenue only once or twice a year, when they send in their returns and payments. In most cases these would be accepted without any further enquiries or correspondence, but the Revenue would have the right to check any return and taxpayers would be notified of returns selected for later examination. Taxpayers would be liable to additional charges if they failed to send in payments, returns and accounts on time. The Inland Revenue will continue to consult on the detailed arrangements that will be needed to make the new system work. Costs to taxpayers and the Inland Revenue The changes will largely do away with the current system of estimated assessments, appeals, postponements, appeal hearings, agreement of profits after checking returns and revision of assessments. This should produce substantial savings in time and effort for taxpayers and the Inland Revenue. There should also be further savings for taxpayers from the simpler rules, which would make it easier for them to deal with their own tax affairs. But the Inland Revenue will still work out their tax bills if they cannot, or do not want to, do it themselves. Some have said that the reforms timetable that was originally suggested would not allow taxpayers, their advisers and employers sufficient time to prepare for the new system. The Chancellor has responded to this by deferring the start date by one year from that implied in the November consultative document. Further consultation In devising the detailed rules for the new system, the government will wish to consult closely, particularly with representative bodies and employers, to ensure that the proposals are implemented as smoothly as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Syria Criticizes Washington </F> for Supplying Israel With Arms"]    [Text] Damascus, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed  Arab sources in Cairo have said that U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher intends to send Ambassador Dennis Ross, U.S.  general coordinator of the bilateral negotiations, to the Middle  East before the end of the month to make shuttle trips between  Damascus and Tel Aviv before Christopher's new tour, which is  expected to begin in July.    The sources said that Dennis Ross will carry with him new  Israeli proposals regarding the negotiations on the  Syrian-Israeli track and an amendment to the Israeli plan on  withdrawal from "Majdal Shams First" so as to include in the  first phase a withdrawal from five villages on the Golan  Heights, then diplomatic relations would be established between  Syria and Tel Aviv.    The sources said that Syria has told the U.S. Administration  that the guarantees offered to it so far under the Israeli plan  are insufficient and conflict with the basic principles of the  bilateral negotiations and the need for Israel's commitment to a  full withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the implementation of  the land for peace principle, and that security guarantees  concern not only Israel, but all the parties concerned.    The sources pointed out that the U.S. administration is  seeking to get Syria to agree to resume bilateral negotiations  on the Syrian-Israeli track, especially after Jordan's agreement  to resume negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track.    In the context of a new tour of the region for U.S.  Secretary  of State Warren Christopher in a new bid to revive peace  opportunities between Syria and Israel, Syria has expressed its  indignation at the Israeli position and the Rabin government's  continued refusal to withdraw, which, in the Syrian officials'  view, freezes the peace process and keeps it at a standstill.    A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that what  Rabin said, namely that there has been nothing new with regard  to the talks with Syria and the existence of huge gaps between  the Syrian and Israeli positions on the peace process, is  attributable to the fact that the Rabin government continues to  deal with the basis of the peace process from the angle of  retaining the Golan and not withdrawing fully from the occupied  Arab territories, thus exposing itself as a party that has no  desire for a just and comprehensive peace. Meanwhile the Syrian  position is fully responsive to the requirements of peace and to  all the political efforts being made to achieve it on the basis  of just and comprehensive foundations. Syria proceeds from its  eagerness to achieve a secure and lasting peace that cannot be  shaken by storms.    The Syrian official said that, if Israel is really and  seriously seeking peace, all it has to do is to withdraw fully  from the Arab territories, implement the resolutions of  international legitimacy in order to achieve peace in the  region, and stop -- it and its leader -- swimming against the  tide.    Meanwhile a Syrian military official has told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT that Israeli armament is a threat to the region's  security and stability. And that Israeli military thinking --  regardless of the costs -- is working to make Israel a military  state. It is not interested in peace. It is interested in war  and in expanding the aggression. The source said that Israel is  in the forefront of the states receiving arms, and it is the  most prominent with regard to the purchase of various types of  military equipment, despite what is being said about control of  the arms race in the region.    The military official criticized states that supply Israel  with arms while they continue to talk about peace endeavors and  efforts. He said that when the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which  the United States believes is within the framework of peace, was  being signed, Israel was supplied -- by airlift -- with 24  Apaches. They were supplied under U.S. military aid. These  helicopters are among the best in the world. A squadron of  these helicopters took part recently in shelling Lebanese  resistance positions in Lebanon, causing great devastation.    Israel has also a group of pilotless planes like Harvey  Searcher Falcon, Eagle-eye, Kurns-2000, and modified Hunter  "Binar" [names as transliterated]. There is information  confirming Israel's possession of a group of Patriot missiles,  which were supplied to the Israeli Army during the Gulf war.    The Syrian military official added that the quantity and  quality of the arms in Israel's possession and those which it is  seeking to possess is not in line with the peace proposals and  confirm that Israel does not want peace, but, rather, is  preparing for war, as Washington continues to officially declare  its eagerness to maintain Israel's military superiority over  neighboring Arab states, safeguarding this superiority within  the equations of military strategic balance and confronting the  advanced weapons owned by some Arab states with weapons that are  superior.    The official pointed out that this military superiority  represents a real threat to peace in the region, and no peace  can last where the military balances of power are disrupted.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles published in 15 May Seoul vernacular newspapers on  North Korea starting to replace the fuel rods at its five  megawatt-class atomic reactor without the presence of  International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, inspectors.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 2 a 700-word  article by Pak Tu-sik on the true intention behind North Korea  replacing the fuel rods. The article begins: The ROK, the  United States, the IAEA, and Western countries agree that if  "North Korea replaces the fuel rods without the presence of the  IAEA," it will lead to a "catastrophe." Citing that such a  decision by North Korea is a "reckless plot" to further their  own interest, the article stresses that "no decision can be  made" until the IAEA inspection team makes a "report" on the  result of its inspection. After noting that North Korea's  decision to replace the fuel rods is a way to hold the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks, the article points out the replacement  work may only be in its preparatory stage and that the actual  replacement of the fuel rods has not begun. The article  concludes that the judgment of the IAEA inspection team will  determine if North Korea has actually started replacing the fuel  rods at its atomic reactor.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO on page 3 publishes a 900-word  article by Nam Chan-sun in Washington on the true intention of  North Korea's decision to replace the fuel rods of its atomic  reactor without the presence of the IAEA inspection team. The  article gives four reasons for such a decision: First, North  Korea publicized its decision to replace the fuel rods in order  to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date.  Second, there is a high possibility that North Korea is using  the fact that the IAEA inspection team, which will leave for  North Korea on 15 May, will inspect the five megawatt-class  atomic reactor anyway. Third, the decision is aimed at  obtaining publicity from home and abroad of its position by  rejecting the claims by the United States and the IAEA that the  replacement of the fuel rods must not be carried out without the  presence of the IAEA. Fourth, there is a possibility that it  was necessary to replace the fuel rods to maintain the safety of  North Korea's facilities and meet technological demands, as  North Korea claims. The article concludes by reporting that no  decision can be made until the IAEA inspection team concludes  its inspection.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 publishes a  800-word  editorial entitled: "The North Korean Nuclear Issue Is Bringing  About UN Sanctions." The editorial notes that it seems that the  United States and the ROK have been "dragged along by North  Korea's nuclear strategy." Noting that North Korea has a habit  of unilaterally severing and then resuming negotiations at the  last moment, its decision to replace the fuel rods is intended  to "drive a wedge" in holding the third round of DPRK-U.S.  talks. Citing that North Korea is trying to settle for a  package deal of "improving relations with the United States,  obtain support for its light-water reactor, achieve economic  cooperation, and conclude a peace agreement on the Korean  peninsula," the editorial notes that since North Korea's true  intention has now become clear, "the United States must take a  more resolute measure" regarding the North Korean nuclear issue.  The editorial reports that if North Korea does not stop the  replacement of the fuel rods and does not receive IAEA  inspections, this will only lead to sanctions by the UN Security  Council. The editorial repeatedly urges that as a responsible  member of the international society, North Korea must work to  resolve the nuclear issue peacefully.    KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 publishes a 1,200-word article  by  Yi Chong-yon in Washington on North Korea's unilateral  notification that it has started the replacement of the fuel  rods at its atomic reactor. The article reports that diplomatic  sources in Washington analyze that North Korea's decision to  replace the fuel rods is a "strategic card to realize the  DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date." The article reports that  diplomatic sources feel it is very unlikely that North Korea  replaced the fuel rods, but has only started safety inspections  for replacement. The article continues that the United States  will decide what to do after obtaining results by the IAEA  inspection team. The article concludes that it will be decided  to present the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council after  the IAEA carries out its inspection next week.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 900-word  article by Kim Cha-su entitled "The Government's Reaction to the  Replacement of Fuel Rods by North Korea." Referring to the  government's embarrassment regarding North Korea's 14 May  announcement that it has independently begun changing fuel rods  at its five megawatt-class nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, the  article writes: "This is because the government has so far  adhered to the strong position that it will resume the  discussions on sanctions against North Korea if it begins  changing fuel rods at the nuclear reactor without IAEA  supervision."    Noting the government's analysis of North Korea's public  announcement that it has begun changing fuel rods, the article  reports that the government will formulate concrete plans to  deal with North Korea after IAEA inspectors complete their  inspection activities in North Korea.    The article reports: "The government stresses that it has no  other choice but discuss sanctions against North Korea with  other countries concerned if the IAEA declares the continuity of  the nuclear safeguards has been suspended, and that it has  decided to convey such a position to North Korea through various  channels," referring to the government's attention to North  Korea's remarks to the IAEA that the issue of selecting and  preserving fuel rods can be resolved at the third round of  U.S.-North Korean talks. The article continues that the  government is ready to deal with North Korea, believing that  this week it will be determined if the North Korean nuclear  issue is resolved peacefully.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 900-word  article by Washington-based reporter Chong Hae-yong entitled:  "Washington's Position on North Korea's Replacement of Fuel  Rods." Referring to the contents of North Korea's message sent  to the IAEA on 12 May and analysis by Washington-based sources  of the background of North Korea's replacement of the fuel rods,  the article reports that North Korea's announcement to change  fuel rods is intended to hold negotiations with the IAEA, as  well as to discuss economic cooperation and establishment of  diplomatic relations with the United States.    CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 700-word article by  reporter U Tae-chun entitled: "The Present Conditions of an  Experimental Nuclear Reactor in Yongbyon." The article reports  that "North Korea has operated an experimental nuclear reactor  in Yongbyon since 1986." The article concludes: "Western  experts believe that the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon  will turn out to be a nuclear reprocessing plant after noting  its size based on data provided by North Korea to the IAEA and  the basic reason for the replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear  reactor and the method of extracting plutonium from the spent  nuclear fuel."</p>

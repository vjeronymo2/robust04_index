			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Forte cleared over property depreciation FORTE, the hotels group, yesterday agreed to provide more information on property depreciation policies in its next annual report, in the fourth public settlement reached by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the new watchdog of the Accounting Standards Board. The panel said it accepted Forte's explanation and saw no need for further action, but that the company had agreed to provide more information on depreciation policies in the future. The move appeared to clear Forte of any violation of existing accounting standards, but also implicitly endorsed the practice of not depreciating certain fixed assets which has been adopted by a significant number of companies. Forte does not depreciate freehold properties or leaseholds longer than 20 years, arguing that their long lives and the money spent each year on their repair and improvement make any depreciation charge 'insignificant'. The panel investigated the company's approach to see whether it contravened SSAP 12, an accounting standard that deals with depreciation. It states that there should be a provision for depreciation on fixed assets with a 'finite useful economic life' equivalent to the difference between their cost and their 'estimated residual value'. In Forte's accounts for the year to January 31 1991, land and buildings held freehold or on long leases are valued at Pounds 2.7bn or 62 per cent of all fixed assets, compared with Pounds 2.6bn or 66 per cent for the previous 12 months. Mr Donald Main, finance director, said the company typically spends about 10 per cent of turnover from its hotels division on improving buildings. That would represent about Pounds 91m last year. 'Our philosophy is that we invest heavily in our property on a regular basis to maintain and improve the buildings so they appreciate in value. There is no logic in depreciating them.' However, in the absence of any new accounting standard on depreciation, the panel's acceptance of Forte's accounts is likely to encourage other companies to continue using similar techniques on their balance sheets. Mr Allan Cook, technical director of the Accounting Standards Board, said: 'This whole area is in dispute at the moment. We will not dodge the issue but we want to address it as a whole and not slate individual companies.' The ASB may issue a draft reporting standard on property values after the summer.</p>

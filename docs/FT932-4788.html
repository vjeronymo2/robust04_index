			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Top Thai committee to act on motorway THE THAI government has formed a high-level committee, headed by deputy prime minister Amnuay Viranvan, to try to settle a dispute over the contract terms of an almost completed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) elevated motorway, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The second stage of a toll road running through Bangkok remains closed despite government demands that it open immediately because of 'a national crisis' in the city's traffic system. Bangkok Expressway - the consortium, led by Kumagai Gumi, which is building the road - says it will open the road toll-free for 90 days if the government agrees to settle the dispute within that time. It insists it will terminate the contract if there is no agreement by then. The state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority responsible for the project has now effectively been cut out of negotiations and its governor has offered to resign. Meanwhile, Japan's Obayashi group has pulled out of building Bangkok's third stage expressway.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Letter: Integrity needs to be emphasised Sir, It is a cause for regret that integrity is not among the main qualities required of IBM's new chief executive (Management, March 29). As a former employee I always viewed integrity as the cornerstone of IBM's business philosophy. I do hope that a change in the company's approach to business ethics is not being signalled via the published 'wish-list'. Our work with companies indicates that integrity is an increasingly highly-prized quality, both by customers and staff in today's tough business environment. The public mood, too, is changing with a growing emphasis on high standards of business conduct. It would be refreshing if the new incumbent took an early opportunity to underscore IBM's commitment to corporate ethics, for the sake of the entire business community. John E Drummond, managing director, Integrity Works, 47 Marloes Road, London W8 6LA</p>

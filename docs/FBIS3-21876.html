In August of last year, 4 kg of amphetamines were brought to  Helsinki from Estonia in a small airplane. The drugs were hidden  in the airplane's space for the heating element. The narcotics  were quite pure and valued at significantly more than a million  markkas.    The smuggling incident is linked to the amphetamine case  currently before the Helsinki Circuit Court, in which eight men  are accused of aggravated narcotics smuggling, aggravated  narcotics crimes, as well as other crimes. The case involves 7  kg of amphetamines. Of that amount, 1.2 kg have been seized.    In connection with the case, the police have, in addition to  the amphetamines, also seized 5 kg of hashish, tens of thousands  of hormone pills and numerous guns, including a submachine gun.  The gang involved, which operated in Finland, has had good  connections in Estonia and Sweden.    According to the narcotics division of the Helsinki police  department, a dozen more suspects will be indicted in connection  with the case. The main suspect in the case has been arrested in  Sweden.    During the course of police investigations, it was  discovered  that the gang was also planning to smuggle 12 kg of amphetamines  into the country. The case also involved 10 automobiles, which  had been stolen in Finland. The automobiles were taken to  Estonia.    During interrogation the police discovered that members of  the gang had been offered to act as middlemen in the sale of  Kalashnikov assault rifles, Makarov handguns, hand grenades, and  ammunition. The price of a Kalashnikov, to give an example,  would have been 7,000 markkas.  <H5>  Amphetamines Delivered From Hotel </H5>   A 4-kg shipment was brought to the Malmi Airport on 3  August.  The previous day four men had flown to Tallinn in a rented small  plane. There, the drugs were picked up from an Estonian dealer  at Hotel Sport.    In the evening, the men celebrated at the Viru Hotel, and  the  next day all four men flew back to Malmi.    Two of the men are professional pilots; one from Helsinki  and  the other one from Riihimaki. The 29-year-old pilot from  Helsinki told the police that they all were cognizant of drugs  being smuggled.    The pilot from Riihimaki has, however, denied this.  According  to him, they were supposed to bring in hormones and not  narcotics. A 31-year-old fireman from Helsinki, who also  participated in the trip, has also denied any knowledge of the  drugs. "I only went on the trip to party," he told the court  last Wednesday [26 January].    So far, the police have been unable to locate the fourth  passenger on the airplane.    The police were able to seize less than half a kilogram of  the total 4-kg shipment. The smugglers were able to sell the  rest in, among other places, Helsinki and Oulu.    Public prosecutor Leena Metsapelto wants the smugglers to  pay  fines amounting to the value of the airplane, or 350,000 markkas.    Some 300 grams of the narcotics were found in an apartment  in  Riihimaki, where the amphetamines had been hidden at the request  of the second pilot. Last Tuesday [25 January], the 28-year-old  man from Riihimaki who had concealed the drugs was convicted of  a narcotics crime, and sentenced to pay 80-day fines, or 1,600  markkas.  <H5>  Half a Kilo Found in Central Finland </H5>   Through the main suspects, the case is also linked to  another  gang faction, from which half a kg of amphetamines have been  seized. The drugs were found in a cottage in Toivakka, in  central Finland.    Jorma Juhani Hypponen (39), who lived in the Rural District  of Jyvaskyla and in Tallinn, was sentenced by the district court  to four and a half years of imprisonment.    In addition to the seized narcotics, the court found him  guilty of the distribution of half a kilo of amphetamines, as  well as the attempt to smuggle 2 kg of the same drug. He was  also convicted of theft, fencing, and a crime involving firearms.    Hypponen started to serve his sentence immediately after the  verdict. As far as the other individuals charged were concerned,  the court granted a two-week continuance.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Referendums: principle must be binding Sir, Charles Leadbeater and Andrew Adonis ('Power to the people', July 15) argue that established democracies could be rejuvenated by introducing 'voter vetoes' in the form of referendums on legislation. But they then state that these referendums should be purely advisory. They would then be meaningless, as the Swedish example shows. In the 1920s, Sweden voted against prohibition. Severe rationing was introduced. In 1953, it voted to retain left-side driving. In 1967, Sweden changed to driving on the right. In 1958, Sweden voted in favour of voluntary-funded additional pension schemes. Two years later a mandatory pay-as-you-go system was introduced (which is now, incidentally, breaking down). In 1980, the alternatives were less than clear, but the result was definitely a decision to abolish the use of nuclear energy in Sweden by the year 2005. Result: extremely unlikely to occur. This year, there is a referendum on joining the European Union. Once again politicians of all parties have pledged themselves to honour the expressed will of the people. If the result is a 'no', they are likely once again to ignore it. The principle of a referendum can be discussed. But if you use them, the result must be legally binding.

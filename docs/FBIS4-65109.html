			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "S. Pol": "Balladur's Popularity Picks Up </F> Again"]    [Text] Edouard Balladur's popularity is rising. According  to opinion polls carried out by Gallup and BVA [Brulle Ville  Associates] in early May, it increased by eight and 10 points in  one month. (Footnote) (The 5-6 May Gallup poll was conducted on  a sample of 961 people by telephone. For the 21-5 May [as  published] BVA poll, 951 people were interviewed face to face.)  These two opinion polls confirm the rising popularity of the  government leader, who had suffered significant losses at the  end of March and in early April, after the demonstrations  against the job training contract. "Balladur's lower popularity  in early April was cyclical," Romain Pache, BVA's research  manager, opined. "No other government leader has enjoyed such a  confidence rating 13 months after entering office," he stressed.  According to Gallup, 50 percent (up 8 percent) of the French  people approve Balladur's policies while 41 percent (down 10  percent) disapprove of them. Nine percent (up 2 percent) gave  no opinion. For the BVA poll, favorable opinions with regard to  the prime minister increased by 10 percent to reach 54 percent.  Balladur is also leading the confidence ratings given to  politicians, with 51 percent of positive responses (up 6  percent). "Today Balladur's increased ratings can be seen in the  socioeconomic categories or age groups which had penalized him.  In particular this applies to the 25- to 34-year-olds,  intermediate professions, ecologists, Socialists, or those who  say they are not close to any party," according to Pache's  analysis.    Last week a Sofres [French Opinion Polling Company] poll  noted a 4-percent increase for the prime minister, with 57  percent of people having confidence in him. For a Louis Harris  poll, 46 percent of the French people (up 5 percent) felt that  the government's policies "were going in the right direction"  compared with 47 percent (down 7 percent) who thought the  opposite. At the end of April CSA [Audiovisual High Council]  noted a 4-percent increase to 44 percent in its monthly poll,  after a 12-percent drop in March.</p>

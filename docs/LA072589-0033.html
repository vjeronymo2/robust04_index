			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A BLUE MONDAY FOR RAIDERS;  </P> <P> ALLEN, LEWIS FAIL TO SHOW AND HELLESTRAE BREAKS BONE IN LEFT LEG  </P> <P> If the Raiders were braced for bad news Monday, they got more than they  bargained for. Marcus Allen began his holdout, as did Bill Lewis, and just to  tie a ribbon around the day, starting guard Dale Hellestrae broke a bone in his  left leg.  </P> <P> Lewis, who started at center last season, can play Hellestrae's position. In  fact, he is one of the team's few experienced linemen who can, but he has  already filed a grievance against the club and may sue. Al Davis doesn't laugh  such challenges off, so if things haven't already gone too far for an amicable  settlement, they're close.  </P> <P> And then there's Marcus . . .  </P> <P> As is Lewis, Allen is on his option year, and thus under contract. Allen can't  be reached for comment, and his agent, Ed Hookstratten, has not returned calls  for a week. The Raiders, as usual, aren't talking, so this promises to be a  quiet confrontation.  </P> <P> Allen was paid $1 million last season, would have to have been offered $1.1  million for this one, and reportedly was offered a little more than that.  </P> <P> However, Allen is said to have his eye on Bo Jackson's numbers: $840,000 in  salary; a $100,000 reporting bonus and a $416,000 signing bonus (although  $966,000 of that $1,356,000 total is deferred).  </P> <P> Allen has played hurt for the last two seasons and moved over to fullback for  Jackson without complaint. However, a certain rivalry is said to have begun  last season.  </P> <P> Jackson was unhappy that he came out of games in goal-line situations. The  Raiders may have been afraid he'd fumble. But after Allen, playing with a cast  on his fractured left wrist, fumbled at the goal line in a late-season loss,  the Raiders began taking him out and putting in Jackson. Allen reportedly  didn't like it any more than Jackson did.  </P> <P> There is also speculation that Allen, among others, is wishing for a deal that  would send him to the Rams. That would reunite him with his coach at USC, John  Robinson, and let him romp behind the strong Ram line.  </P> <P> Without Allen, and of course, without Jackson, the Raiders are down two Heisman  Trophy winners and short in general. The only veteran tailback is Vance  Mueller. The only other halfbacks in camp are journeyman Curtis Adams and No. 8  draft pick Derrick Gainer.  </P> <P> "We've got some inexperience there, no question about it," Coach Mike Shanahan  said.  </P> <P> "I think I've already expressed how I feel about Marcus. Now I've got to  concentrate on the people who are here.  </P> <P> "Any time you have a system, you'd love to have all your players in, but that's  not always the way it goes in the NFL. That's part of the business. You have to  practice with the people you have."  </P> <P> Lewis and his agent, Larry Muno, say that Lewis only lost his starting job  because of his contract situation. Shanahan says he had already decided to  switch Don Mosebar back to center in any case.  </P> <P> In any case, Lewis, at 6-7, 275, is big enough to play other line positions. He  was voted the team's outstanding offensive lineman by his linemates last  season. One preseason publication, the respected Don Heinrich's Pro Review,  calls him "the best center in the division."  </P> <P> The Raiders protected Lewis on their 37-man list during the Plan B free-agency  period, but did, apparently, make the decision to switch Mosebar to his  position shortly thereafter. Mosebar was notified that he'd be going back to  center several weeks before Lewis passed up mini-camp.  </P> <P> Allen didn't attend mini-camp, either. He and Lewis tried to use the weight  room during the session, but Shanahan told them if they weren't going to  practice, they'd have to leave the facility.  </P> <P> They left and kept right on going.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> The Raiders say Dale Hellestrae will be out six to 12 weeks. Hellestrae was one  of the Raiders' Plan B free agents, a former No. 4 pick of the Buffalo Bills.  He missed the 1985 season with a hip problem, was on injured reserve for eight  games in '86 with a broken wrist, and on injured reserve for 12 games in '87  with a broken thumb . . . Rookie Steve Wisniewski moves up to the No. 1 right  guard. The left guard spot is being contested by last year's No. 10 pick, Newt  Harrell, and utility man John Gesek.  </P></p>

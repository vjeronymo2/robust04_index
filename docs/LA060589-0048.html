			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> CANCER SOURCE NOT FOUND  </P> <P> Another study has failed to turn up any single connection among a dozen cancers  of various types that struck children in McFarland early in this decade.  Between Feb. 6 and April 28, a medical team from the state Department of Health  examined 1,885 McFarland children, which represented 95% of all the children  ages 1 to 12 who live in the Kern County community and surrounding farming  area. As was the case with earlier studies, this one pinpointed no single  environmental or other cause for the childhood cancers, said Dr. Rick Kreutzer,  a state public health officer. "Using the technology now available, it would  appear at this point that we cannot find anything in the McFarland environment  that makes it unusual or more dangerous to the residents," Kreutzer said.  </P></p>

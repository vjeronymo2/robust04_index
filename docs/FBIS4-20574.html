Kumashiro, Yokohama National University]    [Text] Boron carbide (B[.sub]12[/]C[.sub]3[/]) and  boron phosphide (B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub]2[/]) are materials  which belong to boron modification of the a-rhombohedral type,  and accordingly their physical properties can be understood in  the same line as for _a_-rhombohedral boron. Their vibrational  properties have recently been studied, in particular by Raman  spectroscopy. With respect to optical properties,  _a_-rhombohedral B is classified to uniaxial crystal, and hence  the anisotropy of the vibrational properties is very important.  The space group of the crystal is R3m and the crystal is not  piezoelectric. Hence, Raman active vibrations are by no means  polar modes. In Raman scattering, the standard procedure of  group theory is valid for the identification of vibrations.  Calculation of the scattering efficiency is straightforward and  the peak frequencies are independent of the angle :gv between  the wave vector of a phonon and the c-axis.    For IR spectra, on the contrary, the situation is a little  different. Not only the intensity but the peak frequency depend  the angle _th_. The degeneracy predicted by group theory is  sometimes lifted due to the presence of the macroscopic electric  field. An anisotropy of this kind is illustrated in the figure  for two hypothetical cases. Figure (a) illustrates the case that  the electrical interaction overcomes the anisotropy of the  crystal, while figure (b) shows the case that the anisotropy of  the crystal overcomes the electrical interaction. In the latter  case, the anisotropy becomes appreciable in IR spectra.  Effective charge is another aspect of anisotropy appearing in  the charge distribution. This quantity is a measure of the  separation between the TO and LO modes.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-23A>      Figure 1. Angular Dependence of the Phonon Frequency. (a) Electrical-interaction predominant; (b) Anisotropy </FIG>      An anisotropy of such a kind has not been studied for these  materials. Part of the reason is the difficulty of obtaining  good-quality crystals. Another part lies in the measurement  itself. For bulk crystals, only reflectance type is available  for IR spectra, precise determination of the peak by  Reststrahlen is relatively difficult, owing to its rather broad  nature. For this purpose, it is more desirable to use the  transmission-type spectroscopy for thin films. Technological  development in thin film growth by molecular beam methods brings  us the potential to solve this problem, good-quality  B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub][/]2 singlecrystal will become to be  available.    In the present paper, we represent preliminary discussion of  vibrational properties, which will serve as an aid for the  interpretation of vibrational spectra of boron-rich solids with  rhombohedral structure.</p>

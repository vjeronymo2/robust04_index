In many cases, such dialogue achieved positive results.  This is obviously a good omen.    The messages from Beijing were inspiring. First, French  Prime Minister Balladur's special envoy, Peyferitte, visited  China; then China and France issued a joint communique on 12  January after consultations. The French Government reaffirmed  that it only recognized the PRC Government as the sole legal  government of China, and guaranteed that it would no longer  approve any involvement by French enterprises in the sale of  arms to Taiwan. This changed the unharmonious relationship  between the two countries after France decided to sell fighters  to Taiwan in late 1992. After that, Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen visited Paris and met with French President  Mitterrand and other French leaders. Both sides held that a new  chapter had opened in the relationship between the two countries.    Then, Jennifer Hillman, chief U.S. trade negotiator, visited  Beijing, and the fourth round of bilateral textile trade talks  was held. A memorandum of understanding was signed on 17  January, and this averted a trade war between the two countries.  Immediately after that, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen  visited China, and a joint statement was issued after a meeting  of the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee announcing that the  United States "supports a stable, prosperous, and modern China."  This indicated that China and the United States had taken a  major step to further develop their relations.    Coordination between the Western countries and between the  Western countries and the countries of Eastern Europe and the  former Soviet Union also achieved positive results. On 10 and  11 January, U.S. President Clinton attended the NATO summit  meeting in Brussels. As a result of this coordination, NATO  accepted a U.S.-proposed "peace partnership" scheme, and this  mitigated the contradictions with Russia caused by the original  plan to expand the scope of NATO to some East European  countries. After that, Clinton visited Moscow. After the  United States and Russia held consultations with Ukraine, on 14  January, the presidents of the three countries signed an  agreement on dismantling nuclear weapons inside the territory of  Ukraine. Thus, a major problem of the nuclear arsenal left over  from the Cold War was solved.    As for regional problems, President Clinton and Syrian  President al-Asad held talks in Geneva in a harmonious  atmosphere, and the talks brought about an opportunity to reopen  the Israeli-Syrian talks. While the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement has encountered difficulties, PLO  Chairman 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Peres held a  meeting when attending the annual conference of the World  Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They discussed ways to  settle differences between the two sides. Reportedly, the talks  between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have "approached the  conclusion of a final agreement."    Some goodwill messages also came from the talks between the  United States and the DPRK on the development of nuclear weapons  in Korea. On 29 January, Billy Graham, a representative of  American evangelical Christianity, met President Kim Il-sung in  Pyongyang, and conveyed a message from President Clinton to  President Kim. Graham and Kim Il-sung "held talks in a sincere  and friendly atmosphere." This indicated the "determination to  make efforts to establish a peaceful and friendly relationship  between the two countries."    Disputes continue to occur among various countries, and the  world is full of contradictions. Using force and exercising  pressure only intensifies the contradictions. Only dialogue on  an equal footing will reduce trouble and turn danger into  safety. It is hoped that the trend of coordination and dialogue  shown in January 1994 will continue, and this will provide a  bright future to the world.</p>

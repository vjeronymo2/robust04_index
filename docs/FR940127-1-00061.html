			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the 1993 Regular Meeting of ICCAT, the quota for take of the species in the western Atlantic was reduced from the 1991 level by 25 percent of 1994 and by another 30 percent for 1995, for a 55 percent total reduction since Sweden submitted its resolution to COP8. In addition, the quota for Japanese fishing vessels, in the central Atlantic, whose harvest had been 450 mt annually from the western Atlantic and about 1,000 mt annually from the eastern Atlantic, was capped at 1,300 mt for the 2-year period 1994&hyph;95. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Progress was made on other conservation measures, including the development of a Bluefin Statistical Document (similar to a CITES certificate of origin), which would be required by all ICCAT countries for the importation of bluefin tuna. This document is already required for frozen bluefin tuna imports. It will be partially implemented for fresh tuna by June 1994, and full implementation is scheduled for December 1994, when the document must be validated by the appropriate government official. An intersessional meeting is scheduled for spring 1994 to discuss, among other things, the use of trade measures as an enforcement tool. Thus, a proposal to list this species in Appendix II may not be warranted at this time based on the progress at the last two ICCAT meetings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, ICCAT has not yet fully implemented the quota reductions or the Bluefin Statistical Document Program, and other measures may be necessary for ICCAT to take with respect to non-ICCAT countries in order to supplement the existing conservation regime. Therefore, the Service requests comments on the merits for an Appendix II listing of the entire Atlantic population, particularly with respect to collecting trade date concerning non-ICCAT countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EIA proposed that the whale shark be considered for CITES protection, and subsequently provided a draft proposal to include this species in Appendix II. Whale sharks are large filter feeders and exist in the temperate seas throughout the world. Whale sharks are vulnerable to commercial harpoon gear and collisions with vessels. Whale sharks have supported small to medium commercial fisheries in India, Pakistan, China, the Philippines, and Senegal, where catches may be increasing. The flesh is eaten fresh or after being slated and dried. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The whale shark is slow growing and may produce few young, and consequently, may be easily overexploited. The NMFS Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed whale sharks in the large coastal species group, and this group of sharks is considered to be overfished in the Northwest Atlantic and to have declined off southern California. However, this species does not appear to be an important fisheries species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the recent increases in worldwide catches of sharks for the meat and fins, and for medicinal purposes, the Service is requesting information this species, but without more specific information indicating population declines or increases in trade, the Service may not have sufficient information to warrant submission of a proposal for this species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Requiem Sharks (Carcharhinidae spp.) and Hammerhead Sharks (Sphyrnidae spp.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These species were proposed for review for inclusion in Appendix II or III, by the National Audubon Society in 1991. At that time, the Service did not believe that sufficient information was available to propose these species for consideration at COP8. However, the Service is re-examining this recommendation in preparation for COP9. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These species are normally targeted by commercial shark longline and gillnet fisheries and are also subject to take in recreational fisheries. The NMFS Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed these sharks in the large coastal species group, but many individuals of these species make extensive migrations. In the preparation for development of the management plan, a peer review of effort by NMFS and non-NMFS experts evaluated the available information and determined that the large coastal species group of sharks was overfished in the Northwest Atlantic. As a consequence, catch quotas imposed for the large coastal shark species were set at levels representing a 30 percent drop pattern. These sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the recent increases in worldwide catches of sharks for the meat and fins, and for medicinal purposes, the Service is requesting information on these species. However, without more specific information indicating specific population declines or increases in trade, the Service may not have sufficient information to warrant submission of any proposal for these species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

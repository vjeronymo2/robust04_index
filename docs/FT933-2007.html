			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Flagstone leisure move with IoW buy AS A FIRST step towards concentrating on the leisure sector, Flagstone Holdings proposes to buy The Needles Hotel Company from Wembley for Pounds 2.6m cash. It also intends to raise Pounds 5.48m net through a placing and rights issue which will lead to a Jersey-based investment company holding nearly 30 per cent of the capital. Needles Hotel owns the pleasure park at Alum Bay and a restaurant complex at Wootton Creek, both on the Isle of Wight. Flagstone will also procure payment to the vendor of an amount representing half the pre-tax profits earned by the Needles between July 1 and September 30 1993. To repay bank indebtedness, improve working capital and meet the acquisition, Flagstone is placing 500m shares of 1p with institutional and other investors and offering shareholders a further 92.9m shares at par on the basis of 2-for-3. Of the placing shares, 219m will be taken by Channel Hotels and Properties, which is controlled by Mr David Kirch. The holding will represent 29.9 per cent of the enlarged capital. Mr Kirch wishes to participate in leisure-related investments indirectly through his holding in Flagstone, but does not wish to join the board. The proposals are subject to shareholder approval on October 11. Share dealings have been suspended until then.</p>

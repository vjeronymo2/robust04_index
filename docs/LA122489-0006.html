			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I saw "The Cosby Show" episode about pregnancy and thought it was one of the  funniest yet. I didn't think it was in poor taste at all. A man will never know  what it's like to be pregnant and the way the show portrayed how a man might  dream about it was absolutely hilarious although it looked more like a  nightmare!  </P> <P> Ellen Andersen, Sun Valley  </P></p>

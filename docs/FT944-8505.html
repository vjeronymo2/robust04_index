			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BAe will raise maximum Pounds 535m British Aerospace is relying on a new trombone to help it win the fight for VSEL. Two-stage rights issues, nicknamed trombones, have become increasingly popular as a method for funding bids since first introduced in the UK by Kleinwort Benson, BAe's merchant bank. Most recently, GKN used such a structure to fund its hostile bid for Westland. The traditional method is to split the issue into a first tranche, which is underwritten in the normal way, and a second tranche which only goes ahead if the bid is successful. This means that if the bid fails, the company is not left with much more cash than it needs, which is likely to dilute earnings. In BAe's case, Kleinwort has introduced a new twist, making the second tranche not merely conditional but also variable. If the bid fails, BAe will get only the Pounds 178m from the first tranche. If it succeeds, BAe will get from the second tranche only the extra sum it needs to satisfy those VSEL shareholders who opt for the cash alternative. The maximum raised from both tranches will be Pounds 535m. The mechanics are that British Aerospace shareholders will be able to subscribe for one 'stock unit' for every three shares held with an initial instalment of 130p. A second instalment of up to 260p will be payable if the revised offer goes unconditional. The units will then convert into ordinary shares. Shares on which the second instalment is not paid will be forfeited, so BAe is virtually guaranteed the second tranche money and only the first tranche has been underwritten. BAe wanted the first tranche to be as small as possible, but the Stock Exchange would not allow it to be less than a third of the total. In previous examples, the two tranches have been of equal size. Mr Tim Shacklock, joint head of corporate advisory at Kleinwort, believes the technique will be adopted by other companies in similar situations. 'I have had a lot of people ringing up asking why nobody thought of it before.' The costs will be based partly on the scale for rights issue and partly on the system for underwritten cash offers. BAe, which spent about Pounds 10m underwriting the first offer, faces another bill of at least Pounds 10m, depending on the length of the bid.</p>

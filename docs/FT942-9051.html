			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Shoddy meets quality in Transylvania: The bitter contest between the old and new at a bankrupt Romanian factory A postcard pretty town in the heart of mountainous Transylvania, Codlea is an unlikely setting for the conflict at the centre of eastern Europe's economic transformation. However, over the past few months this sleepy Romanian town has seen a contest pitting efficient, often brutal, capitalism with its promise of future prosperity against a rickety, unproductive, centrally planned economy, with its guarantee of a job but a dismal standard of living for everyone. For many of the individual actors, the struggle at the Magura Codlea furniture factory which employs 1,600 of the town's 25,000 inhabitants, has been a personal tragedy. One victim was the factory director who committed suicide when the conflict began to heat up late last year. For the workers, it has meant coming to terms with western standards of quality and efficiency after four decades of communism. The suicide came after the company, privatised at the end of 1992 via a management buy-out, lost its western export markets, racked up a Dollars 9m debt and was about to be foreclosed by its creditors, IKEA, the Swedish furniture retailer, and the Ion Tiriac Bank, a private local bank founded by the Romanian-born tennis star. The man now at the forefront of the battle is Mr Hakan Gunnerling, a Swedish specialist in turning around failing companies, who was sent in by the creditors to coax or coerce the Magura Codlea factory into capitalist ways. 'Nothing surprises me any more,' says Mr Gunnerling, who, in less than a year in Romania, has suffered the suicide of a colleague, several pugnacious strikes - including occupation of the factory by protesting workers - and sustained attacks in the national media. He has also been advised to hire a personal bodyguard. But there is still a certain, almost innocent, western bewilderment in his explanation that 'now we have the right machinery, we have the necessary customer, but we just don't have the right people'. Mr Gunnerling's impatience with Magura Codlea's shoddy socialist past is apparent the moment he walks into the factory's meeting room. This is one of Romania's premier furniture factories but visitors must choose their seats with care because some of the chairs in the room, built in the bad old days of Nicolae Ceaucescu's socialist autarky, collapse under the slightest pressure. 'To have chairs like this in a factory which has been producing furniture for 100 years, it's so awful that its almost funny,' Mr Gunnerling says. Standing in silent reproach along the walls of the room are the sturdy, clean-lined bookshelves which, under Mr Gunnerling's stern supervision, the factory has been producing for IKEA. IKEA, which has been purchasing furniture from Magura Codlea for more than two decades and is the factory's principal customer, saw the privatisation as an opportunity to bring all the factory's production up to western standards. According to Mr Gunnerling, Magura Codlea's furniture, in true socialist fashion, 'could look good when it was packed, but when it arrived at the end-user it was scratched'. So Mr Gunnerling, who arrived in Transylvania in October, summoned a team of IKEA engineers and set about teaching Magura Codlea's workers quality control and training them in the use of new equipment from IKEA, to be paid back with future exports. But IKEA's much-vaunted insistence on high standards ran into the resistance of a workforce trained in a system in which, as the east European joke goes, 'they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work'. As Mr Gunnerling discovered, 'not everyone is able to learn to run complicated machinery or to take responsibility for his work'. For many of Magura Codlea's workers it was bad enough to be required to make bookshelves in which the screws routinely matched the holes, but the final straw was when Mr Gunnerling subjected the company's finances to scrutiny. He made a discovery which had been obscured by Romania's Byzantine accounting standards - the company was broke. 'I pointed out to the board of directors that the company is losing money and will continue to lose money for some time,' Mr Gunnerling said. 'By western standards, it was bankrupt, and in these circumstances it was normal for the creditors to take control.' For Magura Codlea's workers, the creditors' seizure of the company's shares last December was going too far. 'They still believe they own the factory,' Mr Gunnerling said. 'Here we have 1,600 directors with 1,600 ideas of how the company should be run.' Protesting that the factory had been 'stolen' - by the managers and the creditors - in mid-January Magura Codlea's employees began a series of strikes. At the height of the stand-off, Mr Gunnerling told workers assembled in the factory canteen that their strike was illegal and that every one was fired, unprecedented in a country where inefficient state companies still keep thousands of surplus workers on their books. Mr Gunnerling has since stepped back from that drastic measure but still plans to lay-off 300 this summer and thinks that 700 is the optimal number of employees. Production has resumed, although new strikes are always possible. The ex-communist government, surprising its critics and acting against the instincts of many of its ministers, has resisted the temptation to re-nationalise the factory or to prevent the creditors from taking direct control. But Magura Codlea still has too many workers with too few skills, and a reluctant Mr Gunnerling fears that to maintain the fragile peace in his workshops he may have to sack the remaining individuals behind the management buy-out. It is not a peace treaty, only a ceasefire, with compromises on both sides. But Magura Codlea has already become a pioneer in a country still only half way down the road to capitalism.</p>

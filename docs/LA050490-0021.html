			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: EXPORTS FUELING THE ECONOMY, MAY SPARK STOCK RALLY  </P> <P> An old story on Wall Street may soon get new attention -- and for good reason.  It may justify the stock market's next surge.  </P> <P> The story is that overseas demand for U.S. goods and services continues to  mushroom. Export business is so good, in fact, that it helped make up for soft  domestic demand in the first quarter for many companies. That kept the slide in  first-quarter corporate profits from being a lot worse than it might have been.  </P> <P> "Export certainly has been one of the reasons why the manufacturing economy  hasn't sunk any lower," said Robert Bretz, who heads the business survey  committee of the National Assn. of Purchasing Management.  </P> <P> His group, which tracks the economy by watching supply and demand trends at  major companies, said its export index in April was the highest since  September.  </P> <P> The continuing export boom may be under-appreciated by a jaded Wall Street.  Consider that domestic demand for manufactured goods has been sluggish for  about a year as car, housing and appliance sales have weakened. That has been a  general drag on the economy.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, exports of heavy equipment and high-tech products to Europe and Asia  keep growing, reaching levels that many U.S. companies could only have dreamed  about in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> Add it up, and the export strength is a partial answer to the mystery of the  economy's resilience in the face of weak domestic demand.  </P> <P> "This is just what the doctor ordered," notes David Hale, economist at Kemper  Financial Services in Chicago. Remember when, just a few years back, economists  warned that flat exports and rising imports threatened to cut the legs out from  under the U.S. economy?  </P> <P> In 1987, this country imported $113 billion more than it exported, counting all  goods and services. By last year, the deficit was cut to $47 billion.  </P> <P> So the progress is real. And even better, it's almost certain to continue, even  as the dollar remains surprisingly strong -- normally a negative for exporters.  The simple fact is that the world needs a lot of new nuts-and-bolts-type  equipment.  </P> <P> "One of the bullish things about the next two to three years is the capital  goods cycle," Hale said. Overseas and at home, many companies are spending huge  amounts of money to modernize their plants or build new ones. Governments,  meanwhile, are committed to rebuilding sewer and road systems and to forcing  new pollution-control systems on factories. And Eastern Europe will require a  major overhaul if it's to be brought into the world trading system.  </P> <P> The machinery needed for those projects -- the air compressors, generators,  tractors, computers and other goods -- are the forte of U.S. manufacturers.  Even if West Germany wanted to keep the entire European market to itself, it  couldn't, notes Lacy Hunt, economist at CM&amp;M Group in New York. "West  German plants already are working at capacity," he said. And Japan, too, is  investing heavily in its own economy, limiting its export capacity.  </P> <P> Hunt believes that another surge in U.S. exports, combined with new vigor in  the service economy, will push real U.S. economic growth to an annualized rate  of 3% in the current quarter, from 2.1% in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Translation for the stock market: Corporate profits may come in much stronger  than expected. And even if interest rates continue to inch higher -- the price  we pay for an expanding economy -- the end of recession worries may give  investors new reasons to look at stocks.  </P> <P> Although investors are conditioned to believe that stocks can't rise if  interest rates are rising, it isn't true. Everything depends on the economic  background. Stocks soared in 1983 as the economy rebounded, even though rates  were rising as well.  </P> <P> In recent days, stocks such as Deere, Caterpillar, Ingersoll-Rand, Fluor Corp.  and Compaq Computer have seen renewed buying. All are major exporters of goods  or services. The market may be telling us that, despite the short-term gloom  over interest rates, the long-term economic picture looks better, not worse.  </P> <P> Europe's Not So Bad, Either: Everybody knows Europe will be an exciting  investment arena in the 1990s. But the expected economic changes there will  undoubtedly produce a lot of losers as well. This is a time for particularly  careful stock picking, not rushing wholesale into European markets, says  Penelope Dobkin, manager of Fidelity Group's Europe Fund.  </P> <P> Dobkin has run the Europe Fund since 1986. She has $370 million under  management, spread among 90 stocks. Her track record: Up 25.93% in the 12  months ended March 31, compared to 22.37% for the average Europe-focused fund.  In the first quarter, Dobkin's fund gained 1.61%, compared to 0.82% for the  average Europe fund. (The average U.S. stock fund lost 2.31%.)  </P> <P> Dobkin says the euphoria over West Germany's future isn't a lot of hype. But  forget the talk about an avalanche of profits falling on West German companies  from Eastern European business ventures. "That's not going to come before  1995," she said, especially given the costs of absorbing East Germany into the  West.  </P> <P> The reason to buy West German stocks now is that they're severely undervalued  just based on their underlying assets, including land, Dobkin said. U.S. stocks  went through an asset-value phase in the late '80s. In West Germany, only now  are the usually secretive companies beginning to disclose what their assets are  worth.  </P> <P> The asset value of West German companies is estimated at about 1 trillion West  German marks, Dobkin said. The value of their stocks on the open market,  meanwhile, is about half that. Pretty simple math, Dobkin figures. And those  asset values are destined to rise, she said, because West German economic  growth will be Europe's locomotive over the next few years.  </P> <P> She has 19% of her fund's assets invested in West German stocks, the heaviest  weighting in any European nation. And she's sticking with the blue chips --  industrial giants such as Siemens and Veba, and big banks such as Deutsche  Bank.  </P> <P> "The average European portfolio is overweighted with smaller stocks," Dobkin  said. But she thinks that, while the smaller issues were the success stories of  the 1980s, the big names will be the hot stocks of the 1990s. One good reason:  "Just look at what the Japanese are buying," she said. Japanese investors are  taken with Europe, and just as they played the blue chip names in the United  States in the late '80s, they're looking for the same kind of stocks in West  Germany.  </P> <P> After Germany, the heaviest stock weightings in Dobkin's portfolio are France  (13% of assets), Britain (13%), the Netherlands (13%), Switzerland (6%), Spain  (5%) and Norway (4%).  </P> <P> She is most worried about Britain. She recently slashed her holdings there (the  weighting was 24% on Jan. 1). Dobkin sees great risk of high inflation in  Britain leading to a recession later this year. And the market doesn't reflect  the major possibility of a liberal Labor government coming to power by 1992,  she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE EXPORT BOOM  </P> <P> While the U.S. economy slowed last year, overseas demand for U.S. goods soared  -- a trend that has continued into 1990, helping support corporate earnings.  </P> <P> Exports of U.S. goods and services in billions of dollars  </P> <P> SOURCE: Commerce Department  </P></p>

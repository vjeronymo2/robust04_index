			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Howard acts on racial disputes A quicker, cheaper way of resolving racial discrimination disputes between employers and staff was announced by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday. Employers who recognised that a practice might have inadvertently discriminated against one group would be able to make a legally binding undertaking to change. Mr Howard told a race relations conference in London that the new procedure would provide 'an effective and voluntary solution to many disputes and would avoid unnecessary confrontation'. Taking companies to court 'does little to encourage sensible co-operation and much to set in concrete ill feelings between the parties'. Mr Herman Ouseley, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, welcomed the announcement. He said: 'This will save time and money.' The Home Office said the measure would mean that disputes could be settled without a tribunal hearing or the costly, contentious process of a formal investigation under the Race Relations Act. Mr Howard highlighted other recent measures to improve race relations, including the proposal to introduce a new offence of causing intentional harassment, and to make publishing and distributing racially offen-sive material an arrestable offence. But, in what was seen as a reference to the recent Commons home affairs committee call for a new offence of racially motivated violence, Mr Howard said the existing law was adequate to deal with offences of racial violence and harassment.</p>

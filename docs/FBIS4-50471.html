			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 16 May in Jinan, while meeting  with members of the provincial team to report the deeds of the  fourth term of the new Long-March shock workers, shock brigades,  and pacesetters, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial  party committee, encouraged the vast numbers of Communist Youth  League [CYL] members and youths in the province to temper  themselves and grow to maturity in the great practice of reform  and opening up and to vie with one another in becoming socialist  new-type persons being politically aware, morally-sound,  well-educated, and disciplined.    Over the past several years, CYL organizations at all levels  and the vast numbers of CYL members and youths in the province  have taken an active part in the spring tide of reform and  opening up, plunged into economic construction, strived to  create a new civilized atmosphere, put all their energies into  study with a view to becoming professional, and made great  contributions to the province's socialist modernization cause.  As a result, a large number of advanced and exemplary figures  have come to the fore.    The provincial CYL committee decided to choose some  representatives from the fourth term of the province's new  Long-March shock workers, shock brigades, and pacesetters and  organize them as a team to make a circuit of some colleges in  the province to give reports on their advanced and model deeds.    When meeting with members of this team, Jiang Chunyun highly  appraised the advanced deeds of the new Long-March shock workers  and shock brigades. He said: You are advanced pacesetters of  the youths in the province and representatives of shock workers.  In you, we can see the image of the new-type persons being  politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and  disciplined, that was advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Your  deeds have fully manifested the spiritual feature of the  new-type persons, and thus you should be respected by the vast  numbers of youths and by society as a whole. On behalf of the  provincial party committee, I express my respect and extend  congratulations to you.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Under the new situation of  carrying out reform, opening to the outside world, and  developing the socialist market economy, it is all the more  important to carry forward the spirit of being politically  aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and disciplined. As young  people, we should be resolved to become professional and should  have lofty ideals first. From a long-term point of view, the  ideal of we communists is to realize communism. The fighting  objective at the present age is to build China into a  prosperous, strong, democratic, and civilized socialist country.  Only with such a fighting objective, the ideal and faith will  be provided with a spiritual pillar, and we will be able to work  hard and forge ahead.    Jiang Chunyun said: Youths should embrace a correct outlook  on life and a correct outlook on value and should make clear for  whom they should serve and work. China is a socialist country  led by the CPC. All citizens and all youths should embrace the  outlook of value of selflessly serving the people and the  motherland rather than being bent solely on profit. Our  personal value cannot be realized unless we make contributions  to the party and the state.    Jiang Chunyun said: Youths should improve their abilities  and skills of making contributions to the party and the state.  This is the only way to turn the strong desire of serving the  people into reality and to yield the greatest results.    Jiang Chunyun expressed hope that the young people will  carry  forward the pioneering spirit of hardworking, truly carry out  the 64-character pioneering spirit set forth by Comrade Jiang  Zemin, and strive to become the youths who can accomplish  something and who are needed by the party and the people.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: To become the new-type persons being  politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and  disciplined, we should, what is most important, strengthen  study, particularly studying well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, and should  use this theory to arm our heads and improve our theoretical  expertise so that we can stand high and see far. We should also  study the basic knowledge on market economy and the knowledge on  modern science. At the same time, we should be brave in  practice and should strive to make innovations, absorb  nutrition, and enrich and enhance ourselves in practice so that  we can become people well trained in not only theory but also  practice.    Jiang Chunyun fully affirmed the series activities launched  by the provincial CYL committee on learning from advanced and  exemplary figures and regarded the launching of these activities  as a good method to educate and guide the vast numbers of  youths. He called on CYL organizations to carry out the  activities of learning from the advanced in a profound and  sustained manner, and, through the advanced deeds of these  exemplary youths, conduct a vivid, realistic, and convincing  ideological education among the vast numbers of youths. He also  encouraged the numerous youths in the province to make even  greater contributions to the province's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive.    The reporting team, composed of (Liang Dong), (Li Jianmei),  (Hou Chengjun), (Zhang Rong), (Hao Jianwei), will visit some  colleges to give reports beginning on 17 May.</p>

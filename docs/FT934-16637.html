			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: European prices recover from Moscow mark-down THE OUTBREAK of violence in Russia sent European government bonds tumbling at the start of trading, but while the markets remained volatile for much of the morning, prices closed higher across the board as investors bought on weakness and relief at President Boris Yeltsin's apparent success in crushing the rebellion. Bond dealers were glued to their television screens for much of the day, closely following the events in Russia. But after the initial marking down of European bond prices, many felt that the reaction had been too dramatic. 'This is a classic case of over-reaction by the European government bond markets,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg Securities. He pointed out that the turmoil in Russia was obscuring the generally favourable economic background to the European bond markets which are expected to benefit from falling inflation and cuts in interest rates. THE GERMAN government bond market, usually one of the most sensitive to turmoil in Russia, recouped its early losses and closed higher. The bund future contract, which closed at 98.86 on Friday, opened at 98.35 yesterday and reached a high of 99.05 before trading at 98.97 in late afternoon. UK GILTS ended higher on the day, as dealers pointed out that many investors regard sterling assets as a safe haven in times of turmoil. Furthermore, the economic background still looks favourable in the UK and supply worries have disappeared temporarily. The market's immediate domestic concerns remain the Conservative Party conference this week, and the release of the September inflation figures next week. Gilts closed between  1/8 and  1/4 point higher on the day with 10-year issues seeing the biggest rise. JAPANESE government bonds opened on a weak note, as dealers marked down prices on the back of the weekend's events in Russia while news of further supply at the long end depressed prices even further. However, late short-covering revived the market and government bond prices ended higher on the day. Japanese bond prices weakened in overseas trading on Friday, following the announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it will no longer buy bonds outright through its trust fund bureau. The bureau has bought about Y100bn of bonds a month over the last nine months, dealers said. News that the Ministry of Finance plans to auction about Y300bn of 20-year bonds today pushed down prices at the long end, an area of the market which has performed well in recent weeks as investors looked for capital gains. Furthermore, since the cut in the official discount rate last week, some investors have shifted into the longer maturities for the yield, as they can obtain a higher return than on bank deposits and other Japanese investments, dealers said. US Treasury prices were little changed in late trading yesterday, leaving analysts surprised that the flight-to-quality that was expected to accompany news of political unrest in Russia failed to materialise. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/32 at 103 15/32 , yielding 5.994 per cent. At the short end the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.825 per cent. The news overnight of intense fighting in Moscow, set the scene for early gains in Treasuries. Yet any benefits for the Treasury market yesterday were short-lived. Prices firmed at the opening, but by early afternoon were flat and soon after slipped into negative territory. On the domestic front, news of an unexpected 1.1 per cent decline in August construction spending helped the long end of the market in early trading. Investors' attention, however, soon shifted to Friday's September employment report, and longer-dated prices eventually drifted lower. Analysts expect the jobs report to show an increase in payrolls of about 150,000.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: GEC-Alsthom ahead 8.5% GEC-ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French power and transport company, increased its net profits 8.5 per cent to Ecu318m (Dollars 359.34m) in the year to the end of March 1993. The group, formed in 1989 as a 50-50 joint venture between the UK's GEC and Alcatel Alsthom of France, achieved the result on sales of Ecu7.98bn, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period last year. The improved profits reflected the strength of the principal business activities - power generation and distribution and transport. 'These areas have been very resilient in the face of Europe's recession and we have also enjoyed strong exports elsewhere,' the company said. In the power generation division - which provides the bulk of the group's revenues - the main sources of income were large power station projects in Asia and Europe. The results included revenues from a Dollars 600m contract in the Netherlands to build a combined cycle gas turbine power station, which uses both steam and gas. GEC-Alsthom has also seen strong demand for coal-fired power stations in eastern Germany. Transport operations, best known for the TGV, the high speed train, also saw increased orders. The results to the end of March benefited from the contract to supply rolling stock to the Paris-Brussels-Cologne-Amsterdam high speed rail line and from a contract to supply standard rolling stock for the Channel tunnel.</p>

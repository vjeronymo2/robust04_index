			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (12): Controversy on how to cut the deficit  -Tax reform prospects FOR ONCE, all economists are in agreement. Turkey's yawning public sector deficit is the key cause of today's inflation. But questions of precisely how big the deficit is and how to reduce it leave the country  - and its economists - divided. Official Turkish statistics show a public sector borrowing requirement equivalent to a record 13 per cent of GNP in 1991. World Bank calculations which strip out the contributions of public sector banks and financial institutions put the financing requirement higher still, at 14 per cent. If inflation is allowed for, the figure falls to 8.4 per cent but still shows a clear jump in 1991, as it did in the previous election year of 1987. Buying votes is a traditional pastime for local politicians. It was, in other words, a tainted chalice which the Demirel government inherited. The new government quickly declared a 1992 target of reducing the PSBR from 13 per cent to 8.8 per cent. It also decided that increasing tax revenues would be the central plank of its policies. But there continues to be a major controversy over whether the measures it has proposed are adequate. Initially, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the minister of state responsible for the economy, talked of tax reform. One adviser, taking this message seriously, suggested a new tax on wealth. But this caused such an outcry that he left his job. It soon became clear that major reforms would be left for the future and that the present would concentrate on minor reforms such as a withholding tax on government interest payments, and reducing the tax loopholes for banks. In addition, the government announced a tax amnesty, a measure which attracted more criticism than might have been expected given the fact that in the past two decades Turkey has averaged one such amnesty every 28 months. The amnesty helped the Treasury by bringing in revenues which would not otherwise have been paid. Its effects were felt in April, but despite this, at the beginning of this month, the Treasury's borrowings from Turkey's Central Bank stood at TL26,000bn (Dollars 4bn), only 17 per cent below its legal limit for the year as a whole. The public sector thus finds itself with its back to the wall and facing a simple but awkward choice. Does it increase its borrowings from its domestic capital markets, thereby driving up interest rates at a time when it is seeking to reduce inflation? Or does it increase the prices of goods and services produced by the state - which also makes inflation look as if it is rising? A tax reform might alter the ground rules. At present the overall level of taxation is around 19 per cent of GNP, around one half of the OECD average of 37 per cent. Further, while there are a few highly publicised top tax payers, including Madame Manukiyan, the local brothel queen, the large rural population is exempt from direct taxation. Further, indirect taxation accounts for a disproportionate share of tax revenue. However, the underlying issue which the present government, like all its predecessors, has yet to face, is the extreme overstaffing of the central government and associated state economic enterprises. The Turkish prime minister is, directly and indirectly, probably the largest employer in the west. Ankara's present privatisation programme appears unlikely to alter this. Attempts to balance Turkey's budget are likely to remain a key issue throughout the 1990s and inflation to prove a stubborn target.

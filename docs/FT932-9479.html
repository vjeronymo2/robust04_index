			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Prudence pays at Mitsubishi - Financial THE LATE 1980s 'bubble' gave many Japanese institutions ambitions beyond their means. Mitsubishi Bank made mistakes then but kept tighter control on lending than most competitors. It is expected to announce non-performing loans of Y400bn (Dollars 3.6bn) at the end of March - about 1.3 per cent of outstanding loans and lower than the 3 to 4 per cent at other leading institutions. Fund management returns are higher on falling interest rates.</p>

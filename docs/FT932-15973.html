			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Employers face EC curbs on ability to cut pay EMPLOYERS' ability to reduce pay and conditions at short notice will be seriously impaired by a little-noticed clause the European Commission has forced the government to insert into the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, employers' organisations said yesterday. At present employers can generally give a few days' notice of terminating an existing employment contract, after which employees are technically dismissed and then offered re-employment on less favourable terms. During the recession many employers have been making, or trying to make, such changes, most notably Rolls-Royce in 1991. Sometimes employees accept the new terms but they are often resisted and, if employers are judged to have introduced the changes unfairly, employees can win damages at an industrial tribunal. But a clause in the Employment Rights Bill, designed to bring British law fully into line with the EC's Collective Redundancies directive and due to become law this summer, means that employers are likely to have to give 90 days' notice in the case of such technical dismissals. Previously the directive insisted on 90 days' notice only for ordinary redundancies where 100 or more employees were losing their jobs. The Employment Rights Bill introduces a more broad definition of redundancy to include 'dismissal for a reason not related to the individual concerned'. The Institute of Directors said it was 'concerned' about the effects of the change. 'We made representations to the government about this but they said there was no problem,' it said. A TUC official welcomed the change, saying it brought British law into line with the original directive. Other changes include the obligation on employers to 'seek to reach agreement with trade union representatives' on redundancies. The commission had been threatening legal action against Britain if it did not incorporate these points. Legal action may continue over the fact that in Britain consultation over redundancies is required only where unions are recognised.</p>

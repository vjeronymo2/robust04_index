			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Jan Ruml by Jiri Stastny; </F> place and date not given: "The Publication of Files Is a Tool  for Learning One's Own Past"]    [Text] Relations between the police and the  judiciary, the work of the Office for the Documentation and  Investigation of the Crimes of the StB [former State Security],  and making hitherto classified information accessible to the  public were the main topics of a CESKY DENIK interview with  Interior Minister Jan Ruml.    [Stastny] Mr. Minister, upon her appointment as attorney  general, Bohumira Kopecna set as her first task improving  cooperation between the Bureau of Investigation and the State  Attorney's Office. How does the Interior Ministry intend to deal  with that problem?    [Ruml] Even the police and frequently the courts come into  conflict with the Bureau of Investigation. I believe the  tension between these entities, which represent conflicting  interests, is completely natural. It is important, however,  that it does not go beyond a certain level of tolerability.  Last week, a meeting took place on this issue that was attended  by the minister of justice, the Supreme Court chairman, the  attorney general, the police director, the director of the  Bureau of Investigation, and I. We agreed at this meeting that  the State Attorney's Office would prepare a binding instruction  for its staff on how it is to deal with problems concerning  criminal activities, and, at the same time, similar memoranda  will be prepared for the police and the Bureau of Investigation.  These bodies are often inundated with work and have the  tendency to return individual cases for additional investigation  just to gain time. Frequently, problems are caused by the human  factor and can be solved by an accommodating approach.    It is necessary that the Criminal Code amendment currently  in  effect meet expectations and that most of the process of  obtaining a conviction take place before the courts and not with  the police or the Bureau of Investigation.    [Stastny] Are there similar problems in communications  between the Police Presidium and lower police units?    [Ruml] The problem is much more serious between the police,  whether enforcing order or investigating crime, and the Bureau  of Investigation, which often duplicates the work of the police.  Policemen always see evidence differently from the examiner,  know more than they can prove, and are assessed on the basis of  solving cases. That is different from the examiner, who is  responsible for establishing clear-cut crimes. These interests  do not always coincide. It often is a matter of the appointment  of personnel so the people involved get along together.    [Stastny] Are you planning to augment the powers of the  Office for the Documentation and Investigation of the Activities  of the StB?    [Ruml] I do not believe it necessary to augment the powers  of that office. It would be more expedient to make sure that  its work is more effective. It has all the powers necessary  because it can collect documentation as well as investigate, so  it is also a body active in investigating criminal activities.  There is nothing to prevent this office from initiating  criminal proceedings if it obtains the necessary evidence. We  should focus on the question of whether there are the resources  within the institution itself. Its powers are sufficient, and  the 50 employees, I believe, provide it with the conditions  needed to bring to light many things of the past.    [Stastny] How do you feel about the proposed way to publish  the names of StB collaborators?    [Ruml] So far, only the outline of the system has been  agreed upon. According to this, every citizen has the right to  know what type of information has been obtained on him. In  response to a citizen's question, the ministry will either  report that the specific files do not exist and explain why, or  the citizen will be given the opportunity to view them, copy  them, etc. It is a tool for learning about our own past so we  will not leave blank spots on the map of the past 40 years. It  should also contribute to a relaxation in society, and every  citizen should have the right to obtain information on himself.    [Stastny] Has the problem of blotting out the names of other  people referred to in these files been solved?    [Ruml] It has not been solved in principle, and no law is in  the legislative process. Apparently the government will have to  make a decision on this. Personally, I believe that only the  names of people who do not belong in the file and appear there  by some coincidence should be blotted out. If the names of  agents were blotted out, the law would lose any meaning. Let the  people know who reported on them! I do not believe that it  would cause a "witch hunt." We can see from the example of  Germany that it has more of a purifying effect.    [Stastny] How are the police equipment tenders progressing?    [Ruml] Some have been closed--the one for jeeps and the one  for digital fingerprinting systems, for instance. Tenders are  in progress on a standard police vehicle, an FM radio system,  and vehicles with speed-gauging equipment for the traffic  police. The Interior Ministry is inviting its own tenders  because, so far, there is no law on public orders. We are  trying for the maximum objectivity and also include on the  selection commissions experts from other sectors so that not  even a shadow of suspicion of bribery can fall on the  commission. This is a very demanding method but the only  feasible one because the public sphere must be subject to  control, and open public tender is the best form of control over  financial spending.</p>

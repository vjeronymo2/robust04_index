			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Tobacco puffing under threat FT-SE Index: 2,538.4 (+21.2) Today's vote in the European Parliament on the banning of tobacco advertising raises the question of how seriously the equity market should take the anti-smoking lobby. Certainly, the spectacle of one of Europe's more politically powerful industries quivering before an institution once described as the mother-in-law of parliaments is thought-provoking. The verdict of the Strasbourg assembly may not be the final word. But if its record on other emotive issues like lead-free petrol is anything to go by, it will influence thinking in the Council of Ministers later this year. The problem for investors is working through the implications of a total ban. At face value, the industry's propaganda suggests that advertising is a minus sum game, aimed at brand recognition and market share rather than total consumption. BAT and Rothmans do not disclose the size of their budgets. Perhaps 5 per cent of net sales is a fair guess, or Pounds 30m-Pounds 50m in the case of BAT's European business. It is instructive to recall that when tobacco advertising was outlawed in Canada, volumes fell but profits increased. In the longer term, of course, companies will no doubt find other ways of spending the money. Marketing effort will move to the point of sale, with price discounts likely to displace newspaper and billboard advertising. The multinationals, moreover, will be at a disadvantage against state monopolies in France or Spain. On the whole, though, the correct response by investors to a ban seems to be to sell advertising agencies.</p>

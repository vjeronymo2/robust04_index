			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Peer's inner quest - Theatre The RSC is now giving John Barton's production of Peer Gynt, in Stratford's intimate Swan Theatre, only two months after it co-presented Yukio Ninagawa's touring production in the great big Barbican auditorium. Ninagawa's involved a vast metal box set, painted two-dimensional scenery, and film projections; Barton's has no real scenery at all, just props. Each catches different facets of Ibsen's vision. Watching Barton's (which he first created for Oslo's National Theatre), I sometimes missed the colour, energy, and epic sprawl of Ninagawa's version, and its tremendous central performance by young Michael Sheen. But Ninagawa kept gilding Ibsen's onion with fancy layers of his own, whereas Barton simply peels it and reveals its layers to us. A certain amount of editorial rearrangement is involved. Barton (adapting C Fry's version, with lyrics by Adrian Mitchell) has homed in on the beautiful choral lines near the end ('We are thoughts. You should have thought us  .'), and he adds a prologue of Peer's birth (chorus: 'We are the thoughts you must think . . .'), and an epilogue (Peer: 'I am the thoughts I made myself shun . . .'). The emphasis is all on Peer's inner quest, and some peripheral characters are wholly or partly cut. The Nordic farmfolk are here Irish (as in Ninagawa's); and some of the minor trolls are Scots. Ibsen's large dramatis personae are enacted by just 11 actors (plus four musicians). The most important stroke lies in casting the same actress - the fine Haydn Gwynne - as both Peer's mother Aase and as his wife Solveig. Though Gwynne distinguishes between the wary old Aase and the trusting young Solveig, she reveals how like they are in their love for Peer; how Aase's mother-love is in fact the preparation for Solveig's wife-love. Ibsen was often ahead of Freud. The casting of Alfred Burke as both Solveig's father and the Button-Moulder pays equal dividends. The two roles, often unalike, here find many connections, especially since Barton has also found a heretofore unstaged scene in Ibsen's manuscript for Solveig, her father, and Peer. A role like Peer is just what the marvellously assured and amiable Alex Jennings needed to lever himself out of the rut of harshly debonair young toffs he keeps playing. Alas, he falls right back into it in Act Four, where he hardly hints at the young peasant beneath the sophisticated veneer Peer dons as Sir Peer, then Emperor of Bedlam. Yet in the first three acts he is splendid at Peer's blarney; his voice is softer here, and his face, with its little Petrushka nose and its gaping mouth, looks like a pumpkin. Jennings's authority is never in doubt, and he makes it increasingly clear that the play is his spiritual journey. There are, admittedly, several more layers of the onion for him to reveal. In Act Five he ages less than any Peer I have ever seen, and yet does little to hint at the peasant he was once; he even drops almost any hint of the Irish accent he mastered so well for the youthful scenes. Nor does he always persuade us that young Peer believes in all his own play-acting and story-telling. But this is the most tender and the most imaginative performance Jennings has given us. The centre of the play is clearly its poetic visions. Peer's restless journeying reminds you of many others. It brings to mind not only umpteen folk tales, but also the quests of Hamlet, Faust, Candide; as well as the Rake's progress. And I had never realised before how Peer's castles in the air pave the way for Ibsen's later Master Builder. Peer Gynt, even when cut, is too vast for perfect comfort; I always become restless myself during Act Four. But what makes Barton's account of Peer Gynt so refreshing is its economy. Simple magic is achieved through little showers of snow, sand, soap-bubbles, or stardust. Peer may journey through the whole world, and yet it is as if he is just a boy losing himself in a toy theatre. And it is at home that he must find himself. In repertory at the Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon</p>

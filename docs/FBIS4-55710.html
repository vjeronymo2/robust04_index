			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F> Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Ryszard Bilski and Maciej  Lukasiewicz; place and date not given: "Our Border Is Open to  the Greeks"]    [Excerpts] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] A great achievement is the  fact that talks have finally been held between Greece and  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  (in New York, with the participation of Cyrus Vance) -- you told  RZECZPOSPOLITA in late August of last year. You also expressed  great satisfaction with the fact that both parties had  unanimously agreed that they would continue talks until the  dispute was settled. Unfortunately, the talks were soon broken  off. What is more, Greece once again imposed a blockade on  Macedonia -- first of all it denied it the access to the seaport  at Salonika. What led to this sudden increase in the tension  between Athens and Skopje?    [Gligorov] The Republic of Macedonia has all along believed,  and it still does, that direct talks are the only way to settle  any disputes. I do not know any more effective method. Only  political dialogue at a common table can help reach a compromise.    Last year's talks at the United Nations were indeed very  promising. Unfortunately, Greece unilaterally broke them off.  It justified this decision with the holding of parliamentary  elections, which, incidentally, was true. One could accept this  argument if, after the elections, the dialogue had been resumed.  Such a course of events might then be considered normal.  However, this did not take place.    It is worth recalling that as early as the election  campaign,  Pasok [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] supported slogans that  were very radical and not conducive to the climate of  reconciliation; when the new authorities came to power, they did  not only make no any attempts to resume the talks, but in  addition a decision was made to further flame the political  atmosphere, which was already very hot and unfavorable for us.    Thus, populist undertakings were chosen. At great rallies  the nationalistic passions were further excited. This method  could only lead to the radicalization of public opinion, to the  decreasing of maneuverability, and to the limiting of the role  of the Greek delegation in further talks.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Exactly. Can you see any chances of  resuming the Macedonian-Greek dialogue? What concessions is  Skopje prepared to make, and what concessions does it expect  from Athens?    [Gligorov] The Greek economic embargo has considerably  deteriorated our economic situation, which was already  difficult; this poor economic situation was caused by the  sanctions slapped against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  which was one of our important economic partners. We have not  retaliated and will not retaliate by imposing a similar embargo.  We will not organize any rallies intensifying the anti-Greek  atmosphere in Macedonia in reply to the Greek rallies. Our  borders are wide open to the Greeks and to Greek commodities.  [passage omitted]    The dispute between Macedonia and Greece is irrational. It  is emotional and does not make any sense. We are, after all,  close nations, with a common religion and possibly good  prospects for economic cooperation. Macedonia is the Greek road  to Europe and Greece -- the Macedonian access to the sea. We  are a small, peaceloving country. We have made it clear in our  Constitution that we have no territorial claims on any of our  neighbors. We are not a military superpower that might threaten  Greece, which has five times as many inhabitants as we do.  Moreover, Greece is a member of NATO and the European Union.  Thus, if one takes into account all these things, one cannot  help but draw the conclusion that it is possible to resolve this  irrational dispute through rational means. [passage omitted]    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What hopes do you pin on Macedonia's  participation in the Central European Initiative?    [Gligorov] My country is definitely pro-European. We  believe that the integration of the Republic of Macedonia with  this European association is the most important, fundamental  goal for us. We link it to the process of Europeanization of  the entire Balkans and Eastern Europe. We believe that it  results from the internal need of the individual states -- from  the new European architecture. The Central European Initiative  may be of great assistance in the process of accelerating the  introduction of European Standards, in the integration of states  of the post-socialist region with the EC.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] It is here, in Skopje, that we heard of the  idea of forming a Slavic-Orthodox alliance. What is your  opinion on this initiative and would Macedonia join such a union?    [Gligorov] I believe that any ideas concerning new  alliances, such as Slavic-Orthodox, Muslim, or others, are  detrimental; they may prove tragic for the Balkans and for  Europe. Along with the downfall of socialism and the division  into blocs, Europe had a great chance to overcome and curb the  process of creating new ethnic, religious, and other divisions.  Such alliances mean a return to painful experiences, as well as  the creation of new conflicts and a road leading to calamities.  The Republic of Macedonia would not decide to enter into such  alliances, today or ever.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Macedonia was the first country to which UN  peacekeeping forces were sent before -- as it is most often  called -- the "fire" broke out. What is your evaluation of the  preventive policy of the West in this part of Europe? Do you  feel safe? How can lasting peace be ensured in the Balkans?    [Gligorov] The preventative mission of UN forces in  Macedonia is of great importance, which extends beyond our  borders. It was a wise, far-reaching decision. The settlement  of conflicts, the prevention of fires makes far greater sense  than putting them out only later on. The UN forces in the  Republic of Macedonia, which also include a U.S. contingent  (almost half of the soldiers), give us a feeling of greater  security. The presence of the said units is interpreted as  proof of UN and U.S. support for the maintenance of Macedonia's  territorial integrity, peace, and stabilization. Lasting peace  in the Balkans can be guaranteed first of all through respect  for and maintenance of the present borders, prevention of any  attempts to alter them by force, countering of the policy of  ethnic cleansing, and the granting of rights to national  minorities. The policy of territorial claims, breaches of human  rights and the rights of minorities, as well as the cultivation  of historical myths and territorial appetites may only lead to  new conflicts. Tragic proof of this is the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Every now and then there appear disquieting  reports about preparations on part of the Albanian minority  (according to official data, they constitute 20 percent of the  population, whereas the Albanians claim that they represent 40  percent) to gain -- even with the use of force -- considerable  autonomy. In this connection there are rumors about the danger  of the outbreak of civil war, about the danger of drawing the  Albanians from Kosovo and from Albania into such a conflict.  Also, the possibility of an armed intervention by Serbia is  taken into account. How can "the writing" of this tragic  scenario be prevented?    [Gligorov] In the Republic of Macedonia, aside from the  Macedonian people (approximately 69 percent of the population),  live many national minorities. The most numerous is the  Albanian minority (approximately 21 percent of the population).  There are also Turks, Gypsies, Romanians, and Serbs. This year  we will conduct a national census, under the auspices of  European establishments, to once and for all dispell the myths  and end the speculations about the size of the minorities,  especially the Albanian minority. This minority has several  parties, two of which are represented in parliament and  constitute the third most numerous political force.  Representatives of this minority are also members of the  coalition government.    It is true that certain radical groups or individuals are  making attempts to establish semi-military organizations, but  they do not meet with great support from the Albanian community  in Macedonia. I believe that this is mainly because the  Albanians and the Macedonians have never in their history been  in a conflict. Thus, prevailing is the striving for  coexistence, mutual respect, tolerance, and dialogue.    All the predictable "black scenarios," which you have  mentioned, will be real as long as the Bosnian "fire" is raging.  They will be dangerous until the situation in Kosovo is normal.  Also, one cannot rule out the possibility of any outside  attempts to destabilize the situation in our Republic. Each of  these dangers threatens an all-Balkan fire, which might soon  spread to the whole of Europe. Frankly, I hope that this will  not take place. [passage omitted]</p>

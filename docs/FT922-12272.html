			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Universe grows as investment black holes close - Sweden and Switzerland plan to liberalise the ownership of shares by foreigners Europe's universe of equity investment is expanding, with the planned removal of restrictions on foreign ownership of shares in Sweden and Switzerland. The process is likely to be a jerky one, but in time the corporate sectors of two countries that add up to the equivalent of the world's ninth-biggest economy will be much more accessible to foreign capital. From July 1, Switzerland will implement a new business code that will prevent companies from refusing to register shares on the grounds that their owners are foreign. In Sweden, rules in companies' articles of association that limit foreigners to 40 per cent of a company's capital or 20 per cent of its voting rights are due to vanish by the start of next year. In both countries, there are obstacles to this liberalisation of share ownership. Swiss companies will still be free to impose limits on the size of stake that any shareholder can build - some are as low as 2 per cent. Swedish companies are asking the government to delay its proposed deadline for the abolition of foreign ownership restrictions by one year, to January 1, 1994. Nevertheless, over time the impact of the reforms will be significant. A study by SG Warburg Securities, the London-based broker, of 13 big Swedish companies - accounting for roughly half of the country's total market capitalisation - suggests that only 40 per cent of their shares are theoretically accessible to foreigners. The figure is closer to 32 per cent in practice, since some of the ostensibly free shares are unlikely to move out of Swedish hands. If these big companies are any guide, the internationally available portion of Sweden's stock market capitalisation will treble once the reforms are complete. In Switzerland, the portion of the market closed off to foreigners is more limited. At the end of the 1980s, for example, registered shares constituted only a quarter of total market capitalisation. Even if all registered shares had been closed to foreigners at that point - and some had already opened up - making them accessible would raise the portion of the Swiss stock market attainable by international buyers by no more than one third. There may be unpleasant surprises on the way. International portfolio managers have not forgotten, for example, that when Nestle decided to allow foreigners to buy its registered shares in 1988, the Swiss index of all such shares rose 9 per cent overnight, while that of bearer stock and participation certificates dropped by more than 4 per cent. In Sweden, a typical company has two classes of shares: A shares usually have 10 times the voting power of B shares. Each category is subdivided into 'free' and 'restricted' shares, depending on whether they are open to foreigners or not. In the 13 Swedish companies studied by Warburg, A shares represent 57 per cent of total capitalisation, but contain 91 per cent of the voting power. In some companies the difference is even more marked: Electrolux's A shares account for only 3 per cent of total share capital but hold 97 per cent of the votes. Once the free/restricted distinction disappears, the difference between A and B shares may become more marked, say the Warburg analysts, particularly in those companies where there is a significant float of A shares. Investors will need to watch out, says Warburg: 'There are instances where the removal of foreign ownership restrictions could actually lead to a deterioration rather than an improvement in the relative attractions of low-voting B shares.' In Switzerland, the Nestle experience has led to an erosion of the premiums once enjoyed by bearer shares. Indeed, says Mr Hans Kaufmann of Bank Julius Bar in Zurich, there has really been only one sector where these premiums have still applied in recent years: insurance. The assumption had been, until very recently, that insurance companies would not be covered by the opening of share registers, because they were affected by restrictions on foreign ownership of Swiss property assets. Mr Kaufmann believes this assumption is unfounded. The property restriction is under review by the government, he says, and in time insurers will open their share registers. Earlier this month, Schweizerische Lebensversicherung und Rentenanstalt, of Zurich, was the first insurer to remove all restrictions on ownership of its equity. Since then, Swiss insurers' registered shares have risen relative to bearers and participation certificates, as investors anticipate an opening-up. The changes will ripple through the Swiss financial system over the next few years. The banks - in their role as stockbrokers - have already dropped their 30-year-old ban on handling foreigners' purchases of registered shares. The big banks themselves, however, remain immune from the changes: the equity of a bank with 'Swiss' in its name must stay in local hands.</p>

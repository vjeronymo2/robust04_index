			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (3): External debt - can an inflexible rule be bent? The structure of Uganda's external debt and the heavy toll of repayments on the recovery programme tests the wisdom of the inflexible rule that obligations to the multilateral institutions cannot be rescheduled, writes Michael Holman. The country's external debt, including principal and interest arrears at Dollars 585.4m, comes to Dollars 2.7bn, equivalent to more than 100 per cent of GDP. Total scheduled debt servicing for 1992-93 amounted to Dollars 173m, more than 80 per cent of export earnings. The government was able to pay less than half this amount. Out of a total scheduled debt-service payment of USDollars 2bn for the period 1993-2010, some Dollars 1.4bn will go to multilateral creditors - principally the IMF and the World Bank, according to an Oxfam study published earlier this year.* Whereas the World Bank has maintained a positive net transfer of resources, this has not been the case with the Fund, says Oxfam, the British aid agency. Between 1987 and 1990, there was a net transfer to the IMF from Uganda of Dollars 90m. Although there has been a compensating positive transfer since then, in the absence of new resources the sharp rise in repayment levels from 1993 will again result in negative transfer, the Oxfam study points out. Payments to the IMF will peak in 1997, representing more than a third of total debt payments, it calculates. Overall, says Oxfam, payments to the IMF will exceed Dollars 200m between 1993 and 1998, resulting in a negative transfer of resources to the Fund. 'In summary, the Ugandan government has no choice under existing debt rules but to request additional bilateral aid to repay its multilateral debt. Its dilemma starkly illustrates the case for a change in the rules and the removal of the taboo against multilateral debt reduction,' the analysis continues. There is a further difficulty, notes Oxfam. Under exisitng Paris Club rules, official creditors will not reschedule or reduce any debt contracted after a fixed date, usually coinciding with the debtor country's first application to the Club. Uganda's cut-off date is 1981, which means that of the Dollars 65m of arrears and maturities falling due to the Paris Club in 1993-94, as much as Dollars 44m is not eligible for rescheduling or reduction. 'The upshot is that Uganda's next trip to the Paris Club will result in savings of approximately Dollars 9m, equivalent to 5 per cent of the country's annual service bill.' The cut-off date, argues Oxfam, should be moved to at least 1987, when the NRM government came to power. 'A large proportion of bilateral debt was inherited by the current government from the brutal and corrupt regimes of Idi Amin and Milton Obote,' much of which was 'irresponsibly squandered and irresponsibily lent'. * Multilateral debt as an obstacle to recovery: the case of Uganda, Oxfam Briefing No 7, March 1994, Oxfam House, 274 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 7DZ.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article M. Sarkisyan: "Is Forum `Going Into Battle?'"] </F>   [Text] The Fourth Armenian Businessmen's Forum has  completed its work. The organization, created with the purpose  of combining the efforts of business people and helping Armenia,  which is going through transition period difficulties, finally  has made it to the big league.    This happened at the price of debunking a myth nurtured for  decades: That all the diaspora as a whole and its business  circles in particular think about is the good of their historic  homeland. It turned out that most of them if they have not lost  interest in the Motherland entirely, at the very least are quite  indifferent to it.    It also became clear for everyone that there is no place for  charity in business. Emotions are nice, but business may  flourish only if the necessary financial and legal base have  been created for it.    And last, the forum participants have realized that their  attention should center on the interests of Armenian economy.  The efforts of Armenian businessmen should be directed at its  prosperity. Correspondingly, they will reap dividends due them  only if this goal is achieved.    Let us start from the beginning, though. The latest forum  resembled only remotely the first one, which had been marked by  pomp and universal euphoria. It differed in the composition of  participants as well. Of the 120 foreign guests, 80 were our  Iranian compatriots. I should note that four years ago there  were guests from more than 50 countries. In this connection,  France d'Arteng, the French ambassador extraordinary and  plenipotentiary to the Republic of Armenia, very tactfully and,  of course, quite correctly pointed out that this was to be  expected. And in fact, unlike in the United States and France,  Armenians in the Near East, in particular in Iran, live in  communities, are better organized, and have retained their  ethnic values and hence the attachment to their historic  homeland. Besides, Iran is our neighbor; transportation  questions between us do get resolved one way or the other;  banking ties are being established; the population's standard of  living, the degree of technological development do not differ  substantially. So why not trade? It was the fortuitous  combination of these two circumstances that has led to a rather  resolved Iranian delegation landing in Yerevan.    This was matched by the atmosphere in the government's  conference hall, where the forum participants held their  meetings. For two days they discussed ways to overcome the  stagnation that has settled into their work. Many quite  openly--bordering on unfairly--expressed doubt in the abilities  of this organization's leadership. It came to a point where the  board chairman, V. Dzhazmadaryan, remarked that he might as well  step down.    Of course, the personality factor plays an important role in  any undertaking. Seriously speaking, however, the main topic of  the forum was the need to provide forward momentum.    Among objective reasons the only one that actually stands in  the way is the lack of a proper legislative base. Jumping ahead,  I will say that Armenian Supreme Council Deputy Ye. Shamshyan  informed the businessmen that a draft law on protection of  foreign investment is being readied to be submitted for  discussion. Moreover, he asked for proposals as to what  normative acts are needed in order to get things moving.    Very little has been accomplished over the past few years.  Not just in absolute terms, which would be understandable and  explainable, but even taking into account the opportunities  available both in the republic and outside it. Especially  impressive were remarks by O. Seferyan from India; A.  Ter-Torosyan, a businessman from the United States; A. Asriyan,  the Armenian Entrepreneurs Union's Chairman; and L. Agaronyan,  the chairman of the Armenian-Iranian Chamber of Commerce. In  particular, among priorities they named the need to get  compatriots from CIS countries involved, to develop more  flexible and effective forms of participation in resolving the  tasks facing Armenia, but of most importance, to begin concrete  work.    The primary means to serve this goal will be the Corporation  of Armenian Businessmen joint-stock society, set up by the  forum, which will assist in the development of small- and  medium-size business. Judging by the participants' enthusiasm,  its charter capital will exceed by far the originally planned  $200,000. As to expected dividends, nobody can guarantee them.  As in any business, there is risk.    Napoleon used to say that the most important part is to get  into a battle, and then see. The Armenian Businessmen's Forum  has moved from words to action. Among things on the drawing  board is to create with the participation of the European Bank  for Reconstruction and Development a financial corporation with  a charter capital of $12 million, which will meet the highest  standards of a commercial bank.    As to the forum organization, the audience was not ready for  normal work, and there was a shortage of information materials.  During Mme. d'Arteng's speech, the forum's Board Secretary Ruben  Grigoryan had to give up his seat in the Presidium to the  interpreter. And when Mr. A. Sobkhani, Iran's acting charge  d'affairs in Armenia, took the floor, there was no interpreter  in the conference hall at all. In desperation, he addressed the  audience half-jokingly in Armenian: "There are so many Armenians  from Iran here; how can it be that there is no interpreter?" And  then he and an interpreter took turns at the microphone...    Trifles perhaps? Depends how you look at it. In any case, if  these are trifles, they are certainly unpleasant ones.    Another conference of Armenian businessmen is behind us.  Also  behind us is another year of work, the only result of which is  the emergence of the Corporation of Armenian Businessmen. There  is another year ahead of us--until another forum, or rather, a  whole year which, I am sure, will finally show who is who among  businessmen and what their word is worth.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Bush blasts EC 'iron curtain' PRESIDENT George Bush last night called on the European Community to lift its 'iron curtain of protectionism', amid fears that EC opposition to farm subsidies reform may still wreck the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Mr Bush, speaking to American farmers in Kansas City, accused the EC of using 'massive' subsidies to protect its farm exports. He vowed to continue US subsidies in the absence of an agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). 'I will not unilaterally disarm American farmers,' he said. Mr Bush's comments appeared to be part of a political initiative within the US to gain support from a key economic sector. He said he was not pessimistic about the chances of a Gatt agreement and his intervention was not seen as an attempt to increase tension in the EC-US conflict on farm subsidies. Mr Bush was speaking after the countries taking part in the trade liberalisation talks in Geneva yesterday unanimously agreed to try to complete the talks by Easter. But the EC remains opposed to the draft agreement on farm trade reform, the most crucial of the 26 draft accords concluded last month. The draft was prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, after the US and the EC failed to reach agreement following weeks of intensive talks. The EC's stance is seen by negotiators as by far the most threatening. The EC received some support at yesterday's meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC), called to decide the future of the five-year-old round. Japan, South Korea, Canada and Switzerland were among participants also expressing serious reservations about proposals in the agriculture text. Mr Dunkel, who is also chairman of the TNC, said he was prepared to serve as 'honest broker' in the resolution of any outstanding differences. He warned, however, that any move to adjust the 436-page text 'must be very precise and concentrated entirely on what we all can collectively agree to without unravelling the package'. The EC delegation is ready to continue negotiations despite reservations. Japan fears, Page 3 South Korean exports, Page 15</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / CBS (Can they all Be Serious?): The likely suitors for the biggest prize among the US television networks Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of CBS, the US television network, could not have been more blunt when he spoke to reporters two weeks ago. 'I'm sending a signal to Wall Street,' he said. 'I want to make it unequivocal . . . we have absolutely no intention today of selling CBS.' Wall Street, however, was not listening. Since Mr Tisch's denial that CBS was up for sale rumours have mounted about a possible bid for the television network. Investors anticipating a takeover have bought CBS shares, helping to push the price up almost 9 per cent from its recent low to about Dollars 315. Among those mentioned as possible suitors for CBS are the film and entertainment company Walt Disney, the media magnate Mr Ted Turner, whose Turner Broadcasting System owns cable television channels such as CNN, and Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest US cable television operator. Of these possible candidates, TCI is regarded as the most likely buyer. The group has said it would be interested in acquiring CBS in partnership with Mr Barry Diller, the entertainment business executive. Mr Diller, currently chairman of QVC Network, the cable television home-shopping channel, has already tried to take control of CBS. But his plans to merge CBS with his company fell through last month after QVC's largest shareholder, the cable group, Comcast Communications, took over QVC. Speculation about a bid for CBS was intensified by Mr Diller's failed plans  -and Mr Tisch, for all his protesting about newspapers recycling 'tired' old bid rumours, has inadvertently added to the uncertainty over the television network's future. When he agreed to the merger with Mr Diller's QVC, Mr Tisch made it clear the deal would mark the beginning of the end of his time at CBS. 'I've been here eight years now. I've enjoyed it immensely, but there's a time when you sort of move on,' said the 71-year-old Mr Tisch. Now that the merger plan has collapsed, Mr Tisch is having a hard time convincing Wall Street that he is suddenly interested in running CBS again, and maintaining its independence. Though the failed merger plans triggered talk of CBS's sale, the likelihood is that buyers would anyway have begun circling the television network. Mr Tisch has turned CBS, once the least successful of the 'big three' US networks, into a handsomely profitable business. In 1993, it reported record after-tax profits of Dollars 326.2m on sales of Dollars 3.5bn. CBS shares rose 53 per cent last year. Earnings growth has been driven by the core broadcast television group. So successful is CBS's programming, that the network now ranks first in ratings during the daytime, prime-time and late night-time periods, a unique treble. Among its most successful programmes are Late Night with David Letterman, which dominates late evening chat shows, the comedy programme Murphy Brown and drama programmes such as Northern Exposure. The company also owns local television stations and a radio business, both of which make money. But outsiders also see potential for taking the business into new areas. One of the most common criticisms of Mr Tisch's reign at CBS is that he has been too conservative, choosing to concentrate on mainstream broadcasting. 'It's a great brand name, it has a terrific franchise and tremendous distribution capability,' says Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst at the Wall Street broking firm Oppenheimer. But she adds: 'There's more that can be done - for example, CBS never expanded into cable.' Mr Tisch is also cautious about CBS's finances. He has built up a Dollars 1.1bn cash pile which the group last month announced it plans to use to buy back 3.5m of its own shares at Dollars 325 a share. The move is seen as defensive strategy to push up its own share price after the failed QVC merger but, according to one industry observer, it illustrates Mr Tisch's 'lack of ambition'. Potential buyers can also legitimately ask whether CBS can maintain its ratings supremacy. Some of its most popular prime-time shows are beginning to look a little old, and its sports programming has been hit by the recent loss of the rights to cover American football games to Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox television network. Another set-back was the departure in April of Mr Jeff Sagansky, the programming executive credited with putting together CBS's successful schedule. Such potential weaknesses - as well as CBS's current strengths - will be fed into the calculations of possible buyers in the next few months as they decide whether to make an offer. To succeed, a bid would probably cost about Dollars 6bn. But for Mr Diller in particular, that may present a big obstacle because, by himself, he would lack the financial muscle to raise the sums involved. This is where TCI comes in. It could finance a Diller bid - although Mr Jack Malone, TCI chairman, has said he would only do so if Mr Laurence Tisch would sell to them. 'If Larry still wants Barry, and Barry still wants Larry, the money can be found,' Mr Malone told told New Yorker magazine. There would be logic to such a move. Mr Diller's managerial and programming talents, TCI's cable operations, and CBS's broadcasting franchise would mesh easily. But although TCI may be the most likely bidder for CBS, others can also see benefits from buying the network. A merger between Disney and CBS would bring together two of the strongest brand names in the US entertainment business. CBS's extraordinary reach across the US (it broadcasts into more than 99 per cent of the country's television-owning households) would provide a distribution network for Disney's entertainment products. But any deal with Disney may be complicated by government rules which restrict links between film studios and television networks - though these rules are due to be relaxed in late 1995. For the other potential bidder, Turner Broadcasting, there would be obvious benefits in merging a cable programming company with a broadcast network. Mr Turner has never hidden his ambition to run a network but he cannot move without the assent of his company's two main shareholders - TCI and Time Warner - which are unlikely to be so keen on a deal. Time Warner plans to launch its own television broadcast network and TCI would be unwilling to give the go-ahead if it had its own plans for CBS. The competition building to take over CBS may be ominous. For decades US television was dominated by three broadcasters: CBS, ABC and NBC. Now, with the arrival of a fourth network in the shape of Mr Murdoch's Fox Television, two more newcomers on the horizon (Paramount, like Time Warner, plans its own network), and scores of cable channels providing programming to viewers, the field has become crowded. As Mr Richard Grand-Jean, president of the specialist investment banking firm Global Film Equity, warns: 'You have to ask yourself, with all the programming becoming available over time, if there are not good reasons to be cautious about paying very robust prices for a network.'</p>

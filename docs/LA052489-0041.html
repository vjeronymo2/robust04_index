			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAINING IS REVIVED ON SCHOOL STRIKE ISSUES;  </P> <P> INFORMAL SESSIONS WITH LEGISLATORS BRING NEW FACE-TO-FACE TALKS; ANOTHER  MEETING SET TODAY  </P> <P> In an unusual move to determine who is telling the truth in the increasingly  bitter Los Angeles teachers' strike, area legislators called both sides to  Sacramento on Tuesday for a series of informal closed-door meetings that ended  with a face-to-face bargaining session.  </P> <P> Union and school district delegations flew separately to the capital in an  effort to resolve some of the confusion over conflicting reports of salary  offers and perhaps bring the strike, now in its second week, closer to an end.  </P> <P> Sources said the aim of the impromptu face-to-face talks, which lasted almost  two hours and ended after 9 p.m., was to lay the groundwork for substantive  bargaining sessions and to come up with a list of issues still dividing the two  sides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Signs of Movement  </P> <P> When the session broke up, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) would  say only that she was "very, very pleased" that the two sides had agreed to ask  a state mediator to meet with them in Los Angeles this afternoon.  </P> <P> As the meetings began early Tuesday afternoon, state Senate President Pro Tem  David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) described what was taking place as "a  fact-finding mission."  </P> <P> "We are hoping we can bring them back to the table. . . . If we can help, we  will do it," said Roberti, who was one of 19 Democratic Assembly and Senate  members who met with union and school board representatives in a series of  separate meetings.  </P> <P> Also discussed was the windfall $2.5-billion state surplus announced last week.  The Los Angeles Unified School District may be in line for as much as $48  million in additional funds this year, school officials said. But the  Legislature and governor's office must still determine when the money will  become available and just what part of it can be designated for teachers'  salaries.  </P> <P> Although both sides described the talks with legislators as cordial, they were  unsure what impact they might ultimately have on the strike.  </P> <P> The legislators are "interested in what we had done and why we had done it and  they wanted to know how they could be helpful," said school board member Jackie  Goldberg.  </P> <P> School board members say they offered teachers a three-year contract with  guaranteed 8% raises each year in a bargaining session that ended in rancor  Sunday. Union officials have denied that any such offer was formally made.  </P> <P> Before leaving for Sacramento on Tuesday morning, United Teachers-Los Angeles  President Wayne Johnson again insisted that a formal offer was never made and  he volunteered to take a polygraph test to prove his point.  </P> <P> Johnson, who last week called for a 26% increase over three years, said Tuesday  that an increase of 8% each year "is somewhat of an acceptable figure . . . an  offer we would consider as part of a package."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conditions for Talks  </P> <P> Johnson also announced in the morning that he was ready to resume bargaining  Tuesday night, but only if the school board agreed to a face-to-face session.  </P> <P> But district spokeswoman Diana Munatones said that the next round of  negotiations will take place "when the state mediator asks us, not when Johnson  decides." The face-to-face meeting in Sacramento was apparently at the urging  of state legislators.  </P> <P> Munatones conceded that the 24% offer was "informal" but insisted that the  district would have formalized it if union representatives hadn't "scoffed" and  "angrily rejected it immediately." She added that the 24% offer is "no longer  on the bargaining table" and that the district's "formal" offer remains 21.5%  over three years.  </P> <P> As both sides were heading north Tuesday morning, 686 more teachers crossed the  picket lines and returned to classrooms. More students were trickling in as  well.  </P> <P> Attendance reports for the day showed that 300,944 of the district's 594,000  students attended class Tuesday -- up 7,426 from Monday, but still down  considerably from the 430,000 figure on the first day of the strike.  </P> <P> In addition, the district canceled its 4-A division baseball championship  playoffs because of the walkout, affecting 16 senior high school boys' teams.  The head coaches of all the teams refused to coach during the strike, district  officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Separate Flights  </P> <P> With relations worsening between the two sides since talks broke off and with  no new negotiating session slated, Johnson, with two aides, and school Supt.  Leonard Britton and two school board members caught separate late-morning  flights to Sacramento to discuss the situation.  </P> <P> Union officials said that Assemblywoman Teresa Hughes (D-Los Angeles), who  chairs the Assembly Education Committee, had been in touch with Johnson.  </P> <P> "She wanted the full story from each side why there isn't a settlement," said  union spokeswoman Catherine Carey.  </P> <P> In addition to Britton, school board members Roberta Weintraub, Goldberg,  negotiator Dick Fisher and financial officer Robert Booker made up the  district's contingent.  </P> <P> District officials said board President Weintraub had received a call from  Assemblywoman Waters on Monday morning, inviting the district to the capital to  explain the breakdown in talks and the state funding situation.  </P> <P> "We were summoned to come up here," said Goldberg during the flight north. "The  Los Angeles delegation called to say, 'What's going on down there?' They called  it an invitation but I felt definitely summoned. . . . They wanted to hear it  from the horse's mouth."  </P> <P> By the time the talks finally ended Tuesday night, the district and union  representatives had missed the last flight of the day from Sacramento and were  scurrying to find Los Angeles-bound flights from other Bay area cities.  </P> <P> In the marathon session, both sides said they lobbied for early release of the  extra state funds.  </P> <P> But state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig called the issue of the extra  money irrelevant as long as the school board is willing to pay a guaranteed 24%  pay increase. Until Sunday, the district's highest offer had been the 21.5% pay  increase, with an additional 2.5% contingent on available funds from  Sacramento.  </P> <P> "I don't know why the strike is continuing," Honig said. "There is no reason if  everyone agrees 8-8-8 is fair.  </P> <P> "All they have to do is go into a room and (agree). It's unconscionable to me  they haven't worked it out."  </P> <P> But Johnson has refused to be pinned down on whether the union would accept a  24% offer unless other concessions are made by the district on such things as  school management and wages lost by teachers during pre-strike job actions.  "I'm not prepared to say yes or no," Johnson said of the offer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Teachers' Responses  </P> <P> On the picket lines Tuesday, teachers differed on whether they would accept a  24% package. But many agreed with Johnson that it would take more than money to  get them back in the classroom.  </P> <P> "It's beyond money -- it's a matter of principle," said Rosalind Williams, a  seven-year teacher at Manual Arts High School.  </P> <P> Echoed Jefferson High School teacher Cathy Armstrong, "We've been underpaid so  long, it would have to be a magnificent offer to be something that a person  could live on. My feeling is if we can really improve the working conditions  and have school-based management, I believe most teachers would be willing to  make a compromise."  </P> <P> Besides the wage issue, a major sticking point is a board proposal that school  management councils, to decide such issues as school discipline, be evenly  divided between teachers and district appointees.  </P> <P> Union leaders say the proposal is unacceptable because it gives teachers  insufficient power in deciding school issues.  </P> <P> Current starting pay for Los Angeles teachers is $23,440 and the top is  $43,319, although that amount can be raised by extracurricular and summer  school duties.  </P> <P> In a related development Tuesday, the state Court of Appeal denied the union's  request for emergency relief against the district's withholding of paychecks  from teachers who have refused to submit roll books and student attendance  records and grades.  </P> <P> About 16,500 of about 28,000 regular teachers have already complied with the  superintendent's earlier directive that they turn in the records, the district  said.  </P> <P> Feldman reported from Los Angeles and Enriquez from Sacramento.

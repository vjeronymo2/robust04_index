			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LONG-SHOTS' OPTIMISM AS HIGH AS ODDS  </P> <P> Although unbeaten Mister Frisky and once-beaten Summer Squall are formidable  favorites for the Kentucky Derby, there are almost as many optimistic trainers  on the Churchill Downs backstretch as there will be horses in the starting gate  Saturday.  </P> <P> "When I look out there, I don't see any superstars, no Seattle Slews and no  Secretariats," said D. Wayne Lukas, who has an entry of Land Rush, Real Cash  and Power Lunch in the Derby field. "The thing that jumps out at you is that  there will be plenty of pace, and the favorites are going to be on or near that  pace. A horse with position and the best trip will have the best chance to  win."  </P> <P> "The two favorites are legitimate, but a lot of horses have a good chance,"  said Ron McAnally, trainer of Arkansas Derby winner Silver Ending. "Mister  Frisky won 13 of his races over questionable competition (in Puerto Rico) and  the (speed-biased) track was in his favor at Santa Anita. Summer Squall has won  every different way and on all kinds of tracks, but you must have strength to  go a mile and a quarter under 126 pounds."  </P> <P> "I know Summer Squall can run, but he's not going to set (a slow pace) on a dry  track Saturday," said Carl Nafzger, who will saddle Florida Derby winner  Unbridled. "Summer Squall will be pressing the pace, and that's a big  difference. Mister Frisky? I think he has to prove himself."  </P> <P> "They'll all hate me for saying this, but this is anybody's race and nobody  knows who's going to win," said trainer John Parisella. "Laz (Barrera) worked  (Mister Frisky) in 1:27 4-5, and that's not his M.O. And I don't think that  Summer Squall is coming up to this race right. I know one thing. Anybody who's  1-2-3-4 in the early running won't be around at the finish."  </P> <P> Behind the co-favorites, Unbridled, Land Rush and Silver Ending figure to draw  strong support while Country Day, Parisella's charge, is considered a long shot  with a chance. These trainers do not believe they are running for second money.  </P> <P> "With a good horse who is so giving, I'd normally like to give them a month  between starts," McAnally said of Silver Ending, who will run with only 13  days' rest. "But I ran him in Arkansas to get his confidence up and mine. He's  very competitive and very gutty. There's a great deal of speed in this race. If  he stays out of trouble and closes the way he did in Arkansas, he will make a  very good showing Saturday."  </P> <P> "I think we've been the best-kept secret on the backstretch," Lukas said of the  lack of media attention for his trio. "Our horses have thrived here this week,  and Land Rush couldn't be doing better. The Blue Grass was great for the  experience and conditioning we needed. We came out of our game plan to force  the issue. Summer Squall (the Bluegrass winner) was wrapped up tight under Pat  Day. The wet track didn't help, either. Land Rush is a bit gangly and not the  nifty horse you need to win in the mud. But he likes this track just fine.  </P></p>

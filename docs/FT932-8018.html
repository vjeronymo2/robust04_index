			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh surge takes gold to highest since Gulf War ANOTHER FRENZIED day in the gold market yesterday saw the US dollar price rise at one point in the morning to Dollars 384.50 a troy ounce, its highest level since the panic buying just after the start of the Gulf War in January, 1991. Traders said profit-taking by investment funds after the New York market opened pulled back the price in the afternoon and it closed in London at Dollars 377.15, up Dollars 6.90 an ounce or by nearly 2 per cent from Tuesday's close. Gold's price slumped to a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce in London on the first trading day of 1993. The rise during the past four weeks, inspired by high-profile investors Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros, has taken the price up by 15 per cent. Dealers warned that the frantic conditions might re-appear today because many countries observe Ascension Day - including Germany, Switzerland and South Africa - and that could create a thin and volatile market. Analysts' reaction to gold's sudden upward surge was predictably mixed yesterday. Enthusiastic bulls suggested the price still had a long way to go and that the upward momentum would continue to be reflected in gold company share prices. 'Don't let the grass grow under your feet while you are pondering your next move in gold shares,' said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. 'Gold's pauses for breath are turning out to be very short indeed - more akin to the urgency of a Grand Prix pit stop than a lazy afternoon siesta.' But an official at Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, the world's biggest gold producer, told Reuter that the demand which had boosted prices recently appeared to have come from a fairly small speculative community which could be unable to sustain prices at present levels.</p>

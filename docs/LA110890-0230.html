			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIMING FOR AN 'IOWA BY THE SEA'  </P> <P> Does the city of Long Beach need to spend $16 million on banners, painted logos  and "barriers" to hide dangerous-looking buildings (Times, Nov. 4)? Does  changing the language we use to refer to downtown Long Beach give the  appearance of improvement? This has got to be the most bonehead idea that the  City Fathers have ever pursued.  </P> <P> Especially when in the same section of the paper was an article titled "Murders  Up 25% in L.B. from the same period in '89." Instead of spending $16 million to  give the appearance of an interesting and livable city, use the money to  improve the police force. Maybe "Iowa by the Sea" is something to strive for.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA K. EVANS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

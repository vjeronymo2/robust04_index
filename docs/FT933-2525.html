			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / PLO intends to open office in Washington THE Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday it was planning to open an office in Washington as soon as the US lifted its formal ban on contacts with the organisation. Mr Saeb Erekat, deputy head of the Palestinian negotiating team at the Washington talks on the Middle East, said in Amman that he expected the US would announce an end to the ban in about three weeks. The PLO mission would not have diplomatic status but would fulfil a political role, said Mr Erekat. Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, said on his return to Tunis, a week after the signing in Washington of the outline of an interim peace agreement with Israel, that Palestinians should now consider US President Bill Clinton a friend. PLO officials are anxious to build quickly on the new relationship with the US, in order to facilitate economic aid for the occupied territories and to assist in the difficult negotiations with Israel that lie ahead. Opponents of the Israeli-PLO agreement yesterday stepped up efforts to marshal opposition to the deal. Leaders of Hamas, the radical Islamic faction operating in Gaza and the West Bank, went to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials and other Palestinian factions. Hamas has agreed a truce with the PLO in the occupied territories but it believes that Mr Arafat has betrayed the Palestinians. It has pledged to continue the armed struggle against the continued presence of Israeli troops. Hamas leaders are also looking for support from Syria, which remains sceptical about the PLO-Israel accord but sent a representative to the signing ceremony. If Syria were also to reach an agreement with Israel, that would represent a blow to Hamas - even more so to Hizbollah, the radical Shia Lebanese organisation which is fighting to end the Israeli presence in south Lebanon. Syria is the main conduit by which arms and financial support from Iran reach Hizbollah.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin named Sergey Mikhailovich Shakhray, minister of  nationalities and regional policy, as deputy prime minister  today.    Shakhray, 38, who was named deputy minister in charge of  federal regional issues in 1991, was removed from the post and  given his present portfolio when Russian cabinet was reshuffled  in 1994.    The Party of Russian Unity and Harmony (PRUH) formed by  Shakhray participated in Russian parliamentary elections last  December and found its way to State Duma, the lower house.    Observers think that the PRUH faction in Duma, a mild  democrat group led by Shakhray, played a key role when the State  Duma passed amnesty in February this year.    The presidential press office announced that the  presidential  decree also stipulates that the number of deputy prime ministers  be increased from three, decided in January when the cabinet was  reshuffled, to six, including one first deputy prime minister.    Meanwhile, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, the minister of  economy, has recently been promoted to be deputy prime minister.</p>

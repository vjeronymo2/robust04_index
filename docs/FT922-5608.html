			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / BP hives off some tax work THE ENTIRE corporation tax staff of BP, the oil and petrochemicals producer, is to join Price Waterhouse in what the accountancy group claims is the first move of its kind in the UK. The contract for BP's corporation tax compliance work was put out to tender after the company announced plans to save Dollars 750m (Pounds 416.6m) a year from productivity improvements including a programme of up to 700 job cuts or transfers and a drive to contract out work now done internally. Mr Peter Hobbs, head of BP's global tax operations, said the move would enable the 20-strong tax team 'to offer a more focused service to the group while securing benefits from the diversity and scale of Price Waterhouse's tax practice'. BP will continue to do its own tax planning. Contracting out has become common practice in other sectors, such as data processing. Earlier this month BP announced the contracting out of responsibility for its share register.</p>

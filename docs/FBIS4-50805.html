			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Press Review" program] </F>   [Text] The fourth safe production week campaign will be  launched across the country from 15-22 May. Vice Premier Zou  Jiahua called on leading cadres at various levels to set an  example in treating it as an important task, so the safe  production week campaign will be unfolded truly in an organized,  well-guided, and down-to-earth way.    Zou Jiahua said: Since liberation, particularly during the  more than 10 years since the start of reform and opening up,  China has made great achievements in economic construction and  rapid progress in ensuring safe production. However, the  situation of safety in production remains grim and bad accidents  have occurred frequently over the last two years. Those  accidents have caused great losses to the people's lives and  property. They have also hurt our country's reputation. For  this reason, we must not treat the production safety issue  lightly, and must pay great attention to it at all times. All  enterprises should regard production safety as very urgent work  and do it well.    Zou Jiahua emphasized: In launching the safe production week  campaign, we must stress actual results and prevent formalism.</p>

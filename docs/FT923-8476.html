			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / People: McGrath moves to Evered Bardon Evered Bardon, the aggregates group whose share price has recently taken a pasting, has found a finance director whose arrival it hopes will underscore the new commitment to tighter control. William McGrath, 33, moves from the same position at Norwest Holst where he has spent the past two years; he also stepped in as acting managing director there between January and May when Chris Bucknall left after only a few months in the job. A chartered accountant, McGrath had previously accumulated six years' experience in the City - in the corporate finance departments of Lloyds Merchant Bank and Kleinwort Benson. His predecessor at Evered Bardon, John Ford, departed at the end of May; Ford had been brought into Evered by the Abdullah brothers, who launched the company on its aggressive spending spree that lasted through most of the 1980s. 'Now, it is all about making what we have got sweat,' says pragmatic group chief executive Peter Tom, who arrived last year following the merger between Bardon and Evered. Tom thinks McGrath's style will accurately reflect the change of priorities since the merger. 'John had a rather exciting relationship with the City. It is a question of fashion; the City is now looking for something else.' Evered has attracted criticism not only for its high gearing - which it is in the process of reducing by a series of disposals - but also for the quality of its accounts with respect to the valuations placed on past acquisitions. 'I never thought I would be pleased to see 30p,' chuckles Tom, referring to the 3p gain made by Evered's share price yesterday. The shares, down from a 1992 high of 88p, have underperformed the market by 47 per cent in the last month alone. ***** David McGarvey has been named managing director of CLAREMONT GARMENTS (Holdings), second in seniority on the board to Peter Wiegand, chairman and chief executive. McGarvey has been a director since the company's demerger from Alexon Group in July 1991 and the new post involves no extra responsibilities. 'It's in recognition of what he's been doing for the past year,' Wiegand said yesterday. ***** James Fyfe, financial director of MACDONALD MARTIN DISTILLERIES, has also been appointed deputy md. ***** Trevor Hart (left) has been promoted from general sales manager for WEETABIX and joins the board as sales director. Les Comley, sales and marketing director, becomes commercial director. ***** Philip Corfield is appointed supply chain director and Alan Tickner information systems and administration director of SPILLERS FOODS.</p>

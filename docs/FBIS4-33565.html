			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias  will say goodbye to Taiwanese Prime Minister Lien Chan, who is  on a four-day official visit to this country, at the Guatemalan  Air Force Headquarters this morning.    During his stay, Prime Minister Chan held a number of  meetings with the presidents of the three government branches  and was bestowed a number of medals, including the Order of  Quetzal.    Diplomatic sources have said the prime minister's visit  strengthened the ties of cooperation and friendship between the  two countries.    Before his departure today, Chan offered to support  President  Ramiro de Leon's efforts to rebuild the country with investments  as soon as a final peace agreement is signed with the guerrillas.    The official believes Guatemala will enter a stage of  reconstruction by ending the armed conflict, which began in  1960, and become a country that will attract Oriental investors.    Lien Chan also expressed his "respect for the good thoughts"  the Guatemalan president has to rebuild the country before and  after the signing of the peace agreement, which is scheduled for  December 1994.    According to the offer, Taiwan will join the countries that  will support projects of reconstruction and development, which  will allow the consolidation of peace. Meanwhile, Lien Chan is  carrying President de Leon's promise to support Taiwan's effort  to be admitted as an OAS observer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN Security Council meeting on Angola will no  longer be held tomorrow. The UN Security Council requires more  information concerning the Lusaka peace talks, and this  information will only reach New York after UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special  representative in Angola, have met in Geneva. Radio Angola  reporter Andeiro Joao has just interviewed Angolan Ambassador to  the UN Afonso van Dunem Mbinda.    [Begin recording] [Joao] Good evening, Ambassador Mbinda. So  we should see the UN Security Council hold its meeting on Angola  in New York tomorrow?    [Mbinda] I can tell you that no date date has been set yet  for a meeting of the UN Security Council. Informal  consultations will probably only begin tomorrow and it is quite  likely that a formal meeting of the UN Security Council will  only occur next week. That means that this meeting of the UN  Security Council has suffered a considerable delay.    [Joao] What reasons could be at the root of this latest  postponement of the UN Security Council's meeting on Angola?    [Mbinda] I do not know the reasons, but I think that the UN  Security Council would like to receive a report on the meeting  which the UN secretary general and UN Special Representative  Alioune Blondin Beye are scheduled to hold in Geneva today or  tomorrow. Moreover, the UN Security Council is waiting to  receive more information so that it can have as much information  as possible on the talks being held in the Zambian capital.  Those are the only reasons for the UN Security Council meeting  being delayed so many times.    [Joao] Ambassador Mbinda: If this UN Security Council  meeting  does go ahead, what decisions would the Angolan Government like  to see made?    [Mbinda] Well, our government hopes that the UN Security  Council will make a realistic analysis of the situation on the  ground and of the Lusaka peace talks, and that it will take  whatever measures are necessary.    [Joao] Mr. Ambassador: When you talk about necessary  measures, are you referring to a possible new package of  sanctions against UNITA?    [Mbinda] I do not believe that the UN Security Council will  take such measures. I do not believe that it will introduce a  second package of sanctions at this juncture. That is because  conditions are not in place for that to be done. The fact that  the Lusaka peace talks are continuing, that they have not  collapsed despite all the problems, all that makes us believe  that present conditions do not justify drastic measures against  UNITA by the UN Security Council. In view of that, I think that  when it holds its upcoming formal meeting the UN Security  Council will be asking UNITA to adopt a more realistic approach.  The fact is that UNITA has been given an opportunity. Our  government offered a number of ministerial portfolios and  afforded UNITA the possibility of wider participation in  government. So, the UN Security Council is waiting for UNITA to  come up with an answer as rapidly as possible. [end recording]</p>

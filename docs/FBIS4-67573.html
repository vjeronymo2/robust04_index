			<p>BFN     [Text] "There is no information to suggest that the leak of  corrosive plutonium-239 from the warheads on the Komsomolets  nuclear submarine could cause a degree of damage to the fishing  industries of countries which use the Norwegian and Barents seas  and to the local population."    The conclusion was contained in an ecological report by an  expert commission from Russia's ministry for environmental  protection (Minprirody) on proposals for the further operation  of the Komsomolets and on ways to minimize the emission of  radioactive substances from nuclear warheads on board into the  environment. Interfax received the information from the  Minprirody press center Thursday.    The ecological report said that at worst the dose which any  human being could receive from the emission of plutonium would  be far lower than the permissible yearly intake of plutonium by  the human body.    That conclusion can be backed up by a comparison of the  plutonium content in nuclear warheads on board the Komsomolets  (around 400 Curie) and the amount of plutonium in the Irish Sea,  into which British nuclear enterprises had emitted a total of  2000 Curie without noticeable pollution being recorded in the  fishing waters.    However, given the intensity of efforts to localize the  source of radiation at comparatively low cost, the expert  commission approved further projects for work on board the  Komsomolets. The outer slits in the vessel's bow would, it  said, be closed to eliminate the possibility of corrosive  plutonium leaking from the torpedo installations in the future.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Revenue moves on charity tax clause The Inland Revenue acted quickly yesterday to stave off a mistaken interpretation of law which would have forced many charities operating lotteries to pay additional tax. In a parliamentary written answer, Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, said the Revenue had received advice that a technique used by charities to set off lottery income against tax was 'incorrect'. The change affects all charities that operated a lottery through a subsidiary company which passed on the income through a deed of covenant. Until now, the Revenue believed it was acceptable to use this structure under section 5 of the 1976 Lotteries and Amusements Act to set the lottery income against tax. Its new advice suggests that the income from the lottery belongs to the charity rather than to the subsidiary and the charity is therefore taxable on the income. However, Sir John stressed that the government did not want charities to be disadvantaged by the changes in the interpretation of the law. He said new legislation would be introduced in the next finance bill to ensure charities would be exempt from tax on the lottery income as long as the income is applied solely to the charity. He said small lotteries operated under section 3 of the 1976 act would also be exempted. The amendment would apply for accounting periods after March 31 next year.</p>

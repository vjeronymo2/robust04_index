			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH BOOSTS 2 PRO-CHOICE CANDIDATES;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT, SPEAKING IN ILLINOIS AND RHODE ISLAND, MAKES A PITCH  FOR CUTTING THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND IGNORES THE ABORTION ISSUE.  </P> <P> President Bush, with an early eye on the 1990 elections, went campaigning today  in Illinois and Rhode Island for two Republican congresswomen who disagree with  him on abortion.  </P> <P> The trip occurred one day after Bush cast his third abortion-related veto this  fall, knocking back a $14.6-billion foreign operations bill because it included  $15 million in aid for a U.N. population control agency that Bush blames for  supporting forced abortions in China.  </P> <P> The President made no mention of abortion in remarks at a fund-raising lunch  here for Rep. Lynn Martin, who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Paul  Simon in next year's elections.  </P> <P> Instead, he made a pitch for cutting the capital gains tax and passing his  anti-crime and clean air initiatives -- all of which have been held up in the  Democratic-controlled Congress.  </P> <P> As Bush spoke at the $250-a-person Republican fund-raiser, he was heckled by  members of the audience who shouted criticism of U.S. policy in El Salvador.  </P> <P> When a woman accused the Administration of killing priests, Bush replied: "We  are not. You be quiet."  </P> <P> He then sought to explain why the United States is supporting El Salvador. With  that, a man jumped up and shouted, "Stop the repression in El Salvador!" The  two demonstrators and a third person were led out by security forces, and the  crowd applauded.  </P> <P> "Now, who's next?" the President joked. "I'm here to talk about Lynn. This is  not a town meeting."  </P> <P> Later, Bush went to Providence, R.I., to raise funds for Rep. Claudine  Schneider, expected to mount a challenge next year to Sen. Claiborne Pell, a  Democratic veteran of 29 years in the Senate.  </P> <P> He also was helping raise money for Gov. Edward DiPrete, who is seeking a  fourth two-year term in 1990 as Rhode Island's chief executive.  </P> <P> Martin, Schneider and two other pro-choice GOP congresswomen, Olympia Snowe of  Maine and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, met with Bush last Tuesday to urge him  to modify his hard-line stance against abortion funding.  </P> <P> Bush said Martin has been in his corner on the fight for a lower tax on capital  gains, which are the profits on the sales of such investments as real estate  and securities.  </P> <P> "The capital gains battle may be over for this year, but the fact is this:  We've seen the votes -- a majority in both the Senate and the House are on  record in favor of cutting the capital gains rate," he said.  </P></p>

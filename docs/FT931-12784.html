			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merck profit growth reflects sector trend MERCK, the world's biggest drugs company, yesterday provided further evidence of the slowing momentum of earnings growth in the drugs sector by posting a 17 per cent rise in underlying fourth-quarter earnings on the back of a 12 per cent increase in sales. Although the results were broadly in line with expectations, Wall Street was disappointed that Merck's earnings growth had fallen below 20 per cent levels. The company saw annual earnings increase by 19 per cent in both 1991 and 1990, and by 24 per cent in 1989. Shares in Merck lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 3/8 before the close yesterday. Fourth-quarter results were distorted by the adoption of new accounting standards, which brought net income for the three months to Dollars 609.1m, or 53 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.6bn. In the same period of 1991, Merck earned 529.8m, or 46 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.31bn. For the full year, Merck had net income of Dollars 1.98bn, or Dollars 1.72 a share, 6 per cent below earnings of Dollars 2.12bn, or Dollars 1.83 cents, posted in 1991. Stripping out after-tax charges of Dollars 462.4m, or 40 cents, for the adoption of new accounting standards, net income rose 17 per cent to Dollars 2.49bn, or Dollars 2.15 cents, in 1992. Sales were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 9.66bn, against Dollars 8.6bn. Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said strong unit volume, cost controls, better product mix and a lower tax rate contributed to income growth for the year. Warner Lambert, another large pharmaceuticals company, unveiled a 14 per cent increase in underlying fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 137m, or Dollars 1.02 cents, from Dollars 121m, or 90 cents, a year ago. Sales rose to Dollars 1.47bn from Dollars 1.34bn. In the 1991 quarter, Warner Lambert recorded an after-tax charge of Dollars 418m, or Dollars 3.11, which led to a net loss of Dollars 297.1m, or Dollars 2.21. For the whole of 1992, net income was Dollars 643.7m, or Dollars 4.78, on sales of Dollars 5.6bn. In 1991, after-tax charges of Dollars 524m brought net income down to Dollars 34.8m, or 26 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.06bn. Excluding charges, Warner-Lambert said earnings rose 15 per cent in the year.</p>

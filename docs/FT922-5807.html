			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Degussa up 7% despite fall in sales DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, made pre-tax profits of DM100m (Dollars 60.6m) in the first half of the current year, 7 per cent up on the DM93m made in the same period last year. This was despite a drop in turnover from DM6.55bn to DM6.08bn. The company - which has said that it planned to cut 1,000 jobs to reduce costs - said that the second quarter of the year had been better than expected. Group profits for the year are likely to be better than last year's, it said. In the year to September 30 1991, pre-tax profits were DM179 - 44 per cent down on the previous year. The expected improvement for the year would be due to rationalisation measures at the Laybold machinery subsidiary and at the parent company, together with good results in the pharmaceuticals and dental products markets, rather than any fundamental turnround in the economy. At the parent company level, pre-tax profits fell to DM57m from DM70m in the half-year. Horten, Germany's fourth largest retailer, is set to embark on a slimming down exercise which will involve a 'significant' but as yet unspecified reduction in staff numbers, the company said yesterday. The purpose of the rationalisation is to improve profitability. Horten yesterday reported a 4.5 per cent drop in sales during the first five months of 1992.</p>

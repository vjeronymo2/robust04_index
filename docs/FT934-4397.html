			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Merck raises Dollars 250m to finance Medco purchase Merck, the large US pharmaceuticals group, yesterday made its first appearance in the Eurobond market in order to help finance its Dollars 6bn acquisition of Medco Containment, a drugs mail order company. The triple-A rated borrower raised Dollars 250m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds which were priced to yield 15 basis points over US Treasuries, in line with market expectations. The scarcity of top-quality corporate issuance in the Eurobond market contributed to the success of Merck's debut offering. 'Although the market is not in fantastic shape, the transaction has gone very well,' said lead manager Morgan Stanley. Syndicate managers at other banks described the issue as a 'blowout'. Investor demand for the bonds was such that when the bonds were freed to trade the spread tightened to 13 basis points. Morgan Stanley said that more than half of the bonds were sold to investors in the UK and Switzerland, with the remainder being placed elsewhere in Europe. Mr John Kearney, Merck's assistant treasurer, said that the proceeds of the issue would be used to re-finance some of the short-term funding linked to the Medco purchase. A good portion of the Dollars 2.4bn cash part of the acquisition had been raised in the commercial paper market, he said. According to Morgan Stanley, Merck saved around 10 basis points by tapping the Eurobond market rather than the US domestic bond market. Mr Kearney added that Merck could well return to the Eurobond market early next year. The Bank of Greece also tapped the Eurodollar sector with a widely-expected Dollars 500m issue of five-year floating-rate notes (FRNs). The notes were priced to yield 115 basis points over Libor, in line with market expectations. Joint lead manager Salomon Brothers said that sales of the bonds had got off to a good start, with demand coming from eastern Asia and from yield-hungry investors in Europe. However, the notes were likely to remain in syndicate for the next couple of days. The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) raised Fl 300m through an issue of seven-year Eurobonds, which more or less completed its Dollars 3.8bn international borrowing programme for this year. Mr Stephen Abrahams, chief of the IADB's capital markets division, said the yield spread on the bonds of 13 basis points over Dutch government bonds was in line with spreads on outstanding bonds issued by other triple A-rated borrowers. The proceeds of the issue would be kept in guilders. Mr Abrahams said that the IADB was likely to borrow a similar amount in 1994 but that a larger portion could be raised in dollars.</p>

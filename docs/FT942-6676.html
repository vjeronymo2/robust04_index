			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues Shares in London Clubs International, owner of the Ritz Club and five other London casinos, look a safe bet at the flotation price of 200p, writes David Blackwell. The group, which will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 141.4m, is raising about Pounds 27.5m net of expenses to pay off bank debt incurred under the 1989 management buy-out from Grand Metropolitan. Samuel Montagu, which has underwritten the issue fully, is placing 16.38m ordinary shares with institutions, of which 4.09m will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. Broker is James Capel. The group will be quoted on the USM because the management has only two years' experience of the company and stock exchange rules require three years. The change of management followed a police raid in 1991 under the Gaming Act, just days before a previous planned flotation. The issue was priced to go even in the week which saw the stock market well down and the announcement of the National Lottery winner. The strong portfolio of casinos, from the high-rolling Ritz to the Golden Nugget, reduces the risk of relying for profits on a few high-spenders. The prospectus puts pro forma pre-tax profits at Pounds 23.1m for 1993-94, and earnings per share, before restructuring costs of Pounds 2m, at 22.5p, giving a multiple of 8.9. A dividend of 11.92p would have been recommended, giving a high yield of 7.45 per cent. Argent Group is the latest of a wave of property companies to seek a listing. Private investors can subscribe through an intermediaries offer at 255p a share, writes Vanessa Houlder. Argent, formed 12 years ago by joint chief executives Michael and Peter Freeman, owns 16 investment properties valued at Pounds 197.1m. It also owns a development site in central Birmingham, with planning consent for 1.1m sq ft of offices, valued at Pounds 26.6m. Argent is braving the market at a time when investors are unreceptive to new issues and, in particular, new issues of property companies - as demonstrated by the pulled flotation of London Capital Holdings this week. Argent has priced its shares aggressively, at a discount of just 5 per cent to its net asset value. If turbulent stock market conditions persist, private investors might do better to pick up stock in the after-market rather than take up the offer. The company is tipped to perform well in the longer term, however; it has good-quality investment properties and an interesting development programme. The offer is sponsored by Schroders. Applications under the intermediaries offer must be made on an application form provided by Cazenove, the broker, and must be sent to Cazenove by midday on June 3.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Mexican rebels win concessions in talks: Peasants say president's peace envoy has accepted least contentious demands Progress is reported in talks between the Mexican government and rebels in the state of Chiapas to end the two-month-old peasant uprising. Subcommander Marcos, the Zapatista rebels' spokesman, said about a quarter of their demands had been met after three days of talks. He said Mr Manuel Camacho, President Carlos Salinas's peace envoy, had agreed to their calls for better health facilities, education and housing in indigenous communities in Chiapas, and respect for the rights of Indian peoples. However, such issues were always the least controversial of the rebel demands, and the government had predicted early agreement on them. The Zapatistas' apparent demand for greater autonomy for Indian peoples, and national economic and political changes will be more difficult to meet. Subcommander Marcos said that national issues 'are too big for the negotiating table' and would have to be made in agreement with opposition parties. Representatives of Mexico's left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution have met Subcommander Marcos and applauded his calls for greater democracy. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD's presidential candidate, said there were encouraging signs that the government was willing to make the necessary legal changes to comply with the spirit of a far-reaching accord agreed last month between Mexico's political parties. The changes include making electoral tribunals, which judge the legality of elections, more independent of the government. A senior government official said a special session of Congress to make the necessary legal changes was now probable. Mr Camacho confirmed that substantial progress had been made in the talks. In an effort to dispel criticisms that he was breaking ranks with the government which he represents, he he was in constant contact with President Salinas and he would seek support within society for any peace agreements reached.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Burmese students at the Ban Maniloi centre in  Ratchaburi face a possible ban from leaving the centre during  the ASEAN ministerial meeting in Bangkok next month to prevent  them from protesting the presence of members of Burma's ruling  junta.    Representatives of Burma's State Law and Order Restoration  Council (SLORC) have been invited to attend the opening and  closing ceremonies plus a banquet held during the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations meeting.    The invitation has prompted international condemnation of  Thailand's role as host country.    Deputy Permanent Secretary for the Interior Chaloem  Phromloet  said yesterday he trusted Ratchaburi Governor Kamlunthep  Thewakun would know what steps to take to prevent possible  problems caused by Burmese students from the centre joining the  protest.    "He knows well how to deal with this type of incident since  he was with the ministry's internal security section before  becoming a provincial governor," said Mr Chaloem.    He said any protesters who try to disrupt the meeting would  be dealt with sternly by police.    M.R. Kamlunthep said: "If I forbid the Burmese students from  leaving Ban Maniloi, I will be accused of violating their human  rights. Yet somehow I will have to come up with a solution."    He said he would hold talks with Mr Chaloem on the  possibility of the Burmese students staging a protest.    "The students at the centre have lately had problems with  villagers in the neighbourhood," he said referring to troubles  in the last month. "Even if these students are refugees in our  country, that cannot be used as an excuse not to abide by the  law.    "Any person who violates the law in this country will have  to  face the legal consequences."    The Interior Ministry's Information and Foreign Affairs  Division director, Praphakon Samiti, said any Ban Maniloi  students joining a protest which disrupts the ASEAN meeting will  be arrested and detained at a centre in Bang Khen.    They will lose their refugee status and will simply be  regarded as illegal immigrants and dealt with as such by the  police, he said.    "Present media reports indicate the students from the centre  are not part of the group planning a protest," he said.    But Mr Praphakon said there were efforts by certain Burmese  dissidents to encourage the students to join them in the protest.    "The students at the centre know they will go to jail and  will not be allowed to return to Ban Maniloi if they join the  protest."    He said he did not understand why anyone wanted to protest  SLORC's presence at the meeting since their participation was  only ceremonial.</p>

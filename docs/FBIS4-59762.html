			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Afaf Zayn] </F>   [Excerpts] London -- As 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani,  assistant secretary general of the General People's Congress and  Presidential Council member, was telling journalists in Sanaa 9  May that fighting had stopped at all axes in the Abyan  Governorate in the south of the country and that the military  situation had been decided in favor of pro-government forces  "poised to complete their tasks by entering Aden within 48  hours", 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] was telling AL-WASAT on the line from his  Aden residence that "they will enter Aden over our dead bodies."  He was emphatic that the Army brigades in what used to be known  as Southern Yemen before the merger "would soon shift from their  defensive to an offensive posture," after the intensive bombing  had failed to achieve its objectives.    Contradicting 'Abd-al-Ghani's contention that the fighting  "was about to be settled in favor of the legal forces against  the separatists in the YSP, al-Bid told AL-WASAT "the military  situation" had not been decided in favor of the forces under the  man (President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih) who made the insane  decision to set off the explosion. Arab and world opinion can  now better judge the kind of practices we have endured over the  three and one-half years that the merger lasted. He drew a  parallel between "the military option President Salih had been  planning before the signing of the accord document in Amman and  the illegal appointments and dismissals and Saddam Husayn's  decisions following the invasion of Kwuait and his dismissal and  replacement of the Kuwaiti government." [passage omitted]    With escalating hostilities, the political situation in  Sanaa  and Aden continues to be ambiguous. According to Salim Salih  Muhammad, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih opted for the military  option once he realized that under a regime of political  pluralism following 14 years of totalitarian rule, he had lost  many of his privileges. Driven by a tribal mentality, he put the  fate of the country on the line, equating himself with the state  and the army. It is this kind of mentality that destroyed the  union. His lending his ear to certain YSP officials, who were  closer to his way of thinking since the proclamation of unity,  propels the "conspiracy theory". That conclusion is echoed by  'Ali Salim al-Bid, who says: "Yes, there is a conspiracy."    What does this conspiracy seek to achieve? Al-Bid replies  that the aim is to set up in the region a theocratic entity  built on the alliance between the military and the fundamenalist  establishments. "It is the military fundamentalist state of  Sudan, along the lines of which other such regimes are being  planned," asserts al-Bid. [passage omitted]</p>

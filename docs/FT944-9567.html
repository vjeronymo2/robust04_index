			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tussauds confident about Spanish park The Tussauds group, operator of Port Aventura, the Spanish theme park which opens next April, said yesterday it expected the project to be profitable from its second year. Mr Nick Harvey, Tussauds' head of corporate development, said at the World Travel Market exhibition in London that Port Aventura would avoid many of the mistakes which have plagued Disneyland Paris, the theme park operated by Euro Disney. Port Aventura will close during the winter months and will not have its own hotels, unlike Disneyland, which remains open throughout the year and has six hotels which it has struggled to fill since the park's opening in 1992. Tussauds, which is part of Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, owns 40 per cent of Port Aventura, which is an hour's drive from Barcelona. La Caixa, the Spanish savings bank, has 30 per cent, Anheuser-Busch, the US brewer and theme park owner, has 20 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent is held by Fecsa, the Spanish utility company. The park, which has cost Pounds 300m to build, is expected to be completed by the end of December. It is hoping to attract 2.5m visitors in its first year, of which 1.1m will come from outside Spain. Ms Maggie Bergsma, who markets the park to tour operators, said she expected France to be the biggest foreign market, followed by Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Many of the foreign visitors would be holidaymakers on the Costa Brava, a two-hour coach drive away.</p>

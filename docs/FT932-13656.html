			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: The hammer falls on Spink - Christies has bought the coin and art dealer THE SALE yesterday of Spink &amp; Son to Christies International marked the close of the City's love affair with the art market. The 300-year-old firm of dealers was among the first to be taken over by large companies in the 1970s, when the high prices and profit margins of the art boom began to attract commercial investors. The art trade has not, however, turned out to be the great honeypot once envisaged. Since the bubble burst at the end of the 1980s, there has been a steady rise in the number of distinguished London dealers whose businesses have folded at the command of suddenly unsympathetic backers. The roll call includes the Heim Gallery, Ackermann's, Sparks and, most recently, Bluett's. it is hard not to foresee a gloomy long-term future for Spinks in the form in which it exists today. In April 1990 Andrew Weir &amp; Company put Spink on the market, believing its future could be better nurtured in a specialist art environment. The initial asking price was believed to be between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. Despite considerable interest, the company was taken off the market at the end of the year. When a subsequent management buy-out was proposed, the price was down to Pounds 22m, with the stock valued at Pounds 8m-Pounds 9m and the grand King Street premises at about Pounds 5m. Christies will pay a maximum of Pounds 16.3m. Spink is unique as a London dealer in that it houses a broad range of specialist departments, from British art to jewellery, oriental and south-east Asian works of art, coins, stamps, even furniture restoration. Its founding father was John Spink, who set up as a goldsmith in 1666. In its operational range it resembles its neighbour, Christie's - as do the firm's claret-coloured flag and liveried doorman. Spink's uncertain future has had the effect of eroding both the firm's breadth of interest and its base of expertise. Last year two senior staff members left to establish The Oriental Art Gallery in Mayfair. Two months ago the silver department closed. The most profitable part of the company is the coin and medal department. Christies has announced that this department is to take over Christies' own coin and medal department to reinforce Spink's leading position in the field. The auction house states that the move will ensure that less than 10 per cent of its auctioneering business will overlap with the interests of Spink. The purchase of Spink provides Christies not only with the dominant position in the coin and medal market but with access to its clients in south-east Asia and South America, currently two of the world's most vigorous art markets. It also brings handsome adjoining premises in St James's with a lease running until 2017. Over the last few years the auction house has been aggressively acquiring much-needed additional space. Now it owns long leaseholds on the entire block bordered by King Street, Duke Street, Ryder Street and Bury Street.</p>

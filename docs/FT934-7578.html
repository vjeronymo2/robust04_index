			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Environment measure will allow agency to recruit - Other measures GOVERNMENT plans for a new environment agency, first announced in 1991, took a small step forwards with yesterday's announcement Bronwen Maddox writes. A paving bill will allow planning and recruitment while waiting for legislation to create the agency itself. The proposed agency for England and Wales, which has been one of the central planks of the government's environment policy, will bring together pollution regulation in a 'one-stop shop'. It will unite the functions of the National Rivers Authority, the Inspectorate of Pollution, and the waste regulation carried out by local authorities. Environmentalists have criticised the government for allowing creation of the agency to be pushed down the queue of forthcoming legislation by more politically pressing issues. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, said that 'the pledge to bring forward paving legislation is a small step in the right direction' but added 'the procrastination continues' on creating the agency itself. If legislation to set up the agency is announced in next year's Queen's Speech, the agency could begin operating by spring 1995.</p>

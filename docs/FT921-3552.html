			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Iraq gives ground over oil-for-food IRAQ AGREED yesterday to resume talks with the United Nations on the sale of limited quantities of its oil in order to buy food and medicines. It also promised to resume contacts with UN agencies charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister, said he believed his visit to the UN at the head of an Iraqi mission had produced a 'better understanding between us and the (Security) Council'. In a stern statement at the end of two days of meetings called to hear Mr Aziz, the Council made it clear that Iraq must take immediate 'appropriate actions' to comply fully and unconditionally with its obligations under the Gulf ceasefire. But the Council stopped short of spelling out the consequences of non-compliance. Asked about possible military action against Iraq, a western diplomat said: 'This is enough for the time being.' Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the special UN weapons mission to Iraq, said inspectors would return to Baghdad next week to continue their efforts to destroy Iraqi missiles. He suggested that if Iraq co-operated, it might be possible within two months to report sufficient compliance to enable the Council to consider easing the embargo on Iraqi oil sales. Mr Hans Blix, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, emphasised that this must depend also on the elimination of Iraq's nuclear capability, about which Baghdad continued to be secretive. Security Council diplomats noted some shifts in the Iraqi position during Mr Aziz's visit. In particular, Mr Aziz dropped objections to talks with the UN about terms for the sale of oil. The UN wants to ensure that proceeds are used to buy food and medicines. Talks on this issue were broken off last month, but Mr Aziz agreed they could resume even though he revived Baghdad's argument that UN conditions infringed Iraqi sovereignty. A UN resolution authorising the sale of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 900m) worth of Iraqi oil expires next week. The US and Britain are ready to renew it, but Mr Aziz said a better course would be for Iraq to try to reach a settlement with the UN secretariat.</p>

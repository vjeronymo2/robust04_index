			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Pirated music in sales of Dollars 2.1bn NEARLY 700m pirated music cassettes and 38m unauthorised compact discs were sold worldwide last year, according to figures to be released later this week by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Unauthorised sound recording sales had a retail value of Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in 1992, or 7 per cent of total sales. This compares with Dollars 1.43bn in 1991. The increase largely resulted from the federation obtaining more information about the level of piracy in China, Mexico and Poland, rather than from a substantial rise in unauthorised sales. The federation said its figures probably understated piracy, however, as they did not include the former territories of the Soviet Union or the United Arab Emirates. The biggest pirate music market last year was the US, where unauthorised recordings had a retail value of Dollars 463m. This is a reflection of the overall size of the US market rather than of a substantial level of piracy. Only 5 per cent of US sales were unauthorised. Smaller markets with high proportions of unauthorised sales included El Salvador, where 86 per cent of units sold were pirate copies, Nicaragua (82 per cent), Peru (81 per cent), Kenya (74 per cent) and Ivory Coast (70 per cent).  ------------------------------------------------------            PIRATE MUSIC SALES (BY VALUE)  ------------------------------------------------------                         Pirate       Pirate % of                         sales         country's Country               USdollarsm     total sales  ------------------------------------------------------ US                      463.4             5 China                   330.0            46 Mexico                  250.0            30 Germany                 121.0             4 Italy                   105.1            14 Poland                  102.3            61 South Korea              72.8            13 India                    69.0            27 Thailand                 64.8            29 Saudi Arabia             62.2            60  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: IFPI  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

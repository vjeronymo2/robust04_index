According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists'  Marine Air Corps from overseas bases on 10 March made sorties  over the South Korean skies and conducted provocative long-range  surprise-attack bombing exercises aimed at a northward invasion.    On 10 March, some 12 pursuit planes took off from a base in  Japan, refueling in mid air, and ran wild in the surprise  bombing exercise of given objects in attack position in the  skies over areas near Sangdong and Kunwi, South Korea as well as  the exercise of returning to the base.    The war exercise, which was conducted with the support of  aerial refueling planes, was a dangerous game to enhance the  actual-combat capability of the long-range air corps in the  surprise bombing of objects inland of the northern half of the  Republic.    While the war exercise was going on, an RC-135 strategic  reconnaissance plane, that flew from a base in Okinawa over the  South Korean skies, made a long-distance flight over areas near  the Military Demarcation Line [DML], took comprehensive pictures  of the whole area of the northern half of the Republic, and  conducted electronic reconnaissance.    In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran amok with  provocative war exercises, which were very agitating to us, near  the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ] of the MDL. On 10 March, over 800  puppet Army's armed villains loaded in some 50 armored cars  advanced up to the fore areas near Chupa-ri of the South Korean  Chorwon County, and worked themselves into a war frenzy openly  occupying a battle position in broad daylight. Prior to this,  on 9 March, the puppet Army's 105mm artillery groups appeared  near Chongja-ri, Paju County and Chungsan, Yonchon County,  Kyonggi Province, were filled with northward invasion frenzy and  dropped over 90 bombs in areas near the DMZ of the MDL.</p>

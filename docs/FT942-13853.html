			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines bucks trend Northwest Airlines, the US carrier that returned to the stock market last month after being taken private five years earlier, yesterday reported net income of Dollars 18.3m in its first quarter, compared with net losses of Dollars 100.3m last time. The profit was in sharp contrast with the losses reported a day earlier by American Airlines and USAir, which said they had been hit by severe winter weather and low fares. However, Northwest's figures were flattered by two non-trading items. It gained Dollars 9.2m before tax from an accounting item related to its employee stock ownership plan, and a Dollars 12.7m cut in depreciation expenses following a revaluation of some of its aircraft. Operating revenues rose 5 per cent to Dollars 2.13bn and earnings per share were 5 cents, compared with losses of Dollars 1.86 last time. One reason Northwest's figures did not suffer as badly of those of American Airlines and USAir is that its route structure is not concentrated in the north-east of the US, where the worst of the weather struck. The airline is also benefiting from wage and benefit concessions worth Dollars 886m over the next three years, under an agreement with its employees which will give them a 27.4 per cent stake in the company. Southwest Airlines, the most profitable airline in the US, reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 41.8m, an increase of 68 per cent on the comparable period's Dollars 24.9m before accounting changes.</p>

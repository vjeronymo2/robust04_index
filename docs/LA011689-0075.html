			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ORANGE;  </P> <P> VIGIL TO COMMEMORATE KEY ABORTION RULING  </P> <P> The landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that 16 years ago struck down many  state laws forbidding abortion will be commemorated next Sunday during a  30-minute vigil to be conducted by the National Organization for Women, north  county chapter, and the Unitarian Church of Orange County in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Participants, each holding a candle, will gather at the corner of Glassell  Street and Almond Avenue at 5 p.m., then march down an alley in memory of women  who died from "back-alley" abortions before abortion laws were changed,  organizers said.  </P> <P> Then a brief memorial service will be held, followed by a march around Orange  Plaza at Glassell Street and Chapman Avenue.  </P> <P> Before the court's 1973 decision, most states prohibited abortions unless there  were special circumstances, such as a threat to the mother's health or life.  </P></p>

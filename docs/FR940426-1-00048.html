			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the general prohibition against an industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member imposing conditions on receipt of items allowed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart D has been removed from &sect;6.81, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;6.83 states that giving or selling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product displays may be conditioned upon the purchase of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the distilled spirits, wine or malt beverage product advertised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereon in a quantity only necessary for the initial completion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or use of the product display. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan or rental of product displays would not be within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exception. Such a continuing tie would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the intent of the Act. Industry members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have long argued that they should be allowed to condition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of product displays on the purchase of a limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of the product advertised. The dollar limit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $500 per brand, coupled with the requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanently inscribed advertising and transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ownership of product displays to the retailer minimizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inducement value to the retailer. The combination of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors allows product displays to be excepted from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations of Part 6, and would be the basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing the industry member to condition receipt of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials as described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.84, Point of Sale Advertising and Consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advertising Specialties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Promotions and practices currently allowed under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory exceptions to the tied-house provisions are safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harbors. This notice proposes a revision to those exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would combine several of the current exceptions into one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general regulatory section. The approach of having a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general section addressing all of the similar activities gives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater flexibility to the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations combine the exceptions listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;6.84, 6.85, 6.86 and 6.87, (inside signs, retailer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising specialties, wine lists and consumer advertising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialties) into a revised &sect;6.84, Point of sale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising and consumer advertising specialties. Items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended for consumers currently identified in &sect;6.47 are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also included in the proposed listing of exceptions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioners requested that ATF amend the dollar limitation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the adjusted rates, but instead, under ATF's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision there will be no limit to the specified point of sale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (POS) materials furnished by an industry member to a retail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners also requested that the term ``wine lists''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be expanded to include all alcoholic beverages. Instead, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;6.84 permits all lists or menus, subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions in paragraph (c) of the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.86, Temporary Retailers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATF proposes adding a new section which will allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnishing things of value to a temporary retailer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.88, Glassware_Section 6.89, Tapping Accessories_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6.90, Supplies_Section 6.97, Coil Cleaning Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioners recommend that these four sections be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined in a new section 6.88, under the title ``Equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies,'' because they deal with similar types of merchandise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and impose similar conditions. As with other subpart D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions which combine similar types of merchandise, (viz.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;6.83, 6.87 and 6.89), the petitioners feel that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combining these items in one section will enhance the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplicity and clarity of the rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners also recommend several other revisions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this consolidated section. They believe that the coverage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the coil cleaning service should be extended from ``a retailer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of wine or malt beverages'' to ``a retailer.'' This amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would provide equal treatment for wine, malt beverages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distilled spirits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners also recommend substituting the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``dispensing accessories'' in section 6.88 for ``tapping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessories'' because the former term more accurately describes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the modern type of accessories falling within this category and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects present marketplace practices where, for example, wine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also is served by dispensing equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners also feel that cold plates should be added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the list of examples of ``dispensing accessories'' and, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the present requirements for glassware and tapping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessories, carbon dioxide gas or ice may be sold at a price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not less than the cost to the industry member who initially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners' proposed &sect;6.88 would read as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``&sect;6.88 Equipment and supplies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Equipment and supplies means glassware, dispensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessories, carbon dioxide gas or ice. Dispensing accessories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include items such as standards, faucets, cold plates, rods,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents, taps, tap standards, hoses, washers, couplings, gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gauges, vent tongues, shanks and check valves. (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) An industry member may sell equipment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies to a retailer if the equipment or supplies are sold at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a price not less than the cost to the industry member who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initially purchased it, and if the price is collected within 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of the date of the sale. (2) If dispensing accessories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are sold pursuant to (1), the industry member also may install  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them at the retailer's establishment. (c) Coil cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service may be furnished, given or sold to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retailer.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the petitioners' proposal to combine various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections into one all inclusive section covering equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies is structurally logical and the terminology change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from tapping equipment to dispensing equipment has merit, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the items listed in the proposed section have not in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> past been recognized as exceptions by ATF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program  Network in Persian at 1520 GMT on 1 April carries a live relay  of the Friday prayer sermons delivered by Ayatollah Meshkini at  Qom. Reception is good.    Ayatollah Meshkini begins his first sermon with three  minutes  of Arabic prayers. He then says: "I would like to say a few  sentences about the issue of Marja'iyat [the status of being the  source of emulation]. Someone may ask from what source our  sources of emulation derive their decrees and interpretations,  which they then pass on to people as God's strictures."  Meshkini asserts that all the fatwas and interpretations about  the correct performance of religious rituals and moral conduct,  and also about proper and acceptable religious belief, have one  single source, out of which two currents flow. The source, he  states, is the prophet, and the two currents are the Koran and  the tradition. He then goes on to stress that Koran is a divine  phenomenon, and as such its words cannot be questioned. The  Koran, therefore, was passed intact through the generations,  until it reached the hands of the Marja'.    On the question of the tradition, he says: "As far as the  issue of tradition is concerned, this is where we differ  significantly from our Sunni brothers. How lucky you, the  Shiite faithful, are." He then quotes an Arabic verse, and  Persian poetry about the Shiites' devotion to their imams. He  goes on to say that whatever the prophet said was learned and  safeguarded by 'Ali, the first imam. He says: "We believe that  the tradition was left with 'Ali for safekeeping, and 'Ali  passed it on to Hasan, who then passed it to Hoseyn, who in  turn gave it to Sajjad; Sajjad gave to Baqir, who then passed it  to Sadiq. Then it passed from Sadiq to Kazem, Kazem to Reza,  Reza to Javad, Javad to Naqi, Naqi to Askari, and Askari to the  hidden imam. This all tells us that the prophet's tradition is  in fact exactly the same as the one which has been passed to us  and our sources of emulation today."    Meshkini then cites remarks and work on the tradition by the  late Ayatollah Borujerdi, saying that he had 36,000 quotations  from the prophet and the imams in his book, all of which can be  proved to be authentic. He then declares: "To sum up, I would  like to say that if someone asks from what source and what  reference point a source of emulation derives his  interpretations, then we have to answer that the sources and the  points of reference are the divine book and the tradition of the  prophet, which has been passed to us by the imams." After  reciting an Arabic verse, he says: "The Sunni doctrine should  not then be referred to as the orthodox sect; orthodoxy is in  fact inherent within the Shiite doctrine, because it is the  Shiites who have found the true Islamic tradition, on the basis  of which they set out to issue decrees and interpretations. I  will, on another occasion, refer to the Sunni mode of reasoning  and interpretation, and the methods they choose. We are proud  to be Shiites of the immaculate family of imams."</p>

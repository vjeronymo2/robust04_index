			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL'S BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> So Drexel was "forced to file" for bankruptcy because of default on loans  totaling about $100 million. Maybe they should have borrowed from Milken to  whom they paid $550 million in just one year. I doubt that he invested that in  junk bonds.  </P> <P> VIRGINIA M.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement" of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea </F> rejecting slanderous remarks against Democratic Kampuchea  concerning missing foreigners -- read by announcer]    [Text] I. The allies, communist Vietnamese, and communist  Vietnamese puppets recently made remarks slandering Democratic  Kampuchea concerning the case of missing foreigners.    II. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK]  spokesman vehemently rejects these slanderous remarks and wishes  to clarify the matter as follows:    A. We are not involved in this matter. There is no reason  for us to commit such an abominable act like the allies,  communist Vietnamese, and communist Vietnamese puppets who  always claim to be democratic or masters of human rights despite  the fact that they have killed hundreds of thousands and even  millions of people.    B. We have strived and are striving to end the war and to  bring about genuine national reconciliation and peace so that  the people can lead a normal life and earn their living  peacefully.    [Dated] 27 May 1994    [Signed] The NADK spokesman</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Philip Johnston report: "Hurd Urges Debate on New World </F> Role"]    [Text] A public debate aimed at reviving national  self-confidence and re-assessing Britain's place in a changing  world was foreshadowed last night by Mr Douglas Hurd the Foreign  Secretary.    In a wide-ranging foreign policy speech at the Mansion House  in London, he lamented the narrowness of current political  argument in Britain, typified by the fracas over Maastricht and  voting rights in Europe.    Mr Hurd said: "While we dispute among ourselves, we risk  failing to notice how the world is changing."    He said the country ran the risk of "intellectual shrinkage  -- as if we despaired of convincing anybody of anything, as if  we simply wanted to devise ways of protecting ourselves against  a Europe and a world which was bound to run against us."    He said: "This is negative and damaging nonsense. This  country has been, ought to be, can be, a powerhouse of ideas  about the future of Europe and more widely about the  relationship between states and international institutions. We  cannot pick and choose to which continent we belong. We cannot  stop the world in order to get off."    Mr Hurd said Britain's influence remained strong across the  world -- in Europe, where "our wholehearted involvement is  essential," increasingly in South America, in India and  Australasia, in southern Africa and in the Far East despite  recent disputes with China and Malaysia.    Mr Hurd said he wanted the European Union to be more than  merely a single market but one that defined its limits, was more  sensitive to its citizens and which stopped seeking to take more  powers to the centre.    The Foreign Secretary also made a renewed pitch for a  rapprochement with Malaysia, following the breach in trade links  caused by British press reports about alleged corruption in the  Malaysian Government.    The Trade and Industry Department hopes to send a  ministerial  trade mission to Malaysia before the end of the year as part of  a push for business in the Far East, Mr Richard Needham, the  trade minister, said last night.</p>

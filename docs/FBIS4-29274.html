			<p>Violating   Security Law   <F P=102> SK1606110694 Seoul YONHAP in English 1007 GMT 16 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> SK1606110694 </F> <F P=104>  Seoul YONHAP </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- The Agency for National  Security Planning (NSP) announced on Thursday it had rounded up  10 poeple suspected of having formed an underground organization  of the North Korean Workers' (Communist) Party.    The agency said the ten persons, charged with violating the  National Security Law, were led by An Chae-ku, age 61, a  lecturer at Kyonghee University.    An was previouly arrested in October 1979 and was given a  life term for his involvement in the case of "Namminjon" or the  "South Korean Front for National Liberation." He was released  in a special parole in December 1988.    His colleagues arrested included Chong Hwa-yo, 30, chief  editor of Hanbaek Planning Co.; Hong Chung-hui, 37, head of the  Wonju Labor Training Institute; Yu Nak-chin, 66, a calligrapher  and former North Korean agent; and Pak Nae-kun, 42, head of the  Ilsin Foreign Language Institute in Suwon.    The announcement said An set up the underground organization  at the instructions of North Korea after he was won over in May  1991 by a visiting North Korean operative active in Japan who  was identified only as a "Paek" aged 58.    He received an operation fund of 10 million won from Paek  and  joined the Workers' Party. An then recruited co-workers and set  up the "Kukuk Chonwi" or "Front for National Salvation" in  January 1993, the agency said.    A number of evidential materials such as the organization's  statute, a congratulatory message from North Korea, copies of  reports to North Korea and a short-wave radio were collected  through searches of his home at Kalhyon-tong and private office  at Taehung- tong in Seoul last June 14, it said.</p>

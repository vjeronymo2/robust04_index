			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OWNER SAYS MS. TO PUBLISH BIMONTHLY  </P> <P> The new owner of Ms. said Wednesday he plans to resume publication of the  magazine every other month starting next spring and named feminist activist and  author Robin Morgan as its editor in chief.  </P> <P> The magazine, founded in 1972, had been a monthly but was not profitable and  had often been at odds with advertisers over its editorial content.  </P> <P> Dale W. Lang, whose Lang Communications Inc. assumed control of Ms. in  mid-October, had previously disclosed that when the magazine resumed  publication, it would no longer accept advertising. Lang had said publishing  the magazine without ads would relieve it from "external pressures" and enable  its editorial staff to concentrate on pursuing issues important to women  without concerns about advertiser backlash.  </P> <P> The last issue of Ms. magazine was dated November. No specific date was set for  resumption of publication as a bimonthly.  </P> <P> Lang was unavailable for comment on the latest decisions, but a spokeswoman  said that subscribers would soon be getting a letter of explanation from Gloria  Steinem, a co-founder of the magazine who remains a consultant.  </P></p>

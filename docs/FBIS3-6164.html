			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon granted an  interview to newsmen after he discussed with the EC ambassador  the French ban on imports of Thai fisheries products. He said  the ban was tantamount to trade protectionism and discrimination  because Thailand abided by regulations concerning its exports.  He said the EC ambassador expressed concern about what happened  and asked Thailand not to lodge a complaint with GATT yet. The  commerce minister also said he would raise the problem for  discussion at tomorrow's cabinet session because the Thai  private sector has already reported a loss of more than 100  million baht -- and it could reach a billion baht.    [Begin Uthai recording] I will report the matter to the  cabinet tomorrow; the private sector appealed for retaliation  against France. But if we take action, it could lead to  strained relations, and we do not want that. We might have to  lodge a complaint with GATT if we do not get a good explanation  or proper solution to the problem. Anyway, the EC ambassador  told us not to take that step yet, but to let him do the work  first. [end recording]</p>

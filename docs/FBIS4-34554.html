			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The military that  toppled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide must receive  "some guarantees" for themselves and their relatives within the  pact to resolve the crisis in Haiti, Dominican Deputy Foreign  Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral said today.    Herrera Cabral said that sending the Haitian military to  diplomatic posts "so they could be quiet there" could be a  solution. He said a solution to the Haitian crisis, however,  "depends on Haitians themselves resolving their problems, on the  patriotism of Haitians, on the flexibility of Aristide since he  is part of the crisis."    The Dominican official added: "Each one has to do his share,  yield a little." To achieve a political resolution, one has to  yield part of his sovereignty, what he believes to be his  personal interests. Herrera Cabral justified the U.S Government  position of negotiating the stepping down of the Haitian  military without need of a military intervention.    Regarding the list of food and medicines that Haiti will be  allowed to import through the border with the Dominican  Republic, he explained there is no "list" since UN Resolution  917 allows humanitarian assistance.    Yesterday, Monday, Dante Caputo, special UN and OAS envoy  for  the Haitian crisis, handed Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer  a UN Security Council grantee, allowing food and medicine to  enter Haiti from this country.</p>

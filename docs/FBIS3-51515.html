			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Chiapas Ablaze"] </F>   [Excerpt] It is the poorest and most backward area of a  country that has become a very important U.S. partner. It is  the most neglected state of the Mexican federation, even though  in San Cristobal de las Casas, the first city the guerrillas  took, an opera theater costing $10.5 million is being built.  The theater will seat 1,000 persons and will have a concert  hall and a parking lot that can easily accommodate 250 cars. It  is an area that was only reached by the economic compensators of  the Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration until after rumors  of the existence of guerrilla groups became stronger. According  to former Mexican guerrilla Gustavo Hirales, the Solidarity  program arrived in Chiapas State overnight with its projects for  dignified health and hospitals, dignified housing, children in  solidarity, and so on.    Chiapas is also the area served by a bishop whom the Pope  has  asked to leave, charging him to be a follower of Liberation  Theology.    This sums up what even the dullest observer believes has  taken place in that remote Mexican area, where from 1 January it  has been demonstrated that there are at least two Mexicos: the  one the official publicity sells and endorses and the one that  seems more like Central America than part of the northern  continent.    But for those who look at the Chiapas uprising with greater  interest from Guatemala, it is impossible not to notice other  characteristics.    It is an area where the Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity (URNG) guerrillas move about practically with full  freedom. It is an area where hospitals for wounded guerrillas  have been built, there are safe houses for the Guatemalan  guerrillas and even guerrilla recruiting networks in cities as  close to the border as Tapachula.    This is the perspective from which the Guatemalan military  intelligence, at least, observes what is going on in the Mexican  State of Chiapas, which is ablaze.    Sources close to the Army admit that for over six months the  second section (Second Directorate or G-2) had information on  the activities of Mexican guerrillas. In fact, during a visit  to Mexico City, Guatemalan officers offered to help in the  investigations. When they received no reply they directly  contacted the 24th Regiment in Chiapas. Nevertheless, the  Mexicans hesitated in accepting their colleague's help. A few  months later they appeared in Guatemala seeking the very  information they had previously disdained.    Most of the information supplied to them showed a link  between the Zapatist [Zapatist National Liberation Army -- EZLN]  guerrillas and two Guatemalan guerrilla groups: the Poor  People's Guerrilla Army (EGP) and the Revolutionary Organization  of the People in Arms (ORPA). To the Guatemalan military, the  Mexican rebels are very similar to the EGP in their Maoist  leanings, their ethnic claims, and their preference for the  "prolonged popular war" fighting modality. The Zapatists have  taken great care to demand in their first war declaration the  presence of international observers, respect to the Geneva  Convention on the treatment of political prisoners, and the  presence of the International Red Cross in combat areas, demands  that have been made in the past by Central American guerrillas  such as the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the  URNG.    According to analysts, as in the case of the EGP, the  Zapatists have carried out spectacular actions to attract  international attention to their demands.    The Guatemalan military officers identify the Zapatists with  the ORPA because of the type of operations they carry out, such  as blowing up bridges and attacks on Mexican Army troops in open  areas.

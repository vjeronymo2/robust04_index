			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mathatha Tsedu] </F>   [Text] The Workers' List Party [WLP] is a newcomer to the  political landscape and was formed this year to contest the  elections. Its major component is the Workers' Organisation for  Socialist Action, which gained notoriety for bringing the  biggest banner at other people's marches. Other components  include the Cape Action League, Action Youth, Forward Youth and  Mayibuye. The party has its strongest base in the Western Cape,  followed by the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. It  has branches in the Eastern Transvaal, Northern Cape and  Southern Cape. Support for the party has also come from  individual trade unionist within both the Congress of Trade  Unions and the National Council of Trade Unions.    The party has fielded only 100 candidates nationally, with  the first 30 comprising at least 12 shop floor workers. The  party says in its manifesto that it does not hope to be  government but intends to promote the formation of a Mass  Workers, Party.    Firmly rooted in socialist programmes, the WLP says other  parties have compromised with capitalism. These are excerpts  from the election manifesto:  <H5>  The right to work </H5>   We stand for the right to work for every worker including  the  unemployed. We demand an immediate end to unemployment and work  for all on a living unemployment benefit.    We stand for a massive public works programme of  electrification, building houses, schools, creches, parks, halls  and roads primarily in townships. This programme must be under  workers' control. The unemployed must be drawn in at a living  wage. There must a state run training scheme for youth.  <H5>  Health, education, housing and social services </H5>   We stand for state provision of free and compulsory  education  for all up to and including matric. State provision of adequate  housing for all, as well as state provision of free health,  legal, recreation and other community services that will ensure  the highest possible quality of life. We stand for paid  education leave of 30 days for each worker per year and longer  periods of training to be negotiated with worker organisations.  <H5>  Economy </H5>   "We believe in working class control over the means of  production and distribution. We believe in socialism from  below. We stand for nationalisation under worker control of the  monopoly companies, banks, mines and land without compensation.  All areas that have been privatised or about to be privatised  like railways, electricity and steel should be renationalised  under workers control."  <H5>  Trade unions </H5>   "We stand for strong, united and democratic trade unions and  community organisations. We believe in a living wage, 35-hour  week with no loss of pay, an end to retrenchment and a full  right to picket."  <H5>  Land </H5>   The land shall be redistributed among all those who live and  work on the land in accordance with acceptable principles of  agricultural economics and democratic consultation. The land of  absentee landlords and the defence force must be confiscated and  used for productive purposes.  <H5>  Equality </H5>   "The party will fight against oppression of women. Sexism at  home, at the workplace, in the township and on the farms must be  exposed and fought against. The disabled must receive proper  rehabilitation. Children's rights should be entrenched in the  constitution. The state must ensure that every child has three  nutritious meals a day and be given adequate shelter and care."  <H5>  Apartheid crimes </H5>   No general amnesty and we will bring to trial those who  defended the apartheid capitalist regime. We must have our own  Nuremberg trials in SA. We also stand for the bringing to book  of all those involved in state corruption.  <H5>  Foreign debt and IMF loans </H5>   Will campaign against the repayment of loans made by the  apartheid state from international capital including the  IMF/World Bank.  <H5>  Tribalism </H5>    We reject these divisions and we are against federalism  based  on ethnic principles.</p>

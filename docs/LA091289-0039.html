			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> China is engulfed in a "class struggle" over whether socialism can survive  there, an official commentary declared in a harsh attack on reformers. Domestic  "class enemies" allied with "international reactionary forces of the capitalist  class" are seeking to overthrow communism in China, the Guang-ming Daily  commentary said. The article charged that many of the reforms advocated in the  last few years by former General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and his advisers are  actually aimed at restoring capitalism. One Chinese intellectual predicted that  the article signals preparations for escalating purges of reformist Communist  Party members.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Telecoms Work Will Be Hastened"] </F>   [Text] China will pick up the pace in its march toward  modernizing its backward telecommunications by the year 2000,  said a top government official.    Ye Qing, Vice-Minister of the State Planning Committee, said  telecommunications have been a bottleneck in the national  economy despite momentous growth in the last few years.    Major difficulties have been the lack of capital, technology  and proper management, Ye said over the weekend at the  International Conference on China's Telecommunications.    The conference, held in Beijing, was called to provide China  with international expertise and perspectives in its determined  effort to improve telecommunications. It was organized by the  State Planning Committee and sponsored by Morgan Stanley and Co,  Arthur Andersen and Co, Captel International and Baker and  McKenzie.    Ye said China is receptive to international suggestions in  drafting its telecommunications development strategy for the  1990s.    It is predicted that by 2000 domestic demand for telephones  will soar to 30 million to 50 million.    The demand for fax machines will be 2 million to 3 million;  for mobile phones 4 million to 6 million; and for  programme-controlled exchanges, 18 million to 23 million lines.    Wu Xiaolong, director-general of the Ministry of Electronics  Industry's overall development department, said that in the  remainder of this century priority will be given to developing  programme-controlled exchanges, fibre-optic networks, and  mobile, satellite and microwave telecommunications systems.    He predicted that telecommunications industrial output will  surpass 100 billion yuan ($11.5 billion) by 2000, over 15  percent of the country's entire electronics production.    By then, Wu said, the technical level of major  telecommunications products in China will match the  international norms of the mid-1990s.    The Ministry of Electronics Industry has taken on the  country's most ambitious development plan: to build an  information superhighway,    The plan has three major parts.    First comes the Golden Bridge, a telecommunications network  linking departments of the State Council with 30 provinces and  autonomous regions, 500 cities, 12,000 large- and medium-sized  enterprises, 100 leading business groups and the country's key  projects.    Second comes the Golden Customs which will link authorities  managing foreign trade, foreign exchange control and customs  with foreign trade enterprises. This will speed up the handling  of customs statistics, tax rebates, cash settlement and  verification of licenses and certifications of country of origin.    The third is the Golden Card project in 10 coastal cities  with the aim to replace cash with checks and credit cards.    Wu reiterated that China welcomes foreigners to invest in  the  domestic manufacture of telecommunications equipment,    Meocre Li, a senior manager with Arthur Andersen, said his  auditing and consulting firm is working on the first direct  listing on the New York Stock Exchange of a Chinese-incorporated  power-generation company.</p>

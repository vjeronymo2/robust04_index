			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn hit by Amps and CDs MUSIC AND leisure group Thorn EMI suffered its third consecutive heavy fall as the continuing worries over the possibility of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into compact disc prices were joined by concern over its exposure to auction market preferred stock (Amps). The nervousness arose in several stocks yesterday with Amps exposure following BET's decision to use a rights issue to repay some of its stock. Thorn has Pounds 115m of Amps and Pounds 103m of redeemable convertible preference shares on its balance sheet. There were suggestions as the market opened that counting Amps in as debt would take Thorn's gearing from around 75 per cent to 115 per cent. Analysts later pointed out that Thorn's gearing was ambiguous because the company writes off so much goodwill in its accounts. However, this argument, together with a strong rebuttal from the group, failed to stem the fall in the shares, which closed 16 adrift at 783p. Anglian dull The market debut of Anglian Group, which manufactures and installs replacement windows, went off with very few fireworks. The shares, offered at 210p, opened around the 203p mark and ended the session at 204p. Dealers said the stock had put up a creditable performance given that only 6 per cent of the shares offered to the public were taken up. Private investors have shunned recent share issues. The flotation of GPA, the aircraft leasing group, was pulled at the last minute as international investors turned their backs on the stock, while the flotation of 3i, the investment group, was postponed. Shares in The Telegraph newspaper group opened at a substantial discount to their offer price, while those in Kenwood, the electrical goods group, managed a minor premium on their debut but have since fallen to a discount. Barclays rallies A long period of underperformance by Barclays, against the banking sector in general and especially National Westminster, primarily caused by hefty profits downgrades and a series of broker switch recommendations, was to some extent reversed yesterday. Nomura , the Japanese broking house, was believed to have recommended a switch from NatWest to Barclays, predicting that Barclays would maintain the current year's dividend. Its interim results are expected on August 6. Barclays shares rallied 12 to 329p on heavy turnover of 5.8m, while NatWest eased a fraction to 339p on 1.8m. TSB continued to attract some above-average turnover, with 6.7m shares traded by the close. There were hints of a seller of 5m TSB at a shade below the market price. Buoyed recently by suggestions that a stake-builder had been operating in both the stock market and the traded options, the shares dipped 5 to 139p amid a mixture of profit-taking and switching out of TSB and into Abbey National. The latter edged up 2 to 289p. Union Discount, which recently revealed heavy losses, remained under pressure, closing 5 off at a 1992 low of 44p; in February 1991 the shares were changing hands at 565p. Templeton Galbraith, the investment management group, touched 313p before finishing a net 20 higher at 309p after revealing that it is involved in talks which could lead to a takeover bid for the group. Composite insurances responded to a strong buy note issued by Robert Fleming Securities, with Guardian Royal closing 2 ahead at 137p. The same broker was also said to have been a keen supporter of Willis Corroon, as was Goldman Sachs. Willis improved 5 to 213p. Lasmo gave another dismal showing in a generally unhappy oils sector, the shares sliding 5 more to 156p after a block of 1.4m was sold into the market at 155p. An initial setback in ICI, after Moody's Investors Service was said to be considering downgrading some of the company's debt, was more than counterbalanced by a move by James Capel, which turned more positive on the stock. The shares gained 11 on the day at 1152p. Laporte, hit by downgrades from a number of houses on consideration of difficult first-half trading, retreated 10 to 563p. Anglia Secure Homes shares almost halved, closing 5 1/2 down at 6 1/2 p after the group revealed increased losses. Other casualties in a building sector suffering from relentless waves of selling as hopes of interest rate cuts recede every day included Taylor Woodrow, down 5 at 70p. Alexander Proudfoot plunged 41 to 194p after an agency cross of 1.2m shares at 200p. Good results from Coca-Cola helped Cadbury-Schweppes to rise 11 to 492p. Cadbury has a canning agreement with Coca-Cola in the UK, where it saw sales growth of 17 per cent in soft drinks last year. Results ahead of market expectations caused Bulmer to jump 16 to 300p. Analysts, however, reported some nervousness among the Bulmer management about the forthcoming flotation of rival cider maker Taunton, following market talk that some institutions are considering switching out of Bulmer and into the new stock. Brewery group Whitbread receded 4 to 438p as County NatWest moved negative on the stock, arguing that its high exposure in south-east England, low earnings growth and expensive rating could hamper recovery. The news that European and domestic short haul cabin crew at British Airways have voted for strike action over pay and conditions weakened sentiment in the shares, which declined 5 to 273p. A profits downgrade from one of the company's brokers left Ocean Group 7 lighter at 242p. Charterhouse Tilney shaved its current-year figure by Pounds 3m to Pounds 44m, and the following year's by Pounds 4m to Pounds 49m. The broker blamed the cut on 'weaker trading in the marine services division'. Speculation in the market that TI Group was about to sell its information technology division to Cray Electronics boosted trade in TI and the shares moved ahead 5 to 326p on high turnover of 4.4m. Sentiment was also helped by a Smith New Court recommendation. The division was part of Dowty Group, recently taken over by TI. Wagon Industrial climbed 12 to 438p, with the company's broker Albert E. Sharp reported to have been among the day's leading buyers. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (11).

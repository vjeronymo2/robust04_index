			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Finnish economy starts to pull out of slump FINLAND'S economy has begun to pull out of its worst slump since the early 1920s, but full recovery is still some way off, according to an economic analysis released yesterday by the country's ministry of finance. The latest signs of optimism are a substantial improvement in Finland's exports which rose by 13 per cent in value and 11 per cent in volume during the first quarter. The trade balance for the January-March period reached FM2bn(Pounds 251m), helped by last November's 12.3 per cent devaluation of the Markka. Finland's industrial production has also begun to rise after a 6 per cent drop last year. A 7 per cent growth rate is expected in the forestry sector in 1992 and around 2 per cent in engineering with an improvement in profitability due to better price competitiveness. However, other economic indicators are less optimistic. This year's overall growth rate is set to fall by a further 1 per cent after a 6.0 per cent drop in 1991. The government's own deficit this year is predicted to rise to FIM54bn and registered unemployment looks set to average 11 per cent, while household consumption has fallen by an annual rate of 4 per cent over the early months of the year. Earnings rises will be only from 2 to 2.5 per cent in 1992 with an annual inflation rate of only 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Hot air rises round cool decisions: The economic and political cases for breaking up British Gas look weak The likelihood is growing that Mr Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, will reject the recent recommendations of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to break up British Gas. Although the public consultation period still has a month to run, the economic case for adopting them is beginning to look weak and, possibly more important, politically unattractive. Moreover, some of Mr Heseltine's own staff appear to disagree with the measures proposed by the commis-sion. The 1,000-page report, published last month, recommended a nine-year timetable for ending British Gas's dominance of the UK gas industry. It concluded that British Gas's dual role as owner of the gas pipeline network and supplier to the vast majority of consumers made true competition impossible. So the commission called for the divestment by British Gas of its trading activities by March 31 1997. It went on to recommend that British Gas's monopoly of the market for domestic customers be abolished in the period 2000-2002. The problem with this timetable from Mr Heseltine's point of view is twofold. First, it postpones the move to free competition in the domestic market  - a key government objective - until the end of this decade, at the earliest. That is a long time to put off the benefits of lower prices and better service which the government hopes greater competition will bring. Mr Heseltine also needs to have something to offset the unpopular introduction of value-added tax on home fuels at the end of this year. Second, it gives priority to breaking up British Gas, which has never been high on the government's list. In their evidence to the commission, officials at the Department of Trade and Industry's oil and gas division said that the question of who owned trading and transportation systems was less important than promoting competition; ownership issues might even recede once a free market opened up. They also pointed out the difficulties of breaking up a company as large as British Gas (which would be the largest corporate dismemberment seen in the UK). Other details in the report would also present the government with problems, for example the recommendation that the cost of splitting British Gas up be passed on to the consumer rather than the shareholder, and the fact that nowhere in the world has the break-up of an integrated gas monopoly been attem-pted. It is hard to see that Mr Heseltine is under any pressure to split up British Gas at this juncture. Even Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator who was one of the early champions of dismemberment, seems to have changed his tune, or at least softened it. He now believes that break-up is less important than creating a competitive market for new suppliers to enter, and he believes that this is what government and regulator should concentrate on. The problem of British Gas's internal conflicts could be satisfactorily dealt with by building 'Chinese walls' between the transportation and trading divisions, he believes. 'The principle of separation has been accepted,' he says. Nor are British Gas's potential competitors gunning en masse for divestment. Earlier this year, a group of independent gas companies put forward a blueprint for a competitive market which did not envisage breaking up British Gas; they only proposed a clear separation of its transportation and trading arms. 'You don't have to go to the ultimate step of breaking up British Gas at this stage,' says Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman of Utilicorp, one of the companies which helped prepare the plan. 'This means that British Gas would be left with a lot of power, but the regulator can achieve the necessary transparency.' The independents have an obvious motive in wanting the DTI to go for deregulation first rather than a break-up. They would get access to a large new market many years earlier than envisaged in the monopolies commission's course of action, which proposed deregulation only after the year 2000. But if Mr Heseltine does opt for this course, he will have to confront three issues. The first is the risk that true competition might never develop if British Gas was left in one piece, however forceful the regulator. The internal separation of the transportation and trading divisions would have to be extremely effective to convince other users of the pipeline system that British Gas was not giving preference to its own business. Although his oil and gas staff seem to oppose a split-up, Mr Heseltine also has a competition department which might view such a move, like the commission, as the cornerstone of a free market. The second is how to protect consumer rights. Under present arrangements, British Gas has an obligation to supply anyone who lives within a reasonable distance of a gas main and is willing to pay. But this obligation would be harder to enforce in a more competitive market. Various people have put forward ideas to deal with it. Sir James proposes that would-be public gas suppliers (PGSs) would identify the geographical areas they wanted to serve. Provided these were not obviously intended just to 'cherry pick' the choicest neighbourhoods, the regulator would grant a licence which would carry the obligation to supply all-comers in that area. But even this arrangement runs the risk that a new PGS might fail, leaving its customers in the lurch and the sensitive gas system out of balance. Mr Jonathan Stern of Gas Strategies, a consultancy, believes that British Gas would have to retain some kind of 'back-stop' role to guarantee the supply and keep the system in balance. But British Gas would be most reluctant to assume these responsibilities unless it was clearly compensated for the additional cost. 'The biggest barrier facing the government is the obligation to supply,' says Mr Stern. The third point is prices. Would a free market really mean lower gas bills for household consumers? British Gas has argued that 12m of its customers are subsidised by the other 6m. This means that the 12m could actually end up paying more as competition erodes the subsidy. The independent gas suppliers are aware of the sensitivity of British Gas's claims, and they can be expected to intensify their lobbying to reassure government that they are wrong. They could point, for example, to the industrial gas market where new competitors are charging as much as 15 per cent less than British Gas. However, while the gas market presents complex technical issues, Mr Heseltine's choice will ultimately be the political one of what garners the most votes, though he would have to have good reasons for rejecting the commission's recommendations. There can be little political mileage in putting a priority on breaking British Gas up, but there may be votes in stimulating competition to bring down prices for the domestic gas consumer - though even this is questionable given the concern that consumer groups have expressed about the impact of privatisation on utility prices. But Mr Heseltine does have the option of opening up the market to competition, using British Gas as a safety net for what would be a pioneering move by world standards. This would have the additional advantage of leaving the government with the option of breaking British Gas up at a later stage if the experiment showed it to be necessary. This might also give British Gas the incentive to ensure the experiment's success.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Severe pay restraint is urged FULL employment in a competitive non-inflationary economy will require severe wage restraint, says Professor James Meade, a close colleague of Keynes in the 1930s and one of the authors of the 1944 White Paper on employment policy. Prof Meade, writing in a pamphlet for the Employment Policy Institute, says that last year, with some 3m unemployed and unemployment rising, money earnings per head rose 6 per cent although the cost of living rose only 3 per cent. He proposes measures to limit the power of trade unions and other groups of workers who can prevent the entry into work of unemployed outsiders at lower wages than the already employed insiders. He also suggests compulsory arbitration for setting bargained rates of pay, with the arbiters obliged to accept the rate proposed by either party which would most expand the volume of employment. Prof Meade accepts that the consequence of those and other suggestions might be a reduction in wages and a sharp shift to profit. 'Such distributional effects would be inequitable and morally and politically unacceptable unless they were offset by some other form of income which supplemented low rates of pay,' he says. He therefore advocates a more equal distribution of wealth and a 'citizen's income' paid to every citizen whether employed or not. East Anglia, Wales, the east Midlands, and the Yorkshire and Humberside area will be the main regions to benefit from the expected recovery in terms of rising employment, says Mr David Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank. In forecasts released today Mr Kern says 200,000 jobs throughout the UK will be created by the end of next year. Fifteen Propositions.

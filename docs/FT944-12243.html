			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Powerscreen rises 12% to Pounds 14m - Integration of acquisitions and tight controls boost figures Powerscreen International, the manufacturer of screening and stone crushing equipment, reported a 12 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 14.1m for the six months to the end of September. Turnover advanced 41 per cent to Pounds 84m (Pounds 59.4m), including Pounds 2.98m from acquisitions. During the period, Powerscreen continued its ambitious string of purchases, paying Pounds 17.1m for Benford from BM Group, a manufacturer of dumpers and rollers used in the construction and plant hire industries. Mr Shay McKeown , chief executive, said that the improvements had been achieved by the successful integration of its latest purchases and an adherence to tight control measures. 'The exchange rate was against us as well, so under the circumstances we think these are very good results,' he added. The shares, however, fell 13p to 282p. Operating profits in the screening division rose 12 per cent to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 8.5m) on turnover up 36 per cent to Pounds 40.8m, compared with Pounds 29.9m. The figures included contributions from Simplicity Engineering and Ludlow-Saylor bought in February. Mr McKeown said the acquisitions had diluted profit margins but had enabled the group to be better positioned in a larger number of markets. Firmer UK sales in the crushing and recycling business helped profits rise 6 per cent to Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 2.44m) on turnover 13 per cent ahead at Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 15.7m). European sales, however, were disappointing. The Benford added Pounds 3m to the turnover in the materials handling division which rose to Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 13.8m). Profits jumped 36 per cent to Pounds 1.93m (Pounds 1.42m). Earnings per share were up 13 per cent to 12.2p (10.8p). The interim dividend rose 10 per cent to 2.2p (2p). Mr McKeown said the outlook was encouraging. 'We have a strong order book and the investments we are making should ensure continued growth.' COMMENT The market has replaced worries over Powerscreen's accounting policies with more real concerns over whether the group's markets provide long-term profit growth. Having changed its accountants, and increased its disclosures, the group is also working hard at widening its markets, with much effort being put into east Asian operations. Profit forecasts for the full-year are little changed at about Pounds 28m, which gives earnings per share of 28.9p and puts the shares on a prospective p/e of 12, a slight discount to the market. If Powerscreen can win the market's confidence, this seems a low rating for a company as consistent in producing profit growth.</p>

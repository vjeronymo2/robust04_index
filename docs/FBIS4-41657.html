			<p>BFN     [Text] No official statements proposing to extend the  powers of the Federal Assembly and the president have as yet  been received, Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko told  Interfax today.    Speaking of the negative reaction to the proposal to extend  the powers of the president and deputies, Shumeyko said from  what he had read in yesterday's newspapers it was clear that  those who wanted no stability were making the sharpest  statements and distorting the situation.    Shumeyko said his statement did not mention the president,  while PRAVDA maintained that he had done all this for the  president. He said he concluded from response of Sergey  Baburin, Mikhail Gorbachev, SOVETSAKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA that  he was not backed by those who did not want stability. He said  this was proof that his statement had hit the mark.</p>

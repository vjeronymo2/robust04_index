			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Justinian: How to avoid trial by ordeal The length of the Blue Arrow and Guinness trials, completed or abandoned in recent weeks, has highlighted the difficulties of trying complex frauds by jury. There is a radical solution, but it will not be found within the criminal justice system as we know it, or within whatever the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice is likely to devise for the future. The iron equation of crime and punishment must be abandoned for most frauds (the straightforward theft as in Barlow Clowes could safely be left to criminal justice) and replaced with an investigation of fraudulent conduct by a public inquiry, together with steps to eradicate the conditions that fostered the fraudster's art. Fraud cases take a long time coming to trial, because the process of garnering and ordering the mass of documentary material and taking statements from witnesses is time-consuming. The accused's anxieties, induced by the delay, are comparatively tolerable. Trial by ordeal is not tolerable. In former times guilt or innocence was left to supernatural decision. Nowadays the ordeal is a protracted court proceeding, with the verdict in the hands of those uninitiated in the financial world's ways. The worst example of the marathon fraud trial has just ended in Nottingham Crown Court. In September 1990 four persons accused of a medium-scale fraud went on trial. Two hundred and fifty days later, at a cost of more than Pounds 3m, they were convicted. The main defendant was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, a considerable discount having been given, no doubt, for the time that the threat of imprisonment hung over him. The apparent leniency of suspended sentences on the Blue Arrow defendants was due as much to the length of the trial as to the reduced criminality of the convicted. Financial ruin and ill-health are also powerful factors for displacing imprisonment. Mr Ernest Saunders, convicted in August in the first Guinness trial, suffered from pre-senile dementia, prompting a reduction in sentence on appeal. In the second Guinness trial Mr Roger Seelig was stretched beyond the limits of endurance. Mr Justice Henry, who tried the Guinness cases, has rightly called for radical reform, 'not just a tinkering of the process'. The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice will no doubt heed his words, but because realistically the body politic will not countenance the abolition of trial by jury, it is hard to see how criminal justice can cope. Jury trial will always take much longer than a professional tribunal. A 'radical solution' was proposed in 1986, at the very moment the Guinness fraud was exposed. Lord Roskill, a retired law lord, proposed an alternative tribunal, composed of a High Court judge and two assessors with expertise in business and finance to try complex fraud cases. The trial by jury lobby prevailed upon government to reject such a sensible solution. As Jonathan Caplan QC, chairman of the Bar's public affairs committee, said: 'Before we actually get rid of jury trial in a certain category of cases, we should want to be convinced that there is no satisfactory way to maintain the status quo.' Neither the status quo, nor the status quo ante can provide a satisfactory way. If a trial for serious crime must be by one's peers, then we must look elsewhere for a solution than in criminal justice. The main purpose of criminal justice is to satisfy society that an offender has been proved guilty in order to legitimise punishment, with imprisonment as the ultimate sanction. The procedural safeguards must be stringent, to avoid unfairness in the trial process and to reduce the risk of wrongful conviction. The potential loss of liberty a criminal faces is a powerful incentive to all those administering criminal justice to ensure that the highest standards are met. There is a heavy price to be paid, however, in lengthy trials and huge cost to the public purse. The law must constantly adapt its procedure to meet new challenges to social equilibrium. The Financial Services Act 1986, which implemented many of Lord Roskill's recommendations about handling fraud cases, has probably done most to stem the tide of some fraudulent activities. Clever fraudsters will, however, continue to find new loopholes. If the prime purpose of the law is both to expose and prevent fraud, there should be a new form of justice, in which society will have to forgo the power of imprisonment. Instead of jury trials, there must be a public inquiry which will investigate all circumstances of a fraudulent enterprise so that the truth - and not just the unreasoned verdict of an ill-equipped jury - may be paraded before the public in the form of a full report. Miscreants would be named in a final report by the committee of inquiry, and their wrongdoings recorded. The committee would have the power to order any person found at fault to pay the costs of the inquiry, reasonably proportioned to the defaulter's part in the fraud. Other administrative penalties - such as disqualification from company directorships, disciplinary actions by professional bodies, disqualification from voting and removal of honours - could form part of the system. In addition, the persons committing the fraud would remain liable to actions in the civil courts. The perpetrators of institutional fraud would have more to fear from these measures than from a short spell in an open prison, followed by the opportunity to re-establish themselves without apparent commercial ill effects. If it is objected that fraud should be treated no differently from murder, it is well to note that fraudsters are more likely to destabilise society than are dangerous gangsters. Criminal justice cannot protect the modern democratic society against the fraudster. An alternative system of administrative justice must replace it.</p>

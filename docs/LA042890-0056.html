			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND AT AFI FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's and Sunday's schedule of  the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with  commentary by the film reviewing staff.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> Recommended:  </P> <P> "THE END OF OLD TIMES"(Czechoslovakia, 1989; Director: Jiri Menzel; Fairfax,  6:30 p.m.). Menzel's distinctively humanist slapstick is only partially on view  in this moderately engaging comedy about a man posing as an aristocrat among  the hunting-party set in post-World War I Czechoslovakia.

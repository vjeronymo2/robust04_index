The most distinguished proof  is Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the Saudi  capital and the reception accorded to him at the highest level.  But it seems that Kuwait -- through its officials -- continues  to insist on swimming against the tide and working to obstruct  any Arab rapprochement directly or indirectly in order to  perpetuate the disputes and splits if possible.    Two days ago the Interior Ministry revealed that it had  found  weapons and skulls inside the Palestinian embassy in Kuwait  after fabricating illogical reasons for storming it, violating  all known diplomatic conventions.    We do not know how the Palestinian embassy has turned into  an  arsenal of weapons and a warehouse of skulls. Even if these  skulls do really exist, what is strange about it, given that  almost every house in Kuwait is armed to the teeth with machine  guns, rockets, and heavy artillery, as announced by the Interior  Ministry itself during its combing campaigns designed to seize  arms after its continued appeal to urge citizens to hand them  over failed.    The presence of a firearm in an Arab embassy is not a  strange  or odd thing. It is a rule pursued in most countries, and no  diplomatic bag lacks arms. The Kuwaiti Government knows there  is a personal weapon with the ambassador of the state of  Palestine in Kuwait and elsewhere. It also knows that other  embassies have weapons, whether before or after the invasion.    The question is about the use and purpose of these weapons,  not about their presence. If these weapons had really been used  against Kuwait's security and stability, thousands of  Palestinians would not have been expelled in a humiliating way  from Kuwait. Nor would Palestinian women have been raped by  Kuwaitis in broad daylight and in front of their families.    One of the main criticisms aimed against the PLO and its  leaders in a recent Palestine National Council session was its  failure to distribute arms to the Palestinians living in Kuwait  to enable them to defend themselves against the storming  operations conducted by government militias. Its reply was that  if it had done so, Kuwait would have turned into a blood bath --  which it does not want to happen to anyone, neither to Kuwait  nor to the Palestinians.    It is regrettable for Kuwaiti Government officials to speak  about the existence of skulls in Palestine's embassy and  announce this serious discovery on the day the Palestinian  president's visit to Riyadh was due to take place. We do not  know how these skulls reached the embassy building. If these  skulls really exist, they are definitely the skulls of innocent  Palestinians who sought refuge in their country's embassy but  were later killed by the bullets of the Kuwaitis who had pursued  them at the height of their spite against anything Palestinian  -- the spite which dominated Kuwait after the Iraqi forces were  moved out of it.    What is clear is that the Palestinians did not kill a single  Kuwaiti. Actually they were often the victims. Amnesty  International reports and television pictures taken by Western  reporters are full of images of mass graves for the victims  killed by Kuwaiti government militias.    Some Kuwaiti officials are mistaken if they think that by  these lies they can obstruct Arab reconciliation. They know  that this reconciliation is not in their interests. They cannot  obstruct history's movement, nor can they freeze it at a certain  point. Second, such an approach -- if it continues -- will lead  to further isolation for Kuwait at the Arab level, and perhaps  at the Gulf level as well. Proof of this is that some Kuwaiti  writers have urged that reconciliation should be achieved with  some of the states which supported Iraq, naming Yemen and  Tunisia, for example.    Kuwait needs a voice of reason to ease the tension with the  brothers and lead to new pages, which do not all have to be  positive; it is sufficient for them not to be negative. This is  because the continuation of hostility is not in the interests of  Kuwait or its people, whether this hostility is toward the  Palestinians or anyone else.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, March 30 (XINHUA) -- An international  forum on China's Spark program, which aims at spreading modern  science and technology in rural areas and improving the quality  of Chinese peasants, will be held from April 4 to 8 in east  Zhejiang Province where the program has been the most successful.    A spokesman for the Zhejiang provincial government said here  today that the forum will be attended by agricultural officials  and experts from 18 countries in Asia, Africa and South America  as well as 120 representatives from 28 Chinese provinces.    The forum will be jointly sponsored by the United Nations  Development Program, the Chinese State Science and Technology  Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation.    China launched the Spark program in 1986. To date, nearly  50,000 projects have been carried out, covering 85 percent of  the rural counties. The projects have resulted in many new  agricultural and industrial technologies in rural areas and  contributed greatly to rural economic growth.    Zhejiang Province has been especially successful in  implementing the Spark program.    From 1986 to 1993, the province launched 3,346 Spark program  projects, yielding 22.4 billion yuan in output value.    Among the 3,346 rural enterprises which implemented Spark  projects, more than 1,000 had their products exported, earning  foreign currencies worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.    While 15 of these enterprises are producing an annual output  value of more than 100 million yuan, most of the enterprises  have improved their product quality, performances and efficiency.    Zhejiang has, through Spark projects, trained 650,000 farmer  technicians.    Through the Spark projects, the province has also introduced  new species of crops, animals, vegetables and fruit.    The Spark program is now developing toward high and new  technology and export-oriented industries.</p>

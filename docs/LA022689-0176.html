			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE POLITICS OF ENFORCEMENT  </P> <P> State Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp has just insulted the intelligence of every  voting Californian. On Feb. 6, Van de Kamp charged Republican Assemblyman John  Lewis with forgery on campaign mailers.  </P> <P> What makes this ridiculous is that two county district attorneys and Van de  Kamp's own staff refused the case because there was no case. His office turned  the case down 2 years ago. The difference now is that Van de Kamp is running  for governor in 1990 and needs to portray himself as some sort of "ethics  enforcer." I assure you he is no such thing. He is prosecuting selectively,  according to political party.  </P> <P> The people of this state are being duped by a professional politician on a  witch hunt. I hope the people who live in Lewis' district realize this. Lewis  is being victimized by Van de Kamp, who is preying on our suspicious nature of  elected officials.  </P> <P> I believe strongly that corrupt political officials should be held accountable  for their actions, and it is this same belief in justice that drives me to  defend a political official who is unjustly accused and victimized. I would  hate to see a good legislator ruined for the wrong reasons. Wouldn't you?  </P> <P> KEVIN JOLLY  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

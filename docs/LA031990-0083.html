			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW-PROFILE PROTESTANT: NATION'S LAST LEADER?;  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY: THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT GAINS SUPPORT WITH AN ANTI-STALINISM  STANCE, NOT POLITICAL CHARISMA.  </P> <P> Politics is a reluctant fourth career for Lothar de Maiziere, the quiet  Christian Democrat in line to become the last leader of East Germany.  </P> <P> De Maiziere, 50, is the white-whiskered churchman whose party led the  moderate-right Alliance for Germany to stunning victory in East Germany's first  free elections.  </P> <P> Inexperienced as a politician and ineloquent as a speaker, De Maiziere never  took center stage during the brief campaign.  </P> <P> The diminutive candidate would walk unrecognized through crowds of East Germans  who came to hear West Germany's Christian Democratic chancellor, Helmut Kohl,  campaign for his sister party in the east.  </P> <P> Even Kohl's wife drew more applause at at least one rally than the bland  candidate himself.  </P> <P> But De Maiziere is credited with purging the East German Christian Democrats of  hard-core Stalinists after he took over the party chairmanship in November from  Gerald Goetting, who now faces corruption charges.  </P> <P> By aligning the party with two newly formed parties -- the German Social Union  and the Democratic Awakening -- de Maiziere was able to win vital support from  Kohl's forces.  </P> <P> Kohl himself made six campaign appearances in East Germany.  </P> <P> Born near what became the West German border in a town called Nordhausen, De  Maiziere is the son of French Huguenot immigrants.  </P> <P> Even as a teen-ager, De Maiziere belonged to a circle of friends whose frequent  philosophical discussions about the church and East German society brought them  under official suspicion.  </P> <P> "I was suspected of being a counterrevolutionary," De Maiziere told one  interviewer.  </P> <P> He joined the Christian Democrats at 16. One of four satellite parties in the  Communist-dominated National Front that ruled East Germany, the Christian  Democrats for decades aligned themselves with the hard-liners.  </P> <P> But the low-key De Maiziere never actually became a counterrevolutionary.  </P> <P> Raised a strict Protestant, De Maiziere was a gifted violist who played in the  respected Radio Symphony Orchestra Berlin and other orchestras until nerve  inflammation in his arm forced him to quit in 1975.  </P> <P> At the age of 35, De Maiziere embarked on a new career, studying law at  Humboldt University in East Berlin.  </P> <P> He combined his devotion to the church and his commitment to justice when he  graduated, becoming a human rights lawyer and, he once said, "the only  Christian attorney in (East) Berlin."  </P> <P> He defended the church and its members against the Stalinist government and did  legal battle for conscientious objectors against military conscription into the  Communist National People's Army.  </P> <P> A lay church official, De Maiziere served as a deputy prime minister in the  caretaker coalition of Prime Minister Hans Modrow, the reform Communist he is  now poised to replace.  </P> <P> De Maiziere is married and has three daughters.  </P></p>

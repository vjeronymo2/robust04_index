			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Telecoms across the borders - European Court In three recent decisions, the European Court of Justice has interpreted Rome treaty provisions relevant to cross-border trade and competition in the French and Belgian markets for telephone equipment, cordless telephones and walkie-talkie radiocommunication equipment. The cases involved prosecutions for possession or marketing of telephone and radiocommunication equipment without the requisite national authorisations or type approval. The court has confined its rulings to confirming that the European Commission's 1988 directive on competition in the telecommunications terminals market will be infringed only when such prosecutions are brought in the situation where national standards-fixing authorities also compete as providers of services or equipment. The competition rules applicable to public undertakings granted special or exclusive rights by a member country may also be infringed in these circumstances, but not if the body fixing, rather than enforcing, the technical standards in issue is genuinely independent of any public or private undertaking competing in the relevant equipment or service market. The court said that approval of equipment by the competent authority of another member country made no difference. In the absence of EC level harmonisation of telecommunication and radiocommunication systems, the approval by one member country did not guarantee that the equipment in question would not interfere with the operation of the systems in other countries with different technical standards. Where authorisations are required to be obtained from a minister responsible for government radio frequency supervision, the treaty ban on import restrictions does not apply if there is a right to seek judicial review of any refusal. Moreover, the rules on state commercial monopolies do not apply, since there is no discrimination against imports. In the French cases, the rulings were given in the context of criminal proceedings enforcing the French law regulating equipment permitted to be connected to the French state telecoms network which prohibits the marketing of telecoms terminals without the appropriate type approval. The defendants argued that French law infringed EC directive 88/301/EEC on competition in the telecoms terminals market on the grounds that the French authority responsible for fixing technical standards was not independent of the body operating the public telecoms network and which itself marketed terminal equipment. The court said that the 1988 directive required member countries from July 1 1989 to ensure that the fixing of technical standards, their supervision and type approval of equipment were carried out by bodies independent from public or private undertakings involved in the commercialisation of telecommunications equipment or services. This requirement was infringed as, at the relevant time, different departments of the French ministry of posts and telecommunications were simultaneously responsible for the commercial exploitation of the public network, the fixing of technical standards, supervision of conformity and the approval of terminal equipment. With regard to the position before July 1 1989, the court confirmed that the EC competition rules applicable to public undertakings were infringed when a member country grants the undertaking operating the public telecoms network the power to fix the standards for telephone equipment and to supervise the conformity with those standards by operators with which it competed. In two Belgian cases, the court said the treaty rules on free movement of goods and commercial monopolies were not applicable in the context of the Belgian law applicable to radiocommunication equipment. However, the Belgian government admitted that the 1988 directive's requirement of independence between regulator and commercial operators was not satisfied by the law after July 1 1989.

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD moved above Dollars 340 a troy ounce briefly on the London bullion market before producer selling abruptly halted the short covering rally. PLATINUM futures were lower on Nymex at midday as profit taking emerged after Tuesday's steep rise. Analysts said July platinum would consolidate recent gains and try for around Dollars 384. They cited continued concerns over the availability of physical supply, particularly in Europe - the EC has set the end of this year as the deadline for new model cars to have catalytic converters. The London's robusta COFFEE futures clawed back earlier losses of up to Dollars 20 a tonne. Dealers attributed the recovery to sentiment that Tuesday's sell-off in New York might have been overdone. ZINC prices fell on the LME, although the premium for cash metal remains high at Dollars 150.50 a tonne. The market remains nervous, with fundamentals pointing to a lower price but traders fearing the technical squeeze on June supplies could be repeated in July, where there is already a large call option open position between Dollars 1,300 and Dollars 1,400. TIN staged a downward reaction to recent gains after the three-month price failed to move above resistance at Dollars 6,500. Compiled from Reuters</p>

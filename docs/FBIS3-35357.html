			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Israeli prime minister is in Portugal. An  accord between Israelis and Palestinians regarding the  withdrawal of troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho could be  reached in the next two weeks. This is what Yitzhaq Rabin said  today at a news conference:    [Begin Rabin recording, in English with superimposed  Portuguese translation] It will be done in a few weeks, more  than two weeks. And I don't believe that it is advisable to be  discussing a specific timetable at the moment. I can assure you  it will be less than three months as originally planned. The  real problem now is not how quickly the accord will be  implemented once it is reached, but how we reach it. I am very  sorry to have to say this, but it will take longer than two  weeks. [end recording]    [Announcer] That was the Israeli prime minister, translated  by Miguel Moreira. Prime Minister Cavaco Silva was also at the  news conference. He said that Portugal supports an agreement  between the EC and Israel as long as mutual interests are  safeguarded.</p>

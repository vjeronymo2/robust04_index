			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Lehndorff Canada meets creditors LEHNDORFF Canada, a private group of real estate partnerships funded largely by European investors, met with about 30 creditors in Toronto yesterday to ask for concessions on its CDollars 565m (USDollars 470m) debt. Lehndorff said it was seeking an 'informal restructuring of its debt, assets and operations' in view of the slump in the Canadian commercial property market. 'Given the persistence of current trends, it can no longer be business as usual,' Mr Murray Brown, president, said. The company said the debt was secured by properties with residual equity of close to CDollars 1bn. The restructuring plan is due to be finalised by September 30. It includes proposals for an injection of equity by the 5,000 investors in its limited partnerships, most of whom are German. Lehndorff manages a portfolio of about 230 properties, mostly in southern Ontario and Alberta. Its main lenders include Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada and several foreign-owned banks. It is the latest in a string of Canadian property developers to acknowledge financial difficulties caused by a combination of heavy debt loads, rising vacancy rates and downward pressure on rents and purchase prices. Bramalea, a developer controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, failed to make an interest payment due last week on a CDollars 100m bond issue. The company is renegotiating its CDollars 4.8bn debt. Its share price stood at 90 cents yesterday morning, down from more than CDollars 5 at the beginning of this year.</p>

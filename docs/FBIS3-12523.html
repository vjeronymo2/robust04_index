Our correspondent  Yo'el Nir reports that according to Gen. Yatom, these figures  are not final but are based on the information available as of  last night. The number of people wounded is still being  examined. Gen. Yatom added that he has worked out new  procedures governing prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs but  has not submitted them to the political echelon yet.    Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq told the committee that the  newspapers published a list of names of 47 people killed in the  massacre. An examination of this list, however, showed that  several of the persons on it are still alive and that some were  only wounded. The list also includes some inaccurate names.  The chief of staff believes this is the reason for the gap  between the various calculations.</p>

Commenting on the achievements of the summit meeting  Migranyan said that "the president of Russia admitted the need  to seek a new architecture of European security, saying that the  partnership for peace concept born within the NATO is not the  only possibility." By this he indirectly admitted the need to  establish such a system of European security in which all  countries of eastern Europe would have equal rights in adopting  decisions to maintain peace and stability, the academician said.    Secondly, the U.S. side confirmed "Russia's special role in  maintaining stability on the territory of the post-Soviet  space," Migranyan said, referring to the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian  agreement to eliminate Ukrainian nuclear weapons.    Additionally, "the U.S. President went further than making  declarations and or giving advice, he concluded concrete  agreements with Russia to open the American market to Russian  goods and include russia into the GATT as an equal member," as  well as integrate it into other international financial and  economic structures.    The academician also welcomed Clinton's decision to help  defend the rights of Russian minorities in the Baltic states.</p>

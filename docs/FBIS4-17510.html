			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The amount of  Russian-Turkish military cooperation may be significantly  increased in the near future, announced Russian First  Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets during his meeting on Friday with  Turkish Defence Minister Mehmet Golhan. At the same time, both  sides confirmed that their cooperation in the military sphere  must not be detrimental to the interests of any third country.    The two diplomats wholeheartedly called for the Black Sea  region to become an area of peace and calm. With that goal in  mind, they agreed to combine their efforts to put out the fires  of conflicts in the Caucasus region and the Balkans.    The Turkish defence minister reported that his country was  ready to discuss the possibility of Russia's participating in  the construction of safe, relatively small heating and nuclear  power plants in Turkey.    In turn, Soskovets voiced Russia's willingness to positively  respond to Turkey's overtures and study the possibility of  building a natural gas pipe-line through Georgian and Turkish  territory. The implementation of such a project would  noticeably improve the economic situation in Georgia, which is  suffering from a severe lack of energy resources. He noted that  the technical and economic foundation for the project could be  completed as quickly as within two or three months.    Both sides expressed their willingness to sign an agreement  on cooperation in the training of military personnel in the near  future.</p>

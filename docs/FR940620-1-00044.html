Data needs must be established giving consideration to the contractor's economic interests in data pertaining to items, components, or processes that have been developed at private expense; the Government's costs to acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the data; reprocurement needs; repair, maintenance and overhaul philosophies; spare and repair part considerations; and, whether procurement of the items, components, or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. Reprocurement needs may not be a sufficient reason to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when replacement items or spare parts can be acquired using performance specifications, form, fit and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of alternate sources which can reasonably be expected to provide such items on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for data, data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in the offer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Contracting officers are responsible for assuring that, to the maximum extent practicable, solicitations and contracts_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be delivered under the contract and the format and media in which the data will be delivered; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) As required by 10 U.S.C. 2320, establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data item on an Exhibit to the contract); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable data item under a fixed price type contract;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable data item; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item of technical data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 227.403&hyph;3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Early identification of technical data to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction or disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 requires, to the maximum extent practicable, an identification prior to delivery of any technical data to be delivered to the Government with restrictions on use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions'' in all solicitations that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items.''

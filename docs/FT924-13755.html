			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Cabinet may trim capital spending CAPITAL PROJECTS are still among the areas that are likely to be cut as the cabinet committee on public spending met yesterday and finished the second stage of the public-expenditure round. The six-strong committee, known in Whitehall as EDX, chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, concluded its assessment of priorities for spending in 1993-94. It will use its discussions today and tomorrow to focus on the impact of those decisions on departmental programmes. Officials are working towards an Autumn Statement in the week beginning November 9, and the tough schedule of meetings is partly to compensate for the decision not to continue the spending discussions during last week's Tory party conference. Ministers highlighted last week the need to keep the pressure on public-sector pay and hinted at a squeeze on social security benefits. Although they played down the more politically contentious course of cutting back on capital spending, construction projects are still under threat. Industrialists have already reacted with dismay to the prospect of large reductions in capital investment, which is seen as having a vital contribution to make to the survival of the construction industry. Lord Prior, a former Tory cabinet minister and now chairman of GEC, the defence group, said yesterday that it would be 'devastatingly bad' for industry if the government cut back on capital projects in the present public-spending review. There are still ominous signs over some building expenditure. One Treasury official highlighted the link between the signal in Mr John Major's speech to conference last Friday about relaxing the rules for public and private co-operation on infrastructure projects, and the expected cuts in the Department of Transport's roads programme. A few pieces of capital spending - such as central government support for local light rail projects - have already been scrapped. Defence spending and the Department of the Environment's housing budget have also been widely identified as likely victims. In spite of earlier suggestions that the Treasury might be trying to get spending below the Pounds 244.5bn planning total for next year, the latest signals are that the intention is to meet that target rather than cut spending below it. The Treasury keeps formally to the line that 'nothing is decided until everything is decided'. The view from spending departments, however, is that the first round of 'easy' cuts has already been made, and that the Treasury's aim now is to give itself room to increase spending on a few high-priority programmes while keeping within the overall target. EDX has not yet decided whether departmental ministers should be invited to put their arguments in person or whether they should have no opportunity to query the committee's judgments until they go to full cabinet in early November.</p>

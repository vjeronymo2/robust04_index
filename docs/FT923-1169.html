			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies There is a great irony in the troubles facing the French franc. If anything, the fundamentals suggest it ought to be a candidate for revaluation against the D-Mark rather than vice versa. France has a tighter fiscal policy, and its inflation record has been consistently better. Consumer price inflation is only 2.7 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in Germany. Still the franc's position remains precarious. Yesterday's rise in short-term interest rates backed up by intervention and the outspoken verbal support of the Bundesbank brought only partial relief. As Britain found last week, the weight of capital flows rapidly becomes too great to resist when the market loses faith in a given currency. The political will to hold the line is undeniable, but it looks increasingly as though the markets will exact a price in the form of a significant German interest rate reduction. That would incidentally open the way to further rate cuts in Britain. It might bring some relief to Spain, which has alienated foreign investors in its government bond market through the reimposition of exchange controls. Most important, it would be a gesture of recognition by the apolitical Bundesbank that Europe's aspiration towards integration has conferred on it a political role. That may be hard for the bank to square with its legal obligation to target domestic price stability. It could argue that the appreciation of the D-Mark against sterling, the lira and the peseta already imply some offsetting deflationary effect. The point is that it has little time time left to wrestle with its conscience. The crunch is probably only days away.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report from the "Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow" </F> column: "Does North Korea Have a Specific Program?"]    [Text] Tokyo is unable to confirm the statement by U.S.  Secretary of Defense William Perry that the DPRK has started  implementing a program which will enable it to produce at least  12 nuclear devices a year within two to three years. An  ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed of this by a senior  Japanese Foreign Ministry official.    He observed that he did not know the reasons which enabled  the U.S. secretary of defense to make such a statement during an  interview with a U.S. television company on Sunday [3 April].</p>

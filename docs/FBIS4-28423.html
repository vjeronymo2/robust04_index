			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Kim  Tae-hui, director of the International Affairs Department of the  Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), in a statement on June 7  demanded that the Japanese authorities fully clarify their  responsibility for the heavy losses caused to Chongnyon and  Koreans in Japan by the unreasonable search of the Kyoto  prefectural police and make an apology in explicit terms.    The search is an illegal and unjustifiable act, an incident  beyond common sense, that will be regarded as a serious  international problem, he said.    He demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately stop  the suppression and violation of human rights which threaten the  activities of Chongnyon and organisations under it and the life  of the Koreans in Japan and take appropriate steps to prevent  the recurrence of such incident.</p>

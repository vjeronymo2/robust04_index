			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Former Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] Chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel has also come out in  favor of criminal investigations against Franz Schoenhuber,  chairman of the right-wing extremist Republikaner. Following  his statements about Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central  Council of Jews in Germany, the Munich public prosecutor's  office must examine whether or not Schoenhuber committed the  crime of incitement. The statements by the former television  journalist are "indeed apt to disturb public peace," Vogel said  in an interview on Saarland Radio on Thursday [24 March].    Yesterday SPD Deputy Chairwoman Herta Daeubler-Gmelin and  Christian Democratic Union Secretary General Peter Hintze  demanded criminal sanctions. Leading Free Democratic Party of  Germany politicians were outraged about Schoenhuber's "shameless  language and insulting comments." The right-wing extremist had  accused Bubis of "instigating people," because Bubis had said  that right-wing extremists were the "intellectual arsonists" of  the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck. Even though Bubis does  not want to file a complaint against Schoenhuber, if  investigations are carried out for the crime of incitement, as  Vogel demands, the public prosecutor's office could act even  without a formal complaint.</p>

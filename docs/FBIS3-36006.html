The president  made this statement during his visit to the Ukrainian Stock  Exchange in response to a question from KIEVSKIYE NOVOSTI's  economic reporter.    The president's interest in stock exchange structures is  understandable: One may discern a prototype of our economy's  key unifying element in their development. Although with great  difficulty, the economy is reforming itself on a competitive  basis. Another reason for the visit was the fact that having  passed through the "evolutionary" process of emergence over a  record short period of time, the Ukrainian Stock Exchange today  fully meets international standards in organizing bids. This  has become possible due to the introduction of electronic  circulation of securities. Assistance came from French  specialists and the government, which allocated funds for  software purchases. The distinguishing feature of the  electronic system is that it allows the very expensive "paper"  chain to be abandoned. [passage omitted]    Valentin Oskolskiy, chairman of the Ukrainian Stock  Exchange's management, reported that the first biddings were  held in March of 1992, while the electronic system was installed  in late 1993. The latter fact was defined as extremely  significant for the development of a florid market of securities  since it creates conditions for the regulation of difficult  relations among sellers, dealers, and investors. Currently,  only stocks of the shipping company "Ukrrechflot" and the  "Ukraine" stock bank are sold through this system. The system  is expected to reach its full potential with the beginning of  the mass privatization of state property.    Having acquainted himself with the system, the staff, and  the  results of the bids conducted on this "occasion" (the stock  exchange sold securities worth 25 million karbovantsy), the  president answered journalists' questions. Since the stock  exchange system is a contrast to the so-called system of  centralized planning, we asked L. Kravchuk to explain his  general attitude toward the beginnings of planning in the  economy.    "You see that one cannot reject planning," said the  president. "It is applied everywhere. Even a small family plans  its future, income, and expenditures -- what it has and what it  can buy. For example, Japan achieved its market through the  fulfillment of plans. One should not reject planning as such.  The problem is that speaking about planning as a principle, we  have before us the image of the great state plan with its  extremely centralized system, administrative methods of  regulation, and pressures on the producer. A plan scares us.  However, we have actually submitted our plans of social and  economic development rather than the budget alone to the Supreme  Soviet. They must be coordinated and interrelated. I believe  that one must have a plan for the development of any economic  entity, concern, corporation, or syndicate. This is the case  throughout the world." [passage omitted]</p>

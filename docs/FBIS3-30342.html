			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by Vid </F> Blagojevic on 1 February; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Blagojevic] Radovan Karadzic, president of the  Srpska republic, commented on yesterday's visit by Mr. Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy to the Srpska republic and Bijeljina in the  following way to your reporter:    [Karadzic] I would like to say the Mr. Zhirinovskiy is  welcome [words indistinct]. He is not just any Russian, but a  Russian who has behind him several million voters, and of course  their families -- so a very significant number of Russians --  and since we have very good relations with the Russian  Government and the Russian opposition [words indistinct] with  the opposition, just as we gladly meet the government. Things  are certainly changing in Russia. What I can tell our listeners  and the local radio stations is that, unfortunately, in our wish  to have peace as soon as possible, we were hoping that peace  could come soon.    However, the Muslim side has opted for war, and the United  States has decided to support the Muslim commitment to war by  recognizing the actual situation on the ground that the Muslims  have achieved by force of arms. That bothers us as that means  there will be more suffering, particularly among the Muslim  people, but we should also be glad about it, since if the actual  situation on the ground created in fighting is recognized, then  it will be recognized for the Serbs as well, and the Serbs  control 60 percent of the territory. The Serbs will achieve  their aims to a greater extent even though with more casualties  than if there were to be peace.    We have adopted important decisions at the general staff  level. Our people have to be completely mobilized. We are either  a nation or not. We are either a nation or we will disappear.  Our enemies have to know that it is dangerous to fight against  the Serbs, that when cornered, the Serbs have no other choice.  We have no choice but to win. We did not want to defeat the  Muslims. We wanted them to win on their territory and us to win  on ours, and to part our ways. If they do not want to, then it  is our duty to defend every inch of our country. There are no  more percentages. Nobody can guarantee any percentages to the  Muslims, and they will most certainly get much less than they  could have had if they had accepted [word indistinct].    [Blagojevic] Asked about the fate of [Bosanska] Posavina and  Mt. Ozren at the last negotiations and the coming ones in  Geneva, President Karadzic said:    [Karadzic] (That is undefined) since we did not want  anything like that as we have a lot of work to do with the  Croats. [sentence as heard] Part of western Slavonia is under  Croatian control so we thought that the entire Bosanska Posavina  should belong to the Serbs, and that is what we still think.  Therefore every inch of Posavina has to belong to the Serbs.  We do not want any corridor, we want a real territorial link  between our Krajina, the Srpska republic, and the Serbian  Krajina, that is, republic. We could not abandon Mt. Ozren, we  even got a significant part of Mt. Ozren back through  negotiations. To tell the truth, the Muslims did not feel much  like taking Mt. Ozren with so many Serbs there, and such savage  and rough Serbs, too, so that, to our mutual satisfaction, we  decided that this part of Mt. Ozren should be returned.    However, since the Muslims have given up on all this, we  have  the reason, the rights, and the ability to defend every inch of  the Serb land, and the Muslims will get what is left. We cannot  compensate them, we cannot guarantee them 33 percent, and let  them then fight for more. Every gamble has two possible  outcomes, a gain and a loss, and every stick has two ends. If  the Muslim leadership has opted for war, and it has, and the  United States has decided to recognize the results of their  struggle, and it has, then it should all also apply to the Serbs  and the Serbs should not complain as they already control 72  percent of the territory, and own 60 percent of the territory.  If we do make any concessions, then that will only be a  percentage or two of unimportant territory, we will not give  away anything important that is Serbian.    [Blagojevic] In what context are we to view the latest  statement by General Morillion, former UN commander?    [Karadzic] That a Muslim state should not be (created)?    [Blagojevic] Yes.    [Karadzic] That is our big problem, ours and the Croats.  Europe wants us to remain in a common country with the Muslims  so as to control them. That European calculation is extremely  wrong since in about 15 years the Muslims would be in the  majority, and they would create pressure, as in Kosovo, for the  Serbs and the Croats to move out. Then it would become a great  Muslim state in Europe. Trying to avoid a small Muslim state in  Europe, Europe is creating a great Muslim state, because of its  miscalculations. Europe does not know that, though. We will  not accept that. We have nothing against a small Muslim state,  but we also have nothing against dividing Bosnia in two parts  between the Serbs and the Croats. The Muslims in Tuzla could  get autonomy with the Serbs, and autonomy in Zenica with the  Croats, although we would rather see a clean partition into  three, where the Serbs could enjoy their territories, and the  Muslims could enjoy whatever is theirs.    [Blagojevic] President Karadzic finally addressed the  soldiers in the Srpska republic army:    [Karadzic] Greetings to all the fighters. Please, gentlemen  fighters, you are the most glorious generation of Serb fighters,  and the officers are the most glorious generation of Serb  officers. Pay no attention to what we do at the conferences, as  all the maps are transient, and only what you hold is eternal.  Hold every village of ours, and do not worry.</p>

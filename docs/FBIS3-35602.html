			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report: "New Deal Has Been Drafted. </F> President To Decide on Academicians' Program"]    [Text] "Russia's Choice," headed by former Deputy Prime  Minister Yegor Gaydar, has drastically improved its chances to  become the only State Duma faction to oppose the government.  Today a group of academicians under Stanislav Shatalin and  Leonid Abalkin plans to present to the president, the prime  minister, and chairmen of the Federal Assembly's chambers an  economic program that is at considerable odds with the financial  stabilization policy as understood by the IMF (see  KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 25 and 26 January). Since this particular  document is seen by most of the State Duma's political  associations as a basis for a constructive dialogue with the  government, "Russia's Choice" (as a matter of fact, together  with "Yabloko") has been left out of a discussion on the program  that representatives of other factions scheduled for 2 February.    Obviously, Leonid Abalkin's statement about "the corrective  nature of the proposed recommendations" should not be taken  literally. In fact the draft program calls for a significant  departure from the economic principles that were actively  defended by Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, who came to  epitomize monetarism in Russia. At the same time, it is too  early to conclude that the package of measures proposed by the  academicians means revolutionary changes in the economic policy  pursued by the government.    The program, if adopted by the government, may have much  greater political significance, however -- joining forces with  the parliamentary majority on its basis will make the  Chernomyrdin cabinet the first "government of people's  confidence" in the past three years. Seen against this  backdrop, the situation at the Federation Council appears less  clear than at the State Duma. A lack of party divisions and  Viktor Chernomyrdin's influence in the upper chamber, however,  may combine to make the upper chamber just as enthusiastic about  the prospects for an alliance with the government as the lower  chamber appears to be.    To all appearances, former government members are set to be  the most consistent opponents of the new draft program. This is  only understandable: Yegor Gaydar and his loyalists need to  restore their political authority after their failure in the  December elections. What "Russia's Choice" sees as the Russian  economy's inevitable slide toward hyperinflation  ("Ukrainization") gives the political association a chance to  rehabilitate itself.    Representatives of the parliamentary majority have been  cautiously inferring that Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, for his part,  will also back the draft so as to offer his version of program  as a basis of the cabinet's economic policy at the next stage,  drawing on his current constructive stance.    The definitive future of the draft, however, will not be  decided by the government or the parliament. In the current  political conditions the last word rests with Boris Yeltsin.  The stress on the president's "firm" stance with regard to the  reform course, made by his press secretary, amounted to a signal  for the key political figures that the president will not balk  at decisive actions if he happens to be dissatisfied with the  new balance of forces in the parliament or the government.   <H3>    Leaders of the group of authors of the new economic  program </H3>   Academician Leonid Abalkin, director of the Russian Academy  of Sciences [RAS] Economics Institute;    Academician Nikolay Petrakov, director of the RAS Central  Economics and Mathematics Institute;    Academician Stanislav Shatalin, president of the "Reform"  international foundation, who co-authored the "500 Days" program  together with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy;    Academician Oleg Bogomolov, director of the RAS  International  Economic and Political Studies Institute;    Academician Yuriy Yaremenko, director of the RAS Economics  and Scientific-Technical Progress Forecasting Institute; and    former Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, director of  the Russian Government's Information and Social Technologies  Center</p>

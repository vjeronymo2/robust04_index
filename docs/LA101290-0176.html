			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER QUITS  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Ali Bozer resigned today in an apparent rift over his virtual  exclusion by President Turgut Ozal from Turkey's policy over the Persian Gulf  crisis.  </P> <P> "I have resigned because I could not have continued my job with speculation  about myself," Bozer told a news conference.  </P> <P> He said he handed in his resignation two weeks ago after returning from a visit  to Washington and New York with Ozal.  </P> <P> Bozer was known to have been dismayed when he was excluded from Ozal's White  House meeting with President Bush last month. Foreign Ministry officials noted  that Secretary of State James A. Baker III attended the talks, during which  Ozal vowed to honor the U.N. economic embargo against Iraq.  </P></p>

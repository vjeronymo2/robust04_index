			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Kosovo shudders under the yoke: Jonathan Ledgard reports on Albanians' resentment at the rule imposed by Serbia IN THE cramped and freezing bungalow which houses Kosovo's outlawed ethnic-Albanian parliament, 14-year-old Lumzim was giving his testimony. He looked shocked and close to tears. Lumzim (not his real name) had saved DM300 (Dollars 188) selling cigarettes on the streets and had planned to travel to friends in Albania with the money. On the way to the bus station, he said, four Serbian policemen stopped him, stripped him naked in the freezing cold and found the money pinned to the inside pocket of his jeans. They beat him, stole his passport and money and forced the pin down his throat. An x-ray shows the two-inch pin lodged in his stomach. It would take an operation to remove it, but Serbian-controlled hospitals have denied care to Albanians. The incident is part of the systematic political and human rights abuse, identified by international human rights organisations, inflicted on ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 per cent of Kosovo's population. Kosovo used to be an autonomous province of former Yugoslavia until it was reincorporated unilaterally into Serbia three years ago by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, its Communist-turned-nationalist leader. Serbs, resentful that 500 years of Ottoman rule and the high birth rate of ethnic Albanians has made them a tiny minority in the former cradle of Serbia's medieval kingdom, voted overwhelmingly for ultra-nationalists in last month's general elections - boycotted by ethnic Albanians. The outcome has raised the tension level and the risk of an Albanian revolt which, once unleashed, would invite Serb repression on a scale which could provoke irresistible demands for intervention from the Moslem world. It is a testament to the repression in Kosovo that Zeljko Raznjatovic , better known as 'Arkan' and described by the US government as a Serbian war criminal, was elected to the all-Serbian parliament, and operates openly from the lobby of the Grand Hotel. He dresses fashionably and is guarded by thuggish veterans from the earlier fighting in Vukovar and other war-torn towns and villages in Croatia. In an interview he made clear his unconcern about his reputation and the war criminal tag put on him by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state. 'I don't give a damn about Eagleburger and his damn trial. He is more of a war criminal than I am,' he says. While extreme nationalists won most of the seats in the December elections, the Democrats led by Mr Milan Panic, who were the only group prepared to compromise over Kosovo, did not even win a seat. This is bad news for ethnic Albanians, although Arkan claims they have nothing to fear. 'If the Albanians are honest and look to Belgrade we welcome them,' he says. 'If it is Tirana, the Albanian capital they look to, we'll help them back.' Most ethnic Albanians here demand independence for Kosovo, rather than union with even more impoverished Albania across the mountains. But, asked about the clandestine ethnic Albanian government headed by self-styled president Ibrahim Rugova, Arkan was ominously dismissive. 'Rugova is a tourist in Serbia, an Albanian tourist. He will be leaving very soon, believe me.' Mr Rugova is trying to keep the peace, and it is proving very hard. The Serbs have shut all the Albanian media, but with every arrest and killing of an Albanian by Serbian authorities the country people, for whom the vendetta, or kahun, is still a cherished way of death, are becoming more restless. Mr Rugova and other ethnic Albanian intellectuals are haunted by the knowledge that any war would end in slaughter of the unarmed Albanians, half of whom are under 15 years of age. The Yugoslav civil war has been fought from the hamlet up. Kosovo will be no different. To stop a bloodbath here, the United Nations would have to deploy massive peacekeeping forces on the ground in the rural communities and emasculate the Serbian authorities. This seems improbable. Young ethnic Albanians say they are prepared to die. 'We would rather die than be Serbian slaves,' said one group of students. Many Serbs think the same way. 'Only war will sort this mess out. That's why I voted for Slobodan Milosevic. He will protect us from the Moslems, from genocide,' said a working-class Serb in the Kosovan capital, Pristina. Such views are common and there is almost no middle ground. Albanians want to be free and Serbs want back what they see as their cultural heritage. Arkan's cause is also clear. He will use all means available to crush Albanian hopes of independence. But even Arkan fears clannish Albanian culture and has sponsored the inflow of Serb immigrants. He and his followers exude violence and the hatred between Christians and Moslems here is tangible. As a warlord, Arkan has already become rich through war. Many fear he also has a personal interest in seeing war and the opportunity for pillage spread to Kosovo.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / UK Gilts: Auction prospect prompts pause for breath SOME of the froth came off the recent rise in UK government bonds last week, as investors reacted negatively to the announcement about the next gilt auction and indications of continuing fiscal weakness. In recent weeks gilts have enjoyed a purple patch, with long-bond yields dropping to their lowest levels for 20 years. The market now seems likely to pause for breath while weighing up the large volume of issues that will be needed to finance the high public sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94. The Bank of England will on July 28 auction an unspecified amount of stock maturing between 1998 and 2001. It will announce tomorrow the details of the bonds and how much will be sold. Market estimates are that some Pounds 3.25bn of securities will be on offer. The announcement on Friday helped the long end of the gilt market, with yields above the 10-year level continuing their generally downward movement. However, prices of 10-year bonds fell more than  1/4 point on Friday, in reaction to news of the auction and that government borrowing in the first three months of the financial year rose by nearly a quarter on the corresponding period of 1992-93. Public borrowing between April and June was Pounds 13.2bn, compared with Pounds 10.7bn in the same period a year earlier. Many in the gilt market were more interested in these details than in the smaller than expected borrowing figure for June. This was caused largely by unusually high government receipts, arising from individuals and companies paying their tax bills in June rather than later in the summer. In spite of the extra cash flowing into the Treasury due to this trend, the PSBR for the month still came out at a high Pounds 3.88bn, partly because of a big rise in government spending triggered by high social security outlays due to the recession. Even with the setback to fortunes of the 10-year stock on Friday, gilts of this maturity showed an impressive rise on the week. The 8 per cent bond maturing in 2003 was quoted on Friday night at 103 7/8 , nearly 1/2 point up on the previous Friday. Its yield fell to 7.43 per cent from 7.51 per cent a week earlier. Longer-dated securities saw a yield fall of a similar scale on the week, while short-dated gilts moved sideways as expectations of an early cut in bank base rates all but petered out. Gilts maturing in 20 to 25 years have performed particularly well in recent weeks. Since early May, 25-year bonds have seen yields drop from about 8.5 per cent to 7.7 per cent. Over the same period, yields for 10-year securities have come down from 8.2 per cent. Assuming inflation data over the next few months are as positive as were the figures last week, it is fair to assume that longer-dated gilts will see a further period of steady price increases. The market was particularly heartened by fresh signs that wage pressures are declining, coming from news that average earnings across the economy rose an underlying 3.75 per cent in the year to May, the lowest figure for 26 years. In a further sign of low inflation, wages per unit of output in manufacturing in the three months to May declined by 3.6 per cent compared with the same period last year. This is the biggest year-on-year fall since the Department of Employment started records in 1970. Meanwhile, prices of factory-made goods for domestic sale rose by just 4 per cent in the year to June, the same as in the year to May, while the year-on-year rise in the retail prices index dropped in June to 1.2 per cent, the lowest figure for nearly 30 years. The message from these figures is that manufacturing is leading the recovery. There are few signs of any significant build-up in consumer spending, nor of price pressures at the level of wages and retail goods Supporting these indications, a chairman of a big food company said last week that the food business was in a 'horrible' state. In contrast, manufacturing output in May registered its biggest monthly output increase for four years, with production up 1.8 per cent on the April level. The release this Wednesday of the figures for last month's retail sales volumes will be watched with interest in the gilt market. Prices are likely to rise should the figures turn out weak.</p>

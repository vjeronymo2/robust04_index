			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / House prices 'rose by 2% in February' Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, is expected to announce tomorrow that house prices rose by more than 2 per cent last month compared with January. The rise would be one of the largest monthly increases reported by the society since the late 1980s and would lift the annual increase in house prices to about 3 per cent. The Halifax figures conflict with a report yesterday by Nationwide, the country's second-largest building society, which said UK house prices on average had fallen by 0.6 per cent in February compared with January. The annual rise in house prices of 3.2 per cent reported by the Nationwide, however, was very close to the figure expected to be published by Halifax. Halifax and Nationwide both expect prices to rise by about 5 per cent on average this year, although their monthly figures have differed widely. Halifax in January and December reported monthly price falls of 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively while Nationwide reported increases of 0.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent. Some of the monthly discrepancies between the societies' figures may be explained by the fact that Nationwide uses a smaller sample of borrowers, while Halifax also seasonally adjusts its figures. Halifax is likely to warn that the slow nature of the housing recovery is such that it is difficult to gain a true picture of the market from one month's figures. It has warned that occasional monthly price falls may still occur even though the general trend in prices and sales is upwards. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said price falls had also occurred in February last year and in 1992. He expected the 'continued small annual rise in house prices apparent since the autumn' to continue. In spite of tax increases scheduled to take effect in April, there was 'still potential for a sustained rise in housing market transactions in 1994'. Mr Davis said: 'Although the tax increases due in April may not be helpful to the housing market and wider economy, the current low interest rate environment has significantly contributed to improved affordability.'</p>

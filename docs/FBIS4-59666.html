			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, May 17 (AFP) -- Fierce battles raged around a  key air base Tuesday [17 May] as southern Yemeni forces, backed  by warplanes, tried to prevent northern forces from advancing on  Aden, witnesses said.    The northerners, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  captured al-'Anad airbase on Monday, opening the way for a push  toward Aden, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south.    "Fierce battles have raged around Al-'Anad since the early  morning," said one of the witnesses.    The southerners, backed by warplanes were "trying to push  back the advance" of pro-Salih forces on the southern stronghold  of Aden, said the witness.    He added however, that northern forces seemed better  equipped  and more organized than their southern rivals.    The northern troops, backed by tanks, artillery and  anti-aircraft batteries, captured the base on Monday and cut off  southern troops, an AFP photographer said.    But the southerners later claimed to have recaptured the  base, and the intensity of Tuesday's fighting made it impossible  to say who was in control.    Southern warplanes were bombing the newly-won northern  positions, defying anti-aircraft fire.    The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5, after months  of arguing over how to run the country, formed from the  unification in May 1990 of conservative North Yemen and poorer,  Marxist South Yemen.</p>

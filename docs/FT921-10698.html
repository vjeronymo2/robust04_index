			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Observer: Blocking copy It was good to see, on a visit to a packed-out north London computer auction, that competitive juices still run strongly even in the newest of business niches. Inside, over 400 people were bidding Pounds 10 or so for recycled software and anything up to Pounds 1,200 for nearly new high-powered PCs. Outside, rival south London auctioneers were leafleting the hundreds of parked cars with advertising copy. Alas for their efforts, the north London team were following them round, removing the ads from each and every car. Technology's all very well, but when it comes to commercial success, you can't beat plain old aggression.</p>

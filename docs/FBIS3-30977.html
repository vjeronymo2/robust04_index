			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.Cz. and E.K.: "After Cabinet Crisis; Budget </F> Will Be the Test"]    [Text] It is quite possible that, despite the  coalition compromise, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] will not  take a unanimous stand in the voting on the budget. The  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] in turn says that it will impose  complete club discipline. According to the SLD, introducing  voting discipline within the PSL is exclusively Waldemar  Pawlak's business. It is hard to tell to what extent the  behavior of some Sejm deputies for the PSL is just a game under  which they will vote in favor of the government's budget draft  anyway.  <H5>  The PSL Keeps Playing </H5>   "Voting on the budget will be political, it will be about  the  stability of the governing coalition, and it will be a test of  the PSL's and the SLD's abilities to jointly work out a  compromise-based economic program," says the PSL's Janusz  Piechocinski. Despite the fact that the governing coalition's  leaders have obliged themselves to jointly support the  government budget draft, the PSL Sejm deputies of the Sejm  Agricultural Commission continue to demand an increase in  agricultural expenditures by 10 trillion zlotys [Z]. The  commission adopted a proposal for such an amendment as early as  two weeks ago. The commission's chairman, the PSL's Roman  Jagielinski, defends the pproach: "I will not change my view  because I am bound by a decision by the commission and by the  PSL Chief Council [no closing quotation as published]. As early  as December, the Chief Council imposed an obligation on its  members who are Sejm deputies to increase the budget means for  agriculture by Z4 trillion, out of which, let us recall here,  half has already been taken into account in the government's  budget draft. The Sejm Agriculture Commission is demanding an  additional Z10 trillion; it says there is a necessity to  increase subsidies from the budget for more areas linked to  agriculture, among them banks. Jagielinski explains that the  contradiction between a statement by the prime minister (PSL  chief) and the position taken by the Sejm Agriculture Commission  is caused by a lack of an information policy inside the PSL.  The issue of supporting the government's budget draft was not  discussed with the PSL authorities, not even on the eve of the  coalition summit, during which leaders of both parties obliged  themselves to jointly support the budget draft that had been  submitted.    Jagielinski allows for the possibility of a division within  the PSL Deputies Club during the vote on the budget, even if  clubwide discipline is introduced. Other PSL members are also  talking about a lack of consultation on the issue between the  PSL authorities and the Sejm deputies. "It is not known to what  extent the demands for increases in budgetary expenditures are  the PSL's tactical maneuver and to what extent the maneuver has  been agreed upon with the coalition partner," Piechocinski says.  Both parties could be eager to convince the electorate that  they fought till the end to keep election promises. Lack of  budget means could be a good explanation for consenting to the  government's version.    But the SLD regards adopting the budget in the government's  version as a principle from which the party has no intention of  deviating. According to assurances coming out of the SLD  Deputies Club, there will be a discipline enforced during the  vote. SLD leaders do not expect Sejm deputies for the  All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement to break away from the voting.  The trade unionists' moods should be calmed by shifts of  individual items within the budget and by devoting these means  for social goals and for professional activation of the  unemployed.  <H5>  Left Wing Gathers Strength </H5>   It is not known whether the coalition's stability and  durability will be affected by an amendment submitted by the  Sejm Ownership Transformations Commission to "Directions of  Privatizations" contained in the budget. The amendment  introduces greater supervision by the Sejm over privatization of  economic enterprises in strategic branches. That provision is  also included in the coalition agreement, but, according to some  of the Sejm deputies for the SLD, it is so flexible that it is  hard to predict what the provision will mean in practice. If  Sejm deputies impose too strict a control on measures undertaken  by the ownership transformations minister, that could become  another reason for a deteriorating situation in the government  and the coalition.    After the Cabinet crisis, which has been perceived as the  SLD's loss, Aleksander Kwasniewski's closest associates went on  unscheduled vacations. Until the return of the SLD leader from  Lillehammer, which is supposed to be in the middle of next week,  they were "forbidden to go within 100 meters of the Sejm  building." Only sessions by individual commissions are supposed  to be an alleviating circumstance for those who disobey.    Sejm deputies for the SLD announce that, after they are back  from their vacations, they will begin negotiations.</p>

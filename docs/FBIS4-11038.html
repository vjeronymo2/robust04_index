			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- Czech Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus, who is making a state visit to our country, and  [Economy Minister] Domingo Cavallo -- in his capacity as acting  foreign minister -- today signed two memoranda of understanding.    The first memorandum pertains to political consultations,  while the second provides for the initiation of talks leading up  to the signature of a free trade agreement between both nations.    The memoranda were signed during a ceremony at the Economy  Ministry attended by Czech Ambassador Ianko Peki, Vice Foreign  Minister Fernando Petrella, Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos,  Horacio Liendo, the legal, technical, and administrative  coordination secretary, and Transport Secretary Edmundo Soria.    In the absence of Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Cavallo  remarked that the political and economic transformation of the  former socialist state has been "very successful." He envisaged  that this would open up greater possibilities for cooperation  between the two countries.    He pointed out that upon Klaus' own initiative, both  countries will start negotiations on the liberalization of  bilateral trade and the possibility of channeling trade through  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the bloc made up of  the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, which have  already signed a free trade agreement.    Negotiations are also under way between the Argentine and  Czech Governments to reach an agreement on the elimination of  visa requirements, investment guarantees, and doing away with  double taxation.</p>

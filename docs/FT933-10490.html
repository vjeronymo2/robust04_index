			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / When high-tech becomes high-risk: IoD case studies of disastrous damage to company computersy SECURITY SHOULD be a significant boardroom issue, and too many companies put it low on their list of priorities, says the Institute of Directors. The institute says in a booklet that businesses depend so heavily on information technology systems that any failure can be disastrous, unless provision is made in advance to deal with it. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the institute, says several factors have made companies more vulnerable and more aware of risks to their security: 'The rise of crime - from major fraud to vandalism and petty theft  -poses a continuous threat to the business community,' he says. 'The advance of technology and the vast expansion of its use has laid many open to severe disruption and losses due to error, malfunction and malicious intervention. The increasing use of highly combustible substances, not only in manufacturing but in office decor, increases the risk of fire.' The most common physical threat to IT systems is power failure, says Mr Tony Elbra of the National Computing Centre. He says a survey in 1991 showed that the average cost of a power failure was Pounds 9,000 and the highest cost was Pounds 30,000. 'Hoverspeed, which relies on advance bookings for its ferry service, was unable to accept any booking or inquiries for the duration of a power cut,' he says. 'Sometimes power failures can drag on for days if the failure causes damage to the equipment.' The booklet, sponsored by Digital Equipment Company, says fire and flood, although relatively rare, pose two of the more dramatic threats to IT systems, which are readily damaged by smoke. Two recent fires, at Digital Equipment and at Mercantile Credit, illustrated how quickly the devastation could spread. Both buildings were rated in the highest category of fire protection, yet a large proportion of each was destroyed within a short time. The booklet adds: 'Preventative measures, such as halon gas flooding, are not always useful against a conflagration. More than half the fires affecting computer installations start outside the computer room. They affect the computer installation only when they burn through the wall and allow the halon to escape.' Mr Elbra says arson is the most common cause of fires that start in the computer installations themselves. Floods were often thought of as rare events, because cloudbursts and rivers overflowing do not occur frequently. But last summer's flash floods in the south of France caused serious damage at the computer installations of a leading bank. Many floods were caused by dripping taps or blocked drains. If these happen over a holiday weekend, it could be five days before they are discovered. The booklet says: 'Mainframe computers are often sited in basements and their power cables placed under the floor. With the power supply being at the lowest point of the building, it does not take much water leakage to cause a failure. In one installation, a burst pipe caused a week's interruption of processing; the long-term cost of this incident was estimated at Pounds 1m.' The 1991 National Computing Centre survey estimated that the total amount lost in the UK each year due to IT security breaches was more than Pounds 1bn. The risk of 'hacking' - unwarranted access - was faced by every organisation that allowed people to dial into its systems. The average cost of each hacking incident reported was Pounds 23,000, with a maximum of Pounds 50,000. Computer viruses - rogue programmes - are described as facts of life which companies have to learn to deal with. The average cost of a virus was estimated to range from Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 50,000. Mr Jim Bates, a computer consultant, says a little awareness can greatly reduce risk. 'Educate yourself and your staff about the threat that they pose,' he says. 'Equip yourself with at least two different but reliable anti-virus packages and ensure that they are installed and used properly.' Professor Peter Hammersley, at City University's department of business computing in London, points out that confidential data is being carried in portable computers, which can easily be mislaid or stolen. The loss of a portable computer carrying personal data - such as details of individual customers - could render the employer liable under the Data Protection Act. The booklet also looks at risk management, protecting the office environment and the vetting of potential employees or business partners. Mr Morgan says: 'Preventative measures can save more than just those assets that can be valued in monetary terms - not least in boosting morale among a workforce that is aware of its employer's commitment to creating a secure environment.' EXAMPLES 'A security guard sought fame by starting a fire and then extinguishing it. All the CO fire extinguishers in the area had previously been emptied by night staff using them to create fizzy drinks. By the time the guard found a charged extinguisher, the fire was out of control.' 'Most computer viruses are very badly written and cause system malfunction almost as soon as they arrive. Contrary to popular opinion, their authors are not whiz-kids or super-brains. In fact if any of them ever became plumbers we would all probably drown within a week.' 'A fire and subsequent flood at a finance company destroyed every item of information technology equipment, including mainframes, minicomputers and personal computers. The immediate cost was Pounds 8m, but the long-term cost was reckoned to be in excess of Pounds 24m.' Director's Guide to Business Security.

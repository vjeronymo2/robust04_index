			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AT SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Ian Marantz's misinformed stance on University of California admissions  policies (Letters, Dec. 27) sadly represents the widespread belief that  Asian-Americans are considered "affirmative action" students.  </P> <P> At UC Irvine and at all UC campuses, only African-American, Native American and  Latino applicants fall under the affirmative action program.  </P> <P> As an intermediate step toward an equal-opportunity society, affirmative action  aims to "balance the ethnic imbalances" that institutions have created to  ensure that under-represented students are not rejected admission because of  their color.  </P> <P> One reason Asian-Americans are well represented at UC Irvine and also  ineligible for affirmative action is their accomplishment in proving their  academic worth despite all the discriminatory barriers that still exist in  society.  </P> <P> But now the UC system is turning its back on meritocracy by refusing admission  to qualified Asian-American students.  </P> <P> Marantz claims that UC Irvine discriminates against white Americans while  reserving spots for Asian-Americans. How can that be when white and Asian  students are theoretically admitted under just one criterion -- merit? Yet  current admission policies prove this untrue.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Asians, UC admissions officials are fusing personal merit and  skin color. Regrettably, the latter wins out in the dominant society, even  today.  </P> <P> UC admissions now overtly embraces discrimination, once again, in favor of  whites. By reserving places for white students while rejecting qualified  (sometimes more qualified) Asian applicants, the university is throwing  meritocracy out the window.  </P> <P> Let's not revert to the discriminatory sins. Instead, the aim should be a  color-blind society based upon individual merit.  </P> <P> JANET OTSUKI  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An Angolan official has visited the southern British  port of Plymouth to inspect an impounded German freighter  carrying weapons bound for the southern African country. The  representative of the Angolan Embassy in London has expressed  concern that more than 20 tanks with artillery pieces on board  were for rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola] forces. The UNITA rebels are currently waging war to  oust the elected government of Angolan President Jose Eduardo  Dos Santos.    On Wednesday customs officials making a routine check of the  freighter (Nora Hiren) discovered the arms hidden under  tarpaulin. The ship's cargo was declared as farm equipment. The  Angolan representative says he will be making a full report to  brief the Angolan Government on the situation. A British  Foreign Office spokesman says there is no embargo on the export  of arms to the Angolan government, but one is in effect on UNITA  forces. Officials, however, say it is unclear if the weapons are  for UNITA or the Angolan Government army.</p>

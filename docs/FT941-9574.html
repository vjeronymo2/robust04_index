			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Dominick Hunter comes to market with Pounds 60m tag Dominick Hunter, an engineering group which claims to be a world leader in filtration products, is expected to come to the market next month with an estimated value of about Pounds 60m. The group, based near Newcastle, has a dominant role in the UK compressed air filter market, and exports more than 60 per cent of sales to 40 countries. Last year the company made operating profits of more than Pounds 4.7m on turnover of about Pounds 30m. Founded in 1963, Dominick Hunter was acquired during the 1970s by Walter Alexander, the Scottish-based conglomerate which was floated in 1976 and the subject of a Pounds 43m management buy-out in 1990. The buy-out team raised Pounds 12m from peripheral disposals and in 1992 sold the original Walter Alexander business, which makes bus bodies in Falkirk, to its management for Pounds 7.4m. In spite of the changes in ownership, senior management of Dominick Hunter has remained largely the same with average service between 10 and 20 years. The group employs about 550 people, mainly in the north-east of England, although it has sales offices in the US, Europe, Japan and China. Mr Brian Thompson, chairman, said the flotation would strengthen the group's highly leveraged balance sheet and allow further expansion of the group's manufacturing and sales operations. About 75 per cent of the turnover is industrial products, which are used to purify and dry compressed air and gases. The group also makes membranes and filter cartridges for air sterilisation and liquid filtration, used in the production of mineral waters, wines, spirits and pharmaceuticals. Last month Dominick Hunter paid Pounds 1.7m for Nitrox, a manufacturer of nitrogen generation equipment with annual sales of Pounds 1m, which it will merge with its newly developed business in this area. Mr Thomson said: 'At the high-efficiency end of the market in which we operate we see continuing growth in demand and believe we are now well placed to expand our markets, particularly overseas.' Institutional investors, including Standard Life, Postel, Granville Private Equity, NatWest Ventures and Dunedin, hold about 75 per cent of the group's share capital, the executive management owns 15 per cent and the balance is held by 85 individual shareholders. The flotation, expected in mid-March, will be sponsored by Granville and Company, with NatWest Wood Mackenzie acting as brokers.</p>

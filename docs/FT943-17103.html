			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Kinkel signals softer line on BSE Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, yesterday called for a 'European solution' in the row over UK beef sales to Germany, signalling a more conciliatory line. Speaking in London during a day of talks with the British government, Mr Kinkel said Bonn's planned move to ban British beef imports would not take effect for at least six months even if approved. The measure, caused by German fears about BSE or 'mad cow disease', is due to be discussed in the Bundesrat on July 8. The Bundesrat's health committee yesterday recommended a limited ban but used wording which would allow the government not to implement the order if it saw fit. Mr Kinkel's statement was interpreted by the British Foreign Office as an attempt to ease Anglo-German differences over BSE. It was also accompanied by fresh signs that the two countries are making progress in efforts to choose the next president of the European Commission by the deadline of July 15 set by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said there was a 'reasonable chance' of meeting the deadline. Officials said Mr Kinkel discussed a compromise list of candidates with Mr Hurd and Mr John Major, the prime minister. Meanwhile, the UK government underlined it is taking seriously possible dangers from BSE. The list of products which may not be used in human and animal food because of the danger is to be extended to include certain parts of young calves. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said yesterday the risk was minuscule, but the government had adopted a policy of extreme caution. Tests had been conducted on mice with offal from calves fed large amounts of BSE-infected brain tissue. These had shown it was possible to transmit BSE from the calves to the mice. She stressed that the government's chief medical officer, Dr Kenneth Calman, continued to advise there was 'no evidence whatsoever' that BSE caused Creutzfeld Jakob disease, the form of BSE which affects humans.</p>

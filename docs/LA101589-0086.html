			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE CALLS FOR DOMESTIC THREATS  </P> <P> Yocum is both right and wrong. She is right in saying that battered persons  should leave the abuser and prosecute him (or her) to the fullest. She is  right: Courts should punish abusers quickly and severely. But, Yocum is wrong  about police not being able to respond to a call like Maria's. If Maria's  father had been a county supervisor, or a movie star, or a police officer  wouldn't they have come? And, isn't a life more important than a drug bust or a  robbery -- even one in progress?  </P> <P> Maybe the ultimate answer is one women must make themselves: Stop getting  linked-up with brutal, immature men.  </P> <P> JOYCE CAWLEY  </P> <P> South Laguna  </P></p>

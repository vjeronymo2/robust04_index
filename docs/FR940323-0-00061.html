			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (g)(1) Determine the projects in which participants will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve and establish minimum qualifications that individuals must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet to be eligible to participate in the program; these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications may vary based on the specific tasks to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed by participants. Regardless of the educational level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or background of participants sought, programs are encouraged to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> select individuals who posses leadership potential and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment to the goals of the AmeriCorps program. In any case,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs must select participants in a non-partisan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-political, non-discriminatory manner, ensuring fair access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation. In addition, programs are required to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they do not displace any existing paid employees as provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 2540 of this chapter. To this end, programs may not select  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any prospective participant who is or was previously employed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a prospective project sponsors within six months of the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment in the program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In addition, all programs are required to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any pre-service orientation or training period requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the Corporation to assist in the selection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motivated participants. Finally, all programs must agree to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> select a percentage (to be determined by the Corporation) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the participants for the program from among prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants recruited by the Corporation or State Commissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under part 2532 of this chapter. The Corporation may also specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a minimum percentage of participants to be selected from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national leadership pool established under &sect;2522.210(c). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation may vary either percentage for different types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AmeriCorps programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Provide reasonable accommodation, including auxiliary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aids and services (as defined in section 3(1) of the Americans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102(1)) based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individualized need of a participant who is a qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual with a disability (as defined in section 101(8) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such Act (42 U.S.C. 12111(8)). For the purpose of complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision, AmeriCorps programs may apply for additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial assistance from the Corporation pursuant to &sect;2524.40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this chapter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Use service experiences to help participants achieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skills and education needed for productive, active citizenship,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the provision, if appropriate, of structured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities for participants to reflect on their service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiences. In addition, all programs must encourage every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participant who is eligible to vote to register prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing a term of service;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Provide participants in the program with the training,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skills, and knowledge necessary to perform the tasks required in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their respective projects, including, if appropriate, specific training in a particular field and background information on the community, including why the service projects are needed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Provide support services_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To participants who are completing a term of service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making the transition to other educational and career opportunities; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To those participants who are school dropouts in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assist them in earning the equivalent of a high school diploma;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Ensure that participants serving in approved AmeriCorps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positions receive the living allowance and other benefits described in &sect;&sect;2522.240 through 2522.250 of this chapter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Describe the manner in which the AmeriCorps educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awards will be apportioned among individuals serving in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. If a program proposes to provide such benefits to less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 100 percent of the participants in the program, the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must provide a compelling rationale for determining which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants will receive the benefits and which participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not. AmeriCorps programs are strongly encouraged to offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative post-service benefits to participants who will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive AmeriCorps educational awards, however AmeriCorps grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds may not be used to provide such benefits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) Agree to identify the program, through the use of logos,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common application materials, and other means (to be specified by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Corporation), as part of a larger national effort and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in other activities such as common opening ceremonies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including the administration of a national oath or affirmation),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service days, and conferences designed to promote a national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identity for all AmeriCorps programs and participants, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those participants not receiving AmeriCorps educational awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision does not preclude an AmeriCorps program from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing to use its own name as the primary identification, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from using its name, logo, or other identifying materials on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uniforms or other items;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o) Agree to begin terms of service at such times as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation may reasonably require and to comply with any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions the Corporation may establish as to when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program may take to fill an approved AmeriCorps position left  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vacant due to attrition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (p) Comply with all evaluation procedures specified by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, as explained in &sect;&sect;2522.500 through 2522.560;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (q) In the case of a program receiving funding directly from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Corporation, meet and consult with the State Commission for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State in which the program operates, if possible, and submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a copy of the program application to the State Commission; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (r) Address any other requirements as specified by the Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=3 --> &sect;2522.110  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=3 --> What types of programs are eligible to compete for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AmeriCorps grants?

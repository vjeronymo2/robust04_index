			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Costain applies to courts COSTAIN, the UK construction group, has asked the US Federal Court and the High Court in the UK to dismiss proceedings designed to prevent it from selling its Australian coal mining business to a higher bidder. This follows legal moves to prevent Costain from selling the business to Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank. Peabody Holding, the US-based coal-mining subsidiary of Hanson, the UK conglomerate, has asked the US courts to enforce an earlier agreement which would have allowed it to buy the New South Wales coal mines. Altus earlier this month agreed to pay Dollars 245m (Pounds 162m) for the mining operations and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property interests. This compares with an offer of Dollars 200m from Peabody for just the coal mining business.</p>

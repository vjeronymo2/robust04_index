			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R.A. Aliyev and G.A. Mamedova (Azerbaydzhan </F> State Petroleum Academy, Baku, Azerbaydzhan) under the ``System  Control Using Incomplete Information'' rubric]    [Abstract] The objective of the article is to develop  methods for identification and optimum control of fuzzy systems  and using the methods in an existing coking process. Equations  for identification of fuzzy functional and dynamic systems are  derived. Theorems on the exact solution of fuzzy equations are  given (without proof). Equations describing optimum control of  fuzzy dynamic systems are presented. The results were used for  identification and optimum control of a coking process  (processing of heavy residual oil for producing oil coke). The  method proposed for systems described with fuzzy difference  equations is based on minimizing a fuzzy functional using  regular and expanded arithmetics operations. To solve  identification problems for systems described with fuzzy  relational equations it is proposed to use an identification  method based on exact solution of fuzzy relational equations.  The method for optimum control of systems with a fuzzy criterion  is based on modification of a fuzzy analog of the dynamic  programming method for deterministic systems with fuzzy control  restrictions. The proposed method was used for developing a  fuzzy model of the coking process and for stating and solving  the problem of termination control of the coking process.  References 6</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korean experts to visit  Vienna for talks on replacing fuel rods in a nuclear reactor,  the agency announced Wednesday [11 May].    In addition, agency inspectors would visit North Korea "in  the next few days" if the replacement of the rods in the Yonbyon  reactor was postponed, the IAEA said in a statement.    U.S. officials say the change of fuel rods could provide  enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear weapons.    The IAEA has been insisting on not only witnessing the fuel  change but also on sampling the used fuel to determine whether  the Stalinist country has diverted fissile material for weapons.    IAEA director general Hans Blix proposed to North Korean  Foreign Minister Kim Young-Nam in a telex message that North  Korea send a team of experts to Vienna to discuss these measures  and the timetable for replacement of the rods, the statement  said.    "In the meantime, on the assumption that the core discharge  is deferred, the IAEA proposes to send an inspection team in the  next few days."    "This team is to carry out the activities which the IAEA was  not able to implement during the inspection in March at the  reprocessing plant."    Blix reaffirmed in the telex that it was very important to  take samples from the fuel rods of a five-megawatt nuclear  reactor at Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of  Pyongyang, to measure their radioactivity levels.    But the IAEA chief suggested that the actual testing of the  fuel rods could be carried out "in the second half of this  year," a spokesman for South Korea's foreign ministry said in  Seoul.    The Blix message was an answer to the North Korean foreign  minister's proposal on Friday that Pyongyang could negotiate  with the IAEA over nuclear inspections and the presence of  monitors to witness the fuel replacement.    The Blix message was made public in Seoul following  unconfirmed South Korean press reports that Washington had  agreed to resume high-level talks with North Korea in return for  the sampling of the fuel rods at a later date.    The IAEA also said its team could finish inspecting a  radiochemical laboratory, from which IAEA inspectors were barred  by North Koreans last March, and check surveillance equipments  at various nuclear facilities.    In Vienna, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the inspectors  could  leave for North Korea any time from Saturday if the response  from Pyongyang was positive.</p>

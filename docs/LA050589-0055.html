			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL MEMBERS GET BERNSON'S-EYE VIEW OF DISTRICT DURING TOUR  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson took seven council colleagues on a field trip through  the north San Fernando Valley Thursday, showing them good, bad and  controversial venues in his district.  </P> <P> The council members and several city department heads settled in big tour bus  seats and listened to Bernson, with microphone in hand, explain his position on  issues such as the Porter Ranch development area and the Bryant Street-Vanalden  Avenue neighborhood redevelopment.  </P> <P> For several council members, the daylong tour was the first time they had seen  the controversial projects, which they have either voted on in the past or will  make critical decisions about in the future.  </P> <P> "No one's offered me a tour like this before," said Ruth Galanter, a first-term  councilwoman who represents Westchester, Venice and Crenshaw communities. "This  is important because we each represent districts that are so different, but the  problems such as traffic and development are generic throughout the city."  </P> <P> One of the longest stops was at Porter Ranch, where a plan to develop the  pristine rolling hills into a major $2-billion residential and commercial city  center is at the forefront of public debate.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles city Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the master  plan for the 1,300-acre Chatsworth site May 11. The development plan will go  next to the council's Planning and Environment Committee, which Bernson chairs,  and then to the full City Council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Endorses Plan  </P> <P> Standing before his colleagues, Bernson endorsed the plan as "in balance and  reasonable," adding that he supports a 20% cut in the project's commercial area  from 7.5 million square feet to about 6 million.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills developer Nathan Shapell also is seeking to build 2,195  single-family houses and 800 condominiums on the site over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> "The biggest crime will be to allow this to be developed piecemeal," Bernson  said.  </P> <P> Galanter and Councilman Michael Woo, another tour participant, are both members  of the council's powerful Planning and Environment Committee. Neither had seen  the site before. They said they have not yet studied the plan in detail.  </P> <P> Galanter, an environmentalist who was elected on a wave of slow-growth  sentiment, said that evaluating the Porter Ranch plan "will be a challenge. I  was standing there trying to imagine those hills covered with buildings."  </P> <P> After viewing the site, Woo said it is enormous.  </P> <P> "I had no sense of it before this," he said.  </P> <P> Lunch was served at the lavish Mediterranean-style mansion of Ray Mulokas,  president of the 60-home Monteria Estates Assn. and a member of Bernson's  citizen advisory committee on the Porter Ranch development proposal. The  committee has endorsed the proposal.  </P> <P> During the tour, Bernson said mini-malls and corner businesses with tiny  parking lots are bad. One venue on his "Points of Interest" map was the  hamburger stand at Balboa Boulevard and Lassen Street.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, this is extremely popular," Bernson said, "Traffic backs up all  along Balboa."  </P> <P> When the entourage stopped to walk through the Bryant-Vanalden neighborhood in  Northridge, the city's largest housing rehabilitation project, Bernson heaped  praise on his efforts that transformed "some of the worst slums in L.A." into  an "ornate gated community."  </P> <P> Council members walked through vacant and occupied units that were newly  renovated and through a vandalized unit.  </P> <P> They were not shown an example of one of the 160 units that the city Community  Development Department cited two months ago for slum-like conditions. The city  ordered the developer, Devinder (Dave) Vadehra, to repair the units, or the  city will do so at his expense.  </P> <P> Ralph Esparza, Community Development Department housing director, said his  office is inspecting the units and preparing a final audit of the project.  </P> <P> The tour was not unique. In 1981, council members took monthly tours to  different districts. Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, whose district stretches  from San Pedro to Watts, said that was the last time she had journeyed to the  opposite end of the city.  </P> <P> "So much comes before the council, it's good when you can at least visualize  some of the places," Flores said.  </P> <P> Also attending the tour were council members Joel Wachs, Joy Picus, John  Ferraro and Marvin Braude.  </P></p>

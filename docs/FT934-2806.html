			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo rally on US news A barrage of adverse press comment following the resignation of Lord Rees as chairman of Lasmo and the continued weakness in crude oil prices produced the expected sharp fall in Lasmo shares. However, this was countered late in the session by news that some US investors have continued to increase their holdings in the stock. At their worst yesterday, Lasmo shares fell to 97p, easily their lowest level since January 1987, with institutions said to be baling out of the stock after strong indications that the final dividend, expected in March, would be cut, and with the market increasingly concerned at the poor performance of oil prices. These languished below Dollars 14 a barrel yesterday as the oil market continued to react to the forecast by Sheikh Yamani, the former Saudi oil minister, that oil prices could fall below Dollars 10 a barrel in the new year. However, a strong rally developed in Lasmo shares below the 100p mark, with sentiment given a big boost by news, issued just before the close of trading, that Capital Group, a California-based US investment company, had increased its stake in Lasmo to 4.67 per cent, or just over 35m shares. US investors have been strong buyers of Lasmo shares this year despite the oil company's well-publicised problems. Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management has also been a strong supporter of the stock in recent months, increasing its stake in Lasmo to around 11 per cent by the end of November. By the close Lasmo had rallied to end the session a net 5 off at 104p. Turnover totalled 13m shares.</p>

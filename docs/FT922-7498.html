			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Pension law statement DETAILS OF the government's review of pension law will be announced soon, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said yesterday. Ministers promised a thorough look at the operation of pension funds in the wake of the Maxwell scandal. On BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Mr Lilley said: 'I will be announcing in a matter of weeks the details of that review.' Among the issues to be considered in the review would be whether pension funds belonged to employers or employees and the legal framework of pension funds, including the role of trustees. It was 'certainly conceivable' there would be new legislation following the review.</p>

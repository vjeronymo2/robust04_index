			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Nation Radio Newspaper" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today President Chamorro decided to delay an  official working trip to Carazo because of demonstrations by  striking drivers. She had planned to visit Carazo, where  drivers began demonstrations this morning. President Chamorro  had been scheduled to inaugurate a few paved streets, some  remodeled schools, and visit San Sebastian Basilica.    Just after 0800, Carazo joined the transportation strike as  more than 100 taxi drivers blocked the roads coming out of  Jinotepe, which affected 95 taxi routes in the department.    Currently, the government is meeting with four  transportation  sector organizations at the Presidency. Only two chambers and  two federations that are members of the National Transportation  Council, which was created by a government initiative, are  attending the meeting. The drivers are discussing problems such  as the increase in fuel prices and the repeal of laws and  ministry resolutions that establish new taxes.    At noon today, the Los Parrales-Vallejos group of the  National Transportation Commission broke off negotiations with  the Chamorro Government. The strike is gaining strength.  Drivers have incited violence and tension in some main streets  of the capital. Since this morning, the union of taxicab  drivers has deployed vehicles and sparked demonstrators in  places such as the Senderi, Repustula 15, and Rubenia  neighborhoods and in the Ivan Montenegro Market. Armed with  knives, taxi drivers have punctured the tires of those taxis  that have dared to continue their regular operations.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Corporate theories reversed as demerger trend gathers pace COURTAULDS Textiles' demerger from Courtaulds in March 1990 was 'the best thing we ever did,' says Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles. In the following two years the shares of both parts of the Courtaulds business outperformed the stock market. The fashion to demerge reverses corporate theories about conglomeration and diversification. Although not new - for instance Bowater split its US paper-making side from its UK industrial business in 1984 - the urge to demerge has been getting stronger. There are two prime arguments for it. First, a company which was perhaps subsumed in a big group could blossom once its management is freed of the constraints of being part of a big group. Mr Taylor says that most companies are too big to be managed effectively. The parts should be comprehensible to its senior management, he argues. Second is the argument that 'the whole is worth less than the sum of the parts' - the opposite of the conglomerate theory. Unbundling, as Sir James Goldsmith called it, can reveal hidden treasures in a company. A trade buyer could be found which had a higher opinion of a subsidiary's value. Or a flotation could be arranged. Once exposed to the outside world a formerly neglected subsidiary's true worth might be seen by investors. The stock market value of the two companies could be higher than they were before separation. That was the hope behind demerger moves at Racal, the electronics group. When Racal floated its telecommunications business in 1988 it retained an 80 per cent stake. Racal was horrified to discover afterwards that its own shares sometimes traded at less than the per share value of its stake in Racal Telecom. The solution was to give the rest of the Telecom shares to Racal shareholders, renaming the company Vodafone at the same time. Extra value was created for investors. Racal hopes to perform the same trick again with its Chubb security business in the autumn. Like Racal, and even ICI, BAT Industries was inspired to demerge some of its businesses when it came under threat of a takeover bid. The assailant in BAT's case was Sir James. In common with potential bidders for Racal and ICI, he was fended off. BAT, the tobacco and financial services giant, went on to give away shares in Argos, its retail chain, and Wiggins Teape Appleton, its paper company to shareholders. Without knowing how a company's shares would have performed without demerging, it is hard to say whether value is enhanced in the longer term. The Courtaulds example is one of the simplest of demergers to track. It involved handing out one free share in the textile company for every four shares held in Courtaulds. A special dividend was also paid. In BAT's case the parent company's shares had been boosted by the threatened bid before the demergers and that bid premium disappeared afterwards. The sharp rise in ICI's share price after the demerger plan was announced suggests that its shareholders believe there will be a longer term benefit to them of the company's split.</p>

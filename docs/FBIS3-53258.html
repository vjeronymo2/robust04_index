			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, today paid a visit to the  Ibb Governorate where he was received by the acting governor,  officials, leading figures, representatives of political parties  and organizations, tribal chiefs, and a large crowd of citizens.    Immediately upon arrival in Ibb, Salih met in the  governorate's center with the brother officials in the  governorate, the ulema, leading figures, and representatives of  the political parties and organizations as well as mass  organizations in the governorate.    In the meeting, Salih noted that his visit to Ibb this time  differs from his previous visit because it comes amid this  regrettable crisis. He said: I highly appreciate what I heard  today from the orators and poets whose sincere speeches came  from their hearts, reflecting the pain of our people because of  this crisis which has been going on since 19 August 1993. We  were expecting to begin a new year and to leave behind the  previous year with all its tragedies and its political, social,  and economic mistakes, and turn over a new leaf. The crisis is  not among the united Yemeni people but is a crisis of confidence  among certain leaderships that pursue their own interests to the  detriment of public interests. There are some who speak of the  masses and their problems while at the same time trying to  realize personal gains. I say that we must uphold the interests  of the homeland and rise above the interests of the rulers and  officials in all centers and departments and on all levels.    The president said: Unity was realized because of the  struggle by all the Yemenis. It is not just a gain for Yemen  but a gain for the entire Arab nation. Unity has brought  together the one Yemeni family. We had hoped that some of our  colleagues and comrades in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  leadership would be logical and reasonable and would let  dialogue prevail rather than allowing other options to prevail.  We hope that the Dialogue Committee will carry out its  responsibility and speedily end its discussion of the problems  and points on its agenda in order to enable the country to come  out of the current impasse instead of this delay and waste of  time. The conditions in the country are getting worse and the  citizens conditions are deteriorating. There is a plan to  create unrest among the citizens and to instigate riots and  sabotage similar to what happened on 9 and 10 December 1992.  There are those who are planning for the return to the old  partition system, which we buried on 22 May 1990.    Salih said: All noble and sincere voices must be raised and  all the forces, organizations, and political parties must oppose  those who call for returning to the past. They must say: No to  partition, yes to unity and peaceful dialogue, yes to security,  stability, and peace.    Salih said: We must remember our people's suffering during  the partition, especially in this governorate, Ibb, which  suffered so much from the afflictions of partition. As  officials, we must remember the suffering of our people. We  must remember the poor and the powerless who are suffering  because of the rise in prices as a result of the expanding and  escalating crisis. The voice of right must be raised to tell  the wrongdoer: You have erred. The problem is not the problem  of 'Ali ['Abdallah Salih] and 'Ali [Salim al-Bid] but is  connected with the responsibility of those who do not want our  people to come out of this crisis, this affliction.    We have made concessions and given our consent to all the  proposed solutions and showed ourselves to be keen on finding a  quick way out of this crisis, whose origins our people know full  well -- the people behind it, and those who stand to gain from  it.    We have consented to all the points and demands made by our  partners -- the YSP -- and have responded to the ulema's call to  put things right. If I knew that any concessions on my part  would keep my country and its unity from going down a hazardous  and slippery road I would do it. The one thing that remains for  me to do is to offer to resign my post as head of state --  something I am prepared to do for the sake of keeping the unity  intact. If that is the problem, let brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid  or the YSP come forward.    The chairman of the Presidential Council reviewed numerous  issues and developments on the national scene, indicating that  he intimated his approval of the system of local government and  the enactment of legislation to regulate it so as to ensure  decentralization and curb centralization. But the provincial  system demanded by some amounts to a scheme to carve the country  into mini-states and sultanates. We have united the Yemeni  family and we should rally it together. So, how can we accept  taking steps backward? We will not be responsible for  sacrificing unity and will not allow infighting. We stand for  responsible and objective dialogue. He pointed to certain  erroneous practices that have been detrimental to unity and to  the problems that have befallen the interim period. From this  place, I call on brothers of the YSP to engage in dialogue,  notwithstanding all the statements made against the president by  some of its officials. I am an understanding person. To all of  them I now say: May God forgive you. Let us turn over a new  leaf and rise above our personal concerns, and work for the sake  of our people's and country's supreme interests. I also call on  the population of the Ibb Governorate and all our countrymen to  help us maintain security, stability, peace, and unity.    Meanwhile, speeches made at the meeting expressed our  people's anxiety over the political crisis our country is going  through and the deep negative impact it has had on the citizens'  economic, social, and psychological well-being. The speakers  urged the political leadership to work to find quick solutions  to this crisis, which is beginning to pose a threat to the  homeland and the unity of the people who have made generous  sacrifices for its sake. They emphasized that the Yemeni  masses, who have been unstinting in their sacrifices for the  sake of unity, are willing to make further sacrifices to  preserve the homeland's unity and defend the gains of the  revolution. The speakers urged the political leadership to be  receptive to the call of the masses, submit to reason and the  country's supreme interests, get together to work out a solution  to this crisis, and address its repercussions.    The meeting also heard a statement issued by the  governorate's population, which urged a reactivation of the  government's various institutions so that they may discharge  their national duties free of party, regional, personal, or  confessional affiliations. They called for all violators of the  duties and functions of public office to be called to account.</p>

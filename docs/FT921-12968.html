			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Food aid 'may cut US subsidy bill' A US congressman who has been organising a Democratic response to pleas for food aid from the former Soviet republics is arguing that a humanitarian response will mean the US government will need to pay less in production subsidies to American farmers. President Bush is expected to seek more money for farm subsidies in his 1993 budget. However, Congressman Dave Nagle, an Iowa Democrat, said new offers of aid could drive the market price of maize up 30 cents a bushel to Dollars 2.75 a bushel. 'This would wipe out the need to pay deficiency payments on corn,' he said. Ms Susan Keith, government relations representative with the US Corngrowers Association, said the government would probably have to pay about Dollars 1.5bn in 'deficiency payments' - production subsidies - for 1991 for maize because the price was below Dollars 2.75 a bushel. US maize sales to the former Soviet Union have plummeted because it can no longer afford to pay cash. The US sold about 16.5m tonnes to Moscow in 1989-90, but only 8.5m tonnes the next year. The downturn in exports does have an immediate budget impact, Ms Keith said. 'If we were selling maize to the Soviets at the level of two years ago, you would probably see a 30 cents price increase.' US wheat prices are above the Dollars 4 per bushel at which production subsidies must be paid. Stocks are quite low by historical standards, but Mr Barry Jenkins, a spokesman for US Wheatgrowers, said the 390m-400m bushels in stocks would make plenty of bread without a significant increase in prices. Cargill, in its January bulletin, notes that '1991 harvests were poor in much of the world, causing a record decline in production. Grain stocks are declining to pipeline levels.' Still, needs are great, particularly in the former Soviet republics and countries torn by war. 'Conditions are realigning to give US agriculture an opportunity like that of the early 1970s, to assist and trade at a time of need and to grow out of a number of its own problems and persistent stagnation,' Cargill says. Reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy could result in UK millers having to use imports to get the quality wheats needed for bread production, widening the food trade gap unnecessarily, the National Association of British and Irish Millers said yesterday. The reforms would encourage farmers to grow high yielding, lower quality grains irrespective of demand in order to maximise the guaranteed return which the intervention system offers.</p>

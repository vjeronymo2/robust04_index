			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECH PREMIER VOWS A COALITION GOVERNMENT;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: ADAMEC WILL SEEK TO DOWNGRADE OFFICIAL ROLE OF COMMUNISM. THE  OPPOSITION KEEPS UP PRESSURE FOR FREE ELECTIONS.  </P> <P> Faced with an opposition ultimatum, Czechoslovakia's Communist prime minister  promised Tuesday to form a new coalition government, including an unspecified  number of non-Communists, by next Sunday.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec also said he will submit to an emergency session  of the Parliament today a draft amendment that would eliminate from the  Czechoslovak constitution both its guarantee of the "leading role" of the  Communist Party and its commitment to Marxism-Leninism as the official state  ideology.  </P> <P> But the umbrella opposition group Civic Forum kept up its pressure, threatening  to move by year's end for dissolution of the new Cabinet as well, if it fails  to come up with an acceptable timetable for holding free elections and  introducing legal guarantees for a host of other human rights.  </P> <P> Civic Forum, which in only 10 days has mobilized virtually this entire nation  against its discredited Communist political leadership, also demanded:  </P> <P> That President Gustav Husak, the former party chief installed by Moscow after  the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion that ended an earlier drive for reform here  in 1968, resign his remaining, largely ceremonial post by Dec. 10.  </P> <P> That the authorities publicly condemn the 1968 invasion and appeal to the  Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact to also declare the intervention a violation  of international law.  </P> <P> And that the government disband so-called workers' militias -- Communist  loyalists who are issued firearms and serve as an extra military arm of the  party.  </P> <P> The latest developments added to the sense of amazement here over the lightning  speed with which the hard-line Communist system appears to be collapsing in  Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> "It took years in Poland, months in Hungary, weeks in East Germany, and here  it's taken days," said a Western diplomat of the extraordinary transformations  that have swept through Eastern Europe, posing new terms of reference on a  continent divided for more than 40 years by the Cold War.  </P> <P> However, Civic Forum strategist Jan Urban warned in an interview that despite  the breathtaking changes, the battle is not yet won.  </P> <P> "I see the next few days as the most risky period," Urban said, adding that the  opposition has "received many warning signals that the situation in the army is  very complicated and risky."  </P> <P> Urban said Civic Forum has information that much of Czechoslovakia's army has  been confined to barracks for the last 11 days, with no access to mail,  television or newspapers, while political officers "talk to them about the  possibility of civil war."  </P> <P> The danger of a military coup has increased, the activist added, because "the  leadership of this (Communist) Party doesn't control the situation; this  government doesn't control the situation; Civic Forum doesn't control the  situation. So the only organizational strength in the state is the army and the  security, and this is very, very risky, because they are tied so closely to the  old regime."  </P> <P> Urban said this weekend's summit meeting between Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev and President Bush is probably the greatest guarantee against  violence. The Czechoslovak army is closely integrated within the Warsaw Pact  structure and presumably could not be used against the democratic revolution  here without the knowledge of Gorbachev, who appears intent on improving  East-West relations.  </P> <P> Assurances Sought  </P> <P> However, the opposition takes its information seriously enough that it has  asked both the Socialist Youth Union, which has chapters in the armed forces,  and the prime minister's office to clarify the situation. Unless it is assured  by today that conditions in the military have been returned to normal, "our  best defense would probably be to launch a mass campaign to warn the public of  this (coup) possibility," Urban said.  </P> <P> Ironically, Tuesday's dramatic developments occurred on what was otherwise  probably the quietest day in Prague in nearly two weeks after Civic Forum  declared an end to the demonstrations that had drawn as many as 500,000  Czechoslovaks into the streets daily. The opposition group said it wants to  cool down the situation during negotiations with the government, knowing that  it can quickly mobilize the population again if the authorities balk at change.  </P> <P> "We want to celebrate, but everybody is so tired we're close to collapse," said  Eva Lnenickova, 22, one of the university students who ignited the political  firestorm engulfing the country. "We hope this week there will be a chance to  celebrate, because this is a great victory," she added after hearing about  Adamec's capitulation at a two-hour meeting with Civic Forum leaders earlier  Tuesday.  </P> <P> But student leaders said they will continue their strike until Adamec meets the  Sunday deadline to deliver on his promises.  </P> <P> "It was beautiful," said Petr Gajdos, 27, a scientific researcher, of the  government's latest concessions. "But it is not yet confirmed, and it is not  yet complete." Gajdos and half a dozen other young men were camped out at the  base of a statue of religious reformer Jan Hus in what their name badges  proclaimed to be the "Liberated Old Town Square."  </P> <P> Confirming Adamec's commitment to propose a new government, Marian Calfa, a  minister without portfolio who participated in Tuesday's negotiations,  described the atmosphere as "rather excited" because of the conflicting views  exchanged. But later, he said, the mood became more "constructive . . . in a  mutual endeavor to find possible ways out of the present political situation."  </P> <P> Calfa said the new Cabinet is to include "both non-party representatives and  representatives of other political parties, and at the same time, of course,  representatives of the Communist Party. It will be a government constituted  primarily of experts," he added.  </P> <P> Calfa refused to answer questions after reading a brief statement to  journalists, but Tuesday night, Civic Forum leader Vaclav Havel said that his  organization "is not and cannot be a political party," and that while it is  ready to consult with the prime minister on the new government's makeup, "in no  case will these demands have the form that representatives of Civic Forum are  directly represented in the Cabinet."  </P> <P> Separately, it was learned that Adamec has already offered five Cabinet seats  to two small political parties -- the Czechoslovak Socialist Party and the  Czechoslovak People's Party, a Catholic group -- that have in recent days  dramatically transformed themselves from tame puppets of the Communists to  truly independent voices.  </P> <P> The current federal government has 23 members of ministerial rank, all of them  members of the Communist Party.  </P> <P> Adamec refused to rejoin the party's ruling Presidium during two stormy  emergency meetings that saw wholesale leadership changes last weekend, saying  he was disappointed in its commitment to reform.  </P> <P> However, Communist Party spokesman Josef Hora told reporters Tuesday that "I am  convinced" Adamec consulted the new party leadership before agreeing to Civic  Forum's demand for a coalition with non-Communists.  </P> <P> Tuesday's negotiations were adjourned twice in just two hours, reportedly while  Adamec conferred with party chief Karel Urbanek.  </P> <P> To Meet Gorbachev  </P> <P> Spokesman Hora revealed that Urbanek has been invited to visit Gorbachev in  Moscow early next month, following the Soviet leader's return from his summit  meeting in Malta.  </P> <P> Havel and other opposition leaders outlined the additional demands they had  made of Adamec at a packed press conference Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Most important, they said, the delegation had "requested of the prime minister  that the changed Cabinet, as speedily as possible, issue the outlines of its  program declaration which would make it plain that the government is prepared  to create the legal prerequisites for the holding of free elections, assuring  freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and the press, the  abolition of government supervision of the churches and change in the defense  law, as well as others."  </P> <P> It said the new government should "as quickly as possible transform its program  declaration into visible deeds. The (Civic Forum) delegation made it plain to  the prime minister that if the public is not satisfied with the program  declaration of the government and its transformation into specific measures,  the Civic Forum and Public Against Violence (an allied Slovakian group) will,  at the end of this year, ask the prime minister and his Cabinet to resign, and  the president of the republic to name a new prime minister, which, if the  president considers it suitable, will be drafted by the Civic Forum and Public  Against Violence."  </P> <P> Opposition leaders said Adamec informed them that he has already requested that  President Husak pardon as many as 30 political prisoners who remain in  Czechoslovak prisons.  </P> <P> They also said that a commission, including representatives of Civic Forum and  students, is to be set up at today's emergency Parliament meeting to  investigate the brutal police repression of a student demonstration here Nov.  17. Creation of such a commission was a key demand of student strikers.  </P></p>

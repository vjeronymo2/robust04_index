To increase the role of interest rates, the national bank  in the fourth quarter of 1994 will increase the credit resources  share granted by the bank via tenders up to 75 percent. The  maximum time period of newly granted loans, with the exception  of seasonal productions, will be reduced from a year to nine  months and later to six months. The practice of their  prolongation will be discontinued from mid-1994. The interest  rate of the national bank will be levelled with market rates.  The national bank will cease granting loans with interest rates  lower than its official interest rate.    2. The government intends to create all necessary  conditions to arrange sales of state securities.    3. The government is currently elaborating methods of  tackling the problems of debts between enterprises and  inoperative bank assets. To improve the system of settlement of  payments, the national bank will levy late charges from banks  for the delay in crediting customers' accounts. To strengthen  confidence in the national currency, gradually the restrictions  or limitations with regard of the use of cash will be lifted.    4. The government together with the national bank will  pursue the policy that does not allow sharp fluctuations of the  exchange rate.    5. The government will take measures to transfer into the  country all hard currency revenues earned by exporting  enterprises to sell the currency at tradings held by the  national bank.  <H5>  Policy in pricing </H5>   1. Regulated prices will be preserved in 1994 for bread and  bakery products, millet, semolina, combined fodders, and flour  sold instead of baked bread.    2. The government will lift a temporary restriction on  the profitability norm for all enterprises regardless of their  situation on the market, with the exception of several  specialized monopolist enterprises.    3. The government will not take steps that will obstruct  the increase of prices for fuel up to the world level. The  domestic price for crude oil will be gradually increased during  the year.  <H5>  The budget policy </H5>   1. In 1994 the limit of the state budget deficit will be set  within the limit of 4 percent of the gross domestic product  [GDP]. The government will take all possible measures to cover  the state budget deficit at the expense of the noninflationary  sources, mainly by selling the state securities and involvement  of foreign sources of financing.    2. The government intends to submit for the examination  by the Supreme Kenges proposals concerning futher improvement of  the taxation system including abolition and reduction of various  tax holidays and allowances. The work will be continued to  strengthen the tax inspectorate and customs service.    3. The government together with the national bank will  cease granting soft loans.    4. The government will take measures to set up a treasury  under the Ministry of Finance the main functions of which will  be cash regulation of the state budget, management of financial  resources of the government and local executive bodies as well  as of the state debt.  <H5>  Measures of social protection </H5>   1. The government continuing the policy of social support of  the population will change the current system and introduce  personalized social allowances system.    2. A system of social guarantees will be elaborated. It  will consist of two levels -- a republican and a local level.  Every citizen of the republic will be entitled to a certain  amount of assistance at the republican level, and at the local  level additional assistance will be provided depending on the  circumstances.    3. The government will restructure the current pension  scheme and reform the social insurance fund system, the pension  fund, and the fund of promoting employment.    4. The minimum wages will be re-examined after the  abolition of all regulated prices for consumer goods and  services. The government will aim at balancing the ratio  between the wages and rate of production growth.    5. Legal and economic conditions will be created to  involve the able-bodied population in economic activity. The  program for development of private entrepreneurship will be  adopted to increase the goods production and employment of the  population.  <H5>  Policy in the foreign sector </H5>   1. The government will make every effort to encourage  exports with the aim of overcoming the slump in production and  improving the balance of payments. There will be a reduction in  the range of export quotas and licenses. As a result, licensing  of exports will be carried out only with the purpose of  observing the rules of currency exchange, prevention of export  dumping, ensuring timely payment of taxes, in the interests of  national and international security, and also to preserve the  cultural and artistic heritage.    2. The government will undertake all steps to eliminate  hindrances in foreign trade. It will strengthen coordination of  measures to free prices with other states and join their efforts  directed at improving clearing settlements in inter-state trade.    3. All operations with foreign investments will be  carried out at a single exchange rate. The government will put  on the table for consideration by the Supreme Soviet proposals  on establishing a single procedure for registration and taxation  for enterprises with foreign participation and national  enterprises. The national agency for foreign investments will  become the center for gathering and providing information on  rules and the potential of foreign investments.    4. The balance of payments in 1994 will remain tense, and  there will continue to be a deficit in trade with the countries  of the former USSR. Despite the inflow of investments for  financing this deficit, in the short term there will need to be  additional external financial help. In attracting foreign loans  the government will adhere to a restrained and balanced policy.  The Ministry of Finance will be the only body authorized on  behalf of the government to conclude agreements on external  loans or to provide guarantees.  <H5>  Systemic transformations </H5>   1. The program of privatization in all three directions will  be continued.    Small-scale privatization will basically see the completion  of privatization of businesses in the wholesale and retail  trade, public catering, consumer and other services, and also  structures linked to them which provide the carriage, storage,  and sales of output.    In the framework of mass-scale privatization the  distribution  of privatization investment coupons to the population will be  completed and coupon auctions will be held.    In individual schemes it is planned to sell off a number of  large and unique enterprises.    2. The government considers that until state enterprises  are privatized, it has the responsibility of running them. In  1994 there will be a reappraisal of the basic funds of  enterprises.    3. On the basis of national programs the government will  take measures to develop priority sectors of the economy.    4. The system of state needs will be of a temporary  nature. It will be replaced by a market-oriented system of  state purchases based on the principle of freely concluded  contracts and taking consideration of exclusively state  requirements (hospitals, state administration bodies, education,  and defense).    5. The government will focus special attention on  eliminating monopolies in the sphere of the wholesale trade and  transport and sales services connected with it, and also in the  sphere of foreign trade.    6. The government will undertake all measures to fulfill  the set aims, creating the due monitoring mechanisms for this.    In the framework of the declared economic policy the  government is open to discussion of constructive ideas and  proposals, and is ready to cooperate on this platform with all  socio-political movements.</p>

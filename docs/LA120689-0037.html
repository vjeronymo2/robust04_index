			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TESTIMONY DUE TODAY IN CHICAGO PROBE;  </P> <P> CRIME: A GRAND JURY IS STUDYING POSSIBLE MOB TIES OF FIRST WARD POLITICIANS AND  JUDGES. INQUIRY IS ONE OF MOST EXTENSIVE OF CITY'S POWER BROKERS.  </P> <P> The first public officials will go before a federal grand jury today in an  unfolding Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service investigation of  possible organized crime links to judges and politicians in Chicago's downtown  First Ward, where much of the city's reputation for crime, commerce and  corruption is rooted.  </P> <P> The investigation appears to represent one of the government's deepest  penetrations into the well-guarded political back rooms of some of Chicago's  legendary power brokers. Bribery in the fixing of court and zoning cases,  extortion and tax fraud are among the crimes reportedly being probed.  </P> <P> "This could very well be the biggest thing we'll see to come down the pike in  regard to the First Ward and organized crime," said John J. Jemilo, executive  director of the Chicago Crime Commission and former Chicago deputy police  superintendent.  </P> <P> One of Chicago's 50 City Council districts, the First Ward is host to diverse  institutions ranging from City Hall and the Sears Tower to Chinatown and  Soldier Field, home turf of the Chicago Bears. The Loop business district is in  the First Ward and so too is the financial district. Prohibition era gangster  Al Capone had his headquarters in the ward, which was once a center for  gambling houses and brothels.  </P> <P> "The perception is that there is a tie between some politicians and organized  crime members," said Jemilo, "and the perception is even more so when one talks  about the First Ward."  </P> <P> Like many of the Justice Department's elaborate undercover investigations of  corruption in government and the commodities industry here, this probe is  populated by colorful characters and cloaked with intrigue. There are double  agents, hidden cameras and concealed microphones.  </P> <P> Among those subpoenaed to appear today are Fred Roti, an affable Peter Lorre  look-alike who represents the First Ward on the City Council, and Pat Marcy, an  insurance agency owner and chief aide to Democratic Committee member and ward  boss John D'Arco. The grand jury's first round of subpoenas also asked for  records of cases heard by at least five judges and two former judges.  </P> <P> D'Arco, a one-time vegetable vendor, is the former First Ward city councilman  who abruptly retired from the City Council 27 years ago after an unfortunate  encounter with an FBI agent. D'Arco was in a restaurant with the late Chicago  mob boss Sam Giancana when the agent walked by, stuck out his hand and said,  "Good afternoon to you, John," raising the impression that D'Arco might be a  government contact. According to author Ovid Demaris, D'Arco, unable to control  a politician's instincts, reached out and shook the agent's hand. He checked  into a hospital the next day, reportedly for his own safety, and quit the City  Council the next week.  </P> <P> The current councilman, Roti, is the son of Bruno (The Bomber) Roti, who  columnist Mike Royko reports was the leader of the so-called "Black Hand"  organization. Royko describes the group as "sort of a collection agency. Either  they collected or you blew up."  </P> <P> Marcy, a downtown political power for decades although he has not held public  office, is generally believed to be the person in charge of the First Ward. He  changed his name from Pasqualino Marchone after he served a prison term for  robbery in the 1930s.  </P> <P> Much of the initial evidence was gathered by lawyer Robert Cooley, who for  three years simultaneously worked openly for First Ward politicians and  surreptitiously for the federal government's Organized Crime Strike Force.  </P> <P> Cooley, described as a fast talking gambler with an uncanny ability to win  difficult court cases, is the son of a repeatedly decorated Chicago policeman  and the brother of a Roman Catholic priest. For years he reportedly carried out  a variety of tasks for local politicians before turning government informant  and agreeing to wear a hidden tape recorder.  </P> <P> He reportedly told his family of his role in the case on Thanksgiving and  vanished last week as word of the spreading investigation became public. The  Chicago Tribune Tuesday reported that Cooley called friends this week to tell  them they would never see him again and to say goodby.  </P> <P> The first hint that a major investigation was under way came last July, when a  restaurant worker accidentally discovered a video camera hidden in the hollow  back of a booth in Counsellors Row across the street from City Hall. The hidden  camera was aimed at booth one, routinely reserved for First Ward politicians  and their friends. Wires from the camera and from hidden microphones were  traced to office space upstairs of the restaurant. The FBI retrieved the  camera, claiming it was government equipment.  </P> <P> Cooley reportedly supplied the government with sufficient information to allow  them to get court approval for the surreptitious video taping and recording.  </P></p>

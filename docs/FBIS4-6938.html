			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Voices Urging `Give Priority to </F> Deregulation'"]    [Text] On the afternoon of 11 March [1994] when former  Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura was arrested on suspicion  of receiving a bribe for interceding with the Fair Trade  Commission [FTC], Chairman Masami Okayu of the FTC held a press  conference and emphasized that he "wished to comply with the  expectations of the people by strictly enforcing the  Antimonopoly Law in the future." However, the environment  surrounding the FTC has become increasingly severe.  <H5>  MITI Opens Way to Revision </H5>   In the comprehensive economic measures decided on 8 February  [1994], a clause was inserted to "clarify the criteria for the  handling of mergers and stock shareholding." The criteria is  called "merger guidelines" and will serve as the standards for  judgment as to whether the FTC will recognize mergers. They are  important guidelines that may be regarded as the "constitution"  for FTC investigation of mergers. The path to "constitutional  revision" was paved by MITI [Ministry of International Trade and  Industry]. The Industrial Structure Council, an advisory organ  to the MITI minister, pointed out in its interim report drafted  in late November 1993 that "the positioning of elements other  than domestic shares is unclear," and that the element of shares  in the global market should be added to the investigation  criteria. The FTC had resisted at the outset by saying that  "there is no problem with the current criteria" (Economic  Department), but it was eventually overruled by MITI.    Demands are submitted to the FTC not only domestically, but  also from overseas. The U.S. Government submitted a document  requesting measures for competition within the framework of the  Japan-U.S. economic talks, and it demanded easing of the  regulation on premiums. The U.S. companies, which frequently use  premiums to promote sales, complain strongly that strict  regulation of premiums serve as a barrier to entry into the  Japanese market.  <H5>  Other Ministries Remain Cool </H5>   Although the FTC is passive regarding the U.S. proposal and  says that "the regulation concerning premiums is firmly in  place," it is actually showing signs of relenting. In the air  travel industry, the practice of offering free air travel  coupons according to flight distances is spreading. However, it  clearly violates the Premium Display Law which restricts  premiums to "within 10 percent of the original transacted price,  and under 50,000 yen." Nonetheless, the FTC tacitly approves it  because "the unique circumstances of international air travel  makes it difficult for Japan's rules to be applied" (Premium  Display Guidance Division).    A view is even expressed that "perhaps the sense of the FTC  is at variance with the international trend in the industry"  (MITI executive).    Late last year, the FTC's study group (Chairman Toshimasa  Tsuruta, professor of Senshu University) made public a report on  the government regulations. It spelled out a basic policy of  "abolishing, in principle, regulations on entry and pricing" and  clarified the guidelines on the problems of government  regulations by individual industries such as distribution and  communications, in addition to ways to ease them.    Despite the fact that "the contents were quite penetrating"  (an FTC executive), the other ministries took it rather coolly,  saying: "We were not aware that such a report was issued"  (Ministry of Transportation). The FTC report was obscured by the  report of the Economic Reform Study Group [Hiraiwa study group]  (an advisory organ to the prime minister; Gaishi Hiraiwa,  chairman), which was announced about the same time and which  also advocated abolition of economic regulations in principle.    In the first place, the FTC's study group was hastily  convened when deregulation became a major theme in the Economic  Reform Study Group, and it was felt that "the FTC must also do  something." In addition to being frequently shaken by domestic  and foreign pressures, the FTC could not hide its weak-kneed  statements.  <H5>  Strict Surveillance of "Discount Sales" </H5>   Despite its passiveness concerning deregulation, the FTC  keeps a sharp eye on "discount sales" amid the trend toward  price-cutting. In November 1993, it issued orders to exclude  four major discount stores on men's clothing for violating the  display law. The reason given was that unfair double-standard  prices were displayed to give the impression of lower sale  prices. Professor Ushio Nakajo of Keio University stated that it  is natural to strictly control violations. However, he  questioned the posture of the FTC, saying: "The FTC should have  other matters to tend to." His contention is that the FTC should  give priority to grappling with deregulation and prosecution of  "dango."    Strengthening measures for competition is one of the four  pillars of an open market policy that the government will draft  by the end of March [1994], and "the role of the FTC is being  elevated to an unprecedented level" (Hiroshi Iju, adviser to  Mitsubishi Research Institute).    Enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law is often swayed by  pressures from politicians and foreign countries, as well as by  demands from the industries. Of course, there are tasks that the  government as a whole must grapple with, such as the buildup of  the investigation sector which is said to be understaffed.  However, unless the FTC adopts a firm stance regarding its  policy on competition, the raison d'etre of the FTC itself will  be questioned.</p>

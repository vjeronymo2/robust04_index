			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Difficulties That Must Be Overcome"] </F>   [Text] Observers currently agree that just as they  expected a few weeks ago, the process of transferring power to  the Palestinian National Authority will not be easy,  particularly in light of the bad economic conditions prevailing  in the occupied territories.    The process as a whole is considered an extremely important  historical turning point. The Palestinian people are aware of  their duty to ensure the success of this process, because the  cost of failure, God forbid, would be extremely tragic.    The Palestinians' task at present is to establish the organs  and cadres of the Palestinian Authority, on the one hand, and to  keep the wheels of government turning, on the other, in order to  provide the necessary services to the citizens and create jobs  for tens of thousands of unemployed workers. This demands the  establishment of industrial and agricultural projects in the  areas of the transitional authority to absorb these workers as  soon as possible.    There is no doubt that ensuring security and peace is  considered one of the main challenges and difficult tests facing  the Palestinians. In view of these difficulties and obstacles,  the Palestinians must make greater efforts and sacrifices to  overcome them. The states that have pledged to provide economic  aid to the Palestinians are called upon to fulfill their  commitments. Numerous dangers are threatening peace. Time is  definitely one of the factor endangering the peace process and  Palestinian aspirations.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Thriving exports help push Filofax to Pounds 2.2m THRIVING exports were behind growth at Filofax Group, the personal organiser company, where pre-tax profits almost quadrupled to Pounds 2.2m in the year to March 31 from Pounds 553,000 in the previous 15 month period. Turnover improved to Pounds 14.4m, helped by Pounds 1.1m from acquisitions, against Pounds 12.7m restated under FRS 3. Sales improvements ranged from 37 per cent in continental Europe, to 22 per cent in the US and 17 per cent in the UK. Filofax said the acquisition of the assets of a former French distributor and the establishment of a new marketing subsidiary in France in October, were making 'good progress.' Operating profit was Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 441,000). The year finished with net cash of Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 2.62m), after the Pounds 1.2m acquisition of Lefax. Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said: 'We have got the product right. It was too expensive and not what the consumer wanted. Now we are selling Filofaxes into the emerging markets of Korea and Taiwan.' The recommended final dividend is increased to 0.75p, making a total for the year of 1.25p (0.5p). Earnings per share rose to 7.7p (2.7p).</p>

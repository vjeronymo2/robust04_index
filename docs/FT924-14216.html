			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Kissing in the European style: John Major gave Lady Thatcher a peck on the cheek. Is this acceptable? THE most telling political image of the Tories' week in Brighton was that of John Major kissing Lady Thatcher up on the platform, in full view of both delegates and - more important - television cameras. One has seen less sincere and much more repulsive political kisses - a slobbery embrace between Mikhail Gorbachev and Erich Honecker stands out particularly in my memory. Major's body language below the mouth was most revealing. While kissing his predecessor he simultaneously grabbed both her wrists with his hands. Only when the lady was thus rendered helpless did the Prime Minister lean forward close enough to kiss. Lady Thatcher gazed fixedly over Mr Major's left shoulder. What else could she do? Yet while the embrace had a certain political resonance, no one so far as I am aware, has questioned its propriety. The social kissing of men and women in public is a very recent development, except for those who move in bohemian and arty circles. It is thought to have been introduced into respectability by the Princess of Wales at around the time of her marriage. The Princess is a wonderfully touchy feely sort of person, and finds such a gesture wholly natural. But almost all Englishmen, and most Englishwomen lack the Princess of Wales's innate warmth and physicality: they have adopted her practice, but clearly feel very awkward doing it. There are a number of difficulties. Who makes the first lunge? Is it to be a single kiss (Mwa]) or a Continental double (Mwa] Mwa])? There is a fundamental problem in the whole endeavour: the shape of the human face. This decrees that it is almost impossible to kiss someone on the cheek at the same time as he or she is kissing you on the cheek. For the benefit of readers I consulted The Spectator's etiquette agony aunt, Mary Killen. She says: 'The double kiss has been discredited in polite circles following its adoption by Cilla Black on her Television show Blind Date. However, if you must persist the rule is for the kisser to place the lips on the left cheek of the kissee, and then wait to receive a symmetrical response.' What is still not acceptable, in public at least, is the social kissing of men with men. To make such a gesture would be to invite instant rumours that one is homosexual. Recently we went on holiday to Italy. I found that men whom I scarcely knew would kiss me goodbye. At first I reeled backwards, but then my wife explained to me that these friends of hers were not fruits but were perfectly ordinary Italian men expressing affection in a manly way. By the end of the holiday I had become quite used to the idea and was kissing along with the best of them. In a way the Italians are more logical than we are - and not just the Italians; the Russians, pace Mikhail Gorbachev, are mighty man to man kissers. If one kisses a woman socially it indicates no more than affection. It is not in any way a lustful embrace. So why should not the same be acceptable between men? The problem at the moment is that we have only the handshake. That is fine when one first meets someone, or at the start of a game of competitive chess, such as that now going on between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. But I do find it slightly ridiculous that the handshake remains almost the only acceptable public greeting between men friends who have developed a warm relationship over many years. The Americans, I know, have developed alternatives: the playful punch on the shoulder, or even the hug, but neither of these are particularly elegant or aesthetic. So I proposed to Mary Killen that official endorsement be given to social kissing between males. It didn't take, I'm afraid. 'No] We really must call a stop to this promiscuous cheek bashing. It's already causing too much confusion and embarrassment. Nobody feels comfortable doing it. I do hope you are not going to attempt to introduce this foreign thing of male kissing into Britain.' 'No, Mary,' I said, lamely. 'You're the expert.' But I couldn't help recalling what one of the Italians said to me, when I commented that in England the practise of male kissing was thought to be a sign of dangerous effeminacy. 'The reason why Englishmen don't like kissing each other' he said 'is that so many of you really are homosexual. You are afraid you might get carried away.' No danger of that, at least between John Major and Lady Thatcher. Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Dangerous liaisons BAe's rapid exit from discussions with GEC shows its sensitivity to institutional unease. The new management's top priority is said to be persuading investors that it is capable of running the business without producing nasty surprises. So while behind-the-scenes fireside chats with Lord Weinstock were apparently just about acceptable, a public carve-up of the UK defence industry is not. Still, as any talks about a deal as large as this were more or less bound to leak at some point, one wonders why BAe got involved in the first place. If the company's focus is genuinely on proving it has a safe pair of hands, it has little need of precipitate talks with GEC - especially as its business and share price are recovering nicely. It is to be hoped that Mr John Cahill is not in too much of a hurry to write himself into the history books as BAe's great helmsman. In the longer term, there are areas where it would make sense for the two companies to collaborate. BAe makes missiles while GEC Marconi makes the electronics to go into them. If the currently proposed joint venture between BAe Dynamics and Matra goes ahead, GEC would be a logical third partner. Yet a full scale merger of the two companies is more questionable. Such a vertically integrated company would have trouble selling components to other manufacturers, as Marconi currently does. BAe is also able to buy from a wide range of component makers. GEC has always been more enthusiastic about a full scale tie-up, perhaps because it covets BAe's lead contractor status. Or maybe Lord Weinstock merely wants back those parts of the UK aircraft business he lost when the aerospace industry was nationalised in 1977.</p>

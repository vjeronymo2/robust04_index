			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / German union calls for 'massive warning strikes': Engineering workers add weight to public sector threat WESTERN GERMANY'S 4m en-gineering workers rejected a 3.3 per cent pay offer yesterday and prepared to add their weight to the wave of strikes already threatening chaos in public services next week. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, president of the IG Metall union, said the offer was meant as a provocation and would be treated as such. He called for 'massive warning strikes' next week. Three factories in Hesse were hit immediately as 4,000 workers walked out in the morning. The danger of widespread public sector stoppages was heightened when the DAG white-collar union announced 74.7 per cent of its membership had chosen action. A 70 per cent 'yes' vote is needed for strikes to be called. Ballot results from the main public service union OeTV, with 1.2m members, are expected today. Work at the Hamburg central post office, which handles 4m pieces of mail a day, was disrupted yesterday when 400 staff were called out on indefinite strike. Services were already 'crippled', the DPG post office workers' union claimed. Cologne-based motorway maintenance workers also stopped work. Results from smaller groups underlined the strength of feeling in the workforce. The DPG union reported a 95.4 per cent strike vote. Almost 90 per cent of motorway maintenance workers in the VDS union voted for action. Mr Josef Hilgers, the VDS leader, said that even a 5.4 per cent pay deal, proposed recently by an arbitration council and rejected by employers, would leave his members only DM80 (Pounds 27) a month better off. The employers, led by Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, confirmed on Thursday that, while they were prepared to reopen talks, they would not increase their offer of 4.8 per cent. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, yesterday reaffirmed his commitment to an effective freeze on public spending for four years. Engineering employers, representing the powerhouse of the German economy, want to link pay rises to productivity increases, expected to be about 2 per cent this year. They claim that excessive labour costs forced them to cut 62,000 manufacturing jobs last year. IG Metall is demanding 9.5 per cent. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, warned of a 'great danger of a further turn in the spiral' of wages and prices 'if, as is now the case, people expect wage rises to offset price rises which have resulted from higher taxes and government levies'. There was no sign that the public sector unions, representing about 3m workers, were prepared to take up Mr Seiters' offer of more talks. Their previous strike, which lasted three days in 1974, was limited mainly to local transport and rubbish collection services in key towns.

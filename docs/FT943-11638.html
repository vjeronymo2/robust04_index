			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Eagle Trust loses Pounds 13.5m action Eagle Trust, the film equipment conglomerate, yesterday lost its High Court action to recover Pounds 13.5m from Swiss Bank Corporation. The company had claimed that two subsidiaries of the bank, SBCI Savory Milln and Swiss Bank Corporation Investment Banking, were liable to repay the money which had been misappropriated by Mr John Ferriday, its former chairman. Mrs Justice Arden ruled the subsidiaries had not known or suspected that Mr Ferriday had used the company's money to pay off his sub-underwriting commitments following Eagle Trust's failed 1987 rights issue.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Mobile subsidies criticised Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, ruled yesterday that mobile phone operators were 'un-fairly' cross-subsidising service providers owned by them. He said he would oblige the operators to pay a reasonable return to service providers for connecting mobile phone users, in a ruling likely to favour the remaining independent service providers. There are about 20 service providers. The ruling follows complaints by service providers not owned by one of the four cellular network operators - Vodafone, Cellnet, Mercury One-2-One and Orange - that the low margins paid to them were making their business uneconomic. Nearly half the network subscribers of Vodafone and Cellnet, the two largest operators, are connected via service providers partly or wholly owned by them. Mr Cruickshank said he was 'determined this market should operate in a completely fair and open manner'. The complaints were launched in 1992 by Talkland, then an independent service provider. A one-third stake in the company has since been bought by Vodafone, the largest of the network operators. Mr Charles Wigoder, managing director of the independent Peoples Phone, said: 'This is good news for the independent service providers, but it does not change the fact that the economies of scale in the industry casts doubt on the future of the smaller independents.' The existing practice throughout the mobile industry is to subsidise the acquisition of subscribers. Mr Cruickshank ruled that 'mature' service providers should make a reasonable return on this investment, defined as two per cent a month over 35 months.</p>

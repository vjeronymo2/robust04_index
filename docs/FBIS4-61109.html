			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Kalashnikova report: "Trade Partnership With the </F> EC Depends on `Political Will'"]    [Text] The consultations between Deputy Prime Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin and Sir Leon Britten, deputy chief of the  European Commission, which were held 2 May in Moscow effectively  marked an end to a nearly two-year-long marathon of negotiating  a partnership and cooperation accord between Russia and the EC.  Solutions to the most contentious problem -- the Russian export  of nuclear-cycle goods -- were finally found during the meeting.  Mr. Shokhin pointed out that "if the political will is  present," the agreement may now be initialed by the end of  Greece's chairmanship in the EC (it expires at the end of June).  For the time being experts will have to "weigh the balance of  interests set forth in the agreement" yet another time -- there  will be no more high-level talks.    A solution on the export of nuclear-cycle goods, including  uranium -- an apple of discord in the talks -- was reached  thanks to mutual concessions. Initially, the EC was not  inclined at all to accept Russia's proposal on including this  subject in the draft agreement on partnership. During the  Moscow meeting a compromise was reached. According to Mr.  Shokhin, the two sides decided that, first, a special agreement  on trade in nuclear-cycle goods be worked out; and, second, that  this matter be presently included in Article 20 of the draft  agreement on partnership, citing, however, an existing agreement  from 1989 with the EC. Among other things, the agreement calls  for preliminary consultations to be held before quantitative  limitations are imposed; the competence of Euratom to be  recognized when solving trade issues; and a pledge by the sides  "to take into account the situation on the market" (export  volumes were not specified). In order to clarify their stances,  the sides agreed to exchange corresponding letters.    The results of the Moscow meeting and talks on the  partnership agreement in general must be considered by the EC  Council 16 May. Mr. Shokhin pointed out that "there is hope"  that this matter will be finally resolved because both side show  their interest in it; he added, however, that now everything  depends on "political will," otherwise the process may be  delayed. As a matter of fact, the European parliament passed a  resolution the other day that links the conclusion of the  agreement to the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic  states, even though it is only recommendatory in nature (then  again, the parliament itself is bracing for an election).    The Moscow talks focused not only on the partnership accord.  Mr. Shokhin and Sir Leon also signed a memorandum on setting up  a working group to look into the possibilities of attracting  foreign investment in Russia. According to Oleg Preksin,  Russian member of the EBRD board of directors, who also joined  the group, it will have to present the results of its work (a  report) to the European Commission by 28 June. One of the key  projects of the Russian side will be the creation of the  Multilateral Agency to Guarantee Investment in Russia (MAGIR).  That is to say, a multilateral fund involving both Russia and  Western countries is to be set up abroad to insure investment  against noncommercial risks (details of the project have yet to  be clarified). This matter may be considered at the G-7's  summer summit in Naples.</p>

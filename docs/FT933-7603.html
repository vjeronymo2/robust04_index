			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Focus at Kodak GOOD CORPORATE governance requires much more than a management board which is studded with successful independent directors. The latest and in some ways one of the most striking examples is to be seen in the story of Eastman Kodak, a world-class company which over the past 20 years or so seems almost to have gone out of its way to dissipate its resources. Now the price is being paid. Earlier this month, its chairman resigned: this week, the company announced that a further 10,000 jobs are to go by the end of 1995. Kodak's culture is straightlaced and serious minded. Around its boardroom table sit the likes of Coca-Cola's Roberto Goizueta, former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, John Phelan, and Dr Karlheinz Kaske, recently of Siemens. Its core business, silver halide photography, has continued to expand over the years, and its research efforts have been productive. Yet its catalogue of strategic errors will stand as a casebook of the ways in which a corporation could go wrong in recent decades. There was complacency in the face of new competition from instant photography and from Japan, followed by debacle when its move into Polaroid's territory brought losses and heavy fines for patent infringements. There was the failure to exploit technological leads in areas like reprographics and publishing systems: inevitably, there was the enormously costly aquisition of a business about which it knew nothing. These grim experiences have forced Kodak to reappraise its activities, and as a result it now appears to be regaining ground in some of its long-established business lines. But its story shows how feeble the business establishment can be when its own cage needs shaking. Kodak's non-executives and its shareholders sat around politely through years of visible decline. Someone should have been prepared to be ungentlemanly years ago.</p>

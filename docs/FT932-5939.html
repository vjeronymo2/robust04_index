			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: CSR net profit increased by 20% CSR, the Australian building products, sugar and aluminium group, yesterday announced an rise of 20 per cent in net profit to ADollars 211.2m (USDollars 148.3m) for the year to end-March, on revenue up 9 per cent to ADollars 4.3bn. The group said higher sugar prices and an improvement in productivity outweighed the effects of low aluminium prices and patchy economic recovery in its main markets in Australia and the US. Its sugar mills made substantially higher profits because of a record sugar cane crop and higher world prices. The timber products division returned to profit after two years of losses. These gains were partly offset by lower prices and profit margins in Australia for some building products. However, the bottom line was boosted by a net abnormal profit of ADollars 20m, mainly due to a restatement of provisions against income tax liabilities, resulting in net profit after abnormals of ADollars 231.3m. This was in sharp contrast to 1991-1992, when a change in accounting standards forced the group to write down the value of assets by ADollars 560m, resulting in a loss after abnormals of ADollars 385.3m. The final dividend was lifted from 10 to 12 cents, fully franked, making 22 cents for the year, against 20 cents.</p>

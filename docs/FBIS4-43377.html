			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- The German Bundesbank is  expecting the number of people out of work in western Germany to  continue to rise in 1994. In its monthly report for June, the  Bundesbank said the expected level of economic growth will not  suffice "to prevent further limited growth in unemployment." In  eastern Germany, however, the employment situation seems to be  stabilizing, even though official and concealed unemployment  remains "depressingly high." The Bundesbank said 2.6 million  persons were out of work in western Germany at the end of May,  360,000 more than the same time last year. The number of  unemployed in eastern Germany increased during the same period  by 63,000 to 1.16 million.    The overall state of the western German economy "clearly  improved" during the spring, the report said. "Recessionary  trends" have evidently been overcome. Counter to earlier fears,  the GDP during the first quarter did not fall again but rose by  a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent compared with the fourth  quarter of 1993, and by 1.5 percent against the first quarter of  1993. A "continuation of this moderate upward trend" is  expected for the rest of the year. The main driving force here  is currently foreign demand, showing that Germany's exporters  have generally retained or restored their competitiveness.    The Bundesbank said there was a "clear continuation" of the  upward economic trend in eastern Germany during the first months  of the year. Output in the manufacturing sector, previously one  of the eastern German economy's "weak points," "rose no less  than 21.5 percent" over the first quarter last year. The report  said this was apparently because more and more eastern German  companies are recovering lost market shares and gaining a  foothold in the western German market. However, exports have  failed to recover. Eastern German companies have so far failed  to secure in western export markets the success needed to make  up for the loss of their East European export markets.</p>

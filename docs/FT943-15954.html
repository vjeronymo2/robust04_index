			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / A poll about the state they're in: Ukraine's president has turned voters' minds to nationality and away from the devastated economy The square outside Kiev's central cathedral is dominated by a statue which captures the ambivalence at the heart of Ukraine. The towering figure of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the leader of a cossack rebellion against the Poles in the 17th century, astride a leaping stallion would appear to be a potent national symbol. But after overthrowing the Poles, Khmelnytsky made an alliance with Moscow which began more than three centuries of Russian domination. When they go to the polls this Sunday in the second round to elect a new president, Ukrainians will still be contemplating Khmelnytsky's mixed legacy of a fleeting independence and an enduring dependence on Russia. President Leonid Kravchuk, whose disastrous economic record led many observers to predict inevitable electoral defeat, is trying to orchestrate a political resurrection. His method, which most western and Ukrainian observers predict will bring him a slim victory in the poll on Sunday, has been to shift the campaign from economic issues to the question of Ukraine's continued existence as a separate state. 'This is a second referendum on independence,' says Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, a leading figure in the national democratic opposition, turned ardent Kravchuk supporter. 'That is why it is so crucial for Kravchuk to win.' To position himself as the only leader who can guarantee Ukraine's continued existence, Mr Kravchuk has launched a campaign to portray his opponent, former prime minister Leonid Kuchma, as Russia's candidate. Despite Mr Kuchma's best efforts - he has begun to speak a slightly hesitant Ukrainian and insist on his patriotism - the efficacy of Mr Kravchuk's strategy has been evident on the campaign trail and in the first round of voting, held nearly two weeks ago. Even in central Ukraine, never a hot-bed of national sentiment, Mr Kuchma has been faced with voters who ask: 'Would you prefer to be the governor of Little Russia (the tsarist term for Ukraine) or president of an independent state?' In the first round Mr Kravchuk drew 38 per cent of the vote, mostly in central and fiercely nationalist western Ukraine. Mr Kuchma won 31 per cent, largely in the more Russified eastern and southern regions, where many people would prefer closer links with Russia. The real reformers on the Ukrainian political scene are furiously, but impotently, resentful of Mr Kravchuk's apparently successful attempt to elude responsibility for the country's economic devastation by playing the national card. 'Ukrainians can't eat their national flag and Ukraine can't survive on national symbols alone,' says Mr Serhii Holovatyi, an MP of the free-market 'Reform' faction in parliament. 'I think that Kravchuk will win and his victory will mean that the idea of statehood has not died entirely, but that doesn't mean that the idea of statehood doesn't hang by a mere thread.' Part of the problem is that, although Mr Kuchma's image as a Russian pawn owes less to his real convictions than to Mr Kravchuk's political skill, he has failed to live up to his supporters' hopes that he would offer a clear economic alternative to the administration. Mr Kuchma has promised to alter Ukraine's punitive taxation policies, its fixed exchange-rate system which discourages exports and to speed up privatisation. So has Mr Kravchuk. To further muddy the waters the Communist party was this week widely reported to be backing Mr Kuchma. Western diplomats at first felt that this might swing the election in Mr Kuchma's favour, but some Ukrainian insiders have suggested that the Kravchuk-controlled Ukrainian media are intentionally exaggerating the strength of communist support for Mr Kuchma, in an effort to undermine his reformist credentials. Nowhere is Mr Kuchma's failure to position himself as the candidate of economic reforms more evident than in his natural constituency in eastern Ukraine. While his populist promises of swift prosperity through closer economic relations with Russia are likely again to win him a majority of the vote in the east, the business community in Mr Kuchma's own bailiwick is reluctantly turning to the incumbent. 'I support Mr Kravchuk,' said Mr Alexander Bulianda, of general manager of Azovstal, Ukraine's largest steel-mill and one of the few state enterprises in the country which is beginning to reform. 'Mr Kuchma is from the old, privileged military-industrial complex and he sees the old system through rose-coloured glasses. At least if Mr Kravchuk is re-elected we can hope that he will allow the cabinet of ministers to run the economy and concern himself with politics.' A growing number of Ukrainians are putting their faith instead in Mr Vitalii Masol, the new prime minister. His past as a Communist party functionary would appear to disqualify him from acting as an agent of market reforms, but progressive cabinet ministers and industrialists throughout the country have begun to say that Mr Masol, like his Russian counterpart, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, has undergone a political conversion to the market. There was some evidence of this yesterday when Ukraine's minister of finance, Mr Hryhori Pyatachenko, who was widely seen as inept, was replaced by Mr Petro Hermanchuk, who speaks for the sorts of reform the International Monetary Fund would like to see. If Mr Masol does begin market reforms, he will have to contend with the hard-line left who make up the largest bloc in parliament, led by the socialist speaker, Mr Oleksandr Moroz. But outside the central government, a constituency for reform is slowly growing. Reform-minded politicians have done well in municipal and local elections. Reformist mayors stand a good chance of winning on Sunday in Kiev and Odessa and reformers have done well on a local level even in eastern Ukraine, where the communists made their strongest showing in parliamentary elections in April. When Ukrainians elected their first president in 1991 they went to the polls with the festive spirit of a nation ridding itself of centuries of Russian domination and decades of communist rule. Their government's lacklustre performance over the past three years has made them more cynical. No matter who they elect on Sunday, few Ukrainians have much hope that their next president will be the source of real, desperately needed, change.</p>

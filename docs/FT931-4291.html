			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): New Dow record after early fall is reversed Wall Street AFTER running into early profit-taking yesterday, US stock markets regained their poise thanks to a late surge of buying, which lifted indices to new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a net 6.22 up at 3,478.34, a record and well above its low for the day of 3,449.43. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.93 higher at 456.33, while the American SE composite added 2.86 at 421.88 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 3.91 to 692.87. New York SE trading volume was 256m shares and rises outnumbered falls by 1,039 to 828. After reaching record levels during the first two days of the week, stock prices were hit by concerted selling when the market opened. Traders reported that an early decline in bond prices triggered the sell-off, although the likely motive was an eagerness among investors to book some of the profits earned earlier in the week. Among the selling a number of sizeable program trades were spotted. Prices steadily recovered during the afternoon, culminating in a late rush of buying that pushed stocks into positive territory only in the final 30 minutes of trading. No important new economic figures were released yesterday, although the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book' report on the state of the economy nationwide showed that business activity continued to pick up in the first two months of the year, in spite of sluggish loan demand and continued weakness in some regional economies. Walt Disney was one of the most heavily traded issues, slipping Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 after a seller offloaded at Dollars 44 a large block of shares  -2.8m in all. There was no indication as to who had sold the stake, or why. Drug shares were in demand as investors searched for bargains in a sector which has been hit hard recently by speculation that President Clinton plans to impose price controls on pharmaceutical products as part of his healthcare reforms. Merck improved Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 in volume of 3.9m shares, Pfizer Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Schering-Plough Dollars 2 to Dollars 61 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 1/2 and Glaxo Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 19 7/8 . News that Primerica is negotiating to buy the Shearson brokerage business from American Express continued to boost the financial services group's stock. Primerica was up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 46 5/8 in volume of more than 1m shares. American Express shed Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 , having originally risen on news of the proposed deal. Genesis Health moved ahead Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 after an analyst at securities house Merrill Lynch raised the firm's short-term rating on the stock from 'above average' to 'buy' and named the company its pick of the week. On the Nasdaq market, Biosurface Technologies plunged Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 6 after the company revealed that it had suspended a clinical trial of its Anticel product, a dressing used for donor site wounds. Canada THE TORONTO market closed narrowly mixed after further heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was off 1.2 at 3,552.0 but advancing issues led declines by 350 to 321. Volume amounted to 52.5m shares valued at some CDollars 530m. Eight of the 14 sub-group indices were lower, led by golds, down 1.1 per cent as the spot price for gold in New York eased 30 cents to a seven-year low of USDollars 326.55. The media group advanced 1.4 per cent.</p>

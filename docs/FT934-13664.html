			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Airlines push EC on services Five leading European airlines yesterday pressed for European Commission to ban ground-handling monopolies at airports throughout the EC, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent. Senior directors of British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa of Germany, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines System told Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, and other officials in Brussels that ground-handling charges at monopoly airports were almost a third higher than those at airports where airlines are free to provide their own services or choose other suppliers. They have already filed formal complaints with the EC.</p>

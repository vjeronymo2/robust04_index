Forces listed as missing or  killed in the Korean war (1950-53), a United Nations Command  spokesman said Thursday. It was the first meeting between the  two to discuss returning and identifying the remains of U.N.  Forces killed in the Korean war, the spokesman said.    The contact has aroused widespread interest as the North  Korean nuclear problem is nearing resolution, although the  return of remains is a humanitarian matter. The two agreed to  continue to meet to exchange technical information whenever  necessary and to discuss forming a joint North Korea-U.S.  investigation team.    More than 10,000 U.N. soldiers are listed as dead or missing  in the Korean war. Although 194 purported sets of remains have  been returned by North Korea, there has been little progress in  identifying them.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FALCONS-COLTS TALKS STALLED  </P> <P> Trade talks between the Atlanta Falcons and the Indianapolis Colts, aimed at  sending the first overall choice in Sunday's NFL draft to the Colts, have  stalled, a newspaper said.  </P> <P> The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in today's editions, quoted an unidentified  Colts source as saying Tuesday: "It looked like we were headed in a pretty  decent direction for a while. But then things started moving away from a deal.  I'm not saying things are dead, but they're certainly on life-support systems."  </P> <P> The Colts would use the choice to select Illinois quarterback Jeff George, an  Indianapolis native. Barring a trade, the Falcons have said they will take  George, but they have not yet begun contract negotiations with his agent, Leigh  Steinberg.  </P></p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Washington calls on Mobutu to resign PRESIDENTIAL guards fought pockets of rebel troops in Zaire yesterday and Belgium intervened in an effort to force President Mobutu Sese Seko to surrender power, grounding a planeload of his money, AP reports from Kinshasa. The US, France and Belgium sent a joint message to Mr Mobutu saying they 'forcefully insist' that Zaire's dictator of 27 years surrender his powers to his arch-rival, Etienne Tshisekedi, the prime minister. Mr Mobutu 'has the blood of more than 300 people on his hands,' Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, said of victims of riots that erupted last Thursday when soldiers were paid with new banknotes that shopkeepers refused. Mr Tshisekedi, head of the pro-democracy transition forced on Mr Mobutu by Western donors, said at least 1,000 people had been killed, mainly regular troops, in attacks by presidential guards. More than 1,500 foreigners have been evacuated from Zaire since the French ambassador was killed last week. On Tuesday, presidential guards at the state broadcasting centre had repulsed an attack by rebel soldiers, hours after fighting at the airport had killed 45 troops, a European security source said. Yesterday, for the first time, Belgium moved against Mr Mobutu in Europe, grounding a plane full of new banknotes he had printed in Britain. Zairean opposition leaders want European governments to seize Mr Mobutu's wealth to press him to give up power.</p>

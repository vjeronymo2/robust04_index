			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Thyssen, Preussag lift Ekostahl bid THYSSEN and Preussag, Germany's steel manufacturers, have stepped up their efforts to buy Ekostahl, the lossmaking east German steel mill. The companies launched a new proposal which, for the first time, includes an offer to inject cash into the struggling steel group. The move is aimed at stemming competition in the region, and blocking Ekostahl's purchase by Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel maker. Thyssen and Preussag are offering initially to buy 50 per cent of Ekostahl's cold-rolling mill and close down the hot-blast furnace within the next three years. They want the Treuhand, the state agency in charge of privatisation, to take absorb any losses during the restructuring period. The consortium is also offering to create 1,000 new jobs in Eisenhuttenstadt through its subsidiaries. These would include recycling and construction. The moves might offset lay-offs of about 1,600 at Ekostahl itself. The German offer coincides with growing pressure on Bonn from the European Commission to privatise Ekostahl as quickly as possible. The privatisation of the east German plant at Eisenhuttenstadt would allow the Commission to move forward in its negotiations with state-owned producers in Spain and Italy aimed at reducing state subsidies and cutting overcapacity. After talks in Brussels earlier this week, Mr Gunther Rexrodt, Germany's economy minister, yesterday told the country's steel industry to speed up the privatisation of Ekostahl. However, a Treuhand official said that it was still not clear 'how serious' Thyssen and Preussag were in saving Ekostahl from closure in the long term. The official added that the latest plan was 'more concrete' than those presented during the summer, which had primarily focused on offering management expertise. Ekostahl's annual production has already been reduced from 2.5m tons to 900,000 tons. The labour force has been cut from 12,000 to 3,500 full-time employees. However, the Treuhand said that negotiations with Riva were progressing and the Italian group was interested in acquiring a majority stake, as well as turning Ekostahl into a competitive mini-mill.</p>

ECOMOG field commander, Major General John  Inienger, gave the warning yesterday when he summoned the  dismissed leader of ULIMO, Alhaji Koromah, for consultations. A  serious split developed within the ranks of ULIMO between Krahn  elements loyal to ULIMO military chief, Roosevelt Johnson, and  Mandingo elements of Alhaji Koromah following the failure of Dr.  Mohamed Sheriff to obtain a position on the State Council. Dr.  Sheriff was being supported by Alhaji Koromah, but lost the vice  chairmanship of the council to Mr. Thomas Ziah of the same  organization. Ziah is being supported by General Roosvelt  Johnson and other Krahn elements within ULIMO.    Following news of Mr. Ziah's election over Dr. Sheriff,  ULIMO  leader Koromah has announced the sacking of Ziah and replaced  him (?by Dr. Sheriff). The dismissal of Mr. Ziah who challenged  [words indistinct] the military wing of ULIMO subsequently  announced the dismissal of Alhaji Koromah. Gen. Roosevelt  Johnson announced that he had taken over the leadership of  ULIMO, disbanded the political wing [words indistinct]. Reports  say the infighting in ULIMO has led to serious gun battle among  its soldiers at the Po River in Tubmanburg ULIMO headquarters.  The fighting was sparked off after Alhaji Koromah ordered the  disarming of Krahn elements of ULIMO loyal to Johnson. Johnson  forces are reported to have resisted the order, which resulted  in a serious gun battle. Alhaji Koromah is said to be confused  as the situation is now reported to be beyond his control. Of  late, Koromah has been attempting to commercialize ULIMO [word  indistinct] $5 million as compensation to cooperate with the  peace process.</p>

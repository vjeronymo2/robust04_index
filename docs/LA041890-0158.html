			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MIKE NICHOLS TO SUB FOR LIZ TAYLOR AT AIDS EVENT  </P> <P> Director Mike Nichols has agreed to pinch-hit for the ailing Elizabeth Taylor  at tonight's Art Against AIDS fund-raiser in Chicago.  </P> <P> Taylor, who is hospitalized in St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica with  pneumonia, issued a statement late Tuesday to quash the reports that she has  AIDS.  </P> <P> "I would like to dispel the plethora of rumors that have been circulating that  I have an AIDS-related condition," she said. "I feel it is important that  people should not be afraid to be tested for AIDS."  </P> <P> Taylor, 58, said she has been tested for AIDS and that the results of those  tests "are negative." The two-time Oscar winner has raised millions of dollars  for AIDS research.  </P> <P> The actress, who was admitted to Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del  Rey on April 9 for a severe sinus condition, was transferred to nearby St.  John's for tests, her physician, Dr. Patricia Murray, said.  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Britannia improves pay offer The threat of strike action at Britannia Airways, the UK's second largest airline, was receding last night after the company improved its pay offer to cabin staff. The 1,000 cabin staff, members of the British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association, part of the TGWU transport union, had voted to strike in support of a pay claim worth between 11 per cent and 15 per cent. The company responded by training volunteers from other companies in the parent Thomson Travel Group to take over cabin staff duties in the event of a strike. The deal is worth 3 per cent on basic pay this year, with a lump sum payment to make the annual rise worth about 5 per cent. In addition, the company has agreed to increase incremental pay scales for senior cabin crew by Pounds 100. The two-year deal uses a formula of retail price index plus 1 per cent in the second year with a minimum increase of 4 per cent. Other improvements to conditions have also been negotiated. Mr George Ryde, the TGWU civil and air transport official, said the pay offer was a breakthrough. 'I have no doubt we will be recommending it because it's quite a substantial move.' He said the union would be putting the offer to a vote and the result would be known by the end of the week.</p>

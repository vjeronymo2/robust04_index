			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 5-A GIRLS;  </P> <P> MARINA PLAYS GAME COACH'S WAY, ROLLS PAST CANYON SPRINGS, 61-49  </P> <P> Marina High School did everything Coach Pete Bonny figured it would Wednesday  night against Canyon Springs.  </P> <P> The Vikings forced some early turnovers and steered the ball away from the  Cougars' leading scorer, Vanessa Harris.  </P> <P> Then the Vikings built a 10-point lead in the second quarter and held on for a  61-49 victory over Canyon Springs in the first round of the Southern Section  5-A playoffs at the Marina gym.  </P> <P> Bonny said he wanted the Vikings to pressure Canyon Springs' guards and keep  the ball from Harris, who averages 16 points and 11 rebounds a game.  </P> <P> No problem. The Vikings forced 27 Cougar turnovers, including 17 in the first  half, and held Harris to eight points on four-of-10 shooting.  </P> <P> "I was happy with our press," Bonny said. "It caused them problems the entire  game. I watched the film of their game against Edison and I noticed they had  problems with the press."  </P> <P> Marina forced eight early turnovers, but led by only 13-11 at the end of the  first quarter.  </P> <P> "We got a lot of turnovers and the game should have been over," Bonny said. "We  didn't get rattled though. We took a lot of good shots."  </P> <P> Those good shots started to fall in the second quarter.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 16-16, Melisa Sortino made two consecutive three-pointers  to spark a 16-6 run and give Marina a 32-22 halftime lead. Sortino finished  with 18 points.  </P> <P> "That was a big run for us," Bonny said. "Those three-pointers are momentum  starters. That's what got us going."  </P> <P> The Vikings scored the first six points of the third quarter to push the lead  to 38-22. They led by as many as 19 in the fourth quarter and Canyon Springs  came no closer than 11 the rest of the way.  </P> <P> Tina DeMarsh scored a game-high 19 points for Canyon Springs (16-10). Christa  Yorke had 14 points and Gillian Bean added 10 for Marina.  </P> <P> The Vikings (19-7) advanced to the second round Saturday night against Ontario  (26-0), which had a first-round bye.  </P> <P> And that meant one more scouting report for Bonny.  </P> <P> "I've been making some calls about them," he said. "I know they know about us,  because they've been here to scout us. I heard they walk it downcourt and pound  it in. Scouting them will be my job for the next couple of days."  </P> <P> In other 5-A games:  </P> <P> Esperanza 71, Corona 39 -- Host Esperanza (19-4) led, 26-4, in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> Kim Kordik had 22 points and Jennifer Harney added 15 points and eight assists  to lead Esperanza. Andrea Warmus had 11 points for Esperanza.  </P> <P> Orange 53, Diamond Bar 29 -- Orange led, 21-19, at halftime, but outscored  Diamond Bar 19-6 in the third quarter and 13-4 in the fourth.  </P> <P> Nichole Champion scored 14 of her game-high 28 points in the third quarter. She  also made 10 of 10 free throws and had 13 rebounds in the game.  </P> <P> Laurie Sallinger had six assist for the Panthers (17-6).  </P> <P> Amy Fu scored 10 points, eight in the first half for Diamond Bar (12-12).  </P> <P> El Toro 71, Moreno Valley 39 -- El Toro used a full-court press to build a 23-8  lead in the first quarter and led, 43-19, at halftime. The Chargers cleared  their bench in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Karie Yoshioka had 16 points, six assists and seven steals for El Toro.  </P> <P> Sara Bone added 19 points and nine rebounds and Danielle Silva had 15 points  for the Chargers (23-5).  </P> <P> Natanya White had 25 points for Moreno Valley (8-13).  </P> <P> Rubidoux 52, Huntington Beach 48 -- Darlene Wilson, Rubidoux's 6-foot-5  forward, scored 17 points at Rubidoux.  </P> <P> Jana Davis and Dana Jahr each had 15 points for Huntington Beach (9-16), which  made its first playoff appearance since 1982.  </P></p>

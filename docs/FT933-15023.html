			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Science under the microscope: Modern forensics raise serious questions of civil liberty ABOUT 100 years ago, a certain John H Watson, MD, arrived in London and met someone with whom to share lodgings. The doctor was warned that this fellow was a little queer in his ideas: his enthusiasm for science could be bizarre. The two of them met at a hospital's chemical laboratory. At the sound of Watson's approach, he leapt up with a cry. 'I've found it] I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin, and by nothing else. Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years . . . It gives us an infallible test for blood stains . . .' A few days later, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson set up joint residence at 221B Baker Street. 'Holmes was on the right track,' says Robin Keeley, head of the analytical chemistry department at London's Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory (MPFSL). 'My colleagues tell me that Holmes' constant admonitions about too little attention being given to shoeprints can still be appropriate. 'However, Watson was less than prophetic when he claimed Holmes had 'brought detection as near to an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world'.' Robin Keeley and the other 220 scientists at the MPFSL - arguably the most respected laboratory of its kind in the world - are confident of their state-of-the-art tools, techniques and methods of examination. But they are also disturbed by their profession's lack of esteem. As the efficacy of forensic science grew, so did its use, especially as the courts increasingly sought corroborative expert advice in support of circumstantial evidence and confessions obtained by the police. Today, there is hardly any serious crime that is detected that does not involve forensic science. But never has it been so controversial, and nowhere is this truer than in Sherlock Holmes' England, where a royal commission of enquiry into the criminal justice system issued its report this week. The commission was set up in the wake of the March 1991 acquittal of the Birmingham Six, who had spent 16 years in jail for alleged IRA terrorism. Their acquittal was based in large part on the discrediting of forensic evidence. The government said at the time that the inquiry was designed 'to minimise as far as possible the likelihood of such events happening again.' This aim may yet be achieved, but the embarrassment for ministers, police, judges, lawyers and forensic scientists continued almost unabated. In addition to the Birmingham Six, further acquittals saw the release of the Guildford Four, the Maquire Seven and the Tottenham Three, among others. Scientists at the MPFSL say their laboratory was not deeply involved in the now-overturned sensational terrorist convictions of the 1970s. The main forensic evidence for these came from laboratories operated directly by the government. The Metropolitan Police laboratory itself is the only one in Britain, and possibly the world, run directly by the police and with an entirely civilian scientific staff. However, MPFSL scientists agree with their counterparts in government laboratories that the reforms adopted since the 1970s have already provided important extra safeguards in the quality control of forensic examination itself, and in promoting disclosure to the defence of evidence that might be damaging to the prosecution. In the more controversial convictions that were subsequently overturned, evidence had been produced to demonstrate virtually conclusively that some of the defendants had handled explosives. It later emerged that similar results might have been produced by the handling of soap or boot polish. Of all the criticisms levelled at forensic science, the one that draws the most emphatic response from Brian Sheard, director of the MPFSL, is the accusation that forensic scientists are secret and conspiratorial. 'The laboratory is an open organisation,' he says. 'We are obliged by law, and believe it to be right, to make all our results available to the defence. The defence are always welcome here. They are welcome to make their own examinations. Our people will not interfere, except to help.' Conversations with Dr Sheard's staff bear him out. Apart from an understandable refusal to have their photographs taken front-on, and some reluctance to reveal techniques that might help criminals avoid detection, they display an openness in discussing their work that is uncommon in most big companies and government ministries. 'Our role is to put expert evidence and interpretation before the courts,' says Keeley, 'not simply to try to put people in jail. We are scientists, which means we must maintain openness of mind. 'Almost ironically, some of our scientists feel uneasy about doing work only for the defence, because, unlike the prosecution, they are not required to freely make available results that might be embarrassing. To be able to bury inconvenient information sits very uncomfortably with many scientists. 'What people do not generally realise is that a lot of our work involves establishing innocence rather than guilt, to eliminate suspects from investigation, and as early as possible. Nearly 20 per cent of our DNA (genetic profiling) work produces that result.' Although Britain pioneered the development of finger-printing in the second half of the 19th century, modern forensic science was late in arriving in London. Now, the Met's laboratory, in central London, is the largest in Europe, probably the best-equipped, and is renowned for pioneering work in the development of scientific methods applied to crime. It helps to bear in mind three things about the MPFSL's work. First, much of its routine work involves establishing whether a crime has, in fact, been committed. Second, almost all the laboratory's work involves corroborative, not investigative, work. The MPFSL's investigative work centres on only two of its units, both with specialised mobile laboratories and staff. The Serious Crimes Unit can be involved in any major crime - murder, rape, armed robbery - and in many ways, such as applying chemical methods to discover blood stains. However, more than 90 per cent of its work involves discovering and developing latent fingerprints on surfaces such as shiny cars and dull paper such as cheques and airline boarding passes. In turn, the Fire Investigation Unit visits all fire scenes and some types of explosions in which death or serious injury has occured and virtually all where arson is suspected. Third, the corrobative work, while involving sophisticated techniques, is still often analogous to the long-established practice in dealing with fingerprints: comparing in painstaking detail evidence 'lifted' at the scene of a crime with evidence obtained from a suspect. For example, MPFSL scientists can demonstrate with varying degrees of certainty that a minute strand of fibre found at the scene came from a jacket discovered in a suspect's home. They cannot prove that the suspect was at the scene, only that the jacket probably was. Keeley can not only demonstrate that the wearer of that jacket recently discharged a firearm, but also that he carried a cigarette lighter, and therefore probably smoked - or, from certain chemical elements, that he had been involved in the cooking of food, and thus, if a man, might have been living alone. Similarly, a floor down from Keeley, Pam Hamer and her colleagues spend a lot of time peering through microscopes to compare the soles of suspects' shoes with scene-of-crime shoeprints. As with the fingerprint's complex ridges, troughs and swirls, the shoeprint has a complicated pattern of wear, tear, scuffs, nicks and repair marks. The firearms section is headed by Brian Arnold, whose statistics bear out a depressing increase in the criminal use of guns, especially in robbery; here, revolving vices and paired high-powered microscopes compare myriad rifling, breach and firing-pin marks. But there is one department of forensic science where the finger-printing analogy is so marked that it has created a widespread misconception, one so strong as to complicate the already complex debate over the profession's most controversial development since the advert of finger-printing techniques. 'The popular term 'genetic fingerprinting,' which unfortunately is even used by some experts, is misleading,' says Cecelia Buffery, a specialist in the laboratory's DNA section. 'The main trouble seems to be that the early practitioners, especially in the US, made claims that couldn't be substantiated. 'Genetic profiling is still not uniquely identifying, though it may become so as the technology grows.' Until then, it will continue to reflect probabilities, not certainties, though very high probabilities. 'However,' says Buffery, 'this is not to say that DNA profiling is anything less than a very powerful technique.' But controversy remains. It centres on the strength of the probabilities, but includes serious civil liberties questions. For example, should the police have the right to take DNA samples from suspects or those convicted? Should DNA results obtained from innocent people be kept in databases? Some of these questions were addressed in the royal commission's report this week. Among 352 recommendations was a call for an independent forensic science advisory council to oversee standards. While it is hyperbole to say that forensic science is on trial, it is true to say it is under the microscope - and that Watson, though possibly not Holmes, would still be amazed.</p>

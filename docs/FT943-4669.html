			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: New credit cards from Amexco American Express has unveiled the first in a series of new credit cards it plans to launch in coming months, signalling a renewed effort to compete with bank card issuers in the US. The company has seen its share of the plastic card market shrink in recent years as growth in spending on its charge cards has failed to keep up with bank credit cards. Its first revolving credit card, Optima, proved a disaster, forcing the company to take a large bad debt charge in 1991. American Express's latest assault on the credit card market marks the first time it has tried to sell credit cards to people who do not already hold one of its charge cards. It is also a reversal of the earlier 'one-size-fits-all' approach under which the company relied heavily on its standard green charge card. The company plans to launch a range of credit cards, each based on a different combination of annual fee, interest rate, grace period before charging interest and benefits. The card unveiled yesterday, called the Optima True Grace Card, offers a 25-day interest-free period, no fees (provided the card is used at least three times a year) and a low introductory interest rate of 7.9 per cent. The new credit cards, like the recently launched corporate purchasing card, indicate the intentions of Mr Harvey Golub, the company's chairman, to turn American Express back into a high-growth company after a lacklustre period.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Bundesbank warning on 'quick fix' Any attempt to revive German exports and thereby curb domestic unemployment would be the 'wrong medicine', the Bundesbank's chief economist warned last night. Speaking in Frankfurt, Mr Otmar Issing, member of the central bank's policy making council, appeared to be directing his remarks at calls for European countries to slash interest rates as a way of combating unemployment. Mr Issing acknowledged that there had been a sharp fall in German exports since German reunification, and that this had contributed to German unemployment because lay-offs were concentrated in export-oriented industries. Germany's trade surplus has fallen from DM135bn (Pounds 53.50bn) in 1989 to DM34bn last year to DM28bn in the first eight months of the current year. However, he rejected arguments that the fall in exports had been triggered by the strength of the D-Mark, pointing out that measured against the currencies of Germany's 18 most important trading partners the D-Mark had risen by a modest 3 per cent in the past two years, and had fallen by nearly 1 per cent since the end of last year. He blamed the export decline on recession in Germany's most important trading partners. Any attempt to combat the decline in exports by competitive devaluation, would prove illusory, Mr Issing said, as it would only serve to worsen trading partners' recessions and diminish demand for German goods still further. A devaluation would stoke up inflationary pressures and trigger a wage-price spiral which would lead to more, not less inflation. Mr Issing's comments follow Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer's remarks on Wednesday that governments should not try to buy economic recovery by means of rate cuts. Mr Johann Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, however, awakened speculation of further rate cuts in Germany in Paris yesterday. He was quoted as saying Germany was 'over the hump' on inflation and there was scope for further interest rate cuts.</p>

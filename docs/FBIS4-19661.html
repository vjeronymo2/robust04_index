			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Eguiagaray: `We Are on Path of </F> Economic Recovery'"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Industry Minister Juan Manuel  Eguiagaray announced yesterday that the survey of employers on  the industrial climate with respect to demand, output, stocks,  and prices improved by 60 percent between April 1993 and the end  of February 1994. Eguiagaray pointed out with these figures that  "we are in an economic recovery, albeit less rapid than we would  like, but all the indicators show moderate positive growth."    The industry minister denied on the same occasion that the  government will approve fiscal measures to encourage industrial  vehicle sales similar to those approved for private cars which  are 10 years old.    "I have never said that," he stressed, "and I believe that I  clearly denied it when I was asked about in Barcelona, Monday."    Nevertheless, he specified that the government is studying  measures for this kind of vehicle, but that they will never be  of a fiscal nature.  <H5>  Orders </H5>   The minister emphasized that the main element of recovery  during February was foreign trade, but that the domestic trade  balance has also improved considerably. Business prospects are  the most favorable since 1991, the minister stated, with a  5-percent increase in February over January, especially due to  the improvement in orders both from abroad and from the domestic  market.    Eguiagaray emphasized the trend in the demand for power,  which, following the sluggishness of 1993, registered a 0.8  percent increase in the first three months of the year.    On prices and wages, the minister said that the trend in  wages in 1993 was increasingly correct, and stated that the  improvement in industrial competitiveness was a result more of  the reduction in personnel than of the fall in unit labor costs.    The minister drew attention to industrial prices, "since the  recovery," he said, "could lead to a rise in these prices in  1994, although, according to the data at our disposal, it does  not seem that this will happen, and so profit margins should not  increase because of the rise in prices."    The factors which, according to the Industry Ministry,  affect  the favorable trend in the sector are a certain revival of the  Spanish economy, the reform of the labor market, the reduction  of interest rates, the sustained recovery of the U.S. and  British economies, and the positive effects on competitiveness  in the prices of industrial products.

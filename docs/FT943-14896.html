			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tomkins doubts A strong two-way pull in conglomerate Tomkins, brought turnover of 9.4m shares as the market gave a cautious welcome to the group's robust full year figures. Profits jumped 50 per cent to Pounds 257m, in line with forecasts but the 16 per cent increase in the dividend to 7.38p was ahead of expectations. Early demand saw the shares advance to 226p, before a more cautious mood set in following the meeting between the company and City analysts, leaving the shares just  1/2 ahead at 218p. Explaining the retreat, Mr Geoff Allum at NatWest Securities said there was concern in the market at the length of time it was taking to integrate its last big acquisition RHM. In addition; 'there is concern as to how successful the company will be to grow by acquisition in unrelated areas.' However, Mr Allum edged his dividend forecast for the current year slightly forward to 8.5p, and said, 'the negatives are now in the share price.' But Mr Ian Rennardson at stockbroker Yamaichi, was more bullish on Tomkins and said: 'The market's caution is misplaced. The company has delivered the goods on RHM. There is no acquisition needed to show continuing growth.'</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (2): Well set to weather storms - Dollar THE DOLLAR has this year weathered some unexpected economic and political turbulence at home and abroad. This suggests that the US currency may be able to withstand any storms that lie ahead during the rest of 1992. Since January, the dollar has appreciated steadily against the currencies in the D-Mark bloc and against the yen in spite of disruptive and conflicting influences. On the negative side, the dollar been buffeted by a US economy that only recently appeared to be foundering in its attempts to pull away from recession, by declining domestic interest rates pressured lower by Federal Reserve policy eases, and by early and disturbing signs of President Bush's political vulnerability in election year. On the positive side, there has been rising interest rates in a Germany troubled by inflationary pressures and the complex economic and political repercussions of reunification, political turmoil and an apparently collapsing economy in the republics of the former Soviet Union, and economic slowdown and financial crises in Tokyo where stock values have plummeted, institutions have curtailed foreign investments and the seemingly all-powerful growth machine has begun to stall. Against this unsettling background, the dollar has charted an upward path. Since January it has appreciated 4 per cent against both the D-Mark and the yen, and 1.5 per cent against sterling. The view of analysts in New York is to expect a modest appreciation in the dollar over the rest of the year. The main reason for their bullishness is the US economy, which is forecast to grow at a steady rate of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent over the next eight months. In contrast, growth in the main European economies will be slower, while there are enough doubts about the outlook for the Japanese economy to also swing the forecasts in the dollar's favour. On the policy front, US interest rates look as though they have bottomed, while the more sluggish European economies could require some extra stimulus. This means yield differentials between the dollar and the D-Mark - which recently reached historic highs - should finally begin to narrow. There are two threats to this scenario. The Federal Reserve could cut rates once more if it thinks economic growth is not sufficiently robust. The likely trigger would be fresh news of weakness in the jobs market. The other danger is if the Bundesbank proves more hawkish about inflation. If industrial unrest forces employers to grant big pay increases, then the Bundesbank could keep policy tight. The near-term direction of Japanese monetary policy is harder to call. The conventional view is that slowing economic growth and continued financial instability will persuade the Japanese authorities to adopt a more accommodating monetary stance. However, there is an alternative prospect. This is that the policy remains unchanged, or even tightens, as the Japanese government bows to international pressure to reduce its bulging trade surplus by forcing the yen higher. Moreover, the signs are that Japanese fiscal, not monetary, policy will be eased in the immediate future, which could boost confidence in the economy and turn the slide in the growth rate. Add to that further declines in net outflows of Japanese capital (linked to stockmarket losses), and it is plausible that the yen will actually gain against the dollar. A big unknown on the horizon this year is US politics. A Bush victory in the November election, guaranteeing continuity of political and economic policy, would be the best possible outcome for the dollar. (This assumes, of course, that the nation and the financial markets do not fall for the charms of Texan billionaire and can-do businessman/politician Ross Perot, who is preparing to run as an independent.) Analysts have warned, however, not to expect a celebratory post-election surge in the dollar if Bush wins. All the currency risk, therefore, is stacked the other way, with the potential for the dollar to take a big hit at a hint of trouble in the Bush campaign. Yet the chances of a Democrat (or an independent) winning the presidency remain slim, in spite of those early hiccups in Bush's re-election drive. In his favour, Bush has an opposition still divided over the electability of its likely presidential candidate, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and an economy that is showing signs of achieving a sustainable recovery at exactly the right time. The election, however, is far enough away for the markets to ignore it for now. 'I'm not sure electoral expectations are factored into the dollar yet,' says John Lipsky, economist at Salomon Brothers in New York. 'It could be a bit like it was in the UK election, where the markets did not take it seriously until just before polling day.' Thus, barring any disasters felling Bush, the dollar should be free from electoral considerations between now and early autumn. International politics could also leave its mark on the dollar this year. The unstable situation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, has already given a short-term lift to the US currency, which is traditionally the safe haven for investors concerned by global political unrest.</p>

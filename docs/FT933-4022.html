			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Cadbury rises 32% and makes Pounds 324m cash call: Rights issue at 400p to pay for agreed takeover of US soft drinks maker CADBURY Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks company, yesterday launched a Pounds 324m rights issue priced at 400p per share after reporting a 32 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 166.2m in the first half. Most of the proceeds of the 1-for-9 issue are intended to fund a Dollars 334m (Pounds 217m) agreed takeover of A&amp;W Brands, the largest US producer of root beer, also announced yesterday. Acquisition of A&amp;W, which had sales last year of Dollars 130.8m, would raise Cadbury's share of the US soft drinks market by almost two-thirds to 5.6 per cent. The proposed deal follows Cadbury's purchase last month of a further 20 per cent of Dr Pepper, the third largest US soft drinks producer. Cadbury said it was also negotiating the acquisition of an unnamed confectionery business with sales last year of about Pounds 55m and net tangible assets of Pounds 20m. The rights issue, of 82.8m ordinary shares, is not conditional on completion of the A&amp;W purchase. Hoare Govett is stockbroker to the issue, which has been fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. Cadbury's shares closed yesterday unchanged at 470p. The latest pre-tax profits, for the six months to June 19, compare with Pounds 125.9m last time and reflected strong improvements in all regions except continental Europe. Sales increased 16 per cent to Pounds 1.7bn, while group trading margin rose to 10 per cent from 9.6 per cent. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, described the performance as excellent. Though continental markets remain depressed, he was confident that this year would show 'significant progress'. UK trading profit rose 29 per cent to Pounds 79m on particularly strong performances by Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages and Trebor Bassett. In continental Europe, a Pounds 15m loss in Spain due to restructuring costs halved trading profit to Pounds 10m, though soft drinks performed better in France. In the Americas, trading profit rose 56 per cent to Pounds 40m on gains by beverages and the first full year contribution from Aguas Minerales in Mexico. Pacific Rim trading profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 31.3m. Results from Africa rose 39 per cent to Pounds 94.5m. Earnings grew to 12.4p per share (from 10.26p) and the interim dividend is raised to 3.6p from 3.3p. Lex, Page 20; Background, Page 23; Market, Page 42</p>

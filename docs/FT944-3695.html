			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Brussels told to rethink on computer research Europe's leading computing services companies have told the European Commission that funds earmarked for basic computer technology research would be better spent on information services to run on the 'digital superhighway'. The Services Informatics Expertise advisory group (SIX) says that unless resources are made available quickly, Europe will fall behind countries, such as the US, in laying the foundations of the information society. The advisory group's 11 members include Cap Sogeti Gemini and Sligos of France, Sema Group and Logica of the UK, and Finsiel of Italy. Together, they have some 60,000 employees and annual revenues in excess of Ecu 6bn (Pounds 4.6bn). Their proposals are a response to a report by Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, which encouraged Europe's information technology companies to seize opportunities presented by the information society. The Commission has already agreed to spend Pounds 2.6bn over the next five years on basic research in information technology. SIX's chief proposal is that funds should be available to pump prime the early stages of large projects. Governments, companies and customers should work together to identify service needs. If there is no obvious customer for a service, the commission should take that role to help create demand. The type of project might include a system to exchange environmental information held on different databases. Acceptance of the SIX proposals would mean an abrupt change of strategy for the Commission, whose Framework research programme provides 50 per cent funding for 'pre-competitive' research, to provide a common pool of knowledge and expertise.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Crime Rate Falls, Especially in </F> South"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- The rise in Italy's  crime rate came to a sudden halt in 1993, with murders down by  27 percent and robberies by 2.9 percent, and major improvements  in the south, according to Interior Ministry figures released  Thursday [31 March].    The number of murders committed in southern regions fell by  301 to 736 last year, against a drop of just 89 in the rest of  the country.    The southern regions remain, however, at the top of the  charts as far as murders per 100,000 people go, with Calabria  boasting six, and Sicily five. On a province level, Reggio  Calabria comes in first with 12 slayings per 100,000 people.    Robberies were also down in the south, falling 32.4 percent  in the north-western region of Val D'Aosta, 18.6 percent in the  southern Calabria region, and 7.5 percent in Sicily.    Sicily still leads the field as far as robberies are  concerned, however, with 137 per 100,000 inhabitants. Puglia  follows, with 65. Forty-seven percent of all Italian robberies  took place in the south. [passage omitted]</p>

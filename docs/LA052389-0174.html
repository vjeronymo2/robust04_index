			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. RALLY AT WORLD CUP TENNIS SHUTS OUT SWISS  </P> <P> Tim Mayotte and Aaron Krickstein both lost first sets but rallied to lead the  United States past Switzerland at the World Team Cup tennis tournament today.  </P> <P> Mayotte overcame Jakob Hlasek 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, while Krickstein outlasted Claudio  Mezzadri 5-7, 6-4, 6-0.  </P> <P> Already holding an unbeatable 2-0 lead, the U.S. team completed a 3-0 sweep in  its opening group match when Rick Leach and Jim Pugh beat Jakob Hlasek and  Heinz Guenthardt 6-3, 6-4 in the doubles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> W. Germany Beats Spain  </P> <P> In the other Blue Group match, West Germany, using the same team that won the  Davis Cup last season, beat Spain 2-1.  </P> <P> Boris Becker, ranked second in the world, beat Javier Sanchez 6-3, 6-3 to put  West Germany ahead.  </P> <P> Spain pulled even when Jordi Arrese, a semifinalist at last week's Italian  Open, upset Carl-Uwe Steeb 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> The West Germans clinched their opening match when Becker and Eric Jelen  defeated Sanchez and Sergio Casal 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 in the decisive doubles.  </P> <P> The eight teams taking part in the weeklong tournament are split into two  groups. After a round-robin competition, the two top teams from each group  advance to the semifinals.  </P> <P> In the Red Group on Monday, Sweden trounced Czechoslovakia 3-0 and Argentina  beat Australia 2-1.  </P> <P> In Geneva, top-seeded Chris Evert defeated qualifier Sabine Hack of West  Germany 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) today in the first round of the Geneva European Open  women's tennis tournament.  </P> <P> In earlier first-round action, U.S. qualifier Shaun Stafford ousted  second-seeded Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union 6-3, 7-6 (6-3).  </P> <P> But Zvereva, last year's French Open surprise finalist and currently ranked  fifth in the world, did not seem overly disappointed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Entered in Doubles  </P> <P> "I entered the tournament to play the doubles," the 18-year-old Zvereva said.  "I didn't know that the WITA (Women's International Tennis Assn.) rules say you  can't play only doubles at a tournament.  </P> <P> "I was surprised to play the singles, though it's not the only reason for my  defeat since I was never really sure of my shots."  </P> <P> Stafford, 20, of Gainesville, Fla., is ranked 92nd worldwide and has been a pro  only since February.  </P> <P> "It was my biggest win but not my best match. I was pleased that I wasn't as  nervous as usual," she said.  </P> <P> Also upset in first-round play was seventh-seeded Sandra Cecchini of Italy, who  lost to Karin Kschwendt of Luxembourg 6-2, 3-6, 7-5.  </P> <P> Defending champion Barbara Paulus of Austria advanced to the second round with  a 6-2, 6-1 rout of South Africa's Dinky Van Rensburg.  </P></p>

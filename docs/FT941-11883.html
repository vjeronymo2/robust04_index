			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Smith pledges not to nationalise Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday gave the party's modernisers a significant boost by ruling out renationalisation and linking improved social services firmly to economic growth. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Smith also gave a clear endorsement of the profit motive and insisted that Labour could deliver a fairer Britain without big tax increases. 'I do not believe the government should run industry or own industry. But I do believe the government has got to work with industry. We have got to create a partnership,' he told the Daily Mirror. 'I want companies to be prosperous, to make profits, to pay their workers well. And I want them to be a success story for Britain,' he said. Mr Smith said a future Labour government would introduce a fairer tax system which would remove much of the burden from 'ordinary people.' But he warned that the party would be unable to deliver improvements in public services unless it succeeded in promoting a sustained economic recovery. 'If we get good steady economic growth we can afford good social services,' he said. 'If we don't get good economic growth we can't. It is as simple as that.' Mr Smith's comments will give heart to Labour's modernisers, led by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, who favour undogmatic policies focusing on good economic management. However, the interview will dismay leftwing groups, which last week tabled a Commons motion calling for a commitment to more traditional Labour policies. Mr Smith was scathing about the Conservative record on taxation, which had opened up opportunities for Labour to win support for its pro-posals for a 'fairer' tax system. 'It is the Tories who are the dogmatic party now,' he said. 'Privatisation has gone too far. I cannot find anybody who believes in railway privatisation. It is almost as if this government is going around saying - what can we do to annoy you?'</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR 32,000 CHINESE STUDENTS TO STAY IN U.S.  </P> <P> The House on Monday approved legislation making it easier for an estimated  32,000 Chinese students residing in the United States to remain here and avoid  persecution in their homeland.  </P> <P> On a voice vote, the House backed a measure by California Rep. Nancy Pelosi  (D-San Francisco) deleting a visa requirement that such students return to  China for two years before becoming eligible to apply for permanent residency  in the United States.  </P> <P> "It's clear that many of the Chinese students in this country have some fear  about returning to the People's Republic at this time," Rep. Jack Brooks  (D-Tex.) said. "They shouldn't be forced to go back to certain persecution, and  this is the least we can do."  </P> <P> The Senate passed similar legislation last month as an amendment to a sweeping  overhaul of U.S. immigration laws. For final passage, the Senate must either  act on the House-passed bill or the House must agree to the Senate amendment  when it considers the immigration legislation.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has opposed the measure as overly broad.  </P> <P> Last month, Bush ordered Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to  delay by 12 months the required departure of Chinese students whose visas had  expired and to give "sympathetic review" on a case-by-case basis to those  individuals who want to stay even longer.  </P> <P> Pelosi's measure is one of several that have surfaced in Congress in the  aftermath of the June crackdown by Chinese officials on pro-democracy students  in Beijing. Like the Senate amendment, her proposal would offer long-term aid  to those who supported the democracy movement and now fear persecution if they  are forced to return to China.  </P> <P> Currently, there are about 40,000 Chinese students in the United States, and  32,000 of them have "J" category visas, which require them to return to their  homeland for two years before becoming eligible to apply for permanent  residency in this country, according to the INS.  </P> <P> The requirement is intended to avert a "brain drain" of students from foreign  countries, most of whom receive some financial assistance from their  governments to study here. Pelosi's bill would lift that requirement for  Chinese students living in the United States on the date of enactment, but  would keep it in place for other foreign students.  </P></p>

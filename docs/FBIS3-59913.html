The most important of the documents to be signed is the  heads  of governments' memorandum of mutual understanding on questions  of ensuring the functioning of the Baykonur space center. As  Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin explained in conversation  with your correspondent, the governments have been able to agree  on the main principle: Russia will use the space center under  lease from Kazakhstan. This principle also extends to the  military test sites located on Kazakh territory. Russian  specialists and military contingents will be based there and  equipment will be deployed there. Russian law will apply at the  leased installations, apparently side by side with Kazakhstani  law. Chernomyrdin stressed that the principle is reciprocal:  Kazakhstan may maintain its military installations in Russia on  the same terms.    The actual conditions of the lease -- the scale of payment  and the term -- have not been decided yet, but Shokhin has noted  that in his view the optimum lease on Baykonur would run for 99  years.    Answering a question from your IZVESTIYA correspondent,  Chernomyrdin said that work to ensure the functioning of  Baykonur could begin "right away" without waiting for the  signing of the concretizing documents, which is due to take  place in January.    The situation which has developed at the space center as a  result of the uncertainty over its status has now led to extreme  consequences. This unique complex, which belongs not only to  Kazakhstan and Russia but also to all mankind, is in a very  sorry state. Some of the launch installations have become unfit  for use [okazalis razmorozhennymi], some of the equipment has  been put out of commission, while some has simply been stolen.    The settlement of the question of ownership is no less  important for other military sites too. A completely  paradoxical situation, according to Shokhin, has developed with  regard to the strategic nuclear weapon basing zones: Ballistic  missiles which have been declared the property of Kazakhstan  continue to be serviced by the Russian military! However, such  a situation with regard to nuclear weapons is not just  nonsensical, it is downright dangerous.    In Shokhin's words, the question of the ownership of the  uranium component of the nuclear missiles stationed in  Kazakhstan and subject to dismantling was also discussed. It is  proposed that Russia will take part in the actual process of  dismantling. In addition, the reprocessing of the highly  enriched "military" uranium will also be carried out in Russia  because only Russia has the necessary technologies.</p>

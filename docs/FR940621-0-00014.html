This rule prescribes the nature and quality of liability insurance to protect HAs and contractors performing this work for HAs. The rule is being issued to comply with directions in the Department's appropriation act for Fiscal Year 1992 to adopt regulations specifying the nature and quality of insurance to cover HAs in the performance of this work.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  July 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  John Comerford, Director, Financial Management Division, Office of Assisted Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;1872.

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520) and approved under OMB control number 2577&hyph;0187, which is valid through August 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. HUD Contract Requirements for Insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under their Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) or Mutual Help Annual Contributions Contract (MHACC) with HUD, Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) (hereinafter referred to as HAs) must carry adequate (1) owner's, landlord's, and tenant's public liability insurance; and (2) manufacturer's and contractor's public liability insurance (both now combined and referred to by the insurance industry as commercial general liability insurance). When the conditions of the ACC or MHACC were formulated in 1969, it was not anticipated that there was any reason to address the issue of bodily injury due to the ingestion of lead-based paint, since the health hazard of this chemical was not well-known. Also, at that time, no pollution exclusion in the general liability policy was thought to apply to claims of this nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, during subsequent years, as environmental claims started arising, insurance companies began to exclude pollution and environmental liability; and it is the opinion of most insurance companies that, since lead is a chemical which is included in the definition of a ``pollutant'', claims arising from lead poisoning are excluded from current policies. However, some courts have differed with the insurance companies' position on pollution exclusions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAs are engaging in lead-based paint testing and abatement, often funded by HUD under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program or Comprehensive Grant Program, which support rehabilitation work needed to improve the condition of public housing units. The Department published a document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to guide these activities, entitled ``Lead-Based Paint: Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement in Public and Indian Housing'' (55 FR 14556, April 18, 1990, and revised 55 FR 39874, September 28, 1990, and 56 FR 21556, May 9, 1991). Use of these guidelines is the subject of other program regulations and notices of funding availability, and it is not addressed in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

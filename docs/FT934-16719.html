			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Observer: A way with water When Bob Thian left school at 16 with two years to kill before being allowed to take up his university place, he initially played jazz at a night club. Tiring of that, he then took himself off to Geneva University where he had intended just to try a few law courses. He didn't return to the UK to work until he was head-hunted for the top job at North West Water some 30 years later. In a hurry now as then, Thian is bound shortly for Mexico to celebrate his latest international deal, providing water services to 2m inhabitants of Mexico City. North West is already immersed in projects from Malaysia to Australia, easily outstripping its other UK rivals on the international stage. One other British company has bid on every deal in which North West has taken part, and has yet to win anything. Working first in Switzerland as a barrister, Thian then spent 23 years in the pharmaceuticals business, with Glaxo, Abbott Laboratories of the US and the Danish company Novo Industri. When the head-hunters called about North West Water, he says he thought they were having him on. Soon warming to a new industry, he attributes his globe-trotting success to 'team work' and a 'dislike of losing'. Building what he calls 'a portfolio of regulators' to reduce dependence on the UK authorities, he has focused on 10 more countries into which he wants to take North West, five of which he admits are 'very long-term' prospects, with just one staffer beavering away. Picked for their political and economic stability, these potential project locations were selected shortly before the April 1992 domestic elections. If North West had been judging Britain by the criteria it applied to the others, this country would not have been one of the chosen.</p>

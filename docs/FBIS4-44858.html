One of these, isolated from a dog's stomach, is particularly  effective for activating pancreatic secretions--which, when  absent or insufficient, causes many human maladies, among them  cystic fibrosis, a very frequent and severe hereditary  affliction affecting in Europe one child in 2,500.    In order to produce this lipase industrially, in other words  to "graft" this animal gene into the chromosomes of an organism  capable to synthesize cheaply large amounts of the corresponding  protein, the researchers could choose among a number of  solutions. Among them, there is one using microorganisms and  farmed "transgenic" animals (in whose genotype the alien gene is  to be introduced), a solution applied by many industrial  research laboratories for producing pharmaceutical substances)  (LE MONDE 18 September 1991).    For technical and financial reasons equally, Jouveinal has  finally opted for the vegetal. According to the company's  director, Pierre Le Sourd, "When compared to animal  biotechnologies, the production of therapeutic enzymes through  plants offers better safety guaranties against viral  contamination, while providing a very cost-effective, large  scale production." Advantages even more valuable can be derived  from transforming genetically tobacco or, even better, rapeseed  plants into true "molecule factories," by a method developed  recently at Limagrain, the world's third largest seed production  facility, in a fashion common to many other international  associations.    By deciding to join their know-how, the two enterprises have  concluded a four-year agreement and set aside about 20 million  French francs for the project. They hope to obtain a  productivity of one kg purified lipase per hectare of rapeseed.  Limagrain will be responsible for the plants' genetic  manipulation, the cultivation of the fields, and for the first  stages of extracting the lipase. Jouveinal will be charged with  enzyme purification, studying its biological activity, and with  monitoring the medicine's--hoped for--safety and performance  against the digestive attacks (symptoms) of cystic fibrosis.    Relatively easy to manipulate genetically, the rapeseed is a  storage organism with a natural metabolism totally geared for  protein production. Its use, therefore, appears particularly  well adapted for producing molecules of industrial or  therapeutic interests.    Well versed in vegetal transformation technology, Limagrain  has also concluded a cooperation agreement with the Regional  Blood Transformation Center (CRTS), on 9 May in Lille, with the  objective of producing, via plants, certain human proteins  existing in the blood (albumin, alpha-1-antitrypsine, hemostatic  factor).</p>

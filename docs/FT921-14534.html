			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / The Guinness Trial: Seelig cites share move by Warburg THE apparently unannounced purchases by SG Warburg, the main adviser to the government in the BT flotation, of Pounds 115m of BT shares was raised when the Guinness trial resumed at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. Mr Roger Seelig, a former corporate finance director at the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, produced an article from The Times in which the Warburg dealing was described as 'effectively a legalised share support scheme'. Mr Seelig put the article to Mr Graham Walsh, former Morgan Grenfell head of corporate finance. Mr Walsh said he had read about the matter and his reaction had been 'bewilderment that it should be possible to do that'. He said he found it hard to see 'how it squares with the sort of circumstances we are discussing here'. Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, deny fraud and false-accounting charges arising from an allegedly unlawful share support operation mounted by Guinness during its 1986 takeover battle for Distillers. Part of the case concerns the non-disclosure of purchases made to support Guinness's share price. Mr Seelig said it appeared that Warburg had spent Pounds 115m on supporting the BT share price in the market. 'Here is the government using an adviser to stabilise the share price in the market and not feeling obligated to make any announcement of such dealings, even though they constitute 15 per cent of the trading in that stock for the entire month,' Mr Seelig said. Suggesting that Mr Walsh, a former director-general of the Takeover Panel, had unparalleled experience of City regulation, he asked if, assuming the article was correct, Mr Walsh believed Warburg or the government should have been giving details of the dealings on a daily basis. Mr Walsh said that as he did not know the full facts he could not comment. He assumed that the government or its advisers would have had legal advice that there was nothing wrong or in breach of the law. Mr Seelig asked if any authority had accused Warburg of creating a false market. No, said Mr Walsh. Had anyone suggested that the failure to announce such dealings was a breach of the Financial Services Act? Mr Seelig asked. Mr Walsh said that all he had seen was comment that the dealings had not been disclosed. The trial continues today.</p>

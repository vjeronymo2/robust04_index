			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Must Act With Discretion" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  Thursday [21 April] began to deploy new-type Patriot missiles in  the central sector of the front after shipping them into South  Korea despite the resolute protest and denunciation from the  Korean people and broad world public, according to Seoul-based  radio No. 1.    This is an open challenge to the DPRK. It is aimed at posing  military threat to the DPRK and mounting a preemptive strike on  it.    The United States began to deploy the Patriot in the central  sector of the front, while crying over "threat of attack" from  the North. This is a dangerous, deliberate military action to  make the situation on the Korean peninsula more unstable and,  further, ignite a new war.    The deployment of Patriot missiles in broad daylight shows  that the U.S. authorities remain indifferent to the armistice  agreement and the armistice body and readily reverse any  commitment in order to attain their aggressive design.    The U.S. imperialists must act with discretion, clearly  mindful what grave consequences would arise from the deployment  of the Patriot in South Korea which poses a grave threat to  peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the Far East.</p>

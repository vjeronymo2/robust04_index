			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ulrich Rosenbaum report: "SPD Election Campaign Between </F> Heaven and Earth"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] considers the withdrawal of Serb positions round Sarajevo  under NATO pressure to be progress and a success following a  deterrent strategy that ought to have been employed much  earlier. Yet, the SPD continues to oppose the use of Bundeswehr  troops in missions outside NATO territory. This was stated by  Bundestag Group Chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose, talking to DIE WELT.  Klose, who is responsible for the foreign policy part of the  SPD government program, referred to the existing party  conference resolutions that do not allow any participation in  peacekeeping missions. "But I expect that the Federal  Constitutional Court will decide on the SPD complaint in May or  June. We will then take it from there," Klose said.    Klose, who is personally in favor of full German  participation in peacekeeping missions, excludes a Bundeswehr  mission in former Yugoslavia for "historic reasons." The  presence of German troops would not only make the conflict in  the Balkans more difficult to solve, but it would also create  new potential for conflict. "There is complete agreement with  the chancellor in this respect," Klose said. At the same time,  he criticized Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who -- for tactical  reasons in connection with the election campaign -- acts as if  the Germans were being requested to assist right away. "We are  withdrawing from Somalia, a German mission in former Yugoslavia  is out of the question, and there are no further demands in  sight. There is, therefore, no obligation to act," Klose said.    Rudolf Scharping's chief foreign policy expert positively  judged the fact "that the Russians are back as an active  superpower." Everyone is profiting from this: NATO and the  United States because this has made an air strike on the  surroundings of Sarajevo superfluous; the Russians because this  success is a success for Yeltsin, which strengthens his domestic  policy standing. "The Russians have proved to be part of the  forces interested in stability," Klose said. At the same time  he criticized the "fearmongering" among the nationalists  surrounding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy; fear of the Russians has a  long tradition in Germany and is currently being irresponsibly  stirred up by the media.    For the debate on the SPD government program, the draft of  which is to be presented in four weeks' time, Klose has worked  out an eight-page foreign policy paper that is to be reduced to  a page and a half in final editing. "This is not the foremost  topic in this election year," the SPD group chairman said. In  spite of all the common principles the SPD shares with the  government, which Chairman Scharping emphasized in Munich  recently, the paper will point out that in solving international  conflicts, the SPD does not primarily think in military and  diplomatic terms, but wants to tackle the reasons for the  conflicts first. "As long as Europe is divided into poor and  rich, there will always be conflicts," Klose said.    Against this background, the SPD has suggested extending the  NATO Partnership for Peace offer to the former East Bloc  countries to a "Partnership for Development" program. This  suggestion has been welcomed by the Polish government. The SPD  wants to keep NATO and the Western European Union as security  instruments, but by linking various levels of dialogue, it wants  to achieve "a completely new security infrastructure" in the  long run. In this process, the Conference for Security and  Cooperation in Europe could gain new significance.</p>

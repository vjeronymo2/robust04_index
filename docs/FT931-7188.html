			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Bonds: EC and National Bank of Hungary raise DM3.9bn THE European Community and the National Bank of Hungary between them raised a total of DM3.9bn in the international bond market yesterday. The rapid placement of both seven-year issues reflected the strong demand for D-Mark-denominated paper and fanned expectations that more borrowers would tap this sector in the near-term. The Kingdom of Belgium is studying proposals from various banks for a planned DM600m offering with a maturity of seven or 10 years, and is expected to make a decision by the beginning of next week. Dresdner Bank, lead-manager of the EC's DM2.9bn offering, said that demand across the board allowed the bonds to be priced to yield 8 basis points above the 7 1/4 per cent bund due January 2000, at the lower end of the indicated range of 8 to 10 basis points. He added that German institutions had also shown interest in the EC bonds despite their lack of yield pick-up over domestic bonds. He said they were attracted by the high quality of the borrower and by Dresdner's promise to ensure liquidity in the bonds by quoting a bid-offer spread in the bonds of just 5 basis points. When the bonds were freed to trade, they were quoted around their re-offer price of 99.75. Hungary's DM1bn issue carried a yield spread of 265 basis points above the same underlying bunds as in the EC's issue. An official at the lead-manager, Deutsche Bank, said the bonds were mainly placed in the German retail market. After the syndicate broke, the bonds were quoted around 99.05, inside fees. The offering, Hungary's largest ever in the international bond market, is part of the country's programme to borrow Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn abroad in 1993 to help service a foreign debt of Dollars 21.9bn. It also marks an increasing reliance on the international capital markets by the country, which carries a Ba1/BB+ rating, putting it just below investment grade. The International Monetary Fund froze a special credit facility to Hungary last summer after the country's public-sector deficit broke through agreed limits. Deutsche Bank also arranged a Dollars 200m five-year offering for United Mexican States, the premier credit among Latin American borrowers. The deal, the issuer's first Eurobond issue since the 1970s, will be priced today to yield 208 basis points above the when-issued five-year US Treasuries. Elsewhere, Peugeot Talbot Motor Company tapped the Eurosterling market for the first time since 1981 with a Pounds 100m four-year offering, priced to yield 90 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent 1997 UK government bonds. Syndicate managers involved in the deal said the fact that Peugeot's long-term debt was not rated proved a drawback when placing the paper. The bonds were not freed to trade by late yesterday. The day's other French borrower was Caisse Autonome de Refinancement, a public mortgage-refinancing body linked to the Caisse des Depots, which raised FFr3bn. The maturity of six-and-a-half-years matched CAR's loans and when the bonds were freed to trade, their yield over the 8 1/8 OATs due 1999 tightened to 28 from 30 basis points at launch. Late in the day, Exxon Capital Corp awarded a mandate for a 10-year Dollars 250m offering to Kidder Peabody. The bonds are expected to be priced to yield 16 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. National Australia Bank raised ADollars 100m through a five-year offering, priced to yield 34 basis points over government bonds. The spread tightened later in the day to 29 basis points. Meanwhile, Tuesday's ADollars 150m bond issue by Treasury Corp of Victoria was bid at 98.75, above the net price to underwriters of 98.35.</p>

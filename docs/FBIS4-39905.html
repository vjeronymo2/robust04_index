			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian State Duma Committee on International  Affairs may adopt a resolution disapproving of the decision by  the U.S. House of Representatives to lift the arms embargo  against Bosnia, the committee's chairman Vladimir Lukin said  today.    He told a news conference in Moscow that the decision made  by  U.S. parliamentarians could have a negative impact on the  Bosnian talks.    Lukin said he intended to propose that representatives of  the  U.S. and Russian parliamentary committees on international  affairs meet in order to discuss the situation.    However, next week the State Duma will consider at the  second  reading the draft law on the unilateral lifting of sanctions  against the rump Yugoslavia by Russia.</p>

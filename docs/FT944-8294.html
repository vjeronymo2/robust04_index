			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Cracker's new three-part story, Men Should Weep, starts tonight (9pm, ITV). The shrink with a drink is superlatively well played by Robbie Coltrane, proving the old axiom that stand-up comedy is the best training for a serious actor. The mood is uncompromisingly dour, from the unlovely Mersey accents to the unlovely attitudes of some convincingly nasty coppers, given to such bibulous pleasantries as 'You're twisted and you're a pairvairt and you'll make a blody good policeman.' A warning: there are two rapes in tonight's episode. Light relief from the Fourth Estate in C4's Cutting Edge: Absolutely Marie Claire (9pm) which takes an unflinching look at a glossy woman's magazine. Otherwise, apart from Martin Chuzzlewit (9.30pm, BBC2), dreariness abounds. Barry Norman's blowsy autopilot chirpiness in Film 94 is now tawdry enough to be camply cultish (11.05 BBC1). And a Late Show special, Forgotten Land - Tales from Albania (11.15pm BBC2), describes a poverty-stricken country seeking a cultural identity.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Alcatel Alsthom Expected To Acquire 17 Percent of </F> Framatome"]    [Text] Framatome's revamped capital structure is beginning  to take shape. In an interview published Monday 14 February by  LES ECHOS, Phillippe Rouvillois, administrator general of the  CEA [Atomic Energy Commission] and head of CEA Industrie--which  as owner of a 36 percent interest in Framatome is the the  nuclear boiler maker's biggest public-sector  shareholder--described in broad outline the purpose of  negotiations now under way with Alcatel Alsthom.    In accordance with the wishes expressed by the state (LE  MONDE of 23-24 January), "it is envisaged that public-sector  participation will be reduced to that of a blocking minority,"  or 34 percent of the stock, Mr. Rouvillois confirmed. EDF  [French Power Company] will keep its current 10 percent share,  he said. On the other hand, according to Mr. Rouvillois, CEA-I  is expected to transfer "a little more than 10 percent of  Framatome's stock," reducing its own interest to less than 25  percent, while Credit Lyonnais surrenders its 5 percent holding.    The state, which now controls Framatome indirectly with its  51 percent share, will give up 17 percent and offer it to  Alcatel-Alsthom, Mr. Rouvillois said. In the past,  Alcatel-Alsthom, owner of a 44 percent interest in Framatome,  had been keen to acquire the additional 7 percent of stock  needed to constitute a 51 percent controlling interest. Could it  be that Mr. Suard's group is being backed into a corner?</p>

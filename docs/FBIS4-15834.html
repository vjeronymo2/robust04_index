			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, Apr 11, BNS -- Russia holds the opinion  that the incident over President Boris Yeltsin's order to  establish military bases in Latvia was exhausted with Moscow's  official apology. The Latvian side, on the other hand, is  determined to achieve that the text of the executive order will  be changed.    "We've given the necessary explanations and see no reason  why  we should once more return to a closed issue," Sergei Prikhodko,  a Foreign Ministry official in charge of Baltic affairs, said  Monday [11 April] in a telephone interview to BNS. "Also, we've  not been officially informed by Latvia that it holds a different  view," he said.    Latvian officials, however, state that the case hasn't been  closed yet. The Latvian Foreign Ministry declared after  Russia's explanations that, in view of Moscow having already  partly acknowledged the error of Yeltsin's order, "a logical  step would be to either revoke or amend it."    "Under Russian laws, the order takes effect on April 13,  with  which Latvia of course cannot agree," Peteris Vinkelis, first  secretary of the Latvian Embassy in Moscow, told BNS.    Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis announced on Friday that he  indefinitely postpones his visit to Moscow originally set for  April 20. The two countries planned in the course of the visit  to sign a package of bilateral agreements on the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Latvia. Ulmanis also said the initialed  agreements are "unfavorable for Latvia."    BNS has information that the Russian side intends to work  out  an altered version of the executive order. Changing the text of  the order is linked with difficulties, however, since the heads  of the country's defense and foreign political departments as  well as the president are absent from Moscow.    The presidential staff are also determined to find out the  reason for the mistake in the executive order. Sergei  Krasavchenko, deputy chief of the president's office, even  conjectured in an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency that  "the mistake was not technical but a political act with the aim  of foiling the meeting between the two countries' heads of  state."</p>

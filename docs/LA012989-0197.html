			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAYING SOMEONE TO DO THE SHOPPING  </P> <P> I have just finished reading your article about Select Shopping Services and  the job that this "operation" is doing ("Shopper Buys Office Supplies for  Clients Too Busy to Bother," Jan. 18). I couldn't believe the content of the  article. It is certainly a condemnation of both middle and top management; the  idea of a corporation being willing to pay $23 for someone to "shop" for them.  I, for one, ran my own business for 35 years. If we needed anything for our  office in the way of office supplies, I would note it immediately, then stop at  any one of half a dozen office supply stores that were on the way home and at  which I had previously opened charge accounts, and get our needs. These would  remain in my car until the next day, when I would remove them and deliver them  to my secretary at 8 a.m. This beats the delivery offered by the local  stationer, which usually would take another day or two, but still cost nothing.  </P> <P> I just can't see where a sane office manager, acting in the best interests of  his employer and/or the shareholders, could engage the services of the sort  described in your article. You specifically mention ITT. How the selection of  services of this sort ever got the OK in a supposedly well-run company like ITT  is unfathomable. What a waste of shareholders' money. Now, admittedly, the  "unheated warehouse" type of operations do price some of their merchandise a  bit lower, but a bit of shopping will generally show that the lack of  completeness ultimately forces most office managers into purchasing from houses  with a more complete line.  </P> <P> I guess Barnum was right.  </P> <P> WAYNE RIVES  </P> <P> El Toro  </P> <P>  Send letters to Orange County Business Editor, Los Angeles Times, P.O.

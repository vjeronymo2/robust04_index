			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANY RIGHT ON REFUGEES, GORBACHEV AIDE SAYS  </P> <P> A senior adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Sunday that East  Germany made the right decision in letting East German refugees go to the West.  </P> <P> "I believe the leadership in East Germany made the correct decision, in the  interests of the people and of the state," said Valentin M. Falin, who advises  Gorbachev on German affairs.  </P> <P> Thousands of East Germans arrived on special trains in West Germany from Prague  and Warsaw on Sunday. In an interview with the West German newspaper Die Welt,  released ahead of publication today, Falin was asked if Moscow is following  developments in East Germany with concern.  </P> <P> "I would say that there are such phases in the development of all countries --  including West Germany. They can certainly cause reflection and also some  concern," he replied.  </P> <P> Falin said Gorbachev would have a message for the two German states when he  visits East Berlin next week for celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of  East Germany.  </P> <P> "This is a very important time. . . . This time must be used as productively as  possibly by all states in Europe in order to ensure a better future for Europe  as a whole," he said.  </P> <P> Referring to Gorbachev's oft-repeated theme of the "common European house,"  Falin said East and West should work together to build such a house in which no  one felt disadvantaged.  </P> <P> "Every state must have its comfortable accommodation, including East Germany --  certainly, a house with open doors and fresh air," he added.  </P></p>

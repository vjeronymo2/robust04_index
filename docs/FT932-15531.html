			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Calling in the experts - How do you know when the time has come to hire a finance director? It was Tony Cotton's bank manager who suggested the time had come for him to employ a full-time finance director. Cotton's business, Logistic Support Consultants, had grown so quickly that its Pounds 200,000 overdraft was starting to creak under the strain and the company was in need of an injection of outside equity. LSC provides advice, training and software services to help companies minimise the running costs of plant, vehicle fleets and computers. Based in Tamworth, Staffordshire, it expects to double sales to Pounds 2m this year and increase staff numbers by half to 45. Fearful that an advertisement would produce too many replies to be manageable, Cotton asked his company's accountant if he could recommend anyone. The result was that Alex Norton, finance director with an investment company until it was taken over, is due to join LSC as finance director designate in a week's time. 'We realise now we should have appointed a finance director two years ago,' says Cotton. 'We were considering bringing in an outside investor and our cashflow was under pressure. We were being bombarded with advice. The bank said one thing, our accountant said something else and our potential investors something else again. We couldn't see the wood for the trees.' LSC is not alone in this experience. It is common for companies, particularly those set up by entrepreneurs without financial expertise, to find their accounting systems under pressure as business expands. 'Finance is a crucial function in today's climate,' says John Woodcock, joint managing director of Robert Half, a financial recruitment agency. 'A company must have its hands on the purse-strings.' In the early stages businesses often rely on their auditors to provide financial advice but they may not be available when they are needed and will not have the same commitment. It can also prove expensive to use an outside accountant for regular financial advice once the business starts to grow. But this does not automatically mean that a small or medium-sized business requires someone with the title, salary and perks of a finance director. 'We see people take on a finance director when what they really need is a financial controller,' comments Chris Maidment, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. It may be tempting to have someone with an impressive set of initials after their name but too senior a figure may not be prepared to get down to the details required to manage the finances of a small business. 'Someone who has been high up in a professional firm may not want to roll up his shirt-sleeves,' says Maidment. The precise title a company gives to its financial specialist will depend on the style of the business, says David Wise, a consultant who has been signed up by the Institute of Directors to run its first course for would-be finance directors. 'It is not important if he is formally on the board as long as he is close to the managing director.' It often makes sense to employ a fully qualified accountant but on a part-time basis. Jo Frost has worked for a number of small businesses - typically with sales of Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m and a dozen employees - on a part-time basis and has just started working for a small marketing company one day a week. Frost, who trained and worked for two of the big accountancy firms before going freelance, has the job of taking the company's raw management accounts and presenting them in a form suitable for the annual audit. 'A qualified accountant can also help with tax questions and budgets,' she says. Some companies are tempted to use non-executive directors with a financial background to back up a weak executive finance director but this is not a good idea, suggests Bruce Rhodes, a director of Pro-Ned, which recruits non-executive directors for companies. 'This is not the role of a non-executive director,' comments Rhodes. 'He should be able to give general guidance on issues such as fund raising, corporate finance and treasury issues but he should not be used for operational activities.' The stage at which a company requires a full-time, professionally qualified finance director (there is no legal requirement for a finance director to have an accountancy qualification) depends on its size and on the complexity of its financial affairs. Some companies will require a finance director when turnover reaches Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m but others go to Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m before it becomes necessary, says Jeff Grant, joint managing director at Robert Half. Jerry Brand, founder and managing director of Russell &amp; Brand, a five-year-old contract catering company with sales of Pounds 15m, says he realised he needed good accounting controls from an early stage to handle the large amounts of cash coming in daily from his company's canteens and restaurants. Brand took on a retired accountant for one day a week to manage his cash books. As the company and the job expanded, the accountant became full-time finance director but two years ago decided for himself that a younger man was needed. The accountant stayed on as company secretary but Brand advertised for a new finance director. He chose Simon Newth from the more than 20 people who replied to the advertisement 'because he was not just a figures man. He was interested in the business and in going out and seeing clients'. Another well-qualified applicant had computer skills and Russell &amp; Brand's financial systems did need upgrading at that time, but Brand opted for Newth's more commercial orientation. Defining precisely what you want the finance director to do should be the first step. 'If a small company has never had a finance director before it may well have a theoretical rather than a practical idea of what he should do,' says Chris Maidment. 'The role of the finance director can vary,' comments Jeff Grout. 'Companies should think about what they are looking for. Do they need someone to handle relations with the bank, to improve costing procedure or to deal with the computer system? The management team must prepare a list of what they want and then set priorities.' While some managing directors, like Brand, welcome a finance director who becomes involved in broader business development issues, there is a danger that an enthusiastic finance director can become too involved. 'Finance directors who come straight from a professional accountancy firm often get too wrapped up in marketing or business development issues,' says Chris Maidment. 'They should be there to remind the managing director of the financial constraints.' The finance director is frequently the first senior appointment made by a growing business since many founders have technical and marketing skills. Personal recommendation or experience of having worked with someone is a good starting point and companies often do recruit accountants who have worked for them as auditors or provided financial advice. Press advertisements can also be effective though sometimes produce large numbers of responses which need to be sifted. Many appointments are handled through executive recruitment agencies, which advertise for and help select applicants, and executive search consultancies or headhunters which do not advertise but use personal contacts to find people. Recruitment agencies will typically charge 25 per cent of the salary involved while headhunters will charge 33 per cent. With unemployment at very high levels in the accountancy sector, now is a good time to recruit a finance director. Salary rates have come down and a job which would have required a salary of Pounds 40,000-Pounds 45,000 plus car and benefits two years ago would now only rate Pounds 30,000-Pounds 35,000, calculates David Taylor, a freelance consultant who helps venture capitalists find finance directors for the companies they back. 'A lot of people are looking for jobs at the moment,' says Maidment. 'There is an oversupply of people at this level and a company can get a wealth of experience for a very competitive salary.'</p>

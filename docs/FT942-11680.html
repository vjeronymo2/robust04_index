			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (10): Forward from the 1920s - Quentin Peel describes the replacement of an archaic phone system They used to say in the old communist East Germany that it was not the Americans who were the real enemy: it was the rain. 'Every time it rained, the wet would get into the telephone cables, and knock out half the system,' says Mr Wolf Reiner Menzel, sitting in the massive old Post Ministry headquarters in Berlin's Leipziger Strasse. 'The concrete channels were so rotten, you couldn't keep it out. We tried to dry them out with compressed air, but it only worked up to 100 metres on either side of the telephone exchanges. So the rain simply cut off our conversations.' Not that the phone system was that efficient when the sun shone. Only one person in 10 had a telephone, and some of the switchgear dated back to the 1920s. Of the 1.8m telephone connections, around two-thirds were in private homes, and of those, 90 per cent used shared party-lines. You couldn't use the phone if your neighbour was talking. The other idiosyncracy of the system was that each of the main arms of the totalitarian state had its own separate phone network: the army, the state security service, and the communist party, for a start. Any senior functionary had to have a battery of telephones on his desk to be linked up with all the separate services. No one trusted anyone else. That was the extraordinary system which greeted Deutsche Telekom, the west German state monopoly, when it took on the task of modernising the east German network at unification. The result was the biggest single investment programme undertaken by any one enterprise in east Germany, scheduled to cost DM60bn by 1997. In that time, some 7.2m new telephone connections will be installed, as well as 360,000 fax connections, 50,000 packet-switched data links, 5m TV cable connections, a complete digitalised switching system, optical fibre networks for both long-distance and local calls, and a whole series of mobile communications networks covering the entire territory. 'We will simply leapfrog several generations of telecommunications technology,' says Mr Menzel, who is today responsible for customer services and public relations. From having had one of the most antiquated phone systems in Europe, the east Germans will have one of the most modern. The telephone exchange in Halle, capital of east Germany's once-thriving chemical industry, provides a graphic illustration. The old exchange was built in 1922. Standing surrounded by 10-foot-high banks of electro-mechanical switches is a bit like being in the middle of a weird mechanical jungle, full of the manic clicks and rattles of thousands of crazy crickets. At the end of every row is a red light, which switches on if there is a fault. At least 25 per cent are blinking. Next door, still surrounded by bundles of new cable, stand the slim new digital switches which will replace them: a few rows of neat grey cupboards, totally silent, and intended to be virtually maintenance-free. Human beings are noticeable only by their absence. In the Halle suburb of Silberhohe, on the top of a grim 19-storey block of workers' apartments, past graffiti denouncing racist skinheads and celebrating tekkno-music, a forest of aerials has sprung up to cope with the explosion of mobile telephone calls expected from the revival of the east German economy. There are 10,000 users already in the Halle region, and the newly-installed capacity is 80 per cent exhausted at peak times. In spite of the frantic pace of investment, Deutsche Telekom is only just keeping pace with the growth in demand. In 1993, 1.02m new connections were installed, and another 249,000 old lines transferred, which reduced the waiting list by just 90,000 - because there were 1.18m applications for new lines. Mr Wilhelm Pallman, Telekom director responsible for the Aufbau Ost investment programme, says: 'Telephones are still selling like hot cakes  .Beside a television set, refrigerator and car, the citizens of the new federal states clearly regard the telephone as one of the basic necessities of life.' He admits that one of the biggest problems at the moment is the number of cables being cut in the course of all the construction activity under way across the territory. 'Many cables have fallen victim to this positive activity,' he says. 'Of course it only causes quite short-term interruptions, but it also causes natural irritation. It proves that telephoning has become a perfectly normal activity.' The investment programme has concentrated on supplying the business sector first, and the turnover per telephone - at DM1,200  - reflects that. It is around 10 per cent higher than the similar figure in the west. From a density of one telephone to 10 people at unification, the level has risen to 24.2 per 100 inhabitants to date, compared with 49.9 in west Germany. By 1997, the target is to reach 46.8 per 100 inhabitants in the east, compared with 52.7 in the west. The cost has undoubtedly been astronomical, with DM28bn spent so far. It is one key factor driving Deutsche Telekom towards privatisation, which will provide the option of financing its capital spending through the stock market. The federal court of auditors has expressed the fear that the programme has been conducted regardless of expense, and many outsiders believe it might have been cheaper to allow the major international telecoms giants to compete in the market. Deutsche Telekom retorts that it is only thanks to its monopoly that it was able to mobilise such vast resources so quickly. 'Perhaps we have sometimes paid twice for the same line. And we threw cables over autobahns, and hung them from the trees, knowing they would only be used for six months. We used every possible contingency. But the need was urgent. The politicians demanded it,' says Mr Menzel. 'The lack of telecommunications was the biggest single disadvantage cited by potential investors. Today it isn't seen as a serious disadvantage any more.'</p>

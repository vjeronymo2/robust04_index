			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / NatWest in mortgage sell-off move to free capital NATIONAL Westminster Bank has written to some of its 230,000 mortgage borrowers to say it is considering selling their mortgages. It intends to offer investors debt securities backed by monthly mortgage repayments. The move comes amid a surge in mortgage lending by UK banks and could lead to a push towards such 'securitisation' of mortgages. Banks are keen on the technique because it allows them to remove from their balance sheets assets which otherwise absorb scarce capital. Mortgage securitisation is common in the US, but has only been used extensively in the UK by centralised mortgage lenders. Barclays pioneered the technique among clearing banks with a single Pounds 175m issue in 1989, but has not repeated it. Mr Richard Ferrett, head of asset management, said the bank's National Westminster Home Loans subsidiary had written to 5 per cent of borrowers. It would not sell the mortgage of any customer who objected. Mr Ferrett said customers would not be affected by securitisation because NatWest would still set the repayment interest rates, and handle problems such as customers not being able to meet monthly payments. He said the bank had not yet decided when or in what form to securitise mortgages. It was writing to customers as a courtesy, but they had signed authorisation clauses when they took out their loan. Although some Pounds 10bn of mortgage-backed securities have been issued in the UK since 1987, the biggest lenders have largely avoided it. Some building societies are working on the technique. NatWest's mortgage lending has risen by Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 10.2bn over the past year. Barclays is known to be working on securitising both US and UK mortgages through its BZW securities arm. Midland has also altered the terms of its mortgages to securitise them, but said yesterday that it had no plans to do so. Mr Ferrett said NatWest was willing to securitise fixed and variable rate mortgages. In order to securitise the mortgages, NatWest must set up an independent company which could buy the mortgage portfolio and then issue securities. NatWest sets out on a mission to explain, Page 5</p>

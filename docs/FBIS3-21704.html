Seleme's arrest was neither confirmed nor denied by Interior  Minister German Quiroga. Seleme is considered to have been one  of Paz Zamora's closest aides both during and after his  presidential tenure.    Quiroga stated that he could not talk about arrests or  arrest  warrants because this is a confidential matter. He did not rule  out, however, the arrest of other politicians linked to Paz  Zamora's administration (1989-93).</p>

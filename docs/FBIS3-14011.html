In response a sense of urgency about resisting  Pakistani designs appears to have cut across party lines in  India. The unanimous resolution passed in both houses of  Parliament condemning Islamabad's role in the valley takes  India's Kashmir policy into high gear. The resolution provides  bipartisan support for a stronger and more credible response by  New Delhi to Islamabad's strategy of keeping up pressure in the  international media.    Irrespective of the outcome of Islamabad's attempts to make  the United Nations human rights sub-commission accept a  resolution on Kashmir, New Delhi's political reactions will  inevitably gain momentum.    But India's response requires an understanding of Pakistan's  motives and tactics. As Sun Tzu, the Chinese military strategist  wrote, "Know your enemy, know yourself, hundred battles, hundred  victories."    With partition two mutually exclusive stereotypes have  symbiotically grown together on either side of the border.  Pakistan's ruling classes have fostered a feeling among their  people that Indians are not reconciled to partition. That India  would do anything to undo the deed and subject Muslims to Hindu  rule.    The constant example given as proof is the case of Kashmir,  a  state in which a Muslim majority population is kept hostage for  exploitation. In time Islamabad has been able to merge  Pakistan's creation with the Kashmir problem. It has evolved  into a general theoretical exposition that without Kashmir the  concept of Pakistan remains incomplete.    In India the accession of Kashmir to the Union has been  upheld as valid and final. Pakistan is seen as an eternal  spoiler who will not rest till Kashmir has been wrenched from  India, by force if necessary.    New Delhi has been highlighting Islamabad's attempts to  quietly hide a disconcerting fact. Mohammad Ali Jinnah rejected  outright the idea of a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir in 1947,  a year before the first UN security council resolution. The  memoirs of Louis Mountbatten have noted that when the viceroy  suggested a plebiscite to Jinnah, the latter reacted by saying  "it was redundant and undesirable to have a plebiscite when it  was quite clear that states should go according to their  majority population."    These two stereotype images have over time become  self-evident truths. They have automated the reactions of the  two neighbours to each others equally predictable actions.    New Delhi's perception has evolved as a result of its  experience of handling Pakistan during the period 1947-71.  Pakistan's military strategy was to launch a lightning offensive  preceded by a relatively smaller infiltration period which they  thought would be backed by the Muslim populace to decouple  Kashmir from India.    After 1971 Islamabad's strategy underwent a subtle yet  significant change. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto began using dual methods  to deal with his enemies. On the one hand Bhutto acknowledged  that India was the pre-eminent power in south Asia. On the other  he began an improved version of the Kashmir strategy. He placed  an emphasis on time and mass indoctrination inside Kashmir.    The main objective of Bhutto's policy was to disrupt,  discredit and paralyse the Indian administration before  committing Pakistani troops. He had by then realised mere  sympathy for the cause did not have enough strength to win him  Kashmir. What was required was a radicalisation of the  population through religion. It is interesting that while Bhutto  abhorred the role of the fundamentalist parties in domestic  politics, he was not averse to seeking their support for his  destabilising of Kashmir and Afghanistan.    In Kashmir, Bhutto used the organisational strength of  fundamentalist parties with cross border affiliations to spread  Islamic ideas as an antidote to the secular forces being  projected by New Delhi. It began by focussing upon Islamic  education. The Jamaat e Islami was useful because of its sway in  the madrassas that rapidly spread throughout the rural areas of  Kashmir valley.    The spread of Islamic ideals was the first element of the  strategy of radicalising the Kashmiri Muslims. The second was  the creation of an elaborate information ring within the  Kashmiri government. The political crises of the period 1982 to  1987 allowed pro-Pakistani fundamentalist parties to exploit the  alienation of the common Kashmiri.    Through the maulvis Islamabad was able to  communicate with the common Kashmiri for the first time. It set  up a fledgling organisation within Kashmir for greater use in  future. Ms. Bhutto's overthrow did not mean the end of the  Kashmir gambit. Instead the policy was streamlined, and the  military's direct involvement increased.    It also received more funding because of Zia-ul-Haq's  Islamicisation policies. The principle beneficiaries of the  Islamic taxes zakat and ushr were the  ulema. They in turn used it to consolidate their  position on both sides of the border. Suddenly the maulvi became  an economically important person, prepared to accept the radical  programme that his handlers from Islamabad sold him. Most  importantly, the policy of Islamicisation through education at  the grassroots became an effective counter to the relatively  successful philosophy propagated by New Delhi that Kashmiriyat  was built on secularism.    New Delhi ignored the quiet revolution taking place inside  Kashmir. It did not take advantage of the Afghan imbroglio to  counter Islamabad's Kashmir operations. Instead New Delhi  preferred to accept at face value the peace overtures made by  the Zia regime in respect of Kashmir.    The greatest failure on the part of New Delhi was its  inability to comprehend the changed Pakistani strategy and  undertake counter measures. The prevalent thinking in New Delhi  was that Islamabad would repeat its 1948 and 1965 strategies.    With Zia, the radicalisation of Kashmiri society proceeded  at  a feverish pace. The Inter-service Intelligence created a  network of informers and sympathisers who penetrated every state  government department. Infiltration and exfiltration routes were  identified. Slowly weapons training along with ideological  brainwashing began to be imparted in camps in Pakistan occupied  Kashmir. By 1988 the trickle had become a flood. All that was  required of Ms. Bhutto was to give the underground movement a  green light with her azadi speech.    Between Ms. Bhutto's first and second terms, Islamabad was  unable to push its Kashmir strategy because political stability  returned to New Delhi. Further, militancy in the valley had come  dangerously close to despondency as New Delhi remained  unperturbed by terrorist attacks that included bombing police  headquarters and numerous kidnappings.    Increased international attention had started bringing about  a change in the perception of the human rights organisations.  They began looking upon militant groups as violators. Amnesty  International, the United States state department and Asia Watch  began taking notice. Towards the end of the presidency of Mr.  George Bush, the threat of being labelled a state sponsor of  terrorism loomed large.    In a bid to wiggle out of this unhappy turn of events  Islamabad began "privatising" the terror drive, bringing in  fundamentalist parties as intermediaries to provide money,  material and boost the morale of the militants. This transition  was taking place at a time when a power struggle between the  president and prime minister diverted Islamabad from the Kashmir  effort.    In Ms. Bhutto's second term Islamabad's options had narrowed  considerably. Militancy by itself was not capable of wrenching  the state out of the Union. The militants were becoming  demoralised. New recruits were becoming difficult to find. As a  result, Islamabad had to relocate unemployed Afghan mercenaries  into the valley in greater numbers to keep the pressure going.  Continuation of the existing strategy allowed Mr. Sharif to get  an upper hand in the domestic political tussle.    There was no other option for Ms. Bhutto other than to  internationalise the dispute. She had to do something radically  different to gain the high ground and boost the militants. In  this effort she was fortunate to find unexpected help from Ms.  Robin Raphel, the U.S. assistant secretary of state in charge of  the newly created south Asia bureau. Ms. Raphel had sought to  reopen old controversies by disputing the legality of the  Instrument of Accession, equating civil war in Afghanistan with  insurgency in Kashmir.    The strategy adopted by the Benazir government has been to  get as much exposure for its new stance. It tries to highlight  the human rights facet of the Kashmir issue. By pushing this  angle, Islamabad has hoped to capitalise upon international  concern for human rights. It was therefore logical she would  pursue a multi-pronged strategy.    She sought the Organisation of Islamic Conference's help, on  grounds that Muslims were being "martyred" in the valley. In the  larger and non-religious fora, like the UN General Assembly and  the human rights commission, she sought to place Islamabad's  charges on a secular plane. By attempting to turn up  international pressure through the passage of a resolution in  Geneva next week, Islamabad hopes to justify the other element  of its strategy--the accession of the state of Pakistan.    In the coming days Islamabad's strategy will be to continue  keeping Kashmir in the international spotlight, create hysteria  in the West so that it could emerge as the fount of a nuclear  conflagration and seek to give the Kashmiri secessionists the  legitimacy of a national liberation movement.    The task before the Indian polity is one of monumental  proportions. A combined effort must be made to send out an  equivocal message of the inherent strength and determination of  the nation to rise to any occasion. This could deter the  building up of further pressure. But the most suitable rebuff to  Islamabad's campaign would be the initiation of a political  dialogue in the valley.    *</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Bahrain SE to expand BAHRAIN'S stock exchange hopes to begin listing foreign companies during the second half of 1992 as part of ground-breaking plans to boost share trading on the Gulf bourse, Reuter reports from Manama. Mr Fawzi Behzad, head of the stock exchange, said the board was studying detailed regulations for the move, which was planned initially for January. 'I think now we are ready, and I hope before this year ends we will see it happen.' He said officials were also preparing a system which would allow foreign and local debt securities to be traded on the Bahrain exchange, which has 30 listed companies and paid-up capital of about Dollars 2.4bn. Mr Behzad hopes the move will encourage Bahraini companies to begin issuing debt instruments to raise capital. Bahraini officials were also studying proposals - already approved - for the creation of mutual trust funds, which would indirectly allow foreigners to trade in stock of local companies, he said.</p>

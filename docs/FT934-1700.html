			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Technology: Yuletide greetings delivered by fax - Worth Watching For those who cannot bear the thought of writing out and posting Christmas cards, how about faxing the season's greetings to your clients? Xpedite, the York-based arm of the US company, is offering its clients the chance to send the season's greetings by fax. Xpedite specialises in sending broadcast fax messages - where a single message is sent to hundreds, even thousands, of different locations. Clients typically include financial services companies wanting to keep in touch with their intermediaries or travel companies wishing to send details of late bookings to travel agents. Each 'card', decorated with bells, angels or a snowman, costs 12p to send. Xpedite: UK, 0904 690000.</p>

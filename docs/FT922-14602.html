			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / N Sea oil output dips UK OIL production slipped to 1.9m barrels a day last month, a decline of 80,000 b/d from February, according to County NatWest in Edinburgh. The fall in output was partly a result of shutdowns on the Flotta pipeline as the new Piper B oil platform was tied into the grid. Low oil prices and weak world demand are causing many companies to focus on cost-cutting and rationalisation this year. That might see many North Sea operators cutting capital expenditure and scaling down ambitious oil exploration programmes. The International Energy Agency, the west's energy watchdog, pointed to signs of a slight recovery in world oil demand in its latest market report. Demand in OECD countries rose by 400,000 b/d in the first quarter, 1.5 per cent above last year's level.</p>

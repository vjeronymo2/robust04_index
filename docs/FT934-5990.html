			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Write-offs hurt Canadian bank Write-offs stemming from the acquisition of a trust company and a discount brokerage firm helped push Toronto-Dominion Bank's fiscal 1993 earnings down by almost a third. Earnings at Canada's fifth-biggest bank dropped to CDollars 275m (USDollars 206.9m), or 82 cents a share, in the year to October 31, from CDollars 408m, or CDollars 1.25, a year earlier. The return on equity slipped to 5.4 per cent from 8.4 per cent. The latest year's earnings would have been CDollars 393m, or CDollars 1.21, without restructuring costs stemming from the purchase of Central Guaranty Trust and a fourth-quarter write-off of the purchase price for the Marathon brokerage business. Loan-loss provisions rose to CDollars 600m from CDollars 543m. Non-performing loans fell to CDollars 1.22bn on October 31, from CDollars 1.59bn a year earlier. The bank predicted that loan losses would decline and earnings improve in 1994, provided the economic recovery in North America was sustained. Fourth-quarter earnings fell to CDollars 82m from CDollars 113m, due to the Marathon write-off. Net interest income in the quarter rose, however, to CDollars 601m from CDollars 529m. Fee income, mainly from securities, credit cards, safekeeping and trust services, grew by 18 per cent. Assets stood at CDollars 85bn on October 31, up from CDollars 74.1bn. National Bank of Canada's 1993 earnings rose to CDollars 175m, or CDollars 1.01 a share, from CDollars 1m, or a loss of 29 cents per common share, last year.</p>

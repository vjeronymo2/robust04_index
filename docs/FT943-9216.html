			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Rapid gear change to stay in the race: European carmakers are recovering from recession, but are they sufficiently competitive The grinding of gears has been harsh, but gradually Europe's automakers are climbing out of the worst recession of the postwar period. Four of the big six volume carmakers in Europe crashed into heavy losses last year, as new car sales fell by more than 15 per cent to 11.4m, the lowest level since 1985. While the leading European car producers are still struggling to stem the flow of red ink with drastic restructuring measures, their share prices have, however, been rising sharply for the past 18 months. In the first half of this year new car sales have also begun to flicker back to life. The automotive sector was the worst-performing area in European stock markets over the past seven years, according to James Capel, the stockbroker. This year it has been the strongest, and had outperformed Capel's European JC index by 20 per cent by early August. Fiat, which incurred the biggest loss in its 95-year history last year and is paying no dividend on its ordinary shares for the first time since 1947, has outperformed the Milan market by 38 per cent in 1994. PSA Peugeot Citroen with its first loss last year since 1984, has outperformed the Paris bourse by 20 per cent, while Volkswagen, which had a group loss of DM1.94bn last year, has outperformed the Frankfurt market by 22 per cent. Though share prices started to rise early last year, new car and commercial vehicle sales were still plunging precipitously. But some foundation for such early optimism is finally beginning to appear. New vehicle sales started to pick up during the first half of this year, arousing renewed confidence among vehicle makers and their suppliers that recovery is under way. 'We now expect that 1994 will turn out to be a much better year than we thought likely at the end of 1993,' said Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, one of the leading UK automotive components suppliers. In the first six months, new car sales in west Europe have risen by 6.8 per cent to 6.5m. The upturn has been led by the UK, France, Spain and Scandinavia. 'Western European markets have evidently passed through the nadir of demand, with many markets now recording quite high rates of expansion,' said Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the management board of BMW of Germany. With its heavy fixed costs, the auto industry is sensitive to changes in sales volumes. As demand picks up, allowing plants to be run at higher production volumes, profits should respond accordingly. 'Assisted by a major shedding of labour, savings in purchasing costs and the start of a recovery in sales, profits now look set for a strong recovery, and we are predicting that earnings will reach new highs in 1996,' said Mr Bob Barber, automotive expert at James Capel. The turnround is not without pain, however. Recession forced plants to close in the face of severe overcapacity and tens of thousands of jobs have been eliminated. Ford of Europe has reduced its workforce (excluding Jaguar) by 15 per cent, with the loss of 15,100 jobs since late 1992. Mercedes-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest engineering group, cut 14,700 jobs from its domestic workforce in 1992, a further 11,000 last year, and it is planning to cut another 8,000 jobs to bring its workforce to 151,000 by the end of 1994. Volkswagen reduced the workforce at its six domestic plants (excluding Audi) in the past three years by 27,000 to about 102,000 by spring. Higher productivity and reduced sales volumes mean that it still has about 30,000 surplus employees. For 1994 and 1995, it is operating a pioneering pact with German trade unions, allowing a big cut in pay and working hours (to a 28.8-hour week) to stave off even more radical job losses. Most carmakers believe that they have turned the corner after last year's losses, the scale of which took the industry by surprise. 'No source had predicted the scale of the disaster until well into the year,' said Mr Gianni Agnelli, Fiat chairman, recently. After last year's record loss of L1,783bn (Pounds 730m), Mr Agnelli says the company's full-year result should 'be better than break-even'. Past responses to recession have not been enough this time round, however, and carmakers have had to revamp their strategies. The European motor industry is undergoing a hectic transition, as the European Union moves to become an open car market with the removal of all quota restrictions on car and light commercial vehicle imports from Japan at the end of 1999. European carmakers are also in a race to become globally competitive. Their rivals in North America - in particular Chrysler and Ford, with GM bringing up the rear - have already made huge progress in closing the competitive gap on the Japanese producers. The share taken by Japanese carmakers in west Europe may be down this year as they have been battered by the strength of the yen, but it is likely to be only a temporary respite. Japanese penetration is still forecast to rise to about 15 per cent by the end of the decade. Incursions into the European market are also growing from North America, both from the big three US carmakers and from Japanese assembly plants in the US. European carmakers are fighting back with radical changes of strategy. For instance, Mercedes-Benz is transforming its new product strategy. Having accepted the unpalatable truth that its luxury cars were 'over-engineered' and that it could end up being 'priced out' of world markets, it is planning to launch vehicles into several new segments of the world market by the late 1990s, including a small family car sized between a Volkswagen Golf and a Ford Fiesta, and most surprisingly a micro compact car for urban commuting that it is developing in a joint venture with SMH, the Swiss maker of Swatch watches. Restructuring is taking on new forms, as carmakers dispose of in-house components operations to outside suppliers to allow themselves to concentrate on the core operations of the design, development and assembly of vehicles. In its boldest move in this direction Fiat is transferring a components operation with more than 700 employees to GKN, which is to invest Pounds 50m in a new plant in Italy. Belatedly, European makers are also closing yawning gaps in their product armouries. Volkswagen, Ford of Europe, Fiat and Peugeot are all launching their first MPVs (multi-purpose vehicles like the Renault Espace) into a fast-growing sector of the world market until now dominated by Japanese and US producers. Such responses may not be enough. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, warns in a recent report that 'European auto industry fundamentals are becoming increasingly difficult for the volume automakers'. It says that Europe's car market is becoming 'more subject to volatile cyclical fluctuations' as European economies converge. It forecasts that long-term growth in new car demand will slow, with the main markets 'approaching saturation'. The European industry will 'remain beset by significant excess production capacity', while intensifying competition for market share has led to rapidly rising marketing costs and aggressive discounting. European automakers' 'relatively limited' presence in other regions of the world leaves them highly vulnerable to competitive conditions in western Europe. It is a catalogue of shortcomings that may temper investors' optimism, which has sent automakers' share prices soaring in recent months.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Books: Whaddya mean illiterate? IMAGES OF ENGLISH by Richard W. Bailey Cambridge Pounds 16.95, 329 pages I ONCE saw a notice in a London bus explaining scheduling changes which concluded with the words, 'So the buses run smoother, and there are less delays'. To purists this sentence is a ghastly example of the quasi-illiteracy which besets our culture. To the more liberal-minded, it is an example of desirable simplification in the direction of demotic forms. How might the quarrel between purist and liberal be decided? The purist will say, 'The writer of this notice ignored logic. He was talking of bus services, not tyres, so it is not the buses but the services which run more smoothly, and that is why he must use the comparative adverb 'more smoothly', not the comparative adjective 'smoother', because it is the verb 'run' which is being qualified, not the noun 'buses'. Moreover, it is either 'less delay' or 'fewer delays' but not 'less delays', since in the plural the word 'delay' is a count noun not a mass term.' Liberals will respond by saying that the original sentence is perfectly intelligible, which is all that matters. Purists might defend nice distinctions and aesthetics, but liberals are unpersuaded: speakers, they argue, wish to communicate, and whatever serves them is good English. At least one thing is clear: as long as language exists, it will change; and change will always provoke complaint. Among the targets in Richard Bailey's book are the complainers. He attacks them for wishing to preserve English in literary aspics of one flavour or another, and he also attacks those who think English is pre-eminent among languages, an attitude which arose with Empire and has accompanied and promoted some of the worst excesses of English-speakers' snobbery, colonialism, and self-aggrandisement. The official aim of Bailey's book is to give a 'cultural history of English'; its real aim is to expose and debunk English-speakers' pretensions. If Bailey were just another commentator these aims would seem merely partisan contributions to the familiar purist-liberal quarrel. But he is an associate editor of the forthcoming Oxford Companion to the English Language, and there is something significant about a Professor of English, engaged in authoritative research, so clearly setting out a reductive view of the place and importance of the English language. Bailey begins with a surprising fact: that the number of people regularly using English in their daily lives is only 15 per cent of the world's population, and declining. The belief that English is an international language and still growing in importance may bolster English-speaking egos, but its hold on this role is slipping, according to Bailey, not just because Japanese, German and Chinese are growing in importance, as a result of economic influence and sheer numbers, but because English itself is fragmenting into many varieties, some already unintelligible to the mainstream. By extensive use of quotation Bailey shows how English first captured the British Isles and then, after an uncomfortable start without settled spelling and grammar, began to impose itself abroad through colonialism. The attitude of Cotton Mather, the 17th century American colonist and divine, is typical; he resisted the idea of an Indian edition of the Bible on the ground that 'It is very sure, that the best thing we can do for our Indians, is to Anglicize them in . . . language, as well as otherwise.' Praise of English, efforts to increase its influence, improve its spelling, or protect its purity, are observed by Bailey with a sardonic eye. So too are claims about the supposed damaging tendencies of slang, neologisms and jargon. At the same date as the Book of Common Prayer - that exquisite jewel of the tongue - was being compiled, John Evelyn complained of English's corruption by 'pedantry of schooles, affectation of travellers, translations, fancy and style of Court, servility and mincing of citizens, pulpits, political remonstrances, theatres, shopps, &amp;c' Today the causes of linguistic decay are cited as television, poor education, advertising, computer jargon, and the argot of youth culture. Bailey's view is that the language never decays; it merely changes. This is true; and change is irresistible. But Bailey leaves two large points unconsidered. First, standards may change, but they exist nevertheless. At every point in its history there has been good and bad English of the day, and we need to grasp the difference. And secondly, a language is as great as its literature; all the world's great languages are rich in this respect, English among the first. Taking this into account might have influenced some of Bailey's judgments more positively.</p>

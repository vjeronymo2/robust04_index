			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Roni Shaqed: "Ready To Die in Jail"] </F>   [Text] Last week, on the eve of signing the Gaza-Jericho  First agreement, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres attempted to  deal with a problem whose solution could grease the wheels of  the Palestinian autonomy: the release of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin,  the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] spiritual leader, from  prison. In statements he made on national radio and television,  and which reached the shaykh, Peres promised that Israel would  be willing to free Yasin if he issues a call to stop terrorism.    At the same time, Peres summoned Knesset Member Talib  al-Sani' of the Democratic List for Peace and Equality and asked  him to contact Yasin. The meeting between the two is expected  to take place on 8 May, but Yasin's attorney, 'Abd-al-Malik  Dahamshah, smiles: "He does not have a chance. No person in  the world could talk the shaykh into accepting a conditional  release."    After five years in prison, the paralyzed and sick shaykh is  himself a ticking time bomb. Israel would love to rid itself of  this bomb -- but honorably and for the right price. Peres  shares the fear of many in the defense establishment that if  Yasin dies in prison, it might reignite the territories.    Yasin's continued imprisonment is a problem for PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat as well. 'Arafat seeks a quiet era to bolster his  control over Gaza and Jericho. By freeing Yasin, 'Arafat will  attain two goals: softening the Hamas opposition and proving to  his people that he is the leader of all Palestinians, including  his sworn rivals.    Yasin, however, despite being paralyzed in the arms and legs  and suffering from an acute lung disease, continues to thwart  the plans of his domestic and external enemies. The signing of  the agreement last week was no holiday for him. He will not  play into their hands, not even for his freedom. From behind  the walls, he rejects any offer of a "conditional release:" "I  will sit in jail until the end of my days. I will neither  surrender to dictates nor be released under constraints," he  stated again last week.    The Shaykh Yasin problem is a constant headache for the two  partners to the Cairo agreement. Some time ago, he rejected  another Peres condition for his release: to meet with 'Arafat  and mend their relations. Yasin said: "Obviously, I will meet  with 'Arafat. I do not need mediators for this. But I cannot  accept such a meeting as a condition!"    Shaykh Yasin is incarcerated in the Ashmoret prison in a  room  specially planned and built to accommodate his unique situation.  Because of his physical handicap, two prisoners have been  assigned to attend to all his needs around the clock ever since  his detention in May 1989. Up to several months ago, Hamas  prisoners were those who performed this task with great  dedication, stemming from their respect for their leader.  According to Yasin's lawyer, Dahamshah, the makeup of the  prison's inmates has recently changed, which is also reflected  in the treatment accorded to Yasin: "Now he is being attended  by members of the Popular Front, Fatah, and various other  organizations, who are unwilling to serve him. They are sick  and tired. After all, the man is completely paralyzed. He must  be lifted, undressed, washed, and accompanied to the toilet."    Yasin's incarceration is not contributing toward moderating  Hamas' attitude toward the autonomy. Yasin's remarks indicate  that his opinion of Palestinian self-rule differs from that of  many of his followers. According to Yasin, there is no problem  in Hamas' participating in the autonomy institutions, including  the Palestinian advisory council. He is unwilling, however, to  participate in its formation and consolidation: "I am not part  of this; I am part of the Palestinian people. The PLO is  responsible for this process. I do not consider this a proper  process leading to peace and tranquillity in our region."    Will Hamas people use firearms against their Fatah brethren?    Shaykh Yasin unequivocally states that this will not happen.  Islam absolutely forbids such a thing. Attorney Dahamshah: "The  shaykh never supported such behavior, did not accept it, and was  unwilling to follow such a path. He maintains that all problems  can be solved through peaceful negotiations."    Dahamshah adds: "I am familiar with his position regarding  terrorism. The shaykh never urged his followers to murder  Jewish civilians -- neither before his incarceration nor  afterward. You should ask yourself: Why have the Muslim  organizations acted against soldiers and not civilians? This  behavior is religiously motivated, and the shaykh has influence  in this respect. Therefore, it makes no sense to demand that  Yasin call on his supporters to cease their acts of terrorism,  seeing that he never called for the murder of people just  because they are Jews!"    The recent closure has not made things easier on the shaykh.  Gaza residents are not allowed to leave the Strip or to visit  their imprisoned relatives. Since only those over the age of 60  are allowed to leave the Strip, only the shaykh's elder brother  can visit him.    The prison authorities award Yasin very special treatment.  During early April, for example, after he returned his breakfast  and announced that he was launching a hunger strike to protest  the fact that a chair and table were removed from his room, all  the furniture was immediately returned.    What interest, if any, does Israel have in Yasin's continued  incarceration? This question was recently raised in the  Ministerial Committee on Security Affairs. In addition to  punishing a leader responsible for serious terror attacks, there  is also the consideration of keeping some bargaining chips in a  period of negotiations and in the framework of pressuring Hamas  to stop terrorism.    Shaykh Yasin's associates claim that it is illogical to keep  him in jail under the pretext that he is responsible for  murderous attacks: "Terrorism increased only after the shaykh  was jailed. As long as he pulled the strings from the outside,  Hamas did not resort to the use of firearms. They settled for  political protest, disturbances, and strikes."    What about the murder of soldiers Avi Sasportas and Ilan  Sa'adon?    Shaykh Yasin continues to claim that the murderers were  members of the al-Majd and al-Mujahidun organizations rather  than Hamas. According to Yasin, this is a historical mistake.  He says that even the charge sheet filed against him states  that he became aware of the murders only after the event, "and  even the Shin Bet knows I had nothing to do with it."    What the shaykh "forgets" to mention, however, is the fact  that he was the man who established these two secret  organizations, which were the precursors of 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam, the Hamas military arm.    In his reply to the accusations included in the charge  sheet,  Yasin claimed he accepts the principle of peace: "I feel  religiously obligated to make peace between my people and other  peoples, because this is God's command." He said that in both  nations, there are many who refuse to accept this peace. At the  same time, he emphasizes that he is willing to accept a  "peaceful solution" which safeguards the legitimate rights of  his people.    In statements meant for outside ears, Yasin is willing to  say  that "the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" are  negotiable: "If you do not want a Muslim state which will  safeguard everybody's rights (according to Muslim concepts),  then okay, we will not have such a state. Let us therefore  establish a state according to the modern concept: a democratic  state which will elect its institutions under conditions of  equality and democracy."    Today, Shaykh Yasin is considered to be Hamas' spiritual  leader. In practice, he is more of a symbol than a leader who  issues operational orders to his men in the field. The movement  continues to pursue his ideological path. The Hamas leadership  takes his opinion into consideration, but sometimes Hamas  spokesmen correct his remarks and "explain" what he meant when  he said this or that. Time has taken its course, and Hamas has a  new leadership. Shaykh Yasin is far away and cut off from  events.    So far, Hamas people in Gaza are operating in the spirit of  Yasin's approach. There is a rapprochement with Fatah, and  there are some indications that Hamas is slowly being integrated  into the autonomy institutions. At the same time, 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam's murderers are still active. Gaza fugitives have  already drifted to the West Bank. Senior security officials  assess that Hamas terrorism will increase in those West Bank  areas that will not be under 'Arafat's control.    Attorney Dahamshah promises, of course, that Yasin's release  and return home "will greatly contribute toward calming the  situation and facilitate the positive process between the two  nations."</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Dollar under fire The Naples summit of industrial leaders in two weeks will look a sorry sight if these market conditions continue. A weak dollar is dragging down the US bond market. Other bond markets - illogically in view of its strong currency including Germany - are sliding in its wake. That in turn is upsetting equities. Against that background the summit leaders cannot credibly congratulate themselves about economic recovery. Pressure on central banks to calm the dollar with intervention will grow, now that the currency has tested levels below Y100. Yet apart from the Bank of Japan, which obviously has most at stake, it is hard to see them showing much enthusiasm. Intervention may calm the market temporarily but without accompanying policy action it is unlikely to have much lasting effect. The Federal Reserve would need to signal its determination with another sharp rise in interest rates. Yet the US economy is showing signs of cooling and the Fed has indicated it would prefer to wait. Fear of another rate rise has clearly spooked the equity market, but it stands to lose both ways. Bond market nervousness and higher long-term interest rates are hardly a recipe for sustained recovery. Similarly the Bundesbank is in a bind. With M3 money supply still growing at a 13.7 per cent annual rate and economic recovery in the air, it cannot relish the thought either of intervening or of cutting official rates again. The last rate cut, explicitly designed to curb M3 by encouraging investors to move out along the yield curve, does not seem to be working yet even though 10-year bonds yield 200 basis points more than three-month money. With markets in such a state, investors' natural inclination is to stick with cash.</p>

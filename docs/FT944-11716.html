			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: How Bock turned the tables on Tiny Over the past year, the relationship between Mr Dieter Bock and Mr Tiny Rowland became increasingly strained. Mr Bock had ambitious plans to reorganise the business, involving cutting central management costs and disposing of assets. However, he felt he was being frustrated by Mr Rowland, who could count on the support of a series of other directors, such as Mr Robert Dunlop, Mr Rene Leclezio and Mr Paul Spicer, who had been with the company for decades. Earlier this year, he persuaded most of Mr Rowland's closest allies to retire, though they were not to leave immediately. However, his ultimate aim was to secure the retirement of Mr Rowland. Mr Bock launched an abortive coup two months ago to oust Mr Rowland from his executive duties. However, hours before September's board meeting, Mr Bock backed off from putting a proposal that Mr Rowland should step down, because he became concerned that he could not count on the support of a majority. A number of Lonrho's directors, whose support Mr Bock believed he had, took fright from challenging Mr Rowland, because they were concerned that he would challenge any attempt to oust him through the courts. Since then, however, Mr Dunlop and Mr Leclezio have left the company. Mr Bock believed the balance of power had shifted irrevocably in his favour. Nervous directors were persuaded that offering Mr Rowland the honorific title of president represented a generous departure deal. So Mr Bock was ready for what he hoped would be his final showdown with Mr Rowland. The contract agreeing Mr Rowland's departure was signed at 4pm yesterday, apparently giving Mr Bock victory. Though, as one of Mr Rowland's oldest colleagues said, 'until I hear it from Tiny's lips, I won't believe it'.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Jardine sets sail for Singapore  -The Hong Kong market is losing two of its oldest listings Hong Kong's stock market today loses two of its biggest and oldest listings, Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic Holdings. Up to 85 per cent of trading in Jardine Matheson stock has passed through the Hong Kong stock exchange, with London absorbing the remainder. Jardine, listed in Hong Kong in 1961, hopes the share trading in Hong Kong will shift to Singapore, where the company has arranged to facilitate it. If the arrangements work - including paying the cost shareholders incur in moving share registration from Hong Kong to Singapore - the transfer of trading will have a big impact on the Singapore bourse. Jardine Fleming Securities, the brokerage owned equally by Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank, estimates Jardine Matheson will be the fourth biggest stock in Singapore by market capitalisation and the second most liquid stock. The defection of Jardine Matheson, which accounts for about 1.66 per cent of the stock market's capitalisation, and Jardine Strategic, the investment arm, which is also the linchpin in a protective crossholding with Jardine Matheson, is the culmination of a decade-long tussle with the colony's securities' regulators. In spite of protestations from Jardine directors, it has also been seen as a vote of no confidence in the post-1997 future of Hong Kong. The saga began on March 28 1984, when the group said it was moving its domicile from Hong Kong to Bermuda. Jardine thought this would put it beyond the reach of Hong Kong regulators. The creation of the Securities and Futures Commission following the 1987 stock market crash changed that. The SFC's power to regulate the company - especially in takeovers - prompted it to seek other ways to avoid Hong Kong regulation. This included moving the primary stock exchange listing to London in 1991, and then, in 1993, getting the authorities in Bermuda to enact a takeovers code - based on London's - that applied only to the Jardine group. An attempt this spring to persuade the Hong Kong government to accept the latest 'Bermuda solution' fell at the first hurdle. Ironically, the SFC still claims the power to regulate the company. Its powers extend to companies whose principle business and management is in Hong Kong. About 60 per cent of Jardine Matheson's earnings came from Hong Kong and China in 1993 which will remain the principal source of earnings in the medium term. The SFC took comfort from a decision this month by the FT-Actuaries World Indices policy committee to retain the Jardine group in the Hong Kong section of the FT-AWI indices. Morgan Stanley took a different view. This month, Morgan Stanley Capital International restructured its Hong Kong index to reflect the delisting of the Jardine group by deleting Jardine Matheson, Dairy Farm, a worldwide retailer, Hongkong Land, the property investment company which has a stake in Trafalgar House, and Mandarin Oriental, the hotels group. Jardine Matheson directors estimate 80 per cent of its stock is held by overseas institutions, the vast majority of whom will not be obliged to sell their holdings.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICISM GROWS AS CONGRESSIONAL HEARING NEARS;  </P> <P> EPA RETHINKS ITS STRATEGY ON WATER CLEANUP  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has spent $8.5 million on  ground-water contamination in the San Gabriel Valley without developing a  comprehensive plan or cleaning up any water, is reevaluating its approach.  </P> <P> The reevaluation comes amid growing criticism of the EPA by water suppliers,  community groups and political leaders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conferring on New Strategy  </P> <P> EPA spokesman Terry Wilson said the agency's regional office in San Francisco,  which oversees the San Gabriel Valley Superfund project, is conferring with  officials in Washington on a new strategy for attacking ground-water pollution.  </P> <P> That strategy will be unveiled, Wilson said, at a congressional hearing that  Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) has scheduled June 5 in Baldwin Park.  </P> <P> Wilson said EPA officials will not discuss any changes in priorities on the  project until the hearing by the Small Business Committee's subcommittee on  environment and labor, headed by Torres.  </P> <P> Torres has already berated EPA for a lack of progress in dealing with a  contamination problem that was discovered nearly 10 years ago and has been on  the Superfund priority list since 1984. Suspected carcinogens have seeped into  more than one-fourth of the 400 wells in the Main San Gabriel Basin,  jeopardizing the water supply of 1 million people.  </P> <P> "From the material presented to me so far by the agency," Torres said, "it  appears to me that EPA has, at the very least, mismanaged the project. For 10  years they have been running around in circles trying to decide what to do and  they still don't know."  </P> <P> EPA also will face strong criticism at the hearing from the Upper San Gabriel  Valley Municipal Water District, which imports water to the area; the Main San  Gabriel Basin Watermaster, which oversees pumping from wells in the basin, and  the Upper San Gabriel Valley Water Assn., which represents water suppliers.  </P> <P> Robert G. Berlien, general manager of the water district, has been authorized  by all three agencies to tell the congressional hearing that EPA is moving much  too slowly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> District Manager's Points  </P> <P> In testimony prepared for the hearing, Berlien has outlined these concerns:  </P> <P> EPA has not developed an overall plan or cleaned up any water. "Water suppliers  do not have a clear understanding of where the cleanup project is headed."  </P> <P> Little progress has been made in finding out how pollutants contaminated ground  water. The pollutants include trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE)  and other solvents. The sources must be found to make sure that contamination  is not continuing and to identify polluters who can be billed for cleanup  costs. Even though EPA is giving the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control  Board $1 million a year to find pollution sources, the water board says it will  take 10 years to complete its initial survey at its present pace.  </P> <P> EPA's decision to concentrate resources and efforts on preventing contaminated  ground water from moving southward through the Whittier Narrows to the  neighboring Central Basin is of little help to the San Gabriel Valley.  Meanwhile, cleanup of the San Gabriel Valley's most polluted region, the  Azusa-Baldwin Park area, is being deferred.  </P> <P> EPA's decision to spend more than $1.5 million to solve the pollution problem  of a tiny El Monte water company that serves only 200 homes, Berlien said,  "does not appear to us to be a reasonable decision." The problem could have  been solved cheaply with a connection to another water supplier.  </P> <P> EPA's proposed change of engineering contractors "in mid-project can only  result in significant time delays as one contractor phases out and another  gears up to take over. Vast amounts of specific site experience will be lost in  the change and large expenditures will be needed to educate the new engineering  contractor."  </P> <P> Berlien said he understands that the current contractor, the environmental  consulting and engineering firm of CH2M Hill, will be replaced on the San  Gabriel Valley project by the Bechtel Co. next year. Wilson at EPA said that a  change might be made, but contracts have not yet been signed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Staff Increases  </P> <P> In his written testimony, Berlien said the water agencies believe that EPA  should increase its staff on the San Gabriel Valley project, consider opening a  local office, accelerate the search for pollution sources and immediately begin  to clean up heavily contaminated ground water in Baldwin Park and Azusa.  </P> <P> In spite of his harsh criticism of the cleanup effort, Berlien said he hopes  that EPA will not dwell on past mistakes but move forward. "We certainly do not  wish to see EPA expending its limited resources on justifying its past  actions," he said.  </P></p>

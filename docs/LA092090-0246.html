			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> RUSSIANS URGE RYZHKOV TO QUIT  </P> <P> The Russian republic's Parliament overwhelmingly approved a resolution today  urging Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his Cabinet to resign,  calling them unable to save the country from economic ruin.  </P> <P> The measure, which passed on a 164-1 vote with 16 abstentions, said Ryzhkov's  government "is not capable of pulling the country out of its deep economic  crisis."  </P> <P> The Russian body called on the national Parliament, the Supreme Soviet, to  "solve the question of the resignation of the entire government of the  U.S.S.R."  </P> <P> But the resolution was referring to the Council of Ministers and not President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has backed a sweeping 500-day program that would  bring quicker market-oriented reform than Ryzhkov has called for.  </P></p>

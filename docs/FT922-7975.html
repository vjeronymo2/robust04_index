			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: European venture capital rises THE VALUE of venture capital funds invested across Europe rose by 12 per cent to Ecu4.6bn (Dollars 3.62bn) last year, in spite of the economic downturn and a reduction of new funding from venture capitalists in the UK. The findings come in the annual survey of venture capital conducted by the European Venture Capital Association in conjunction with KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, which was released yesterday. Investment from EC countries outside the UK grew by 29 per cent. UK funds dropped from Ecu1.9bn in 1990 to Ecu1.7bn last year, but still represent 37 per cent of all European venture capital. 'Our main concern was whether venture capital was going to reflect the slowdown,' said Mr Miguel Zorita Lees, chairman of the Association. 'It has managed to weather the storm relatively well.' There were 4,111 new investments in 1991 amounting to Ecu3.57bn and 2,796 follow-on investments valued at Ecu1.06bn. The average venture capital investment was Ecu671,000. Expanding companies and buy-outs accounted for 87 per cent of venture capital contributed, while seed capital to finance new businesses grew by 49 per cent. But the absolute amount of seed capital - at Ecu46m - remained a small fraction of all capital. Mr John Hustler, head of venture capital at KPMG, said: 'Venture capital investment assists with expansion-financing once a business is up and going. The big question is how to get more seed-corn investment for start-ups.' Small companies received the vast majority of venture capital, with 95 per cent going to enterprises with less than 1,000 employees. There was little investment in high-technology industries, in which venture capital investment peaked in 1989. Mr Hustler said this was a function of the structure of European businesses. He said there had been a sharp increase in investment in the medical and health sectors, while venture capitalists were still neglecting opportunities in telecommunications.</p>

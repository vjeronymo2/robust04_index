			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Han Zhenjun (7281 2182 6511)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 14 Apr (XINHUA) -- After more than 30  years, China has achieved world-renowned successes in applying  nuclear technology in agriculture, and the successes are  yielding economic returns worth 3.32 billion yuan per year. The  results achieved in certain fields rank top in the world.  Radioactive breeding, in particular, has been highly assessed  by the International Nuclear Energency Agency.    According to statistics, the 383 mutated fine seed strains  which China has bred with radioactive breeding technology  account for nearly one-third of the world's total seed strains  bred by means of mutation induction, placing China on top of the  world in this regard. As a result of radioactive breeding,  China has come in control of a large number of distintive  mutants that can promote early maturity, short stem, disease and  degeneration resistance [kang ni 2123 6627], and fine quality,  creating a gene bank for seed breeding. Currently the annual  acreage for these new seed strains has been maintained at more  than 9 million hectares; and the use of fine seed strains has  increased the output of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops by  nearly 5 billion kg and brought in more than 3 billion yuan of  economic returns each year. The total value received from the  higher output is 800 times of the total investment in the  research. Following the introduction of the three nationally  well-known new strains -- the "Lumian No. 1" cotton, the  "Yuanfengzao" rice, and the "Tiefeng 18" soybean -- which won  state awards, first class, for invention, China has again  successfully bred the new rice strain, the "Zhefu 802," which  has now become the most widely planted rice species in China.    The application of radioactive breeding technology has now  expanded from grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops to  vegetables, fruits, mulberry, rubber, and flowers. By improving  the "Xiangzaoru No. 1" glutinous rice, Hunan's scientists and  technicians have tackled the species' problem of low yield; and  now the rice species, which are of better quality and pest  resistant, have become Hunan's dominant glutinous rice species  and their use has expanded to 16 other provinces and regions,  including Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Hubei. Because of their  adaptability to north China's cold climate, the fast growing  soybean and cold-resistant rubber species which China has  successfully bred in recent years are growing in sizable parts  in north China. The "Yuandong No. 3," a newly bred wheat  strain, is resistant to rust disease, powdery mildew, aphid, dry  and hot wind, and soil salinization. This extraordinary wheat  strain that can ensure steady output is being introduced on  sizable areas.    Making insect pests infertile is a special application of  nuclear technology in agriculture. The idea is to kill insect  pests through letting loose male insects that have been made  infertile with radiation so that female insects that mate with  them cannot reproduce. Remarkable progress has already been  made in this research project. To control fruit flies [da shi  ying 1129 1395 5859] that menace tangerines, scientists and  technicians once let loose 100,000 male flies that had been made  infertile through radiation on a 500-mu experimental tangerine  farm in Guizhou. Consequently the menace of the flies in the  farm dropped from 5-8 percent to 0.005 percent. This virtually  complete extinction has served as a basis for widespread  application of the technique that makes insect pests infertile.    The application of isotopic tracing technology in  agriculture, which has substantially upgraded China's  agricultural research, plays a significant part in guiding  agricultural production. The results obtained from the research  can be used for teaching farmers how to correctly and  economically use fertilizers, and also can be used for studying  how to prevent environmental pollution through understanding the  residue of agricultural chemicals in plants and soil.    Meanwhile, China has also succeeded in increasing the  hatching and sprouting rates of soybeans and eggs of silk  cocoons, carps, prawns, and in accelerating their growth and  maturity through treating them with low-dosage radiation. Prawn  output has now increased 15-20 percent, and silk output has  increased 20 percent.</p>

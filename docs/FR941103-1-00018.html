			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge was established by authority of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of February 18, 1929 (45 Stat. 1222), as amended, and the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act of March 16, 1934, as amended. The refuge is a part of the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge Complex, but has a full-time project leader and staff. The purposes of the refuge are (1) for use as an inviolate sanctuary, or for any other management purpose, for migratory birds; (2) for suitable incidental fish and wildlife-oriented recreational development; (3) the protection of natural resources; and (4) conservation of endangered species or threatened species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Humboldt Bay is situated 280 miles north of San Francisco and 85 miles south of the Oregon border. Humboldt Bay lies on a narrow coastal plain. It is a natural land-locked harbor 1/2 to 4 miles wide and 14 miles long, separated from the ocean by well-developed coastal dunes and a sand beach. Humboldt Bay is a vital link in the coastal section of the Pacific Flyway for migratory waterfowl, shorebirds, and other waterbirds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sport fishing in Humboldt Bay is a popular form of recreation. Well established fisheries for perch, smelt, salmon, rockfish, crabs and clams provide for local enthusiasts as well as tourists. Declines in salmon stocks on the north coast have resulted in sharply reduced seasons and shifts in fishing effort to other species. Fisheries gaining rapidly in popularity are dungeness crab ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cancer magister <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), leopard shark ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Triakis semifasciata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), California halibut ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paralichthys californicus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and various clams. Sport fishing within the bay accounts for more than 30,000 angler-days each year. Most of the fishing in South Humboldt Bay occurs on the South Jetty and at Buhne's Point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public sport fishing will be permitted on navigable waters of Humboldt Bay that fall within the existing refuge boundary. Most fishing in Humboldt Bay will occur from boats on the navigable waters. Fishing will also be permitted from the outer levee of Hookton Slough, west of the designated parking lot. The non-tidally influenced areas (levees and seasonal wetlands) will be closed to fishing to provide disturbance-free resting and foraging areas for migratory birds. Anglers will be monitored on an opportunistic basis to determine if any wildlife disturbance is occurring. Fishing will be permitted within the framework of applicable State and Federal regulations. The California Department of Fish and Game will be consulted if any changes are planned in the refuge fishing program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Opening the refuge to sport fishing has been found to be compatible in a separate compatibility determination. This determination noted time and zone restrictions. A Section 7 evaluation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act was conducted, and it was determined that the proposed action would not adversely affect any Federally listed or proposed for listing threatened or endangered species or their critical habitats. Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), an environmental assessment was made and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was made regarding the fishing program. Numerous contacts were made throughout the area of the refuge soliciting comments on the proposed fishing plan. The California Department of Fish and Game concurs and fully supports the regulated sport fishing program proposed at the refuge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has determined that there would be sufficient funds to administer the proposed hunt pursuant to the requirements of the Refuge Recreation Act. The cost of establishing and managing the fishing program will be minimal, and will consist primarily of posting and maintaining ``Public Fishing Area'' signs and including fishing information in the refuge brochure. There are necessary funds within the annual budget of the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge Complex for this work. There will be no facilities developed or managed specifically for the use of anglers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements for part 32 are found in 50 CFR part 25 and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0014. The information is being collected to assist the Service in administering these programs in accordance with statutory authorities which require that recreational uses be compatible with the primary purposes for which the areas were established. The information requested in the application form is required to obtain a benefit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public reporting burden for the application form is estimated to average six (6) minutes per response, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing the form. Direct comments on the burden estimate or any other aspect of this form to the Service Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, NW, MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1018&hyph;0014), Washington, DC 20503. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Economic Effect <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In addition, a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) has revealed that the rulemaking would not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. This proposed rule would have minimal effect on such entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

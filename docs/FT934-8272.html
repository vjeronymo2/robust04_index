			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong hears a different story Investors in senior global markets had an uncomfortable time last week. As measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the US performed better than the other big blocs, with a rise of 1.4 per cent against one of just 0.1 per cent in Europe and a fall of 0.8 per cent in Japan. However, Wall Street's eventual gains were based on indications of economic recovery, which left an apparent price to be paid elsewhere. International economists and strategists now expect higher US interest rates, sucking US investment back into the domestic bond market and away from the foreign adventures which have given Pacific Basin, and occasionally European equities, a high old time of it recently. So far, so good. The US was up, Europe flat, and Japan overvalued, according to analysts and investment managers. But that did not stop Hong Kong advancing a further 8.7 per cent, taking its gain to 76.6 per cent so far this year. Mr Michael Paterson, at Asia Equity in London, says that US interest rates, for Hong Kong, are a secondary argument. 'A sharp rise in US rates would have some effect,' he says, 'although Hong Kong as an exporter would enjoy a US recovery.' However, adds Mr Paterson, the important thing about Hong Kong is that China has had an economic revolution and that it is using Hong Kong as a financial centre. He argues that the Hong Kong equity market, on a discount to the world on a 1994 price/earnings ratio of 15, should actually be at a premium. As Hong Kong rose, New Zealand fell, by about the same amount. First, the equity market there failed to get the National government it wanted, and expected, says Ms Pauline McAtamney at Ord Minett in London. Secondly, delays in the outcome of voting on eight marginal seats has produced further uncertainties, which may be resolved when the results are known tomorrow.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change  % change in                    % change in local currency**  sterling** US Dollars**             1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of    Start of     Start of                                        1993        1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -0.83   -0.11   +32.02   +29.07      +24.99       +22.43 Belgium      -0.40   +0.80   +22.27   +23.29      +15.77       +13.39 Denmark      +0.04   +3.59   +32.29   +37.89      +31.10       +28.42 Finland      -1.89   +2.15  +101.13   +93.91      +77.54       +73.93 France       +0.63   -1.19   +19.38   +17.48      +12.55       +10.24 Germany      -0.07   +0.46   +30.81   +30.56      +27.62       +25.01 Ireland      +0.55   +5.66   +65.21   +49.85      +32.67       +29.95 Italy        -1.45   -6.63   +31.12   +29.51      +17.59       +15.18 Netherlands  -2.00   +2.36   +33.19   +31.15      +28.28       +25.65 Norway       -1.22   +0.29   +50.41   +36.09      +30.49       +27.82 Spain        +0.27   -0.32   +52.50   +40.59      +20.33       +17.86 Sweden       +0.51   +0.09   +76.76   +38.58      +21.95       +19.46 Switzerland  +2.24   +4.74   +41.72   +32.31      +32.23       +29.52 UK           +0.20   -0.86   +15.89   +10.25      +10.25        +7.99 EUROPE       +0.13   -0.08   +26.10   +21.14      +17.75       +15.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -0.20   +0.37   +47.31   +28.94      +26.05       +23.47 Hong Kong    +8.65  +13.73   +49.38   +76.59      +80.66       +76.96 Japan        -0.80   -4.00   +26.38   +20.56      +44.75       +41.80 Malaysia     +2.57   +6.56   +74.11   +80.49      +88.92       +85.06 New Zealand  -8.61   -4.70   +50.48   +33.20      +42.50       +39.50 Singapore    +2.50   -3.54   +54.49   +43.74      +51.07       +47.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       +2.50   +3.51   +22.58   +21.03      +19.66       +17.21 USA          +1.40   -0.99    +9.73    +6.50       +8.73        +6.50 Mexico       +1.59   +6.59   +22.97   +14.23      +12.65       +10.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa +3.22   +6.16   +42.64   +32.86      +53.32       +50.18 WORLD INDEX  +0.61   -1.11   +20.24   +16.09      +22.66       +20.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on November 12th 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, and NatWest Securities Limited.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Lviv Oblast: Seven Parties Can Count on Winning Seats. </F> Communists Striving To Join This Group"]    [Text] The elections on 27 March have once again confirmed  that Galicia is distinct even from its neighboring Western  Ukrainian oblasts. While voters in Zakarpattya, Bukovyna  [Chernivtsi Oblast], and Volyn, elected only one deputy in each  of these oblasts in the first round, and not a single deputy was  elected in Rivne Oblast, Lviv [Lvov] Oblast has already elected  nine deputies in 23 districts, Ternopil Oblast -- four in 10  districts, and Ivano-Frankivsk -- a total of six in 12 districts.    However, there are differences between these three oblasts  as  well. In Forecarpathia [Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast], a conclusive  victory over Rukh members has been scored by the "Volkovetskyy  team" -- a group of prominent Kiev "Vikings" (V. Pylypchuk, V.  Mulyava, P. Movchan, Ye. Pronyuk), invited to run here by the  chairman of the oblast council of people's deputies [Stepan  Volkovetskyy] (who has long been battling the local supporters  of [Vyacheslav] Chornovil, entrenched in the oblast state  administration). They were joined by Stepan Volkovetskyy himself  and the leader of the local Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists  [KUN]. On the other hand, in Ternopil Oblast, each of four  parties (Rukh, Ukrainian Republican Party [URP], KUN, and the  Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA]) have so far won one seat each.    The situation in Lviv Oblast is somewhat more complicated.  So  far (as anticipated), those forces that put their stakes on  well-known public figures have been most successful -- namely,  Rukh and the New Wave [Nova khvylya] Union. Outright victories  were scored by the well-known deputies and Rukh members Les  Tanyuk and Yaroslav Kendzyor, Viktor Pynzenyk from the New Wave  Union, and Mykhaylo Kosiv and Ihor Yukhnovskyy, who cooperated  with both political currents. Also in this group are Stepan  Khmara, the leader of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican  Party [UKRP], who won overwhelmingly over his long-time  opponent, Mykhaylo Horyn, head of the URP, as is Ivan Bilas,  member of KUN and a well-known military historian. The exception  here was an independent candidate -- Yevhen Zherebetskyy, an  associate of the Academy's Institute of Ukrainian Studies, who  was one of the founders of the Lviv organization of Rukh in 1989  and then lay very low in political terms for the next five years  (colleagues new to this job asked this author in amazement "Who  is this man?"). Another event that created a sensation was the  lightning-quick victory of Ihor Koliushko, a young politician  from the New Wave Union (who was also active five years ago).    However, there were losses even among the leaders. Left  behind in the first round were the New Wave's Ihor Hryniv,  heretofore a people's deputy, and several other of this union's  favorites. The Lviv organization of Rukh lost its leader, Yuriy  Klyuchkovskyy; Lyubomyra Boychyshyn of recent fame; the young  and promising politician, Ihor Derzhko; yet another of its  celebrities, Volodymyr Chernyak (the latter ran in Lviv Oblast  against the will of the regional organization of Rukh); and a  few other candidates. KUN lost General Oleksandr Rol.    Still, the "New Wave" can take comfort in the fact that  People's Deputy Taras Steckiv made it to the second round,  running ahead of his rival (33.9% as against  18.7%), People's  Deputy Iryna Kalynets. Rukh can count on victories by People's  Deputy Dmytro Chobit, deputy Rukh chairman Oleksandr  Lavrynovych, and two more of its candidates. Running in the  second round from KUN will be Serhiy Zhyzhko, head of the KUN  secretariat, and five of his comrades-in-arms. Among those  continuing to battle it out in the electoral marathon are  people's deputies of Ukraine Larysa Skoryk (All-Ukrainian Rukh  [VNRU] and Orest Vlokh (DemPU). Meanwhile, their independent  parliamentary colleagues, Ivan Makar and Ihor Derkach, have left  the race.    The URP also finds itself among the outsiders. After the  defeat of its all- Ukrainian leader, its main hope lies with the  economist Oleksandr Shandryuk, who fell short of outright  victory in the first round in Lviv's Shevchenkivskyy electoral  district by a mere 0.37%. This district serves as a  perfect  example of what the fragmentation of democratic forces leads to:  Due to the large number of democratic candidates (which included  many well-known figures), the electorate split the vote to such  a degree that the Communist Oleksandr Holub was able to make it  to the second round with a paltry (but guaranteed) number of  votes (7.7%), while a Republican was unable to gain an  outright  victory in the first round.    In addition to Shandryuk, those still in the fight include  Oleh Pavlyshyn, head of the oblast organization of the URP, and  two other members of this party.    The UNA has good chances in Lviv Oblast. In his district,  Oleh Vitovych, the regional commander of the Ukrainian National  Self-Defense Force [UNSO], is leading (38.5% versus  24.5%)  against Mykola Horyn, the chairman of the oblast council of  people's deputies, while Yaroslav Ilyasevych, chief of staff of  the same team, is leading against Zoreslava Romovska, a law  professor (48.9% against 11.3%). In contrast, even  the name of  his legendary father, the commander of the Ukrainian Insurgent  Army [UPA], did not help Yuriy Shukhevych, the leader of the  UNA, in the elections. Presumably, voters were stopped by the  candidate's age and poor health. Andriy Shkil, a young and  promising politician known for his eloquence, who heads the  oblast committee of the UNA, could have won in many districts of  Lviv Oblast, but not in the Pivdennyi district, where he ran  against the unrivaled Viktor Pynzenyk. But, based on the results  of the first round in Ternopil Oblast, the UNA can count on at  least three seats.    The electoral campaign of the other ultra-right party -- the  Social- Nationalist Party of Ukraine [SNPU] -- produced almost  zero results. It is unseemly to count other people's money, but  judging by the number of leaflets bearing a symbol resembling a  swastika (to be sure, the SNPU claims that the symbol represents  a combination of the letters "I" and "N" -- "national idea," the  number of huge yellow banners bearing the same symbol that  covered Lviv's most important buildings, and the number of  evening hours bought on the local television program "Mist," one  can imagine how much money was spent on the campaign by the  Social-Nationalists. Nevertheless, not a single one of the  SNPU's 21 candidates (including its leaders) made it to the  second round -- apparently their unusual emblem, black shirts,  and their name, which evokes certain associations, made a  different impression on the voters than what the SNPU expected.  All that the Social-Nationalists are left with is taking comfort  in the victory of their ally, S. Khmara, and the hope that their  other ally, Iryna Kalynets, wins.</p>

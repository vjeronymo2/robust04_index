			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / EC edges closer to tax on energy THE likelihood of an EC-wide tax on energy to combat global warming edged closer last night as an even split withinthe Community turned into an 11-1 majority in favour of the principle of a carbon tax - still resisted by the UK. The six member states, led by Germany and the Netherlands, which have virtually signed up already to the European Commission's proposal for an energy tax, garnered support yesterday from the four poorest EC states and from France, leaving Britain potentially isolated. Environment and energy ministers of the 12 were last night still striving for a compromise which the UK could sign up to, but fair distribution of the energy tax burden has been agreed in principle. The Commission's tax plan would raise the price of a barrel of oil equivalent by Dollars 10 by the end of the century, with half of the levy falling on all non-renewable fuel and half on its carbon content. At yesterday's special ministerial meeting, a 'burden-sharing' formula was agreed whereby the tax would be modulated to 'take into account different levels of economic development and different levels of carbon dioxide emissions of individual member states'. This rough formula still leaves much to play for - and any final decison rests with EC finance ministers, who will discuss the tax in June. But it was sufficient yesterday to comfort the four poorest countries - Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece - that they may be able to negotiate a delayed phasing-in of the tax, and to reassure France that it can negotiate to protect its nuclear industry, by changing its mix to penalise the fossil content of fuel. Britain, after consultations with the Danish presidency of the EC, was last night pushing for a vague formula. This noted that several member states regarded fiscal instruments as a 'significant contribution' to cutting CO emissions, but merely urged the Community to make up its mind on an EC-wide tax 'as soon as possible.' 'We are still considering in the UK what the way forward is,' said Mr Tim Eggar, British energy minister. Such a formula, senior Dutch officials said, would be 'worse than useless', and if the ministers were to reach any conclusions, the UK's objections should be recorded in a footnote. 'If they want another opt-out, that could not be acceptable on competition grounds,' one said. Mr Eggar, accompanied by Mr David Maclean, junior environment minister, said yesterday that those countries which had changed their view on the principle of the tax were still 'deeply unhappy with how those principles were to be put into practice.'</p>

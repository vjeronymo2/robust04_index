			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Property: Auctions: the simple way to buy and sell - They are quick, efficient, and offer freedom from gazumping. Gerald Cadogan explains what to do The property auctioneer issues his challenge: 'It's against you, sir.' What does he mean? And what is 'sir' to do? In fact, the auctioneer is saying that another bid has topped yours - so you must decide whether to carry on bidding or forego the property you are seeking. At such times, the adrenalin surges - but you need to stay cool. If you like brinkmanship, you could wait until he says: 'Going for the first time, going for the second time . . .' You then slip in a bid just before he has time to say: 'Going for the third time, and sold' (with a bang of the hammer). Sometimes, this ploy offers the chance for a bargain; after all, you would not expect frivolous bidders at this stage. Sometimes, though, it never goes to the third call; the auctioneer stops to say: 'I am sorry. The property has not met the reserve.' If you remain interested, that is the moment to approach the saleroom management and try to arrange a private deal. Auctions are the quick and efficient way of buying and selling property, provided you know what you want and can afford. You have the security of knowing there is no gazumping - that is, acceptance of a higher offer from someone else after the deal has been agreed - once the hammer is down. A saleroom assistant takes your name and a cheque for 10 per cent of the price (which the auction house will present next morning for special clearance), and you exchange contracts before you leave. Just 28 days later, the place is yours. Sellers usually pay around 2.5 per cent, plus advertising charges. For this, they get far greater publicity than almost any private treaty sale. Property auctions split into two types. First, there are small country sales of a single property or group of properties, often held in the local pub or village hall. Then, there are large sales of many properties, held at hotels in London and other centres. These provide potential buyers with up to 700 homes a month from which to choose, says Gary Murphy of Allsop, a leading auction firm which sold 1,574 residential properties (93 per cent of those offered) for Pounds 61m in 1993. About 60 to 70 per cent are repossessions. Murphy points to a growing trend for auctions to be used as a first resort rather than the last, as they used to be until quite recently. Part of the reason undoubtedly is that buyers are sure of a fixed price  - and sellers of getting their money without purchasers pulling out because the chain of which they are part breaks down. If you are selling, you must decide with the auctioneer on a reserve price. This will not be more than the published guide price, which is intended as a realistic estimate and is often exceeded, anyway. The seller must also give the auctioneer copies of all the relevant papers. For a Pounds 10 fee, these can be passed to a potential buyer or his solicitor, together with any special conditions of sale. It is important to remember that all parties must do their legal homework, as auction sales are binding contracts and are not offers subject to contract and survey, as in a private treaty sale. Once you have found something you like, decide if you want a survey done (this should produce an independent valuation). Then, contact your mortgage provider and tell your solicitor, who might want to get in touch with the vendor's lawyer. Your financing, and everything else, must be in order before you go into the saleroom. If you do not want to bid before the sale, check carefully - and often  - that the property has not been withdrawn or 'sold prior'; auctioneers will provide an addendum that details any last-minute changes. On the day itself, arrive in good time. Listen to what the auctioneer says in his general remarks - they may affect the lot in which you are interested. If you can, take your solicitor or surveyor to bid for you; they will not be carried away. If you bid yourself, pay attention and keep your limit firmly in mind. Do not rush to enter the bidding; it can help you if it is slow. (There is an alternative ploy to which I once fell victim when trying to bid for a semi-derelict farmhouse. The survey had been done and I had decided on what seemed a sensible limit of Pounds 30,000. As the auctioneer looked for starting bids, a voice from the back boomed 'Pounds 30,000' - and blew away any competition on the spot.) Finally, never bid for a property you have not seen personally, as some dealers do. Country auctions are excellent for properties that agents find hard to assess (which often means they are in need of considerable attention). This summer, for instance, Carter Jonas sold a Georgian old rectory at Moulsoe in Buckinghamshire for Pounds 220,000 (guide price: Pounds 150,000). The property was in a terrible state - its last serious redecoration was in the 1920s. But Margaret Whitmore, of Carter Jonas, explains: 'We held the sale in front of the house. Everybody knew what was on offer.' Meanwhile, more than 100 people attended Henry Adams' auction (in Goodwood House) of the derelict Seven Points on the Goodwood estate in West Sussex. With a guide price of Pounds 125,000, it went for Pounds 137,000.</p>

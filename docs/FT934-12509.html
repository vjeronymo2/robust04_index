			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Foster's accepts offer from Hudson Conway FOSTER'S Brewing Group, the Australian brewer which owns Courage in the UK, yesterday announced that it had accepted an offer from Hudson Conway (HCL), a Victoria-based property group in which Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press has an interest, to buy back and cancel shares owned by Foster's in HCL. The offer is pitched at ADollars 3.50 a share. Foster's owns around 12.8m shares in Hudson Conway, which would net it approximately ADollars 45m (USDollars 30m). In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Hudson Conway - which is part of the consortium that recently won the right to build Melbourne's first casino - said the proposal was subject to shareholder approval at its annual meeting, scheduled for November, and confirmation by the Supreme Court of Victoria. CRA, the Australian mining house which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ Corporation, yesterday announced a series of top-level management changes, intended to ensure a smooth succession as members of current management retire. The mining company said that Mr Leon Davis would succeed Mr John Ralph as chief executive of the company, when Mr Ralph retires next year. Mr Davis has been with CRA for 37 years and was seconded to RTZ, as mining director, in 1991. He will return to Melbourne in May, and fill the post of managing director and chief executive designate until Mr Ralph, CRA's long-standing chief executive retires later in 1994.</p>

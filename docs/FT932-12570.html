			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / TUC region presses for wider balloting THE NORTHERN region of TUC is to lobby for the next general secretary to be elected by a vote of all members of TUC-affiliated unions. Mr Bob Howard, regional secretary, said the TUC had for too long been seen as a London-based office, selecting its general secretary and senior officials on the basis of 'Buggins' turn'. Stressing that he was not seeking the position, Mr Howard said he was not against Mr John Monks, deputy general secretary who is expected to succeed Mr Norman Willis when he takes early retirement. The ethos of the union movement now, said Mr Howard, was to move towards 'universal democratic membership suffrage'. Adoption of that in the selection of the general secretary by giving all members of affiliated unions a personal vote could overcome the 'unfair criticism' suffered by Mr Willis, he said. 'It would reinforce the authority of whoever became general secretary.' The TUC said that no union had asked to change the system. Nominations from affiliated unions will be open until mid July. If more than one nomination is made, delegates at the TUC's annual congress in September will vote on the basis of one vote per 1,000 members they represent.</p>

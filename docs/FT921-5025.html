			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Technology: New copier goes back to its roots - Worth Watching TWENTY-FIVE years ago the now ubiquitous plain paper copier was in its infancy. Most offices used a stencil machine to run off multiple copies of documents. Now a distant descendant of the humble stencil duplicator, called a digital duplicator, is poised to challenge the copier's supremacy. The digital duplicator is a blend of old and new technologies. It uses a stencil master image produced using scanning technology similar to a fax machine. The result is a single compact unit in which the original is fed in one end and copies emerge from the other - just like a copier, but with an output of 130 copies per minute it rivals all but the fastest copiers which cost much more. The quality of digital duplicating is now equal to, if not better than, that of a copier, and, like its predecessor, produces high-volume copies (anything in excess of 15-20 copies) at a low cost. Riso Kagaku of Japan, which pioneered digital duplicating, has launched a series of models costing less than Pounds 10,000 which will also take input direct from a desktop PC or Apple Mac.

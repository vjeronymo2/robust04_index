			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Arts: The new bible for opera lovers - Max Loppert reviews the latest dictionary in the Grove opus The original Grove was Sir George (1820-1900). He was a very Victorian sort of polymath: a builder of bridges and lighthouses by profession, a passionate amateur of the arts who inter multa alia conceived of and edited the very first Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians. This was published piecemeal from 1879 onwards, and in complete form in 1890. So far, there have been six editions of the Dictionary. The first five remained more or less small operations under the control of a single editor. Then came Grove 6, published in 1980, and running to 20 volumes, far more than originally planned; it was edited by not just a main 'Grove' - Stanley Sadie - but by three senior consulting 'Groves' and 32 executive 'Grovelets' in tandem. These facts, and the re-naming of Grove 6 as The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (because almost all articles had of necessity been newly commissioned), may stand as symbols of the growth in the amount and kind of information on musical subjects ready and waiting to be codified to the taste of the late-20th century. It did not stop there: Grove 6 engendered a mass of offshoots (long articles published as separate paperbacks), and then a couple of bigger developments  -among them The New Grove Dictionary of American Music - requiring material new as well as redeployed. Now comes the latest epic of musical explication linking the Macmillan publishing company to the Grove name. Opera Grove is likewise edited by Dr Sadie, decked with editorial assistants, and longer than originally intended. It follows the Grove 6 layout and model, and claims 'New' in its title for much the same reason as did Grove 6. That is to say: roughly 90 per cent of the articles have been newly commissioned, with the remainder reprinted from Grove 6 (and, on occasion, altered and/or cut without the original writer's sanction, as I can personally testify). On the other hand, the four volumes stand taller and look even handsomer than the 20 of Grove 6 (plush red instead of plain brown covers, gilt topping). The statistics relating to their contents - more than 5,700 pages, nearly 3,000 entries on composers and more than 2,500 on singers alone, with many others on related opera performers and departments, technical terms, theatres and cities with operatic links and traditions - are astonishing. But then, this is altogether a pretty astonishing achievement. The meat of Opera Grove lies in its general articles - 'Opera' itself, 'Libretto' (the longest in the dictionary), 'Criticism', 'Production', 'Stage Design', 'Sociology of opera', and (for its good humour and good sense) Lord Harewood's 'Casting' are just some I particularly admire - and in its entries on the composers. These latter stretch wide across the historical span, from the greats to the marginals, from Mozart to the 17th-century Italian Abbatini and the 19th-century Czech Josef Leopold Zvonar. New to Opera Grove, and hugely valuable, are the pieces on the most important individual operas of those composers - from Figaro to Paliashvili's Abesalom da Eteri and Schubert's Die Zwillingsbruder. The more prominent the composer, the longer and more copiously detailed the entry. Ditto the operas themselves. Complaint about the inclusion of lesser-known figures and works from the past seems to me shortsighted; after all, today's Legrenzi may become tomorrow's Cavalli, once some opera or recording company has newly revealed his merits. Up-to-date-ness has been achieved, sometimes quite remarkably. William Bolcom, whose first full-scale opera, McTeague, had its premiere last October, is in, with eight sensible lines of description on the new opera itself. Indeed, of the noteworthy composers of new operas I have encountered in recent years, only the young Swede Hans Gefors (composer of Christina) and the American Meredith Monk (creator of and performer in Atlas) lack entries. This suggests a degree of consistency that, unfortunately, has not been achieved in other subsidiary departments. In his Preface Dr Sadie neatly pre-empts possible criticism on this score: 'The New Grove Dictionary of Opera has been written by some 1,300 people and it no doubt embodies many contradictions.' Nevertheless, the degree and type of inconsistency between articles prove far more considerable than this would seem to suggest. There is a sharp disparity of 'tone' between the most abstruse theoretical discussions (eg 'Analysis'), which seem to have been directed by one academic at another, and most of the rest. As I recall them (having contributed sections 6 and 7 of 'Gluck'), the Opera Grove author guidelines were primarily concerned with (house-)style, not substance. For the author this meant welcome freedom from stringent formula-fulfilment; but it has led to a variation in the balance struck between information and evaluation from article to article that will perhaps prove not so welcome to the amateur or newcomer to the subject. My FT colleagues David Murray ('Strauss', full of elegantly expressed, theatre-tested perceptions) and Andrew Clements ('Berg', 'Henze' and several later 20th-century figures) are among those who seem to me to get the balance right. Other longer articles I have read that 'say something' beyond the merely factual include Rodney Milnes's characteristically zestful polemic in defence of Massenet, Richard Taruskin brilliantly acute on Prokofiev and Mussorgsky, Julian Budden re-evaluating Puccini with magisterial clarity and fairness, Amanda Glauert's judicious survey of Humperdinck, Richard Osborne's unfailingly lively 'Rossini'; by contrast, Julian Rushton ('Mozart') and Anthony Hicks ('Handel'), both undoubtedly scholarly in their grasp of fact and text, fail to illuminate their subjects as it were from within. A more serious inconsistency arises in the longer single-work entries. Some give the details of first casts and those of important revivals, some do not. Some indicate key recordings, all the more important when the work is a rarity, some do not. This particular failure, an editorial rather than an authorial one, is significant. Recordings are for many people the main entry into the world of opera; the Opera Grove supply of discographical information is at once parsimonious and frustratingly uneven, leading to the curious situation that so huge and fact-filled a dictionary on opera should nevertheless require other sources of basic information to supplement it. I would have been happy to sacrifice the all-too-numerous entries on minor British singers to fill in at least the basic gaps. In the matter of the singers' entries, the inconsistencies are of a different but even more troubling order: a favouritism amounting at times to absurdity in coverage of the British, and the sheer disparity in quality between the most illuminating pieces and the thuddingly unilluminating ones  -the latter unfortunately far more generously supplied. All dictionary-reviewers play the inclusion-exclusion game, and no doubt Dr Sadie is already hardened to its niggly results; but - just to take the example of lower-voiced male singers - it seems to me incomprehensible that the Englishmen Roderick Kennedy, Roderick Earle and Matthew Best, honourable second-rankers all, should have been included (with, however, no mention of Mr Best's conducting sideline) when no place was found for the Frenchman Francois Le Roux (leading Pelleas of our day), the Russian Vladimir Chernov (newest important 'Italian' baritone), or the German Franz Grundheber (leading Wozzeck of our day). What distinguishes the illuminating singer's entry from the opposite kind is difficult to analyse. Still, when examples lie to hand of J. B. Steane and Desmond Shawe-Taylor at their most discerning on the 'historicals', the reader may well come to regret all the more the prosaic stuff that is poured out to serve the current crop of singers. So many of them are deemed in some way 'ideal' or 'unrivalled' that the epithets soon lose their clout. This is clearly a part of the same 'feel-good' factor that caused, say, Alan Blyth's vivid Grove 6 summing-up of Gwyneth Jones to lose all mention of the 'uncomfortable beat' in her tone when re-cycled in Opera Grove; and it often leads to the evasion of all 'negative' characteristics, even when these are common knowledge. The situation with regard to other operatic executants is less vexed. Barry Millington's accounts of 'controversial' producers such as Ruth Berghaus are a pleasure to read for their lucid, balanced judgment. But still, the matter of who gets in and who does not causes puzzlements. Conductors: Lionel Friend but no Michel Plasson, Mark Ermler, Carlo Rizzi, Paul Daniel, or the late Pierre Dervaux or Charles Groves (musical head of two British opera companies during his lifetime). Opera-house bosses: the ENO men Arlen, Harewood and Jonas, quite properly, but no Jeremy Isaacs, Nicholas Payne or Elaine Padmore. Critics require also to have produced books or translations to find a place; so it is odd that the FT's Ronald Crichton, William Weaver and Paul Griffiths, all three authors of studies with direct operatic connections, have not. As for Dr Sadie's decision to exclude himself, this is modesty gone mad] Even after so short an acquaintanceship with Opera Grove, I feel strongly that its editorial team badly needed - but failed ever to acquire - the dictionary equivalent of the cinematic Continuity Girl or Boy hovering around the set to ensure that scenes matched up when filmed out of order. Opera Grove has already been attacked, from the loonier fringes of opera criticism, for an 'ideological bias' that runs counter to the notion of opera-as-theatre. For this to be the case, the dictionary would have to show much more care and consistency in organisation and content. Perhaps this is its saving grace. Probably a more consistent Opera Grove could only have been created by a race of operatic Ubermenschen. Much of it suggests it has been so created: that is the wonder of the achievement. The latest Grove issue keeps faith with the lighthouse and bridge-building spirit and enterprise of its founding father: it is a monument to the most unstable, labour-intensive, perpetually controversial and grandest of the Western performing arts.

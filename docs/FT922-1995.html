			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Major's privatisation of personal choice Forget about the Labour party. Yesterday's quarrelsome inquest into its election defeat is doubtless of great interest to students of bio-diversity. They may wish to protect even the most suicidally-inclined of endangered species. The rest of us do better to study real events. One such took place on Tuesday night, when Mr John Major addressed the 15th anniversary dinner of the Adam Smith Institute. The prime minister said next to nothing new, yet his speech was a revelation. It turns out that when he indicated during the April campaign that he would, as he now puts it, 'privatise choice', he really meant it. If 'privatise choice' puzzles you, hang on a moment. All will be made plain. But first note a second event of political significance. This occurred on Wednesday. The protagonist was Mr Norman Lamont. He was addressing a business gathering in Surrey. 'In two or three years,' he said, 'people will look back and see that it was now, during this critical period, that the right decisions were taken.' Put these speeches together and you have a clear picture of the strategy for British domestic policy over the medium term. The economy will be tightly managed. The discipline of the exchange rate mechanism remains in place. There was no panicky cut in interest rates before the election; in the chancellor's view there is no case for one now. The government's ambition is to halve the inflation rate to 2 per cent or 3 per cent and keep it falling towards zero. This squares with the Treasury's attempts to force public expenditure planning totals for 1993-94 down below the levels agreed in the pre-election round. So far, so predictable. Election bribes are there to be taken back when you have won. That established, we can return to 'privatising choice'. Mr Major's explanation of this intriguing phrase is that 'where once socialism nationalised or municipalised personal choice, taking it away from the individual and the family, we will give choice back to them and extend it further'. This, he told the institute, is 'the greatest and most far-reaching' privatisation, and 'the one to which I am most committed'. As I see it, three consequences follow. The public services will be turned upside-down. Local government will be further diminished. And there will be no extra money to ease this revolution through. Take central government first. The Citizen's Charter is not welcomed by the Civil Service, but No 10 Downing Street is determined to promote it. It is holding another seminar on the subject. I assume that they will be wearing their lapel-badges. Contracting-out of services, a success in local government, will be attempted in central departments and agencies. This must be about as popular with officials as a 10-year stretch in Canary Wharf. The mandarins intensely dislike open government, but an attempt will be made to weed secrecy clauses out of many existing laws. Do not hope for too much. Government self-regulation of what should and should not be secret is never to be trusted. There are few contemporary headlines in all this, but the net effect could be dramatic. The structure of Britain's central administration in 2000 might be unrecognisable to anyone who last saw it in, say, 1980. Those who look for local government around millennium-time may need a magnifying glass. The great town hall barons of the 1970s, with their direct labour forces, council-house fiefdoms, and monopolies over state education services will have been swept away. The local government commission will doubtless reduce the number of local authorities. Mrs Margaret Thatcher started the process of rescuing council tenants from local authority control; Mr Major is clearly determined to complete the job. Most strikingly, the education service is being taken away from locally-elected bodies. This is apparently not centralisation. 'No bureaucrat decides whether a school should apply to become grant-maintained,' says Mr Major. 'It is the governors and parents.' Yet control over local governance follows the money to pay for it; seven-eighths of council revenue from taxation is now received in the form of cheques from Whitehall. When it comes to sink schools, Mr Major intimated on Tuesday, control will be direct. 'If the governors or the local authority are unwilling or unable to put things right, then we must find ways to raise standards in them.' For the rest, it will be indirect. The universities, polytechnics and sixth-form colleges already have their own appointed 'funding councils'; a similar non-elected intermediary body for the country's 4,900 secondary schools cannot be far behind. This will surely require a fresh corps of administrators. Even Mr Major's government is wary of taking on the country's 24,000 primary schools, although it seems to think that by allowing groups of them to become self-governing it can keep the new intermediary bureaucracy to a minimum. There is more. 'The inspection of key public services . . . will be . . . independent of the services they inspect,' said the prime minister. Schools are being given a new free-range inspectorate; social work departments will likewise be audited by outsiders. Throw in a couple of new organograms there. Add just one more for the better management (with no extra money) of the police. 'There should be a policeman passing your door regularly, and not just when the burglars have called,' said Mr Major. Much of this programme makes sense. It is also likely to be popular. Concentrating on individuals and their needs is the spirit of the age. It may even be applied to pensions policy. Here the Tory inclination is to fund-members' rights of ownership to the funds to which they contribute. Mr Robert Maxwell's thievery give a political force to such a strategy. Yet something is missing from the whole picture, and here I do not mean cash. What is to be the role of local democracy? Are people always to be mere customers, except once in four or five years at general elections? Mr Major is saying that Whitehall knows best. Local councils may merely manage the collection of rubbish, town planning, and old people's homes. In Europe he bangs the drum for subsidiarity. At home, he is selling an improved version of Mrs Thatcher's conglomerate, United Kingdom plc. Its board is packed with Conservative ministers. Shed no tears for them. They will keep their jobs - as long as they please the customers.</p>

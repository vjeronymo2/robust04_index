			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.133 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Nitrocellulose and derivatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nitrocellulose includes various types of nitrated cotton or wood pulp, depending on the nitrogen content. When dry, it is extremely sensitive to shock and friction and readily accumulates static charges. It is highly flammable and explosive, burning rapidly and producing very little smoke or residue. Impure, it is subject to spontaneous ignition. Storage of dry nitrocellulose is not permitted as it possesses all the hazards of a sensitive and easily ignited high explosive. Nitrocellulose with 25 to 30 percent moisture content is stored in zinc-lined boxes or metal drums and is substantially nonexplosive when stored in an area where explosives or ammunition cannot be projected into it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.134 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Red phosphorus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Red phosphorus forms sensitive mixtures with oxidizing agents, posing a dangerous fire hazard. It may be stored in general warehouses in metal drums or metal containers included in wood boxes. Phosphine gas may form in containers of red phosphorous; protective measures should be used when opening these. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.135 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Thermite (TH). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thermite, a mixture of iron oxide, aluminum, and other substances, is a dark gray granular mass. To burn, it requires an igniter. At 4300  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F, iron oxide reduces to molten iron, causing rapid burning. Thermate is a mixture of thermite, grained aluminum, barium nitrate, sulfur, and lubricating oil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.136 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Incendiary bombs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Incendiary bombs may consist of a combustible body of magnesium metal alloy containing an igniter composition such as thermate. When ignited, the body of the bomb burns at about  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> 3700  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. Other types (such as IM, NP, PTI) have steel cases filled with thickened fuel. These operate by ejecting the burning fuel over a wide area. Incendiary bombs are difficult to extinguish. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.137 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Colored smoke mixtures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These mixtures contain dye for smoke and some fuels. They do not contain hexachloroethane (HC). Respiratory protection shall be worn for protection against heavy concentrations of smoke. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.138 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FM or FS in smoke form shall not usually produce effects requiring treatment. Smoke in high concentrations from CN&hyph;DM, CN, and HC is toxic, and anyone unprotected by a mask subjected to this should receive medical attention. Corrosive on the skin, liquid FS or FM should be immediately washed with copious quantities of water, then flushed with mild sodium bicarbonate solution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.139 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Adamsite (DM). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DM is a greenish yellow to black solid, melting at 383  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. Smoke from the burning agent causes irritation in the nose and throat even in minimal concentrations. Longer exposure causes tightness of the chest, headache, sneezing, coughing, intense nausea, and weakness. The symptoms increase in severity for some time after exposure, and temptation to remove the mask should be resisted. Irritation produced by this agent is so intense that an intolerable concentration is reached long before it becomes dangerous to life. The effects may last for several hours, but no permanent injury is caused. If DM is spilled, it should not be swept or handled in any way so as to cause dust formation: DM should be wet thoroughly before it is swept. For first aid treatment, remove victim to fresh air and flush nose and throat areas with bicarbonate of soda solution. Let victim breathe an alcohol, chloroform, and ammonia mixture. Evacuate to hospital for medical treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.140 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> O-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) CS is a white crystalline powder similar to, but more powerful than, CN. It has a minimum purity of 96 percent; insoluble in water and ethanol, it is soluble in methylene chloride. CS1 is a micropulverized powder. CS2 is a modified CS1, treated with liquid silicone to increase fluidity and persistency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A protective mask; ordinary coveralls secured at the neck, wrist, and ankles; and rubber gloves shall provide protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Exposure incapacitates within 20 to 60 seconds and, after the affected individual reaches fresh air, the effects continue for 5 to 10 minutes. Eyes burn, tear copiously, and involuntarily close. Exposure also causes coughing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, a stinging sensation, a running nose, and dizziness or a swimming sensation in the head. Heavy concentrations of CS, which has a pepper-like odor, shall also cause nausea and vomiting. To prevent stinging and reddening of the skin, personnel touched by CS dust or particles should not shower for 6 hours. Individuals affected by CS should move to fresh air, face the wind, and should not rub their eyes. To remove accidental gross contamination, personnel should remove clothing and immediately flush the body with copious amounts of water to remove most of the agent; apply 5 percent sodium bisulfite solution to remove remainder (except in or around eyes); then rinse the entire body. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Area decontamination is required with CS, which settles as a dust. Any such accumulation shall be removed, either by vacuuming or washing down the area with detergent solution followed by a clear water rinse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.141 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Sulfur trioxide-chlorosulfonic acid mixture (FS) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is a heavy liquid acid with an acrid odor. It fumes strongly in air, decomposes above 154  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F, and is used solely as a smoke-producing agent. Exposure to heavy concentrations may cause severe irritation to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Inhalation of concentrated fumes causes coughing and strangulation, a constricted feeling around the chest, and a burning sensation in the nose and throat. When the mixture comes in contact with moisture, it forms hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, both of which corrode metals and fabrics. Any FS on clothing or skin should be wiped off with a dry cloth, and the contaminated area flushed with large amounts of water. Itself nonflammable, FS may cause fires if spilled on flammable material, particularly under damp conditions. Leaking munitions containers should be removed from the magazine and contents poured on the ground in a suitable area. Spillage can be removed with large quantities of water. Small quantities of water added to FS react violently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.142 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Titanium tetrachloride (FM). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

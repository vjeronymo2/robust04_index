			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Ireland's DM1.5bn paper attracts retail investors THE Republic of Ireland became the latest EC member state to borrow in D-Marks yesterday, adding to its foreign exchange reserves after the unsuccessful rear-guard action to shore up the punt last month. The republic's DM1.5bn issue of 10-year bonds, increased from an initial DM1bn, was widely seen as a success when set against the Kingdom of Spain's DM4bn, 10-year issue last week. Although an AA3/AA- credit, compared with the AA2/AA of Spain, Ireland's bonds were launched with a yield 24 basis points above the benchmark government bond, marginally tighter than the 25 basis point spread on the Spanish bonds. Spain's issue had already tightened from a 31 basis point yield spread at the time of launch a week earlier. Deutsche Bank, which led the issue and took two thirds of the bonds on to its own books, said demand had been strong from both German and Swiss retail investors, while other banks involved in the deal also reported good demand from Germany. Late in the day, Deutsche was bidding 100.15 for the bonds, above the reoffered price of 100.06. While a queue of sovereign and supranational issuers continued to be rumoured in D-Marks, among them Belgium, Denmark and the European Community, the autonomous Spanish region of Andalucia was the only borrower to declare definite plans to come to the market next week. The region, which has not been to the international market before, plans to issue DM300m of five-year bonds at a yield spread of 75-80 basis points. Andalucia carries an AA3 rating from Moody's, and expects to return to the market later in the year to help fund its Pta130bn borrowing programme. The EC, meanwhile, turned to the Ecu bond market yesterday for the first part of its exercise to fund its recently agreed loan to Italy. Following Finland's Ecu500m issue on Monday, this was only the second big Eurobond issue since the turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism took hold last summer. The EC's issue, which sold out quickly, thanks mainly to the quality of the name, was widely seen as a better test of sentiment in the Ecu bond market than Finland's offer. Its success led to suggestions that other borrowers will use the currency in the coming weeks, although its long-term future was still open to question. The yield on Ecu bonds yesterday was around the same level as the theoretical yield on the basket of currencies that make up the Ecu, a recovery from the depths of the market last autumn, when the yield was some 40 basis points above the theoretical level. The EC's three-year bonds were brought with a yield of 7.785 per cent, four basis points above the UK's three-year Ecu notes auctioned last week, and held their level in later trading. Ford Motor Credit Company launched a Dollars 1bn global issue through Goldman Sachs, though the bonds were said to have met demand almost exclusively from the US. Early price talk, indicating a yield spread of 78-80 basis points over five-year Treasuries when the bonds are priced today, was said to have attracted almost no interest in the international market. 'Not many people are interested in a single-A US car company,' commented one banker, who said he had taken no orders at all outside the US. Good demand from inside the US, though, led the indicated yield spread down to 75-77 basis points later in the day. Meanwhile, continuing expectations of early cuts in UK interest rates brought a further Pounds 100m of reverse floating-rate notes, which pay a higher yield as interest rates fall. The three-year issue, which takes the total in the past two weeks to Pounds 700m, was launched by Samuel Montagu through a special purpose vehicle, Thames Investments. The paper was backed by Pounds 100m of three-year gilts with a coupon of 13 1/4 per cent: coupon payments from these gilts will be used to pay interest on the floating-rate notes. The structure, which relied on the bank's ability to buy a tranche of high-coupon gilts in the market at a low price, due to the intrinsic lack of demand for such paper, enabled Samuel Montagu to offer terms which were slightly better than those typically seen so far: a return based on 12 3/4 per cent minus six-month Libor, rather than 12 3/8 per cent, and an initial minimum coupon of 7 1/8 per cent, rather than 7 per cent. The Republic of Colombia is preparing to return to the international market for the first time since the debt crisis in the early 1980s. However, Colombia has never defaulted on commercial bank debt, although it has stretched the maturity of some loans. Bankers Trust has won the mandate to arrange a Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m offering of five-year Eurobonds, with an option for distribution in the US private placement market. The deal is expected to be launched in late March or early April.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Currency factors reverse early gains in shares - Market report Once again, weakness in the US dollar undermined a firm start on the UK stock market yesterday and although trading volumes were low, share prices were turning easier at the end of the session. Traders commented that it was uncertainty over official US policy towards the dollar that was upsetting London stocks rather than any precise analysis of the implications for profits at the blue chip companies. The market opened firmly as London responded to the dollar's rally late on Friday, which followed suggestions from Washington that the US authorities would intervene to support the currency. Helped also by a rebound in stock index futures, the FT-SE 100 Share Index jumped by 20 points to 3,052.9 in early deals. Trading volume was painfully thin, however, and gains melted as the dollar failed to live up to its early promise and UK government bonds shaded lower. Confidence also cooled when bonds softened following regional consumer price data from Germany. But the market held the line when Wall Street opened higher, and it was not until dollar weakness had turned the Dow Average downwards and bond markets had extended their falls that the Footsie slipped into negative territory. The Dow was 6 points off in UK hours. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a net fall of 3.7 at 3,029.1 and dealers looked with some concern at the approach of the 3,000 level. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 2.2 to 3,500.2 as buyers continued to back away across the broad range of the market. A more revealing picture of the day's trading came from the official business volume figures. Turnover through Seaq, the market's electronic trading network, fell by nearly 12 per cent from Friday's figure, returning a total of only 456.3m shares. This is well below what are generally agreed to be profitable levels from the point of view of the London-based securities industry. About 60 per cent of the day's trade was in non-Footsie stocks. The fall in market indices would have been greater but for sharp rise in shares in the regional electricity companies after East Midlands Electricity had announced a Pounds 186.5m special dividend payment to shareholders. Other electricity companies have returned cash to shareholders by way of share buy-backs but this policy has become frustrated by the strong share prices in the sector. The market now looks for other electricity companies to follow the East Midlands lead, although there were signs yesterday of political objections. Although the focus was on the dollar-orientated stocks, losses among these issues were not large. Wellcome was a weak spot but this was ascribed to negative comments from a US investment bank known to be bearish on the stock rather than to currency factors. Other pharmaceutical issues also gave ground, but Glaxo managed to hold steady in spite of currency influences. Currency nerves benefited stocks seen as domestically-focused and therefore likely to attract investors seeking to avoid dollar risk. Some store and retail issues gained ground, although buyers were very selective and backed away when the market turned sour. The uncertainty in the London stock market is likely to focus on the next round of data on the US economy, due at the end of the week. On Friday, US gross domestic product statistics for the third quarter will be accompanied by the deflator figure which has been identified as a key factor in the inflation watch maintained by the US Federal Reserve Board. The economic schedule in the UK is quiet this week, and dealers doubt if the latest survey of industrial trends by the Confederation of British Industry will bring any strong response from the stock market.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Blazes whipped by hot, dry winds have destroyed nearly 20,000 acres of forest  and brushland in California, fire officials said. One of the worst of the  fires, an 11,700-acre blaze about 45 miles northeast of Fresno in the central  Sierra Nevada foothills, was nearly contained. The arson-caused fire destroyed  seven houses and forced about 2,500 people from their homes for a time. A  5,700-acre wildfire in the Cleveland National Forest continued to burn out of  control in a remote area of San Diego County. About 900 firefighters saved 13  homes and structures.  </P></p>

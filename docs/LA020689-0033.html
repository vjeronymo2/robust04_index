			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN TO PROBE CHARGES THAT WWII HERO ORDERED GERMAN PRISONERS SHOT  </P> <P> The Ministry of Defense said Sunday it will investigate allegations that  Britain's most decorated World War II hero ordered the machine-gunning of seven  German prisoners in 1942.  </P> <P> A spokesman said the charges have been leveled against retired Rear Adm.  Anthony Miers, who died three years ago.  </P> <P> Miers received a Victoria Cross -- Britain's highest decoration for valor --  three weeks after the officer, who was then a lieutenant, allegedly ordered the  crew of his submarine Torbay to shoot the Germans, who were cast adrift in a  dinghy after the British submarine sank a freighter off Crete.  </P> <P> Details of the alleged killings were first published in a recent book by  Ludovic Kennedy, who said they were ordered by a war hero but did not name him.  </P> <P> The Sunday Telegraph newspaper named Miers in its latest edition and Kennedy  confirmed it.  </P> <P> The newspaper said the killing of the seven prisoners was similar to war crimes  for which several German submarine commanders were tried and executed.  </P> <P> The bullet-ridden bodies were found by the Germans and may have led to brutal  treatment meted out to captured British commandos in the area afterward.  </P></p>

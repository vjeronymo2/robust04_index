			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Bankers cautious on Italian debt buy-back BANKERS have reacted with cautious interest to the Italian government's plan to use the proceeds from privatisation to buy back state debt. The aim would be to reduce what some prominent treasury economists call the 'black hole' of government debt. The cost of servicing debt accounts for most of the state's financing needs. A new fund would receive proceeds from all planned privatisation issues, excluding those where the receipts are destined to reduce the debts of heavily-borrowed state holding companies selling their subsidiaries. Proceeds from the disposals of Credito Italiano, the bank controlled by the Iri state holding company, and Nuovo Pignone, the engineering group owned by the public-sector Eni energy and chemicals concern, would not be put into the new fund. Receipts would be used to shore up the balance sheets of Iri and Eni. The fund will also receive cash from future dividend payments by Iri, Eni, Enel and Ina, the four public sector concerns recently transformed into joint stock companies. Bankers are now keen to know what bonds would be withdrawn via the new fund, and whether paper would be bought at market or nominal prices. Italy issues a wide range of debt, varying from fixed-rate three-month treasury bills to 10-year bonds and shorter-maturity floating-rate issues. Current market rates are often well below nominal prices.</p>

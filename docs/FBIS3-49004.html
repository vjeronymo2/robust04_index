			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dimitur Vasilev: "Movement for Rights and </F> Freedoms Is Preparing To Form an Association of Municipalities  To Act as a State Within the State"]    [Text] At the end of November the DPS [Movement for Rights  and Freedoms] held its second national conference, which adopted  the DPS program and decisions on its future activities. In  fulfillment of the latter, in December the DPS initiated  meetings in certain municipalities to discuss and adopt a  "Charter for an Association of Municipalities." DPS municipal  councillors had taken the trouble to draft a document called a  charter for establishing a new administrative-state organization  not prescribed under national legislation. At this point it  must be stated that the association dreamt up by the DPS is  illegitimate. The National Assembly is the only body with the  powers to constitute and create new state bodies not covered by  the Constitution and the law of the land.    The aims and tasks of the association as recorded in its  charter emphasize its supramunicipal character. It is to be an  body of government that can impose a dictate over its member  municipalities in deciding specific issues, albeit with the  "consent" of the mayor of the municipality in question. It is  no accident that the charter includes this phrase -- with the  consent of the mayor, because the purpose of this is to make it  easier for the association to impose its dictate in practice,  for the mayors exercise the power of the state, not only  representing the municipalities, but also governing them. On  the other hand, not every mayor in the territory covered by the  association can be a DPS member. For this reason, the  association's leadership will not be able to wield its dictate  in every municipality. Furthermore, all the DPS mayors are  functionaries of the local DPS leaderships and are subject to  their will. They are obliged to fulfill the DPS program.  Evidently, the association's leadership will consist solely of  DPS representatives. In the last elections, 27 municipal mayors,  653 village mayors, and 24 National Assembly deputies were  elected from the DPS list. According to the decisions of the DPS  national conference, they are all DPS functionaries and must  obey its orders.    Under the charter, the association's member municipalities  can preserve their economic, political, and juridical  independence, but how will they retain it when, according to the  same charter, the association may set them tasks, supervise  them, adopt decisions to be carried out by the municipalities,  and call them to account. Although they have joined the  association "voluntarily," the municipalities are placed under  its leadership. Accordingly, the association becomes an body of  the DPS and is anticonstitutional in nature. It will comprise  not one, but several associations, established on  administrative-territorial and ethnic principles. Accordingly,  the associations form an intermediate link in the state  structure. They are tending to replace the regional and  district municipal councils as specified in the Local  Self-Government Act that have not been created so far and are  unlikely to appear in the future. The DPS has decided to fill  this gap by forming these associations. They are being created  in regions with a Turkish- speaking population and are  differentiated on an ethnic basis. The Constitution does not  permit such autonomous territorial formations (under Article 2,  Paragraph 1).    According to the charter, the leadership of the association  consists of one representative for each municipality -- its  mayor, who has only one vote in the adoption of decisions, which  are passed by an absolute majority, that is, by half the number  of members present plus one. The charter does not state the  number of members in the association's collective leadership,  its minimum or maximum membership, or where its headquarters  will be located, nor does it in any way resolve the not  unimportant issue of how the association will be financed.    The charter, despite its legal imperfections, is of great  political importance because of the ethnic aims that it pursues.  For this reason, prominence must be given to the ethnic goals  that the DPS aims to achieve through the association. The DPS  is trying to use it as a form of intermunicipal unification so  as to provide qualified assistance to the DPS mayors in their  administrative work. Accordingly, it may help them to stick more  closely together, exercise more effective control over them, and  help to resolve more efficiently the problems addressed in the  DPS program.    The DPS wants to create an independent administrative and  territorial unit that is protected from external influence.  Here one can perceive the idea that Ahmed Dogan put forward at  the DPS national conference, namely that no one should be able  to exercise his dictate in the territory covered by the  association -- not parliament, the president, the government, or  anyone else. In this way, the DPS provides itself with a  terrain for acting and holding sway, undisturbed by anyone, over  the territory of the sovereign Bulgarian state, and for  manipulating and deciding everything that arises from its  program. This is already a basis for ethnic differentiation and  for developing political, cultural, and economic autonomy.  Thus, the association becomes "a state within the state," in  complete contravention of the Constitution and the laws. By  creating the association on this basis, the DPS can direct it  and link it more closely with our southern neighbor, which in  recent years has been displaying and following a purposeful and  well- planned policy in many ways in the regions of Bulgaria  with a Turkish-speaking population. This already represents a  threat to the national security and sovereignty of the state of  Bulgaria.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Reliance in the race for Indian diamond contract Reliance Industries, the Indian petrochemicals and textiles conglomerate, yesterday said it was one of five contenders chosen by the Indian government to explore and develop potential diamond mines in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional diamond mining area. De Beers, the international diamond group, was among the bidders which made presentations to the state government last week. The contract is likely to be awarded later this month, and the successful bidder is expected to spend Rs1.5bn (USDollars 48m) on the exploration and development of diamond deposits. Reliance, India's largest private sector company, has also bid for a facility to produce methane gas from coal in Mehsana district, in Gujarat state. The company will spend Rs150m for the initial exploration required, if its bid is successful. The Indian government recently liberalised the country's coal, gold and other mining industries. They were formerly under the tight control of the government. Reliance's forays into mining follow its successful bid earlier this year to develop three medium-sized oil and gas fields off India's west coast together with Enron, the US power company. Reliance's 9m tonne crude petroleum refinery is being set up in nearby Jamnagar at a cost of Rs51.42bn, which was raised through an ambitious public issue last year. Reliance also hopes to enter the recently liberalised Indian telecommunications industry. The company has proposed to the government that it will build and operate a nationwide telecommunications network, providing 10m new telephone lines in the next decade, rural telecoms services and public call offices. The government is still in the process of finalising its telecoms policy. Reliance yesterday declared its audited results for the year ended March 31 1994, saying it had established a record total income of Rs54.61bn. The company reported a net profit of Rs5.75bn on sales of Rs53.45bn, compared with last year's profit of Rs3.22bn on sales of Rs41.06bn. A spokesman for the company said Reliance was now 'India's largest corporation in terms of sales, operating profit, cash profit, net profit, net worth and assets'. The company's directors have recommended a dividend of 51 per cent for the year, constituting a dividend payout of Rs1.39bn. The dividend, the largest in the private sector, will be shared by the company's 2.4m shareholders in India and abroad.</p>

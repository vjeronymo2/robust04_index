			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DEFENSE STOCKS FALL IN LONDON  </P> <P> Stocks of defense-related industries plunged on the London International stock  exchange today in response to the British government's announcement it will  slash an estimated $1.03 billion from the military budget.  </P> <P> Defense Procurement Minister Alan Clark said in Parliament late Monday that  inflation had placed extraordinary pressure on the military's running costs,  prompting that $1.03 billion be trimmed from the $36.25-billion defense budget.  </P> <P> The government also said the cuts were due to the easing of East-West  relations.  </P> <P> Hardest hit by the news was British Aerospace, which lost a $906-million order  for 33 Tornado fighter-bombers. British Aerospace stock tumbled 37 cents a  share to $8.60, but managed to stage a slow recovery around midday.  </P> <P> Setbacks were suffered by other companies linked to the manufacture of  Tornadoes, a nuclear-capable aircraft designed for attacking the Soviet Union.  Tornadoes are built in the northwestern English town of Warton in cooperation  with Italian and West German firms.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH, U.S. TV PRODUCERS FORGING ATLANTIC ALLIANCE  </P> <P> In their attempts to bolster ratings, American television officials are looking  to Britain with new fervor. Just last month, top CBS programming executives  Howard Stringer, Kim LeMasters and Barbara Corday were meeting with their BBC  counterparts here to discuss possible co-productions.  </P> <P> "We were talking to CBS in general terms," said Mark Shivas, head of drama and  TV serials for the BBC. "There's a long-standing relationship between us and  Howard Stringer (president of the CBS Broadcast Group) that goes back many  years."  </P> <P> At the moment, low-rated CBS may need the BBC more than the BBC needs CBS. But  the balance is beginning to shift. Rising costs have prompted British  broadcasters to look more favorably on accepting money and creative input from  abroad.  </P> <P> "We have no long-running series planned for which we need major co-production  money," Shivas says, "but I can see it in the future because of rising prices.  There are ways of doing series co-productions, and we will find them. First we  need a project we all like."  </P> <P> The British have sold series formats to the United States before -- including  the premises for "Three's Company," "All in the Family" and this season's "Dear  John" -- and the number of TV movie and miniseries co-production deals between  British and American broadcasters has vastly increased in the past few years.  </P> <P> Successful series co-ventures have proved elusive, however. Nevertheless, both  sides are now examining ways to collaborate on episodic programming. CBS, whose  executives declined to comment on the recent meetings with the BBC, has already  commissioned a pilot for an action-adventure series called "Outpost," a  co-production between Columbia Pictures TV and HTV, one of Britain's commercial  channels, to be shot in Britain.  </P> <P> American producers are also looking to Canada, Australia and France for  co-financing. Both ABC's "Mission: Impossible" and CBS' "Dolphin Cove" this  season were Paramount co-productions with Australia's Network Nine. And cable's  USA Network has two co-production series currently filming: "The Hitchhiker"  (with a French partner, Atlantique) and "The Ray Bradbury Theater" (with  England's Granada TV and France's Ellipse).  </P> <P> "The gap between the licensing fee provided by the network and the actual  production costs has widened over the years both here and in America,"  explained Sydney Perry, managing director of London Weekend Television  International, "so we all need to find partners to bridge that gap."  </P> <P> Satisfying two different cultures is not easy, however, as ABC discovered with  its recently canceled series "A Fine Romance." A co-production between  IndieProd/Phoenix/New World Television, London Weekend Television and France's  TF-1, the one-hour romantic comedy bombed opposite "The Cosby Show' and "A  Different World."  </P> <P> "If there were any problems with the show, they weren't because of the  co-production arrangement," said Ed Gradinger, president and chief executive  officer of New World TV Group which put up the lion's share of the financing  and retained creative control of the series.  </P> <P> "We had terrific partners, and they made very few demands. We sent them copies  of the scripts, and they didn't try to get in our way. They helped finance the  show, which made life easier. You have to admit the show had phenomenal  production values."  </P> <P> "A Fine Romance," about a divorced couple who co-host a TV travel show, starred  Margaret Whitton (American) and Christopher Cazenove (British).  </P> <P> What went wrong? Nick Elliott, controller of drama at London Weekend  Television, said: "At the end of the day, a lot of shows are just not good  enough. On this one, we never got right all the things you have to get right.  It didn't have a single strong writer-producer at the center. I don't think the  three partners caused the problem."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Elliott admitted, "The best way to make a series is to do it  yourself, without partners. With partners, there are endless phone calls. But  today, no TV company can afford to make all its major drama without a partner  of some kind."  </P> <P> "A Fine Romance" was London Weekend Television's second stab at a series  co-produced with an American partner. The first, the 1984 police series  "Dempsey and Makepeace," starring Michael Brandon and Glynis Barber, was  syndicated in the United States by Tribune Entertainment, which had a minority  stake in the show.  </P> <P> "There's no way you can consult daily with a minority partner," said Elliott,  who did not enjoy being in the minority position on "A Fine Romance."  </P> <P> London Weekend Television will be the majority partner in its next two  co-productions -- a series of "The Saint" movies (with D.L. Taffner) and a  series of movies based on stories written by Frederick Forsyth (with Blair  Entertainment/USA Network).  </P> <P> "I'll get involved with a co-production series if the deal looks good and the  show looks good," Elliott said. "It's very, very hard to do a co-production  series. The differences between two countries are harder to satisfy on a  long-term basis."  </P> <P> New World's Gradinger has the same concerns. Co-productions, he cautions,  cannot be "thewave of the future", but they can be "a way to do certain shows  that can fit within the requirements of some of our sister countries."  </P> <P> "We'll pay particular attention to co-productions when the product is  suitable," he said, "You can't take an all-American show like 'Hunter' and make  it into a co-production."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> FIRST-GRADER SNAGS $2,000 SCHOLARSHIP  </P> <P> Somer Flaherty was born more than 100 years after Nellie Bly, one of  journalism's most notable female pioneers. But 7-year-old Somer, who will be  awarded a college scholarship by her local girls club later this month, is  determined to follow in Bly's footsteps.  </P> <P> "I would like to be a news reporter," the first-grader wrote on the application  for a $2,000 award. "I tell everyone everything, and my nickname at home is  roving reporter."  </P> <P> Flaherty was chosen from more than 50 applicants for the first annual "She  Knows Where She's Going" scholarship, offered by the Newport Mesa Girls Club.  The money will be placed in a trust and made available to Somer in the year  2000, when she graduates from high school, said Susan Kline, a spokeswoman for  the selection committee.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Somer says, she will practice for the job.  </P> <P> "All the time, my mom says why don't you go and write stuff down while you're  waiting," Somer said. "I write stories about animals and insects, butterflys  and spiders."  </P> <P> Along with making up stories, she also covers the news of the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "One time I wrote about my mom, when she took my next-door neighbor's cat to  the vet because it got hit by a car, but it didn't die," Somer said. The  neighbor, she said, enjoyed the story.  </P> <P> "She said, 'Oh, this is such a good story, I have to keep it,' " Somer said.  </P> <P> Judges considered four elements when reviewing the anonymous applications,  Kline said. They looked at the youngster's maturity, academic achievements,  extracurricular activities and the family's financial needs.  </P> <P> Recommendations were solicited from second-grade teachers at every public and  private school in the area, Kline said, and were also available to parents  through the Girls Club. On the application, the children were asked to write  essays or draw pictures and file letters from teachers and family friends  giving information about the child. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

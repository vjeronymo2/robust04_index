			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] Claims that Britain agreed to the NATO ultimatum to  Serb forces besieging Sarajevo only after being "leaned on" by  the United States were fiercely denied by 10 Downing Street  tonight.    The allegation is that President Clinton warned the Prime  Minister in a 30-minute telephone call on Wednesday [9 February]  that if Britain blocked the strategy, the United States  commitment to NATO might be seriously undermined.    But senior officials denied that anything of this sort  occurred during that phone call or elsewhere. The conversation  was "entirely one on good terms."    In fact, Britain was happy to go along with this policy.    Even so, there remain fears among some Tory MPs that Britain  and the West are in danger of becoming embroiled in a civil war  by adopting a policy which could prolong the conflict, they  fear, rather than curtail it.    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has said that Britain  approached this policy with great caution. But he insists he is  convinced that it will produce more good than harm.</p>

			<p>Inspection   <F P=102>   SK2503025494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0244 GMT 25 Mar 94 </F> <F P=103> SK2503025494 </F> <F P=104>  Seoul YONHAP </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] United Nations, March 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea  refused to let the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  fully check its seven declared nuclear sites during March 3-14  inspections, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix told the U.N.  Security Council on Thursday.    In a press conference after his report to the Security  Council, Blix said that North Korea is capable of producing  plutonium needed to manufacture atomic bombs and that the  Stalinist country may have more plutonium than it has admitted.    As North Korea refused to allow IAEA experts to examine a  radiochemical laboratory, one of seven declared nuclear  facilities, the IAEA cannot verify the laboratory has not  produced plutonium since February 1993 when it was last  inspected.    To determine whether the laboratory has produced plutonium,  sampling and gamma-ray tests are necessary, he added.    Blix said he does not know whether North Korea has the  capability to produce nuclear weapons, but the IAEA has  concluded that Pyongyang diverted plutonium from spent nuclear  fuel on several occasions as a result of its inspections. This  means the North Koreans have secured far more plutonium than  they admitted in the gram unit.</p>

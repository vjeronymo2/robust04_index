			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Iraq fears send oil to 5-year lows THE OIL market ended a nervous week with a tentative recovery from fresh five-year lows reached early yesterday. As with other recent setbacks, the morning selling that pushed the February futures price to Dollars 13.85 a barrel at one point was linked to concern about the prospect of Iraq returning to the market sooner rather than later. In late trading, however, the price had moved up to Dollars 14.07 a barrel, down 9 cents on the day and 68 cents on the week. Last week's downward reaction to the failure of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries's ministerial meeting to agree on production cuts continued on Monday, pushing the February futures price down another 35 cents to Dollars 14.40 a barrel. Tuesday saw prices staging a modest recovery for most of the day, but that was reversed in late trading after Iraq announced that it might negotiate with the United Nations about a one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil to finance humanitarian aid and compensation to victims of the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It had earlier rejected this idea, seeking instead a permanent easing of UN export sanctions. Prices steadied on Wednesday but moved sharply lower again on Thursday as the fears about Iraqi sales adding to the present oversupply returned to the fore. At the London Metal Exchange copper led a general rise in base metals prices. Having broken through technical resistance on Thursday the three months copper price climbed to Dollars 1,688.50 a tonne before backtracking to Dollars 1,679.75 at yesterday's close, up Dollars 24.25 on the week. Aluminium prices took a prominent part in the rally until they succumbed yesterday to disappointed selling following the overnight announcement that no specific production cuts had been agreed at inter-government talks in Washington. At the two-day meeting US, Russian, Australian, Canadian, Norwegian and European Union officials had discussed ways of easing the severe oversupply that has been driving aluminium prices lower since the collapse of the Soviet Union released a flood of metal from the former Eastern bloc (chiefly Russia). There had never been much hope of substantial progress being made at this stage, but news that the delegates had succeeded only in identifying objectives and had deferred consideration of practicalities to follow-up talks scheduled for January 18-19 nevertheless prompted a sharpish market sell-off. By yesterday's close the LME three months delivery price, which climbed as high as Dollars 1,088 a tonne on Thursday, was quoted at Dollars 1,075.75 a tonne, down Dollars 9 on the day but still Dollars 17.25 up on the week. Lead was once again the strongest LME market, with prices maintaining the strong upward trend that began late last week. The three months price closed yesterday at Dollars 446.50 a tonne, up Dollars 18 on balance but Dollars 2.50 below the seven-month high reached on Thursday. Dealers attributed the market's strength to increased demand from car battery makers and tightness of supplies of lead concentrate (an intermediate material). The London Commodity Exchange cocoa market struggled to build on recent gains as fresh harvest news was awaited from west African growing regions. The March futures position edged up to a 5 3/4 -year high of Pounds 1,064 a tonne yesterday afternoon and ended Pounds 8 up on the week at Pounds 1,061 a tonne.  ---------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------- Aluminium         +3,900 to 2,395,450 Aluminium alloy     -140 to    49,060 Copper            +1,925 to   592, 425 Lead                -675 to   298,075 Nickel              +960 to   119,904 Zinc              +6,050 to   870,575 Tin                 +130 to    19,125  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Swan Hunter fightback launched A CAMPAIGN to save the Swan Hunter shipyard was launched yesterday amid fears that the government's proposed enterprise zone for Tyneside could be conditional on an end to shipbuilding on the river. Labour MP Mr Steve Byers, in whose Wallsend constituency Swan Hunter is based, said there was growing concern that the European Commission might impose similar conditions on a Tyneside enterprise zone as on Sunderland in 1989. Under the EC deal - part of a Pounds 45m rescue package to cushion the blow of closure of the River Wear's last two shipyards - resumption of shipbuilding was barred on the sites for at least five years. One of the sites, at Southwick, has since been cleared for new industrial development. An enterprise zone was part of the Tyneside aid package proposed last Wednesday by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, if there are substantial job losses at Swan Hunter. He said the zone would have to be agreed by the EC. Swan Hunter, the last shipbuilder on the Tyne, last week failed to win a helicopter carrier order from the MoD and went into receivership on Thursday. The 'Life for Swans' campaign, which involves local authorities, trade unions, MPs and MEPs, will also press the government to seek EC intervention funding for the company. That would give Swan Hunter a 9 per cent subsidy on merchant shipbuilding work. When the company was privatised in a management buyout in 1986, it was sold as a warship yard, debarring it from Intervention Funding. This hindered its attempts to diversify out of warship building. Talks between receivers Price Waterhouse and the MoD continued all day yesterday over whether outfitting of three Type 23 frigates can continue at Swans. The work offers the company's best hope of finding a buyer. Last night, sources said the MoD had said work could continue on the frigates at Swans until May 28, but it is understood agreement was not reached on when payment would be made. Mr Byers said: 'The conduct of the Ministry of Defence in their dealings with the receivers has been nothing short of scandalous. The MoD should stop playing cat-and-mouse with the livelihoods of the thousands of workers.'</p>

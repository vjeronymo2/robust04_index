			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Many-sided chip wrangle sizzles in Belgian court THE STAKES are getting higher and the chips are down in Belgium's long-sizzling legal wrangle over who invented the six-sided pomme frite. While the rest of the world may be preoccupied with a different kind of chip  -the semiconductor - Belgian attention is focused on a technologically advanced way to produce pommes frites - crisp, golden spears of potato accompanied by dollops of mayonnaise and almost everything else. So it was almost inevitable that this dispute about the cutting edge of frite technology should take place in Belgium. Inevitable, too, for a country struggling with linguistic divisions, that it should be a French-speaking Walloon and a Dutch-speaking Fleming who would grill each other in court over the true origin of the hexagonal frite. The only thing the two men agree on is the superiority of the six-sided frite over the traditional rectangular shape. The new version absorbs up to 20 per cent less grease and cooks more evenly and quickly because its edges are smoother. Such advantages are to be weighed seriously in a country where 10,000 friteries serve 1,000 tonnes of chips a day. Aviko, a subsidiary of Gebeco, the Dutch food co-operative, said yesterday that sales of its Pommes Sixtettes brand were booming in Belgium, thanks in part to the publicity of the court case brought by Mr Guiseppe Bonsignore, a Walloon of Italian origin, against Mr Robert Stroobandt of Flanders for frite patent infringement. Aviko bought its licence to make six-sided frites from Mr Stroobandt. Yesterday, Mr Bonsignore countered by saying that the more polygonal frites Aviko sold in Belgium, the greater the damages he would be seeking. When he started his lawsuit in 1990 he sued Mr Stroobandt and Aviko together for BFr11m (Pounds 183,000). But the wheels of Belgian justice grind slowly and the Liege commercial tribunal is not expected to reach a judgment for some months. Meanwhile, Mr Bonsignore has licensed his frite-cutting grille to two Belgian companies, and touted it to McCain of Canada, the biggest supplier of frozen chips in Europe. But Mr Lucien Decraeye, head of Belgium's national union of frituriers, or friers, has doubts about whether his customers will take to the novelty of a six-sided frite. 'We Belgians are very traditional when it comes to our frites'. Gastronomically, everyone agrees, the ideal frite would be completely round. Creating industrial machinery to cut potatoes into cylinders would be very hard, according to experts. However, even this last frite frontier is probably not safe from ingenious Belgians - and their lawyers.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Japanese banks halt lending to troubled property group FIVE leading Japanese banks yesterday said they would halt lending to EIE International, a property developer weighed down by Y700bn (Pounds 4.3bn) in debts. Japanese banks have traditionally been reluctant to cut their lifelines to debt-stricken corporate customers. But the EIE case could mark a tougher approach, as the banks write off a pile of non-performing property loans. EIE owns hotel resorts and office buildings in the UK, the US, Australia and south-east Asia. Its break with the banks came after a dispute with the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which has Y190bn in loans outstanding to the company, about half defined as 'bad'. LTCB said any loan losses would be covered through the sale of its long-term holdings of shares. The bank said the decision to confront the bad debts was taken in the interests of 'financial soundness'. The removal of LTCB's support sends a clear signal to other banks that it will no longer be responsible for EIE debts and raises questions about how the EIE group will service its debts. Trading in two affiliates of the unlisted EIE International was suspended yesterday. Sea-Com, a shipping and resort company, is listed on the second section of the Tokyo exchange while Electronic and Industrial Enterprises, an electronics supplier, is traded on the over-the-counter market. Mr Harunori Takahashi, president of EIE reassured staff that the company would continue trading. LTCB said it would not immediately cut links to the two listed affiliates. EIE group and its bankers, LTCB, Mitsui Trust and Banking, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, Sumitomo Trust and Banking and Nippon Credit Bank, have been renegotiating a restructuring package. The banks say the developer was unwilling to accept terms, which included a quickening of property disposals. The extent of the break with LTCB can be gauged by the fact that the bank has recalled five managers sent in to underpin the property developer. LTCB said the worsening of the international property market and the appreciation of the yen, which cut the value of foreign holdings, had undermined the chances of a successful bank-sponsored restructuring.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Correspondent report by Vladimir Jovanovic: "Serbian </F> Military Industry; Belgrade's Bold Plans"]    [Text] Belgrade, 28 Dec -- It is well known that after the  disintegration of Yugoslavia most weapons and military equipment  remained in Serbian hands. Furthermore, Belgrade is constantly  at work on refining its plans for the further militarization of  the country.    The embargo against Serbia on the import of weapons and on  the acquisition of new weapons and military technology most  certainly will contribute nothing toward lessening of tensions  in the Balkans.    The interest of the Serbian political leadership in the  defense industry increased after the partial withdrawal of the  army from Bosnia in June 1992. The bulk of the former  Yugoslavia's arms industry was concentrated in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Belgrade succeeded in relocating parts of  this industry across the Drina River, including some plants from  central Bosnia and important divisions of the "Sokol" aircraft  manufacturing firm from Mostar. However, it failed to gain  control over key defense industry capacities in Bosnia,  including plants such as the infantry ammunition factory in  Konjic, the explosives factory in Vitez, the military equipment  factory in Bugojno, and some other defense plants in Tuzla,  Zenica, and Gorazde.    As a result, Serbia faces mounting problems with the  production of infantry ammunition. It turned out that  manufacturing ammunition at the Titovo Uzice plant is too  costly. They solved this problem by resorting to foreign trade  operations run through the affiliated company "Jugoimport" from  Belgrade. This trade is flourishing despite the embargo. Working  through Jugoimport, Serbia is exporting M-84A tanks, missiles,  guns, 6O to 12O-mm mortar shells, flamethrowers, air defense and  anti-armor guns, various types of all-terrain vehicles,  communication systems, electronic systems for G-4M Super Galeb  aircraft, and so forth. In exchange, Serbia receives from Greece  ammunition made by manufacturers in Western Europe, according to  the Montenegrin weekly MONITOR.    Meanwhile, Belgrade continues to work on improving its  1,000-km range missiles. The Yugoslav Army's highest ranking  officers concluded several agreements regarding "defense"  strategy at a secret meeting in Belgrade on 9 June, however,  they focused most of their attention on the improvement of  long-range missiles.    Zivota Panic, the Serbian chief of General Staff, visited  Iraq in March and is said to have visited Russia before that.  During these trips, a group of his associates probably drafted  and finalized plans for the transfer of technology and know-how  to improve the range of the Serbian missile systems, which are  quite similar to the Russian and Iraqi missile systems.    Vojislav Seselj, a chetnik leader, who was apparently very  familiar with these dealings, made public statements in Europe  and, in particular, threatened Croatia and Slovenia with  long-range missiles. He might have received the data on the new  missile systems, which they are still working on feverishly to  improve, from the then chief of the Counterintelligence Service  who was later replaced because of his contacts with the  Chetniks.    Military analysts in Belgrade think that the Serbian army  does not yet have such long-range missiles, which does not mean  that it will not have them shortly. There could be problems  manufacturing special types of propellant. These problems,  however, are not at all unsurmontable.    It is certainly not possible to interpret the improvement of  missile capabilities as an effort to establish peaceful  relations. There is also ever increasing talk that the institute  in Vinca is working on the "cold fusion" process, which would be  used to fit the 1,000-km range missiles with nuclear warheads.  All these activities are causing quite a stir among observers in  Belgrade. Various rumors are spreading -- whether substantiated  or not -- asbout imports of "cold fusion" technology. We have  learned that Genadij Sikin, Russian ambassador to Belgrade,  visited FRY President Zoran Lilic on 9 December. Brief press  agency releases reported that they talked about illicit nuclear  materials trade in East Europe.    Then in the middle of December, the Belgrade Sava center  hosted a symposium titled "Aviation 93." The ongoing development  of a Yugoslav supersonic aircraft (NA) was the topic of one  unofficial session. This project began in the early 1980's.    In June of last year, the Serbian political leadership,  working through the then Air Force commander Bozidar Stevanovic,  began the process of acquiring legal title to the  Aviation-Engineering Institute in Zarkovo near Belgrade. This  institute has various capacities, including wind tunnels to  carry out various experiments, e.g., to reach a velocity of Mach  five. It is also capable of manufacturing supersonic jets.    It is not yet known whether Milosevic has secured an export  market for these planes. This would be the only way to make this  project economically feasible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial today, PELITA discusses the  revocation of the publication permits for three weekly  publications, namely, TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK. The daily says  our rational thinking can accept the explanation given by  Subrata, director general of press development and graphics, who  spoke on behalf of the government yesterday. In this  connection, PELITA wonders what the Indonesian press should do  next in the current second long-term development plan. The  answer is we should take the incident as a lesson as human  beings who believe in the almighty God. We should increase our  sense of national responsibility as loyal citizens of this  republic who respect the laws, Constitution, and democracy based  on the Pancasila ideology and the 1945 Constituency. In this  case, the Indonesian press, which has a positive role in  maximizing and distributing the benefits of development, should  be able to consolidate national unity and integrity to enhance  the quality of democracy.    REPUBLIKA wonders why the unwanted incident, even as  Information Minister Harmoko earlier issued several warnings,  should have inevitably taken place. The Indonesian press is now  enjoying an atmosphere of openness praised by many people inside  and outside the country.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL;  </P> <P> LUNGREN ACCUSED OF DOING ABOUT-FACE ON ABORTION  </P> <P> Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith on Thursday accused  Republican opponent Dan Lungren of flip-flopping on the abortion rights issue  in order to boost his chances in the November election.  </P> <P> "He has changed his views on abortion to save the life of his political career  and onlyfor that reason," said Smith, an abortion rights advocate, during a  press conference in the lobby of the downtown Million Dollar Theatre.  </P> <P> In a joint radio appearance this month, Lungren, a staunch abortion opponent,  said that, because of society's lack of support for crime victims, he would  support the right to abortion in cases of rape, incest or threat to the  mother's life. While in Congress in 1987, Smith pointed out, Lungren  co-sponsored a proposed "right to life" constitutional amendment that would  have banned abortions, except in cases in which the mother's life was  threatened.  </P> <P> In reaction, Lungren's camp issued a two-page statement blasting Smith for  ducking a joint radio talk show appearance in Los Angeles on Wednesday.  Lungren's statement made no mention of the abortion issue.  </P> <P> When asked for further clarification, Lungren press spokesman Dave Puglia said  that, as acongressman, Lungren voted consistently against public financing of  abortions. Puglia said that the recent radio statement was nothing new, since  Lungren has supported abortion in cases of rape or incest during Congressional  floor debates.  </P> <P> When asked how that squared with Lungren's co-sponsorship of the constitutional  amendment, campaign manager Brian Lungren said, "Lungren's record is clear on  the issue of abortion. There has never been any change. We have answered the  question."  </P> <P> Janet Carroll, legislative director for the California Pro-Life Council, said  Thursday that her organization has no problems with Lungren's stance. The  council, she said, occasionally supports legislation that restricts abortions  except in cases of rape, incest or threat to the mother's life. "We support  what it is politically possible to get. . . . If you're out to save lives, you  save as many as you could save. We have no doubts or qualms about Dan Lungren."  </P> <P> Lungren has repeatedly sought to downplay the abortion issue, saying it takes  up only a minuscule portion of the attorney general's time. Smith has countered  that it could become a major issue at the state level if the U.S. Supreme Court  eventually dilutes abortion rights.  </P> <P> At his press conference, Smith stood beside a makeshift marquee that his  campaign aides had altered to read, "The Two Dans."  </P> <P> "It stars Dan Lungren, the quick-change artist," Smith said.  </P> <P> " . . . The protagonist in this story has suddenly changed his view."  </P> <P> Also speaking was California Abortion Rights Action League board member Joanie  Parker, who said: "To trust Dan Lungren on abortion rights is like believing  Saddam Hussein is spreading democracy through the Middle East."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Lungren campaign Thursday released the results of a poll  conducted for Lungren between Aug. 2 and Aug. 9. Statewide, Lungren led Smith  38% to 35%, with the poll having a three-point margin of error.  </P></p>

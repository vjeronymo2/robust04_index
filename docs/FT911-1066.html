			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / IBM slashes prices to revive sales: Workstation makers likely to enter price war to compete with cuts of up to 60 per cent INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer company, yesterday slashed the prices of its computer workstations by up to 60 per cent, a move that is expected to spark a price war throughout the computer industry. The cost of computer power in all segments of the market is falling. Leading personal computer manufacturers have already announced sweeping price cuts on their desktop and portable machines while minicomputers and mainframes are selling at steep discounts from official list prices. IBM's workstation price cuts are expected to prompt similar reductions by its main rivals, Digital Equipment and Sun Microsystems, said industry analysts. The IBM price cuts, which range from 12 per cent to 60 per cent, follow the introduction in March of an aggressively priced series of high performance workstations by Hewlett-Packard. IBM also said it was determined to be a 'price performance leader' in workstations, one of the fastest growing segments of the computer market. The company acknowledged in March that its workstation sales had been hurt by the recession. The company cut the price of one of its highest performance models, the RISC System-6000 550 from Dollars 130,000 (Pounds 76,900) to Dollars 52,500. This computer, introduced just six months ago, was originally sold as a 'mini-supercomputer' but IBM is now repositioning it as a technical workstation. IBM said it was able to reduce the prices of workstations because it had achieved higher than expected production yields on microprocessor chips, the devices that form the 'brains' of a computer. The advent of very high performance microprocessors, such as the reduced instruction set computing (RISC) devices used in IBM's workstations, 'has turned hardware computer economics upside down', said Mr Steven Milunovich of Salomon Brothers. The impact of these semiconductor devices on the cost of computer power would not stop at desktop systems, he predicted. 'Multiprocessor systems will directly threaten mainframes and minicomputers,' he said. While computer users can look forward to lower prices and higher performance, manufacturers now face lower profit margins on hardware and many companies are now forced to emphasise the software and service segments of their business. Advances in semiconductor technology are also affecting the market for the very fastest 'supercomputers'. Convex Computer yesterday launched a series of computers based on gallium arsenide semiconductors, which offer higher performance than conventional silicon-based chips.

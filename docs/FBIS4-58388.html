			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi </F> Beilin by Mikha Friedman; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Friedman] Mr. Beilin, when  the process began, it was said that Gaza and Jericho First is an  experiment and that if it does not succeed, the situation is  reversible and it is possible to return to the status quo ante.  Is it correct to say that over the past few weeks, people have  stopped talking about the reversible nature of the agreement?    [Beilin] By its very nature, this is an interim and  reversible agreement. Naturally, we all hope it will not be  necessary to reverse it, because it is clear that even if this  is theoretically possible, it will be extremely difficult in  practice to come out and say now -- after all that has  transpired -- that we are revoking the agreement. I believe it  will be possible to do so only if extremely grave, intolerable  incidents occur. As is the case with any other agreement, our  working assumption is that both sides will abide by the  agreement. It is obvious -- even if not always explicitly  written down -- that if one side violates the agreement, the  other side is no longer bound by it. Any agreement of this  nature is reversible, but the sides always hope it will not be  necessary to revoke it.    [Friedman] What if the worst-case scenario happens? Will  the wd?nd we have enough leverage to do what we consider  necessary.    [Friedman] What is the difference between the situation that  will unfold in the territories as of noon tomorrow and between  future Palestinian sovereignty over all the territories?    [Beilin] The difference is in terms of foreign affairs and  defense. Just like most autonomies in the world, in this case,  too, there is independence, excluding the two key elements of  foreign affairs and defense. This is more or less what we gave  the Palestinians, which is the nature of autonomy.    [Friedman] Where will it lead eventually? Do you see an  inevitable historical process toward a Palestinian state?    [Beilin] I do not believe in historical determinism. I  completely reject the thesis that there is an inevitable process  leading to a state. A Palestinian state will be established  only if the Palestinians demand this and there is an Israeli  Government ready to accept this demand. So far, no Israeli  Government has accepted such a demand. If you want my opinion,  I believe that eventually a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation  will be established, because most of the sides involved prefer  this solution or are at least ready to accept such a solution.  This will be the common denominator among all the sides.    [Friedman] Let me phrase the question differently: Would  you agree to be a member of a government that is ready to grant  the Palestinians an independent state?    [Beilin] Look, I must tell you that I do not consider a  Palestinian state -- which my party and the government of which  it is the main constituent opposes -- to be a national disaster.  At the same time, I have always preferred the confederation  model. If I had to choose between the two options, I would  always prefer the confederation solution.</p>

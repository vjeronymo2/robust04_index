			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Accountancy: How companies have painted themselves into a corner - FN Arfin looks at the state of annual reports and asks if there is a better way of getting value for money BETWEEN now and the late spring of 1994, millions of pounds will be spent on books nobody wants to write and hardly anyone really relishes reading. The annual report season is upon us. As August 31 year-enders put the finishing touches to their documents, December 31 year-enders begin to assign responsibilities and select suppliers for their annual reports. All over the corporate world, managers brace themselves for an unpopular and expensive chore. Why? The easy answer is that they have to. But no law, regulation or established industry standard requires the elaborate documents that will disappear into institutional libraries and line office rubbish bins for the next several months. The truth is, having enthusiastically adopted the colourful, American-style annual report in the 1980s, most companies have painted themselves into a corner. While recognising that, as they are now constituted, annual reports have limited use, managers believe they have little choice. When a company has produced glamorous annual reports for years, a U-turn to sobriety is unsettling for shareholders. Particularly as we appear to be emerging from prolonged recession, no company director wants to raise unwarranted questions and concerns. Very large sums are at stake in the production of annual reports. Companies with large share registers enjoy economies of scale, making an average cost difficult to determine - but between Pounds 4 and Pounds 5 each, including postage, is not uncommon. Medium sized companies, publishing more modest reports can easily spend Pounds 150,000 in total. A large share register and a management taste for expensive presentation can bring the bill to Pounds 250,000 or more. The privatised companies, with their massive share registers, have become adept at reducing unit cost - to as low as 10p a copy  -but their staggering postage bills make them substantial spenders. A few brave companies have opted out of the money trap. When the Companies Act was amended to allow a summary financial report in a short form annual report, British Airways stopped producing a recognisable annual report altogether. Instead, BA publishes an undecorated report and accounts for investment professionals, a user-friendly, semi-annual newspaper for private shareholders, an annual fact book for analysts and professionals and an annual corporate magazine. The company estimates this highly segmented approach saves it about Pounds 450,000 a year. In the US, McDonald's accompanied its most recent - and inexpensively produced - document with a videotape. The 16-minute programme set out the company's medium-term strategy. Although the concept may seem flashy and expensive to some, the cost of reproducing more than 300,000 short, lightweight tape cassettes probably compares favourably to the cost of publishing a similar number of glossy documents. As a way of exposing resistant professionals to the non-financial communications messages, the McDonald's approach is decidedly clever; who can resist at least a peek? Admittedly, few companies can follow the examples set by BA and McDonald's. The illustrated and designed annual report remains the most common approach. The design and public relations communities experienced some criticism during the recession for establishing this standard. Yet consultants, who sold the idea of reaching audiences with carefully framed messages carried by themed texts and illustrations, were not wholly wrong. The problem is that for most British companies, the audience remains too narrowly defined. British annual reports address the City and its mix of analysts, fund managers, bankers and journalists: a group resistant if not hostile to annual report embellishments. But anyone who reads a magazine or newspaper, watches a documentary or listens to factual radio programmes is bound to be influenced by subtle communications techniques to a degree. American companies have long addressed their annual reports to wider audiences. It is common to attribute the style of American annual reports to the higher proportion of private shareholders in the US, where institutions control about 50 per cent of equity as opposed to around 80 per cent in Britain. However, the better American reports recognise that shareholders, whether private or institutional, are not the only readers. They set out annually to deliver a persuasive case to any intelligent reader. And the financial community, despite its primary focus on the numbers, is interested more often than not. The review section of the typical British annual report is a sop for the poor private investors, who more than make up in numbers what they lack equity. Private investors are regularly under-estimated. They are seen as unsophisticated; happy with photo essays and fat captions. The illustrations may be beautiful, but texts range from pedestrian to indigestible. The level of useful information is virtually nil. What after all, does such typical annual report-speak as 'satisfactory sales', 'significant improvement', 'substantial reduction', or 'poised for recovery' really mean without sufficient context? One active private investor, with holdings in about 20 companies, says: 'The text gives you some idea about what kind of company it is. Not putting an effort in the front says something very negative about the business. If they can't be bothered to be imaginative about the front, one is safe to assume that they have a similar attitude to a lot of their business.' Corporate executives responsible for annual reports need to reconsider their view of private investors. ProShare, the organisation formed to represent the interests of private investors, publishes a bulletin that is full of letters about earnings per share, gearing, market capitalisation and similar topics from so-called unsophisticated private shareholders. The paradox is that most of the money wasted on annual reports is in addressing private investors in the wrong way. Yet corporations have travelled this route so long that eliminating design, illustration and photography is unthinkable. If annual reports are going to continue to be costly, perhaps the solution lies in making every pound work harder. This can only come about if corporate directors stop under-estimating the intelligence of the non-professional reader. To be effective, the quality of information content needs to be improved. As much attention ought to be devoted to text as visual content so that the two work more effectively together. Lively, information-rich content aimed at a reasonably well educated reader makes an annual report more useful. As long as the numbers add up, the investment community is not likely to be put off. Most analysts and fund managers seem to be fairly neutral about non-financial material. Despite their protestations, they are often subtly influenced by interesting, readable information. In 1992, the US company HJ Heinz reported on a large acquisition in the food service industry. One objective of the annual report was to direct the attention of the financial community to Heinz' substantial turnover in this sector. The details and ramifications of the acquisition were presented without illustrations. But the front of the book was devoted to a magazine-style essay on the company's behind the scenes activities. Every City analyst shown the report reacted to that essay. 'I never realised food service was such a big part of their business,' was a typical response. Heinz, in effect, steered the agenda for professional discussion while addressing a more general audience. Annual reports cost a lot of money - that is a fact. But given thought, they don't have to waste it. FN Arfin is the author of Annual Reports That Pay Their Way. Pounds 35. Published by Financial Times/Pitman.</p>

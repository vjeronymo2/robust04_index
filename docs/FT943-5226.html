			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: London Despite a busy week for economic statistics, the gilts market is likely to focus on Wednesday's monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. After hints that the Bank wants to see an interest rate rise over the next few months, speculation will arise over whether the two men will immediately move to push up rates from their current level of 5.25 per cent. Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, says most indicators have shown little sign of inflationary pressure since the two last met. The rate of narrow money growth is expected to slow, when announced on Monday; house prices are weak; and annual growth of average earnings has stayed at 3.75 per cent. Ms Peters thinks rates will be left unchanged. To help them decide on the strength of the recovery, industrial production and manufacturing output figures for July will be released on Tuesday. Analysts expect each of these to rise by 0.4 per cent month-on-month. Whatever the economic and interest rate news, gilts may find it difficult to make progress without the help of the international market. The yield spread to 10-year German bunds fell below 140 basis points on Friday, having been 180 points a few weeks ago.</p>

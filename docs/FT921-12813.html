			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): 'Do your homework and avoid tips' - Serious riches / The Review meets a father of three with a multinational lifestyle, who runs his portfolio in the same way that he runs his business: he enjoys it, but it's a serious job needing research STEVEN ALTNEU's CV lists 'stock market investing' as one of his hobbies. Look elsewhere on the document, and it is obvious that he has the experience to invest more effectively than most. He has worked for most of the American banks you have ever heard of - they include Chase Manhattan, Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter - and now, still aged only 45, he is a management consultant. His connections with the Wall Street stock market date back to his final years at high school, when he took vacation jobs helping to operate IBM machines. With such a wealth of inside knowledge, might he not be expected to operate like Gordon Gekko, the filmic corporate raider, buying and selling on 'tips' from men in the know? Not a bit of it. 'I don't act on tips. I used to be quite an active speculator, but I've learnt from my mistakes. Don't speculate unless you're prepared to make it a full-time job. Avoid hot tips, friends' tips, taxi-drivers' tips like the plague.' He mentions an early investment in Woodside Petroleum. As a banker at Chase Manhattan he was involved in a big syndicated loan with the company to finance a gas project in Australia. It was public knowledge that further developments were coming. 'I felt I really knew this company.' So he bought. Unfortunately, it soon turned out that the good news was already in the price. Then Woodside ran into delays. Exchange-rate fluctuations also worked against him. Eventually, he sold out at a loss. The lessons are revealing for all those more amateur investors who would try to take on the market armed with a few hunches about a company. 'It wasn't a company which I really understood from the point of view of the investor. I understood it from the point of view of lending, but I did not understand it as an equity risk rather than a debt risk.' Thus he belongs avidly to the 'homework' school of investment. He treats running his portfolio in the same way that he treats running his business. He enjoys it, but it is a serious job, requiring serious work. Reading whatever research he can lay his hands on is vital. He is also only happy to invest in markets or areas which he understands - hence a concentration on Wall Street. However, he is also a believer in globalisation, which explains why he is now learning about the European markets. The statistics slip easily off the tongue: 'In 1970, US equity markets accounted for 66 per cent of the total value of world markets. In 1990, the value of world stock markets had grown, but non-US markets represented 67 per cent of the value. I feel that trend will continue.' Fortunately, he is increasingly well qualified to carry out a global job. Mr Altneu was born and raised in New York, and he is still an American citizen. But his wife, Jane, is English (they met while studying together at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, where she was on a Fulbright scholarship), and the couple have two houses. One is in the leafy London suburbs, and the other faces the Manhattan skyline from the New Jersey shore. Now, their three children - Rachel, aged 12, Daniel, 10, and Emily, 5 - are all being educated at day-schools in London. Eventually, they have ambitions to go to university in the US. Mr Altneu's time at Chase (from 1972 to 1981) gave him a lot of time in London, which was the hub for the bank's operations outside America. The elaborate Persian rugs which decorate his home bear witness to the frequent visits he made to Iran. At Dean Witter, he was responsible for one of the first big financing deals made with a Communist bloc country - a risk-conversion floater with the Foreign Trade Bank of Hungary. The problem with the Dean Witter job, as far as he was concerned, was that he worked in mergers and acquisitions. Staff who deal in this area are privy to so much market-sensitive information that, to avoid conflicts of interest, stocks and shares have to be held in 'blind trust'. Mr Altneu was very pleased with the broker who managed his portfolio for him at this time, Mahesh Kumar. When Mr Kumar moved to Lehman Brothers, Mr Altneu happily moved his portfolio with him. Lehman fits in readily with his own investing philosophy: 'My feeling is that they are a very good house and they offer some superb products. They will give you a considerable amount of information, and they go about their business very objectively and scientifically.' The multinational lifestyle does not make the more mundane items of personal finance, such as paying tax and contributing to pensions, any easier. The US continues to tax him, while UK authorities expect their share. Beyond careful taking of losses towards the end of years when gains have been realised - which helps to lessen the capital gains tax burden - there is not much he can do about it. Pension provision in the US is still a few years behind the UK, and his arrangements are unusual. Under American law as it stood in the 1970s, employees had to stay with a company for 10 years before they became 'vested' and earned the right to a company pension. He stayed at Chase Manhattan just long enough to qualify. Therefore, when he retires, he will receive what would in the UK be called a deferred pension. Reaganite reforms of the 1980s reduced the qualifying period to five years, and he stayed at Dean Witter long enough to qualify for another pension fund. This time when he left, he opted to receive a transfer value, and started an IRA, or Individual Retirement Account. This is broadly similar to a British self-administered pension scheme. The pension fund is administered on exactly the same terms as his general portfolio. As far as Mr Altneu is concerned, all investment is for the long term, and he sees no reason to be more conservative with his pension fund than he is with his other investments. Thus he keeps between 10 and 20 per cent of his portfolio in cash at all times. Bonds currently make up a heavier weighting than usual, but he still has 33 per cent in US equities. He will increase his equity holding over the next few months, in anticipation of a recovery. He may miss the bottom of the market, but that does not bother him greatly. 'Don't expect to buy at the bottom and sell at the top - leave something on top for the next guy if necessary.' All he wants is to ensure that he enters the market at a relatively sensible time, in the long term. All this should ensure that Steven Altneu, who is now considering making another career move and becoming a fully fledged investment manager, avoids some of the mistakes of his ancestors. His grandfather first came to America in 1904, as an immigrant. He set up an office-cleaning company in Manhattan. The business went well, and 10 years later, he was offered the chance to buy his premises, for Dollars 20,000. That was a lot of money at the time, and he turned it down. It might have been a good investment - that property, a seven-storey office block, was at 177, Broadway. Nowadays, the world headquarters of Merrill Lynch stands nearby. Steven currently seems to be taking the long view a little more successfully than his forebears.</p>

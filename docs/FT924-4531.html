			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Age of labour shortage ends for Japanese JAPAN is suffering from an excess supply of labour for the first time for almost five years, according to government figures published yesterday. These suggest the official unemployment rate will soon rise if the economic downturn continues. The ratio of job offers to job seekers fell to 0.96 last month from 1.01 in September, which means that for every 100 job seekers there are only 96 job offers. This is the ratio's lowest level since April 1988 when the Japanese economy was recovering from the downturn provoked by the rapid appreciation of the yen in the mid-1980s. The ratio has fallen from a peak of 1.47 in March 1991. Although the official unemployment rate was unchanged at 2.2 per cent, the sharp decline in job offers suggests unemployment may begin to rise. Job offers in October were 18 per cent down on last year, mainly because offers of temporary and part-time work were 68.7 per cent lower. Manufacturing job offers were 28.9 per cent down on a year before, 6.8 per cent in finance and 12 per cent in the rest of the service sector. The gathering depression in the jobs market means that consumer spending will remain stagnant for several months yet. However, it seems increasingly unlikely that the government will stimulate the economy significantly through tax cuts or higher public spending in next year's budget. Only a determined political intervention from the ruling Liberal Democratic party is likely to overturn the Finance Ministry's opposition to tax cuts in the light of the continuing steep fall in tax revenues. Finance Ministry officials disclosed that public revenues for 1993 will be about Y71,700bn (Pounds 381bn), with tax revenues Y1,200bn down on the initial budget for 1992. Expenditure is likely to be Y74,800bn. The officials said the revenue shortfall may require modest increases in taxes on alcohol and tobacco as the ministry is opposed to increased borrowing to fund the shortfall. Vehicle sales in Japan last month were 12.3 per cent down on November 1991 at 434,100. Sales of large trucks, which were 28 per cent down at 9,224 and large cars which were 20.8 per cent down at 61,331 were particularly badly hit. Mazda and Nissan lost market share to Toyota, Mitsubishi Motors and Honda.</p>

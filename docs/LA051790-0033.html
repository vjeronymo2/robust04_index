			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE COULDN'T EAT WORDS, SO THIS WAS NEXT BEST  </P> <P> Times columnist Mike Downey will be eating tortillas for the rest of his life  if fans of the Phoenix Suns have their way. Wednesday, after the Suns beat the  Lakers to win their Western Conference semifinal series, Downey received a box  of 300 tortillas from Beth McDonald and Perry Damone, morning hosts of Phoenix  radio station KEZ.  </P> <P> The accompanying letter stated, in part: "Please accept this gift as a token of  our appreciation. The newspaper article in which you predicted that the Suns  would 'fold like a tortilla' was just what we needed. . . . We're not sure what  you'll do with 300 tortillas. . . . Our listeners have suggested that perhaps  you could put them where 'the SUNS don't shine.' "  </P> <P> A moment of silence: Here's part of what Downey wrote May 9, after Phoenix beat  the Lakers in Game 1:  </P> <P> "Of the eight clubs remaining in the running for the NBA championship, seven  can win it. Phoenix can't. Sorry. Never happen. Phoerget it.  </P> <P> "So, don't sweat Tuesday night's 104-102 Laker loss at the Forum: These are the  playoffs. Phoenix will fold like a tortilla."  </P> <P> Just the fax: Downey said he has received at least 100 derogatory and somewhat  humorous faxes from Phoenix fans, and they are still coming. "I must have  refried beans for brains," he says.  </P> <P> Hot item: The St. Petersburg Times reported that while there is talk of housing  an NHL expansion team at the Florida Suncoast Dome, management at the Bayfront  Center can't even keep the ice frozen for an old-timers' tournament.  </P> <P> After the completion of four games, the ice had melted down to the cement in  several spots and was thin in the middle of the rink. One player injured his  knee when he slipped and fell. Needless to say, 24 scheduled games were  canceled.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Which was the last Western Conference team, besides the Lakers, to  win the NBA championship?  </P> <P> The Forbidden City: Beijing will be closed to people from the Chinese provinces  during the Asian Games in September. Officials say the measures are to avoid  traffic jams, but observers believe it is to prevent trouble from dissidents  after last spring's protests in the city.  </P> <P> Beijing vice mayor Zhang Baifa said passes will be issued to selected people  from the provinces to allow them to watch the games.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The Seattle SuperSonics, in 1978-79.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Dave Winfield, as he steered his car into the Yankee Stadium parking  lot Tuesday: "Welcome to the zoo."

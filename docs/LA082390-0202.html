			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH CHIEF ASKS FUND TRANSFUSION;  </P> <P> BUDGET: URAM WILL URGE SUPERVISORS TO USE UP TO $2.3 MILLION IN COUNTY MONEY TO  MAKE UP FOR STATE BUDGET CUTS.  </P> <P> Giving his first detailed public response to state budget cuts, Orange County  Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram said Wednesday that he is recommending  that supervisors use up to $2.3 million in county funds to restore cuts in  state funding for mental health and county clinics.  </P> <P> But Uram indicated that hospitals and doctors will probably have to absorb more  than $13 million in reduced state reimbursements to Indigent Medical Services,  a program that gives care to the county's 24,000 "working poor" who do not  qualify for Medi-Cal.  </P> <P> "Public safety is a higher priority than health -- that's the considered  opinion of the Board of Supervisors, the Legislature. That is the way they  think," Uram said in remarks to the United Way Health Care Task Force, a  coalition of leaders from community clinics, doctors, hospitals and nonprofit  agencies.  </P> <P> Uram said he believes that the county administrative office will recommend this  week that funds for mental and public health receive local "bailout" money when  the Board of Supervisors adopts a budget Aug. 29. The CAO's letter is expected  to be made public Friday.  </P> <P> "To avoid the trauma of layoffs, I think they're going to give me some money to  do this," he told the task force.  </P> <P> He added that if money is not restored to the state budget, cuts to mental  health and some other health services "might double" in January. He noted that  several bills have been introduced in Sacramento to restore health-care money,  including one by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach).  </P> <P> After their meeting with Uram, task force members said that any cuts to the  county's health budget are unacceptable, and several members argued that public  health is as much a safety issue as crime.  </P> <P> If Orange County residents "are really interested in public safety, they're  going to have a really bad safety problem if people are ill," Barbara Talento,  an associate professor of nursing at Cal State Fullerton, warned. "The measles  problem last year is the tip of the iceberg." The nationwide measles epidemic  killed two Orange County infants earlier this year.  </P> <P> County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider could not be reached for comment,  but Karen Davis, the office's administrative manager of finance, said Uram's  comments on the CAO's recommendation represented "a potential . . . nothing is  final."  </P> <P> She said the recommendations will be made today or Friday.  </P> <P> So far, Davis said, the Health Care Agency appears likely to take a  $13.6-million cut in indigent medical care, a $3.7-million cut in mental health  and an $800,000 cut in state monies that help fund public health operations.  </P> <P> In related action, leaders of the Hospital Council of Southern California have  mounted a major campaign to restore money to the Indigent Medical Services  program.  </P> <P> In an unusual "legislative alert" that was sent to 43 member hospitals Friday,  council vice president S. Russell Inglish asked members to "write or call your  county supervisors." Inglish urged that supervisors either vote to restore all  IMS cuts -- or to give IMS a share of any funds generated by new fees.  </P> <P> To resolve a projected $40-million county deficit, the board is considering  imposing new jail-booking fees or property tax fees. Supervisors voted  Wednesday to delay considering a jail-booking fee to cities, which officials  say could raise $2.1 million.  </P> <P> "Hospitals and the Orange County Medical Society view this issue (of IMS  funding) as a critical public safety matter," said John Cochran III, Orange  County area chairman for the council, which represents 43 hospitals here.  </P> <P> Noting that four hospitals in the North County have had to close their  emergency rooms in the last 16 months, Cochran, who is president of La Palma  Intercommunity Hospital, said IMS reimbursements to county hospitals and  doctors underwrite the hospital's already-strapped emergency care system.  </P></p>

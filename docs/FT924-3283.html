			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / EC leniency urged over new VAT rules EC TAX authorities should not punish companies which accidentally break complex new VAT rules in the first few months of 1993, a senior European Commission official said yesterday. Mr Peter Wilmott, who heads the Commission's indirect tax and customs directorate, has written to the 12 national administrations urging a lenient attitude towards companies that are slow to meet the requirements. In turn, Brussels is likely to be lenient with laggard member states. 'We expect member states to be understanding of traders' difficulties,' he said yesterday. 'That doesn't mean they should simply write off big tax debts, but they shouldn't be wheeling out the big guns to sanction people who didn't really understand what they were doing.' A transitional VAT regime comes into force on January 1, and is the key to lifting border controls on goods. But there are fears that the opening of the single market may be marred by a lack of understanding about the system. EC transport ministers adjourned talks yesterday until December 21 on the right of hauliers to ply for trade in other EC countries, Reuter reports from Brussels.</p>

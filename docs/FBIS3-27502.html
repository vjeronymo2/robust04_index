			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Ng, So Lai-fun, and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] The Legislative Council early this morning approved  the first part of Governor Chris Patten's proposals for  electoral reform, changing only the title of the bill but  fending off two attempts to block it. The final vote was taken  at 0120, at the end of more than nine hours of debate and a  marathon session of voting forced by the council's complicated  Standing Orders.    Councillors overwhelmingly approved, with only a few  dissenting voices, granting Hong Kong's 18-year-olds the vote,  adopt the single-seat, single-vote system for all elections, put  an end to the system of appointing members in district boards  and municipal councils, and allow local members of the Chinese  National People's Congress to stand for election here.    There was a 100 percent attendance by councillors for what  was deemed to be the legislature's toughest session, given  China's strident opposition to the Patten proposals and warnings  that anything that was decided would be scrapped in 1997 anyway.    Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang said she was pleased  with the result. Mrs Chan said she hoped China would accept the  system which has been decided by a legislature capable of making  a judgment for the vast majority of Hong Kong people. "I hope  China will appreciate we have the wider interests of Hong Kong  at heart and we will do our very best to seek cooperation with  China," she said.    The first attempt to block the bill was launched by veteran  legislator and Patten adversary, Elsie Tu, but she was defeated  36 to 23 after three hours of debate. Mrs Tu was supported by  the 15 Liberal Party members and seven pro-China legislators and  independents.    Later in the evening, the Liberal Party tried again to stall  the more controversial part of the election law -- the  single-seat, single-vote system for the 1995 election of the  legislature -- but was defeated after another three hours of  debate. The amendment tabled by party chief Allen Lee Peng-fei  was rejected 35-15.    Independent legislator Eric Li Ka-cheung, who sought to  restore the appointment seats to the district boards and the  municipal councils, was opposed by 41 members. Only eight  legislators voted for Mr Li's motion, most of his supporters  being independents.    Mrs Tu warned Hong Kong people would be victimised if China  and Britain failed to co-operate. She said: "Let me make clear  at the outset that I believe in democracy if that means finding  ways to improve the livelihood of the people. But I do not  believe in a political power struggle that leads the community  into a state of fear and anxiety about the future."  Disappointed with the fact that there would be no further talks  because the reforms had gone through, Mrs Tu said: "If I were  asked to be an adviser (to China), I would feel this time I must  do it."    But independent legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai said the  proposals carried in the bill were very moderate. If such  proposals were to be rejected, it meant that Hong Kong would  only capitulate to China's wishes, she said.    Standing Orders required 12 rounds of voting on the  amendments before a final decision could be reached. The  original proposals got through with only the slight adjustment  to the title suggested by independent legislator Andrew Wong  Wang-fat.    The voting, which will fuel the Chinese anger, came only 10  hours before Mr Patten is to start another dispute by publishing  the British version of what went on during the 17 rounds of  talks about political reforms. The Governor will explain to  Legco at the question time session beginning at 1430 why he had  decided to go ahead with publishing a White Paper.    A total of 100,000 copies of the White Paper, 70,000 in  Chinese and 30,000 in English, will be released at 1700 and will  be available to the public tomorrow morning.    Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas Ng Wing-fui  said at the end of the debate on Mrs Tu's motion that the  Government was now left with no alternative but to proceed with  the bill. "We have now come to the point where we simply have  no other alternative but to get on with the legislative  process," he said. "The Chinese side has made it known on  numerous occasions that there would be no more talks unless we  first withdrew the current bill. Surely, this is a demand which  neither the community nor this council will find acceptable."    Mr Ng said the bill was needed for the orderly preparation  of  elections in 1994/95.</p>

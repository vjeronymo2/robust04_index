			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV AND TRUST  </P> <P> A front-page article ("Survey Shows Change in Cold War Thinking" on Jan. 24)  declared that Gorbachev was rated more favorably than President Bush in a Times  Orange County Poll.  </P> <P> I live in Orange County and nobody asked my opinion. The only list that  Gorbachev appears on of mine is the one entitled, "People I Least Trust." He's  not even No. 1 on that list. He follows a close second -- after the news media!  </P> <P> BRENDA HESTER  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

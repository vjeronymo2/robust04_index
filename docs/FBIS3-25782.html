Wu arrived in Beijing Friday as head of a four-man SEF  contingent to arrange the agenda of talks between SEF Vice  Chairman and Secretary-General Chiao Jen-ho and ARATS Vice  President and Secretary-General Tang Shubei. Chiao will arrive  here on Jan. 31.    The Chiao-Tang talks will be the highest-level cross-Strait  talks since the Singapore negotiations between SEF Chairman Ku  Chen-fu and his ARATS counterpart, Wang Daohan, in April last  year.    Officials of the SEF and ARATS, the two intermediary  organizations authorized by Taipei and Beijing to handle cross-  Strait exchanges in the absence of official ties between the  two, failed to reach any concrete agreements in three follow-up  meetings to the Singapore talks.    The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) earlier said that it  hoped  the Chiao-Tang talks would "create favorable conditions" for a  second round of Ku-Wang negotiations.    The SEF had earlier proposed that Chiao and Tang focus on  four main areas of discussion:    -- The effectiveness of the SEF and ARATS in promoting  cross-Strait exchanges, such as in the implementation of  agreements on the authentification of documents and compensation  for lost registered mail;    -- The results of the three follow-up talks to the Koo-Wang  meeting;    -- The implementation of issues agreed upon during the  Singapore talks, including cross-Strait economic cooperation and  cultural exchanges, and protection of Taiwan investors in the  mainland; and    -- Other issues of mutual concern, such as the repatriation  from Taiwan of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants, and  the joint crackdown on drug and arms smuggling.</p>

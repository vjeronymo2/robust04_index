			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee Discipline  Inspection Committee began its second enlarged plenary meeting  in Hangzhou today. Wang Qichao, member of the Standing  Committee and secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee  of the provincial party committee, delivered a report entitled  "Carry Out a Deep-Going, Sustained, and Even More Effective  Anticorruption Struggle to Serve the Province's Reform,  Development, and Stability."    Wang Qichao reviewed the unfolding of the anticorruption  struggle and building of party work style and clean  administration in the province since it implemented the  guidelines of the second enlarged meeting of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission. He pointed out: The  province's anticorruption work showed a good tendency and  healthy progress, basically satisfying the central authorities  and the provincial party committee's demands in the previous  stage.    First, leading cadres' integrity and self-discipline were  strengthened. Party and government leading bodies at or above  county or department level generally held democratic meetings,  during which 96 percent of the leading cadres carried out  self-examination and self-correction with [words instinct]  emotion. Most cadres conscientiously dealt with and corrected,  in accordance with relevant provisions, mistakes exposed in  their self-examination. For instance, 340 enterprise cadres  with a second job had given up one of their jobs, 2,031 cadres  turned in a total of 670,000 yuan in gift money and coupons they  received and accepted during official activities, and 357 cadres  returned credit cards they had kept for personal use.    Second, discipline inspection, supervision, and examination  organs at all levels cracked a number of serious cases of law  and discipline violation through concerted efforts. In the  latter half of last year, discipline inspection and supervision  organs received and handled 42,256 letters and visits from the  masses, a 109.9-percent increase over the first half of the  year; placed 1,988 discipline violation cases on file for  investigation and corrective action, up 43 percent; and punished  2,351 party-member cadres, up 88.7 percent. Of the cadres  punished, 645 were expelled from the party or discharged from  public employment, 79 were removed from official positions, and  486 were placed on probation within the party.    Third, some progress was made in special rectification work,  such as clearing up illegal fees, economic entities set up by  party and government organs, overseas and out-of-country trips,  and reckless distribution of gift money and coupons. The  provincial government abolished 310 unreasonable fees in two  batches, while relevant departments at the provincial level and  various cities, prefectures, and counties scrapped 1,226  self-imposed fees.    Wang Qichao pointed out: In carrying out anticorruption work  this year, the province should take proper, unremitting charge  of three tasks to strive for fresh results in the next stage:  1. to further take good charge of leading cadres' integrity and  self-discipline. While continuously implementing the five  provisions put forward by the central authorities last year on  leading cadres' integrity and self-discipline, we should  earnestly enforce the five new provisions forwarded and  reiterated by the central authorities this year; 2. to  intensify efforts in handling cases and sternly punish corrupt  elements; 3. to take good charge of special rectification work  and the work to rectify unhealthy practices.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Koichiro Tani, Ramjet Propulsion Research </F> Department, National Aerospace Laboratory]    [Text] One technology that is essential for the development  of the space plane is the scramjet engine, which achieves thrust  by supersonic combustion--spraying hydrogen fuel into a  high-mach air flow. At the National Aerospace Laboratory,  various types of scramjet tests have been conducted for 5 years.  Of these, the tests involving air intake and compression have  been focused on aerodynamic characteristics research. This  research was a study of scramjet startup characteristics at  minimum operation. Figure 1 shows the shape of the air intake  model. Shape parameters that determine the aerodynamic  characteristics are represented by side wall leading edge  inclination (_a_) and contraction ratio (CR). These two  parameters were incrementally changed to seek startup  boundaries, and along with this, aerodynamic characteristics in  the startup/non-startup transition zone were investigated.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-45A>      Figure 1:  Air Intake Model </FIG>     The experiments were conducted in a mach 4 blow-down tunnel  at the Kakuda laboratory. For the experiments, 30 models with  different shapes were prepared and inflow boundary layer  thickness was varied by attaching them either to a flat plate in  the wind tunnel (Case A) or directly to the wind tunnel wall  (Case B). Boundary layer thickness was about 1/8 of model height  in Case A, and about 1/2 of model height in Case B. Wall  pressure and pitot pressure measurements were taken to reveal  aerodynamic characteristics. Also, to make flow composition  visible, schlieren observation was used for inside the air  intake and oil flow was used for the surface flow.    Figure 2 is a schlieren photograph of the flow at the time  of  startup/non-startup. Oblique shock waves which can be clearly  confirmed at startup time become blurred at non-startup time as  they face the lower flow. This is because the separation shock  waves that are generated on the ceiling wall at non-startup time  substantially change the internal part of the flow. Figure 3  shows how this looks when observed by the oil flow method. In  this figure, Line A corresponds to where the oblique shock waves  created by the sidewall are reflected and Line B corresponds to  a new separation line which the separation shock waves create on  the side wall surface. As the CR increases, Line B gradually  moves from the inner part of the air intake to the upper flow,  and finally moves in front of the air intake.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-46A>      Figure 2:  Model Internal Schlieren Photograph </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-46B>      Figure 3: Oil Flow Photographs of Side Wall </FIG>     In this manner, changes in the shape of the air intake side  wall change the separative state of the ceiling boundary layer,  and when this happens, the separation shock waves change the  flow in the internal part of the air intake. The transition of  this flow follows changes in the location of separation shock  waves and, in the case of the axisymmetric air intake, it is  impossible to fully observe the startup state with just the flow  speed in the throat section, the narrowest part of the flow  path. Therefore, the startup characteristic of each air intake  was evaluated by using two criteria for grouping, as shown in  Figure 4. One is grouping by location of separation shock waves.  At startup time, the separation shock waves are near the throat  (circles in the figure). They moves to the forward edge of the  air intake (triangles in the figure), and finally jump out in  front of the intake (squares in the figure). Aerodynamic  performance (total pressure recovery rate, captured flow volume  rate, etc.) gets worse as the separation shock waves move, but  throat flow speed does not necessarily become subsonic. The  other grouping is simply when the average flow speed in the  throat is above (unfilled shapes in the figure) and below  (filled shapes) the speed of sound. In terms of the role of  transmitting the supersonic flow to the combustor, the states  represented by solid triangles and squares in the figure can be  said to be fully non-startup.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-47A>      Figure 4:  Startup State Groupings </FIG>     As seen in Figure 4, startup generally is difficult toward  the advance angle, which tells us that startup is difficult when  CR is high. The model with leading edge angle of almost 0  and high CR in particular can be easily shifted to a completely  non-startup state. Moreover, when compared to Case B, which has  a thick boundary layer, Case A has a broad full startup zone,  but it has a narrow transition zone, and changes in shape cause  rapid change in state. Incidentally, total pressure recovery  rate (ratio of total pressure in main flow and average pressure  in throat) at startup is 40 - 70% for Case A, but it is  20 -  45% for Case B because of strong influence of the boundary  layer, which has low total pressure. In the future, studies will  be done on air intake shapes that will, in accordance with the  needs of the combustor, achieve prescribed pressure increases at  the throat surface while suppressing ceiling wall separation.    These tests were conducted as part of joint research with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.</p>

In Tehran, the  Friday prayers were led by Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moselmin  Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    At the beginning of his sermons, the acting Friday prayer  leader of Tehran set out to describe the mission of the prophets  and the battle between evil and righteousness. He said: After  the passage of seven centuries since the mission of His Holiness  Jesus Christ -- may peace be upon him -- humanity was in dire  need of a new prophethood. Then the greatest miracle in the  history of mankind occurred, and with the prophethood of the  esteemed prophet of Islam, a comprehensive and all-embracing  doctrine was created that was able to nurture human beings,  build civilizations, and provide all the answers to all the  needs of mankind in all eras and historical junctures. In this  way, God was able to communicate His fundamental ethos to  mankind through the Prophet's tongue.    Even at that time, the atheist and arrogant camp lined up  against God's prophet, and stopped at nothing in their  confrontation against the divine messenger. They were  shamelessly ungrateful and employed the most violent and  coercive measures to keep the history's most eternal truth  well-hidden. However, this school of thought [Islam] was to  become the architect of a great civilization, which has about  1.5 billion followers today. During the last 15 years, the most  beautiful manifestation of this civilization has been  crystallized by the selflessness and the sacrifices of the  nation of Iran.    Moreover, the president clarified: At present, history is  witnessing the repeat of events that unfolded at the advent of  Islam. The plight that the Islamic world faces today is the  same as the one that the prophet had to endure during the early  days of Islam. A glance at the conditions of Muslims in various  parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kashmir,  Bosnia, and Palestine, and the silence of the West toward their  plight, testifies to this reality.    At the end of the first sermon, Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin  Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed the need to consider the Prophet,  his ethics, and his characteristics in life, worship, piety, and  jehad as a model.

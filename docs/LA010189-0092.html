			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Anti-terrorist police in London arrested several people in connection with the  discovery two weeks ago of a major IRA bomb factory in the city. Police would  not say how many people were rounded up or give further details of the  operation. One man was arrested earlier after police found an apartment in  south London full of bomb-making equipment and more than 100 pounds of Semtex  explosives of the sort used by Irish Republican Army guerrillas fighting to end  British rule in Northern Ireland. He was charged with conspiracy to cause  explosions in Britain likely to endanger life.  </P></p>

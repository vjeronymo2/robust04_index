			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Tokyo stocks Standard Chartered's and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's decision to delist from the Tokyo Stock Exchange should come as little surprise. Their announcement yesterday brings the number of foreign groups abandoning the exchange this year to 18. The exodus underlines the Tokyo Stock Exchange's lack of competitiveness. The costs of a Tokyo listing are three to four times higher than those of other international markets. Yet trading volumes in foreign stocks are minuscule. That is partly because Japanese institutions currently have little interest in acquiring overseas assets while the yen continues to appreciate. But it is also because transaction costs in Tokyo are up to eight times higher than in other markets. Japanese investors can trade more cheaply in foreign companies' domestic markets. They can also trade Japanese shares at less expense, which explains why 50 per cent of trading volumes in certain Japanese stocks is sometimes transacted on London's Seaq. Yesterday's call for further deregulation by the Keidanren, the Japanese business federation, could not be more timely. Its proposals for liberalising brokerage commissions and revising the securities trading tax should be accepted by the ministry of finance. If not, Japan's financial industry risks ending up with as much of its core based overseas as its manufacturing counterpart.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Letter: Bulldozers and bureaucrats Sir, Your picture of a lone protester defying a bulldozer destroying a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) at Twyford Down brings into question who really rules. It is significant that as soon as the politicians become preoccupied with the general election, the bulldozers - held back since March 1 - go in. The conclusion is that it is the people who do not have to worry about votes - the bureaucrats - who are the driving force. Rodney Parkins, 8 Duval Drive, Rochester, Kent ME1 2SY</p>

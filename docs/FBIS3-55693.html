The whole package has been  tagged "the little Constitution" of Lithuania.    The Lithuanian president, lawmakers government members,  municipal officials and regional government commissioners met in  the parliament Monday [10 January] to discuss the principles of  local administration and territorial division reforms.    The meeting's participants discussed several issues,  including a new administrative-territorial division of  Lithuania, municipal property problems and a bill on municipal  elections.    Municipal elections in Lithuania are scheduled for next  fall.  The draft provides for a single-mandate system of elections, but  several members of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party  faction proposed to introduce proportional representation.    Opposition MP [member of parliament] Andrius Kubilius said  Monday the opposition will only back a single-mandate system.</p>

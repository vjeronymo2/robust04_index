			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Italian Agenda for </F> Corfu Summit"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, June 22 -- Italy will try to delay  the election of a new European Commission president and will  raise objections to financing proposed for the so-called Delors  Plan on jobs at the summit of EU [European Union] leaders in  Corfu, Greece, this weekend, Foreign Undersecretary Livio Caputo  told reporters Wednesday [22 June].    On the election of a new EU executive chief, to replace  resigning president Jacques Delors, Italy will ask that a  special summit be called in September because a unanimous  decision "is impossible today" and forcing a decision at the  Greek summit may cause rifts within the Union.    Germany and France have endorsed Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene but Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  seems undecided between Dehaene and Dutch Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers. Two other candidates are also in the running for the  Commission presidency.    The two top items on the agenda at Corfu June 24 and 25 are  the signing of a cooperation accord with Russia and the signing  of membership treaties with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway,  which would join the Union in January 1995 if the governments of  all 12 member states ratify the treaties in time.

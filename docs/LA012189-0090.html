			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVOLUTIONARY BOAT FROM SAN PEDRO CHALLENGES FOR LITTLE AMERICA'S CUP  </P> <P> A revolutionary sailboat from the Cabrillo Beach Yacht Club in San Pedro will  start a best-of-7 series against the Australian defender of the Little  America's Cup here Saturday.  </P> <P> The competition -- known formally as the International Catamaran Challenge  Trophy -- is for Class C catamarans 25 feet long.  </P> <P> Class C catamarans are distinct for their airfoil wing-type sails, which  inspired the design of the 60-foot Stars &amp; Stripes catamaran Dennis Conner  sailed in a lopsided, 2-race defense of the America's Cup against New Zealand's  130-foot monohull last September.  </P> <P> The San Pedro boat, dubbed Wingmill, features an airfoil that rotates top to  bottom like a pinwheel when the boat tacks or jibes (alters course across the  wind direction). It will be sailed by brothers Steve and Brian Dair of San  Pedro.  </P> <P> The defender will be Edge II, a conventional Class C cat to be sailed by Simon  McKeon and Dave Churcher.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALLET REVIEW;  </P> <P> BALLETMET WINS NEW FANS WITH COUNTY DEBUT  </P> <P> BalletMet, which performed Sunday afternoon at McKinney Theatre on the  Saddleback College campus, is the kind of regional dance company that wins  people over to ballet. The 22 dancers are lithe, fleet and personable, and they  seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves. The repertory is essentially  contemporary, stressing humor, lyricism and an athletic ease.  </P> <P> For its first Orange County appearance, the Ohio-based company left the  Balanchine and Paul Taylor at home and chose not to offer a new James Kudelka  work that's on the program elsewhere on the three-week West Coast tour.  </P> <P> Instead, we got a taste of the style of company artistic director John McFall  in "Beyond Midnight"; "Shinju," a 15-year-old exercise in balleticized Japanese  ritual drama by McFall's mentor, former San Francisco Ballet artistic director  Michael Smuin, and the good-humored, if long-winded, antics of Lynne  Taylor-Corbett's "Great Galloping Gottschalk," to the Latin-flavored music of  Louis Moreau Gottschalk.  </P> <P> McFall's piece, danced to Gabriel Faure's Piano Quartet No. 1, does have its  charms. Among them are the white turn-of-the-century style dresses for the  women (the handiwork of Victoria Gyorfi, a former San Francisco Ballet dancer),  which make all the languorous turns and lifts look especially lovely.  </P> <P> The steps take full advantage of the upper-body pliancy of the 10 dancers, as  well as their ability to look into each others' eyes and suggest that something  romantic is actually transpiring. But all the melting fluidity in the world  can't make up for a lack of structure and development.  </P> <P> By the third movement, McFall seemed to have run out of ideas. A startlingly  misplaced gymnastics sequence (a woman dragged downstage by two men suddenly  vaults up over their shoulders) suggested the well of inspiration was very dry  indeed.  </P> <P> The woman -- tiny, quicksilver Catherine Yoshimura -- was a delight, however.  Rapturously romantic and soft-edged in "Beyond Midnight," she was an impish  sprite in "Gottschalk," a human barnacle clinging for dear life to one man in a  whirling circle of dancers. One wonders what she would have done with the  sweetly stoic geisha in "Shinju."  </P> <P> Paige Fulleton navigated the role's small vocabulary of shyly angled movements  (feet flex, knees bend, the head tilts) with great delicacy and control but  without conveying much intensity of feeling. Todd Woffinden, her stolid samurai  hunk, lacked the power and toughness that would be second nature to a  professional warrior.  </P> <P> The sinister aura of the stern bit players surrounding the doomed lovers was  also in need of weightier, darker notes.  </P> <P> The striking visual effects (by Willa Kim) and the spare, suitably exotic music  (by Paul Chihara) still weave a persuasive spell around this essentially hokey  piece. The double suicides -- Romeo and Juliet meet Bonnie and Clyde -- come  complete with writhing bodies and leaping red ribbons of blood.  </P> <P> "Gottschalk" was a breezy send-off, with the right-on-the-mark comedic timing  of Michael Cornell and Daren Savage, the warmly romantic playfulness of  Elizabeth Zengara and Armando Luna, and the pertly audience-conscious clowning  of Anastasia Glimidakis, Patti Owen and Andrea Hodge.  </P></p>

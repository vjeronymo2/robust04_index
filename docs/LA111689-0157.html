			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR ELECTS KIRKLAND TO 6TH TERM  </P> <P> Lane Kirkland, the 67-year-old president of the AFL-CIO, was unanimously  reelected Wednesday to a sixth two-year term by 765 delegates to organized  labor's biannual convention.  </P> <P> Richard Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers Union, which reaffiliated  with the AFL-CIO last summer after a four-decade absence, was elected to one of  five open vice presidential seats on the AFL-CIO executive council.  </P> <P> Latino delegates to the convention expressed disgruntlement that a Latino labor  leader, Jack Otero, vice president of the Transportation Communication  International Union, was not among those named to the 33-member council.  </P> <P> The executive council has no Latinos, only three women and two blacks, a fact  that irks minorities, who note that women and minorities are the prime targets  of current union organizing efforts in the United States.  </P> <P> "I'm very disappointed. It's inconceivable to me that if you have 1.4 million  Latino members affiliated with the AFL-CIO you can't find one to sit on the  executive council," said Rick Icaza, president of the Los Angeles County  Federation of Labor and a delegate to the convention. Kirkland "has to  realistically sit down and encourage the executive council that the time is  now."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Usha Joshi: "Investigating the Dunkel </F> Proposals"]    [Text] "The farmers are the backbone of our country and  agriculture is the foundation on which our economy is based."  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao said this in an interview, and it  is true in our present situation. It is important to discuss how  much burden will be put on the farmer and how it will crumble  our economy if the multinational companies put the stamp of  their patent on every grain we grow. Why are our politicians and  the government quiet about this issue and merely trying to  comfort us?    Genetic engineering has reached every grain of wheat and  paddy now. It means that various seeds can be created by  cross-breeding special types of seeds. S. Barlow had crated a  Mexican seed by crossing a Mexican high yield variety with a  dwarf plant, which made the plant shorter (to withstand rain,  winds, and hurricanes) and still produce a high yield. This  helped bring the Green Revolution to India. We do not know how  many fruits, flowers, grains, and plants are being experimented  on, and how many new varieties have been created. This is being  done in our country too, however, only at the laboratory  research level on some special kind of pulses and some varieties  of corn in Shimla. It is not being done at national level. Why  are these foreigners taking so much interest in our natural  resources? Why are they inviting our senior scientists working  in this field to accept high positions there and having them say  their say? Why are they collecting seeds of our fruits, flowers,  and grains? For example, of the hundreds of varieties of mango,  only about 50 are left now, and from among these only five or  six varieties are recommended for growing. A time will come when  we will have only five or six kinds of mangoes in our groves,  and the remaining will disappear as we are not saving these  trees or their seeds.    In this situation, we will have to beg these multinational  companies, and pay them their asking price to use their patented  hybrid variety. They are asking for ownership of patents in the  Dunkel proposal. The same is true about their grain seeds that  have already reached our farmers.    It is an excessive burden on the farmers to ask them to  protect the seeds until sowing time so that they are not  changed. It is important to mention here that the scientific  expertise required for producing hybrid varieties is beyond the  farmers. It is the government's responsibility to produce such  seeds in "seed institutions" and make those available to the  farmers through seeds distribution centers. The seeds stored  with the farmers will not be protected even under ideal  conditions, and these will not produce a good harvest. The  farmers will be attracted to those hybrid varieties that give  higher yield. It does not matter to them whether these are  produced by Pioneer Seed company or one of the dozen foreign  companies that have established themselves in India during the  last five or six years. There is a biotechnical department at  the ICAR in India. In addition, the National Bureau of Plant  Genetic Resources has been established. Seeds of all varieties  of traditional indigenous plants are stored here and will be  kept for 30-40 years. However, only two or three kilograms of  these seeds are stored. If we need to produce new seeds from  them, it would take 10 years to produce them in large quantities  for the farmers. Commerce Minister Prabanab Mukherji's statement  that a law to keep seeds until the next harvest will be passed  to remove the doubts about the Dunkel Draft is nothing more than  hog wash.    Scientists select the best available seeds when they want to  produce high yield seeds of any kind. From patent seeds they get  one male and one female seed and cross them to experiment with  different possible combinations. It takes a scientist about five  or six years to finish this process.    These seeds are not stored in large quantities in major  storages. This will force us to depend on foreign exotic seeds  again and their patent laws will prove a major hinderance to us.  Because of the lack of a proper long-range agricultural policy,  we will become slaves in our own country. The package deal  included in the Dunkel draft has this provision in it. Now, they  do not have to send an army to defeat a nation, our stomachs  will be controlled using this strategy.    The patent laws in India were for the process and not for  the  product, however, now under Dunkel the patent law will effect  every technological product. For example, if a company gets the  patent right over any lifeform, everything related will belong  to it. In this way, developed countries will slowly entrap the  developing and backward countries so well that we cannot even  think about it. The Dunkel draft also proposes patenting not  only all varieties of trees and plants but also micro organisms.  Now we know why the foreign researchers have been collecting  plants and herbs from our jungles and conducting research on  them for many years. This was a well planned strategy which has  emerged in the form of the Dunkel draft. Great Britain says that  the Gatt agreement will result in trade worth 230 million, which  seems to be true. Gatt, with its 107 member countries, will help  open new channels of trade in India. It will help exchange of  technology, increase employment opportunities, and provide rules  and regulations for mutual trade. However, other nations are  playing the game of giving with one hand and cutting our other  hand by offering this package deal under Dunkel, and our  scientists, politicians, and the government is quiet about it.  The Dunkel draft will be signed as an agreement in Brussels on  15 December. It is important that we make necessary changes in  the patent laws so these work for us and present the draft to  the people. The developed countries have used up most of their  natural resources, and their eyes are on our virgin land now.</p>

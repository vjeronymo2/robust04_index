			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has not established a timeline for the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards or test procedures for hydrogen, electric, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solar powered vehicles. EPA will continue to assess the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing emission standards and test procedures for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Energy, under the Chrysler Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, is responsible for developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum equivalency factors for electric vehicles for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of including such vehicles in the CAFE program. The CAFE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation and test procedures for electric vehicles are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in 10 CFR 474.4. The petroleum equivalency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors for electric vehicles were not extended past 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, due to continued technology development and a strong  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry interest in the CAFE treatment of electric vehicles, DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is currently developing a notice of proposed rule to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new petroleum equivalency factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is currently developing a reformulated gasoline program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reformulated gasoline will be used in current gasoline-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. The AMFA does not provide CAFE credits for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline-fueled vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Fuel Specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of the Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency proposed that alcohol fuel and natural gas fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for fuel economy testing and service accumulation shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of commercially available fuel for motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several automobile manufacturers recommended that definite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel specifications for methanol and natural gas fuels used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions and fuel economy testing be adopted. The commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the proposed procedure allows for too much potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistency between the manufacturers and EPA in fuels used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing. Without fuel specifications, fuel economy and emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results could vary in response to differences in fuel properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The manufacturers suggested that specifications for methanol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blends be based on chemical grade methanol (ASTM D 1152) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification grade gasoline (40 CFR 86.113&hyph;82a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency agrees that setting fuel specifications for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuels for emission and fuel economy testing would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the uncertainty associated with certification using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unspecified commercially representative fuels. However, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that, to the extent variability in fuel specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can affect emissions, fuel specifications for methanol, natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas, and other alternative fuels used for emissions testing (and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, fuel economy testing since they are calculated from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same test) should be representative of fuels encountered in-use. Certified automobiles are expected to comply with emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards under normal in-use conditions, which includes the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fuels that are representative of those commercially available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator reserves the right to test vehicles using fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of those that in-use vehicles will encounter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ideally, fuel specifications should be developed that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of in-use fuels. However, since the markets for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these fuels for use in motor vehicles are not yet established,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the fuels that become commercially available could vary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly in composition, a single set of specifications may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be representative of the fuels that could be used. Also, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is difficult to identify which compositions are representative in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the absence of established markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 11, 1989, EPA published a final rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (54 FR 14426) which established emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and test procedures for methanol-fueled automobiles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In that rulemaking, methanol test fuels were required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of in-use fuels. However, the methanol fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market is not yet at a level of development to allow for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of a representative fuel. EPA has developed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> package of proposed technical amendments (58 FR 11816, March 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993) to the above-mentioned final rule to improve the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions data and increase the flexibility for manufacturers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the requirements. One of the proposals in this package is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow a combination of chemical grade methanol and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification gasoline for test fuels in proportions that reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the composition of the intended in-use fuel (currently this would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be 85% methanol and 15% gasoline) until specifications for a fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of in-use fuel can be determined. EPA plans to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply these provisions for both emissions and fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For natural gas, the issue of setting fuel specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is being addressed in a separate rulemaking (``Standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions From Natural Gas-Fueled, and Liquified Petroleum Gas-Fueled Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicle Engines *&blank;*&blank;*'' NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on November 5, 1992, 57 FR 52912). In the interim, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will allow a manufacturer to petition the Administrator to use a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific composition of natural gas, provided that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer can demonstrate that this fuel is similar in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition to currently available in-use fuel. If standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grade fuels emerge when methanol, natural gas, ethanol, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuels become commercially available, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider such fuels for setting test fuel specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Energy Efficiency of Dual-Fueled Automobiles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of the Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed a method for determining whether a vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the AMFA energy efficiency requirements to be eligible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAFE credit. The method proposed by EPA required each fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy data vehicle to be tested under both the city and highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test cycles using the alternative fuel, the petroleum fuel, and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for alcohol dual-fueled vehicles, a 50 percent by volume alcohol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 50 percent petroleum (gasoline or diesel) fuel mixture. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of energy efficiency that was proposed would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to determine, and the Administrator to approve, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net heating values and densities of the alternative fuel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum fuel, and 50/50 mixture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of the Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

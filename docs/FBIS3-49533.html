			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovakia Will Not Become a Toy in the Hands </F> of the Strong"]    [Excerpt] Trencin -- A festive rally of Army of the Slovak  Republic commanders was held in Trencin yesterday, on the  occasion of the beginning of the second year of the existence of  the Slovak Republic and the building of the Army of the Slovak  Republic. It was attended by Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak,  Army Commander Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, and senior  members of the Army of the Slovak Republic Officers' Corps.    At the outset of the rally, its participants heard a letter  addressed by President Michal Kovac to the participants in the  rally. The letter states, among other things, that in the  security and political spheres, we are oriented unequivocally  toward NATO and the West European Union (WEU). We are looking  for guarantees to ensure that Slovakia will never again become a  toy in the hands of the strong.    As Michal Kovac went on to stress, according to ideas  communicated by former U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin,  participation by the Slovak Republic, along with the other  states of the Visegrad Group, in the Partnership for Peace  initiative should serve as an intermediary organizational link  on the road toward fully fledged NATO membership. This should  mean the possibility of achieving a certain type of associate  membership of NATO or the WEU. According to Michal Kovac, this  would not require full integration of the military components,  but should at least contain guarantees that the parties will be  consulted whenever the territorial integrity, political  independence, or security of either party will be jeopardized,  in the opinion of one of them.    In another part of his letter, Michal Kovac appreciated the  fact that, in defiance of complicated conditions, the division  of the former Federal Army has been completed in a relatively  short period of time. He assured Army members that he will see  to it that all necessary conditions be established for the Army  of the Slovak Republic to discharge its duties and for it to be  accorded such a degree of social recognition as corresponds to  the nature and significance of its work for the benefit of the  Slovak Republic.

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Pact urged to help poor nations: UN report sees benefits for rich in a deal A 'NEW global compact' between industrial and developing countries is proposed in this year's Human Development Report, published yesterday by the United Nations Development Programme.* Such a compact would aim to achieve, by the year 2000, universal basic education for men and women, primary health care and safe water for all, the elimination of serious malnutrition, and at least 80 per cent access to family planning. It would also aim to create enough job opportunities to absorb the growth in the global labour force while reducing absolute poverty by 50 per cent. While these aims would be of more direct interest to developing countries, industrial countries would benefit from closer co-operation on drug trafficking and pollution, relief of immigration pressures through creation of job opportunities in poor nations, and reduction of nuclear threats through lower international tension and acceptance of non-proliferation policies. Both sides would benefit from global peace and disarmament and from prevention of unmanageable debt burdens. The report, compiled by an independent team of economists 'under the guidance' of Mr Mahbub ul Haq, a former finance minister of Pakistan, suggests that the new compact should be financed partly from a global 'peace dividend' of around Dollars 1.5 trillion (million million), resulting from a 3 per cent annual cut in all countries' military spending throughout the decade. It also says industrial countries should reform their Overseas Development Assistance so that two-thirds goes to the poorest nations (at present only a quarter does) and at least 20 per cent to 'human priority expenditure' (at present only 7 per cent). A 'global debt bargain', involving a substantial write-down of debts by official donors and commercial banks, would halt the debt-related net transfer from developing to industrial countries, which the report says is currently Dollars 50bn a year. It also suggests various forms of funding for environmentally sustainable development, such as a one-dollar-per-barrel oil consumption tax, yielding around Dollars 24bn a year, an equivalent coal tax (Dollars 16bn), and rationing certificates for carbon dioxide emissions. Finally, developing countries could increase their exports by Dollars 40bn a year if global markets in both goods and services were liberalised. Such a compact, the report suggests, should be prepared by a process of world consultations, leading to a 'world summit on human development'. It also suggests creation of a privately funded body, 'Honesty International', to monitor and combat corruption, following the successful example of Amnesty International in human rights. These are the main prescriptive conclusions of a report which gives a disturbing analytical and statistical picture of inequalities and obstacles to development in the global economic system. In particular, the report shows that global income disparities have widened in recent years. By 1990, it says, the richest 20 per cent of the world's population had incomes 60 times greater than the poorest 20 per cent, whereas in 1960 this was only 30 times. Even those figures are based on the distribution between rich and poor countries: if maldistribution within countries is taken into account, 'the richest 20 per cent of the world's people get at least 150 times more than the poorest 20 per cent'. The report attributes this widening gap partly to the national policies of developing countries but also to unequal access to capital and technology and to restrictions on free movement of goods and labour. An important innovation of previous reports was the 'human development index,' which combines life expectancy, educational attainment and income indicators to give a composite measure of human development. On this measure, Canada has now displaced Japan as the world's most developed country. The US trails in sixth position, behind Norway, Switzerland and Sweden. Next come Australia, France and the Netherlands, with the UK 10th and Germany 12th (behind Iceland). But if gender disparities are taken into account, Sweden is in first place, while Canada drops to eighth and Japan to 18th. At the other end of the table, Guinea has wrested the wooden spoon from Sierra Leone. Romania, in 60th place, is the least developed 'industrial' country, while Barbados, at number 20, scores highest among those officially classified as 'developing'. *Human Development Report 1992, Oxford University Press, Dollars 16.95 paperback, Dollars 29.95 cloth.</p>

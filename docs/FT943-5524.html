			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / AA to shed up to 550 insurance jobs AA Insurance yesterday announced the closure of its processing office in Cheadle, Cheshire, with the loss of up to 550 jobs. The work is being transferred to Newcastle and Cardiff. Mr Sean Keating, national secretary of the GMB general union, said: 'This will be a devastating blow but we hope that some of the staff might be redeployed.' He said that insurance industry restructuring driven by the growth of direct sales was the reason for the redundancies. The company, a subsidiary of the Automobile Association, said that a reassessment of its work had been announced in May to ensure that the company retained its position as the 'premier personal-lines intermediary in the UK'.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> BULK OF 'SPEEDY TRIAL' UPHELD  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court today upheld most of Proposition 115, the so-called  "Speedy Trial" initiative, but struck down its broadest provision, a repeal of  independent state constitutional rights for criminal defendants.  </P> <P> One effect of the ruling is to eliminate a restriction on privacy rights that  opponents said could be used to allow criminal prosecutions for certain  abortions.  </P> <P> The court ruled unanimously that the constitutional provision, which would have  required California courts to follow U.S. Supreme Court rulings in applying a  long list of constitutional rights, was such a fundamental change that it  amounted to a "revision" of the state Constitution, which cannot be done by  initiative.  </P> <P> But the court voted 6 to 1 to uphold the rest of the measure, which was passed  by voters in June.  </P></p>

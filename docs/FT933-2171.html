			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Brussels to press US over farm trade accord EUROPEAN Community ministers agreed early today to seek new flexibility from the US on the Blair House farm trade accord without formally renegotiating the deal. Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EC trade negotiator, praised the compromise by 35 foreign, trade and agriculture ministers meeting in Brussels, declaring that it had 'cleared the air'. Sir Leon, who had fiercely resisted French demands to reopen the accord, said the Community was unanimously agreed on the need to respect a December 15 deadline for reaching final agreement on the Gatt Uruguay Round. The compromise came shortly after 3am this morning after 12 hours of talks. It followed a Franco-German initiative to avert a political crisis within the Community over the world trade talks. During the late-night talks, Sir Leon complained however that proposals based on a Franco-German draft paper risked tying his hands in forthcoming negotiations with the US. His intervention provoked a stormy response from Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister. The essentially French paper, supported without much obvious enthusiasm by Germany, identified many of the chief French concerns about the Blair House accord limiting subsidised food exports. It followed demands from some ministers that the European Commission should test whether the US was ready to accept a 'clarification' of Blair House to accommodate the French and head off a full-scale political crisis in the already embattled Community. Several ministers voiced concern that the French-German draft could tempt the Clinton administration to blame the EC for a breakdown in the Gatt talks, or encourage the US to produce counter-demands. US officials remained adamant last night that 'clarifications' could not be allowed to serve as a guise for reopening the pact. The draft identified five difficulties with Blair House. These included an extension of the so-called peace clause preventing unilateral sanctions by either side; flexibility to make the cuts on subsidised food exports at any oint during the six-year life of the agreement; ensuring that EC food mountains are exempt from export curbs; strengthening of existing provisions to prevent surges in cheap US cereal substitutes; and guarantees that the EC will get a full share of any growth in world food markets. The draft makes clear, however, that these demands do not amount to a new negotiating mandate for the European Commission. It emerged hours after a snap summit between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in Paris. A key sticking point centred on Sir Leon's objections that the text could be interpreted as supporting France's contention that the Blair House deal is incompatible with the EC's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Earlier Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, warned that the EC would be paralysed by recriminations if the Uruguay Round failed. EC's row over farm trade, Page 6</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Boost for service jobs in Japan Japan's labour market continues to be weak, but the mild recovery is encouraging service industries to take on more staff, unemployment figures released yesterday show. The unemployment rate hovered at 3 per cent for the third month in a row in September, just below the 3.1 per cent record set in May 1987, the labour ministry said. A faint glimmer of improvement was evident in a rise in the number of jobs on offer, from 63 per 100 applicants in August, to 64 in September. However, the improvement in the job seekers' ratio may be fragile because it was entirely thanks to a possibly seasonal fall in the number of applicants over that period. Taken over the year to September, by contrast, the number of people looking for a job rose by 8.3 per cent. Industrial production for September fell 1.5 per cent from a month earlier, a sharper decline than was previously expected by private economists. The figure was partly affected by the upward revision of industrial production data for August, which rose 3.9 per cent from the previous month. Shipments fell by 3 per cent on the month while the inventory index rose 1.5 per cent. The inventory to shipments ratio for the month, which fell by 3.1 points in August due to brisk retail sales, rose 3.5 points. Production of electrical machinery fell 7.9 per cent, metal products dropped 4.9 per cent and 'other manufactured goods' declined 9.2 per cent. Precision machinery rose 4.7 per cent and transportation equipment advanced 3.9 per cent. The latest employment figures suggest that the main hope for a recovery in the labour market rests with service industries, where productivity is low by international standards. Employment by service companies rose 2.9 per cent in the year to September, while manufacturing jobs fell by slightly more, 3 per cent, over the same period. Overall employment is now greater in services than manufacturing, according to Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Barings Securities. Consumer prices in Tokyo jumped by 0.8 per cent in the year to October, from a 0.2 per cent rise in September, reflecting a rise in food prices caused by the hot summer. Excluding food, the core inflation rate remained unchanged, at 0.5 per cent, confirming that there is little inflationary pressure as the recovery gets under way.</p>

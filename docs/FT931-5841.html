			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Minister warns on order for carrier MR JONATHAN Aitken, the defence procurement minister (above left) yesterday visited Swan Hunter to see work in progress at the Tyneside shipbuilder. The future of the group, which has a blank order book after 1994, is dependent on its bid for a Ministry of Defence helicopter carrier - a Pounds 170m order which may be shelved because of financial pressures on the defence budget. Mr Aitken warned that a final decision depended on available resources. A decision will be made by the autumn. Without the order Swan Hunter, now reducing its workforce by 1,400 to 2,200, may close. Campaigning by management, unions and Tyneside MPs has left ministers well aware of the impact that the closure of Swan Hunter would have on Tyneside's economy and morale. Speaking during Mr Aitken's visit, joint group chief executive Mr Alex Marsh said the order was an 'absolutely critical contract' for the company, which has spent Pounds 1.5m on its bid. He denied that the government could have helped Swan Hunter more in its fight for overseas orders. But he said it was of great concern that the project could be withdrawn so late in the tendering process. Such a move would spell 'all sorts of disasters' for the group and for Tyneside.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investor problem for solicitors Sir, Barry Riley's reference (The Long View, October 29) to 'bureaucratic investor protection' rubs a sore spot for many of us in the professions. The effect of the Financial Services Act for solicitors has been to make them deliver a worse service at a higher cost. This is particularly frustrating when the problem could so easily be solved by taking solicitors outside the Act, provided that they clearly undertook to accept no personal benefit from commissions.

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVICE FOR DICK CHENEY  </P> <P> Col. Harry Summers, who is often capable of unusually incisive analysis of the  problems of waging war, could have been more helpful in his advice to Secretary  of Defense Dick Cheney ("Cheney's Job: Visualize the Wars and Roles We're  Equipping For," Op-Ed Page, March 31).  </P> <P> Cheney may well turn out to be a superb bean-counter and paper-shuffler, in the  best tradition of Robert McNamara, but it is doubtful he is capable of  visualizing war. One pretty much has to have been in one to have any real  understanding of what it takes just to stay in the field, much less win. Cheney  lacks that experience. So, the best advice one could give Cheney is: Seek out  the few warriors who still survive among the gaggle of commissioned bureaucrats  who "lead" the uniformed services these days; solicit their advice, learn from  their experience and their reflections on that experience. Then use that  learning to effect reforms in strategy, forces and doctrine.  </P> <P> If, when Cheney leaves office, the U.S. can deploy military forces capable of  successfully waging warfare against real enemies (the Grenadian Home Guard  doesn't count) in a variety of operational and political settings, without  either having to go nuclear or cut-and-run to save their backside, he will have  earned his pay, and maybe a place in history to boot.  </P> <P> ROLF P. COLT  </P> <P> El Cajon  </P></p>

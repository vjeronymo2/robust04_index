			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: Air strike proves successful says UK premier MR JOHN MAJOR said last night the air strikes had been 'limited and proportionate' but appeared to have been successful. He warned President Saddam Hussein that the allies would strike again if the Iraqi leader continued to defy the United Nations. The UK prime minister, who spoke to President George Bush by telephone after the attack, won support from the Labour and Liberal Democrat frontbenches for the attack. He said there had been no allied casualties among US, British and French forces and that all aircraft had returned safely. Preliminary signs were that the mission had achieved its objectives, Mr Major said in Downing Street. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told the Commons later, that 'early indications are that serious damage was inflicted.' However, the near consensus at Westminster was spoilt by protests from left-wing Labour MPs that the attack might strengthen Mr Saddam's position in Iraq and could encourage Islamic fundamentalism. The government said the attack on surface-to-air missiles and command and control facilities in southern Iraq had been taken in 'self-defence' to protect allied aircraft patrolling the no-fly zone to enforce UN resolutions. It said Iraqi activity would be scrutinised - and that no further warning would be given if Iraq's aircraft and missiles posed a threat to coalition aircraft operating south of the 32nd parallel. Mr Rifkind said Britain would continue to take part in discussions at the UN about Iraqi incursions into the demilitaried zone on the border with Kuwait. He told the Commons that four RAF Tornado strike aircraft and two Victor tankers took part in the raid, which followed Iraq's deployment of missiles in a 'threatening posture'. He won enthusiastic backing from Tory MPs. Mr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, said 'the only correct course. . . . was to take those missiles out of action,' adding: 'We cannot have the will of the UN challenged with impunity.' Some Tories wanted still greater pressure applied. Sir George Gardiner (Conservative, Reigate) said: 'The time will come when we need, not only to give Saddam Hussein a bloody nose but to go for his throat.' But several Labour MPs exempted themselves from the front bench consensus on last night's action. Mr Andrew Faulds (Warley East) said: 'This sort of action simply ensures the survival of Saddam Hussein and makes millions of converts to Islamic fundamentialism.' Mr Rifkind provoked protests from some Labour MPs when he said one critic, Mr Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South, 'might see himself as a friend and ally' of Saddam - a charge Mr Cryer denied The family of Mr Michael Wainwright, the Briton jailed for 10 years in August last year for illegally entering Iraq, fear he could be used as a human shield to prevent further allied strikes on military targets, PA adds. His sister, Susan Priestley, of Halifax, said: 'We are worried about what could happen to both Michael and the other jailed Briton, Paul Ride. 'They are currently being held in Baghdad but that could change.' Mr Ride, of Walthamstow, east London, is serving a seven-year term for the same offence.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Yusin article: "U.S. Administration's Attitude to </F> Russia Could Change If Russian Authorities Follow Opposition's  Foreign Policy Recipe"]    [Text] Washington-Moscow -- "The day when Russia joins the  `Partnership for Peace' program will be a great day for Europe."  Bob Graham, Democratic senator from Florida and a close friend  of President Clinton, is convinced that Russia will continue to  be one of the administration's main foreign policy concerns in  the foreseeable future.    During a trip to Washington organized by the U.S. NATO  mission for journalists from 22 European countries, the subject  of Russian-U.S. relations overshadowed all other issues, with  the sole exception of the Bosnia crisis. Officials and experts  from the State Department, the Pentagon, the National Security  Agency, and the Congressional Research Service made no secret of  the fact that many points of concern to Washington have recently  emerged in Russian policy.    First and foremost there is Moscow's skepticism about the  "Partnership for Peace" program. Russia's unexpected decision  to delay joining the "Partnership" indefinitely was a nasty  surprise for the Americans. When nationalists and Communists in  the Duma oppose military cooperation with the West, that  surprises nobody, but it is quite another matter when the  president and defense minister start adopting that stance....    Washington finds the arguments put forward by Moscow against  "Partnership" less than convincing. "Russia is demanding  special status in relations with NATO. But it will have such a  status," was the assurance given by a high-ranking Pentagon  official who was speaking to journalists, like most officials,  anonymously. "Perhaps not everyone in Moscow realizes that  `Partnership for Peace' is actually not one partnership but  many. Each side implements its own cooperation  program with NATO. When Russian colleagues tell me that they do  not want to be playing the same role as Albania, I say: `Look  at the map. Yours is a huge country with a very powerful army,  you are a nuclear power. Who would think of comparing you with  Albania?' Naturally, we will have an entirely special  relationship with Russia -- a closer and a detailed  relationship. I see no serious reason why Russia should  renounce participation in `Partnership' and deliberately condemn  itself to isolation."    In the Americans' opinion, Moscow's vacillation over both  cooperation with NATO and the much-troubled Russian-U.S. joint  maneuvers is due to domestic factors. Following the reformers'  failure in the December elections, Yeltsin has changed the  emphasis in foreign policy, espousing some of the opposition's  ideas. These include -- however unpalatable it may be for  Washington to recognize it -- the arbitrary anti-Americanism of  the Russian "patriots."    Researchers from the "security policy research center," who  regularly send reports to the White House, Congress, and the  State Department, are convinced that since December the Russian  authorities have lost their reformist potential, that a rapid  retreat into the past has begun, and that the world is on the  threshold of a new era of confrontation between Washington and  Moscow. Frank Gaffney, one of the center's leading experts,  believes that it would be a mistake to involve Russia in  "Partnership for Peace" and that the program in general is of no  value to the West -- the functions of restraining Russian  expansionism could be successfully handled by NATO. Former  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former National Security  Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski are of a similar opinion.    The White House is in no hurry to follow their  recommendations. Washington's policy toward Moscow is  determined to a considerable extent by Strobe Talbott, deputy  secretary of state, who is a Yeltsin supporter and believes that  Russian reform will succeed. It is premature to talk about a  revision of the U.S. approach to Russia. In the opinion of most  of the specialists to whom I talked during the trip, the Clinton  administration has staked too much on Yeltsin to suddenly  deprive him of support and recognize that the tone in Russia is  now set by the nationalists rather than the democrats. "We are  proceeding on the basis that the Russian Government is keeping  faith with the reform policy, does not plan to implement an  imperial policy toward its neighbors, and is geared to  cooperation with the United States," a high-ranking State  Department official stated.    Concern over Russia's relations with the other republics of  the former USSR was repeatedly evident during my meetings with  U.S. officials. They clearly indicated that, if Yeltsin and his  entourage follow the hard-line opposition's recipe in their  foreign policy (above all in resolving territorial disputes with  neighbors), the Clinton administration's approach to Russia  could change. The Americans consider the Kremlin's increasing  pressure on the Baltic states and the troop withdrawal delay  unacceptable, and, in the event of any infringement of Ukraine's  territorial integrity, Senator Graham has promised to employ  "effective economic and political measures."    But as far as the stepping up of the Kremlin's role in the  Transcaucasus and Central Asia is concerned, none of the people  I spoke to condemned Moscow -- as if tacitly admitting that the  states which have taken shape there form part of its sphere of  special interest. No longer seeing Russia as the strategic  enemy of the United States, U.S. diplomats clearly prefer  Moscow's influence in these explosive regions to be strengthened  in preference to that of fundamentalist Iran or other Islamic  states.</p>

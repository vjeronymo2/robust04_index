			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, Ramallah, from Rashid Hilal -- Dr. George  Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], has stated that, despite its  refusal to participate in the self-rule authority's security and  executive establishments, the PFLP will remain among the masses  and keep its establishments because it is part of the social  fabric of Palestinian society and its social structure. He said  that the PFLP will not take a negative stand toward the  establishments that serve the citizens but will seek to improve  them and develop their social and national acts and performance  in a way that serves our policies and views while extending the  necessary services to the citizens.    In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Dr. Habash said that  the way the Palestinian forces who reject the agreement will  confront the Palestinian self-rule authority will not go outside  the pragmatic forms which are now known to everyone --  political, and media struggle. He added: These forms will  remain valid and suitable even after the implementation of the  agreement. Any change in these forms will remain within this  framework and we will not deviate from it as a rule, unless the  Palestinian authority resorts to violence against the masses and  forces that reject the agreement. He stressed that he will not  be the first to resort to violence.    Habash noted that the loopholes in the agreement and its  inherent contradictions are not enough to bring it down, but  action is needed to turn the slogan of foiling the agreement  into a practical one. He said that the forces rejecting the  agreement are determined to formalize their opposition through  effective and influential popular, mass, and political actions.    Habash stressed that these forces will seriously work to  complete the widely based national and Islamic front and rebuild  the PLO on national, democratic, and struggle bases in  accordance with the national program and charter so as to allow  as much participation as possible by most sectors of our people  inside and outside the territories.</p>

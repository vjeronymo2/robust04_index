			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: WHEN EATING IS AN ACT OF KINDNESS  </P> <P> I am not what you would call your highly motivated dieter. There are no  reunions in sight, I am not under the gun to slim down for a beauty pageant,  and I can still cross my legs in hot weather.  </P> <P> That is not to say I don't watch what I eat. It means I acknowledge that there  are times in a person's life when turning down food is just not possible.  </P> <P> My husband and I have a little cabin about four hours north of our home. We  have traveled the road often enough to know that my kidney capacity reaches its  peak seconds after we pass into the small town of Payson, Ariz. (All of this  has been documented.) There are no public facilities, and it is too soon to buy  gas. Therefore, we must stop at a fast-food chain so I can use the restroom.  </P> <P> Am I going to march right by all those people who have bought the right to use  the restrooms? Get real. I do the honorable thing and order breakfast. I  certainly am not going to corrupt my principles and compromise my integrity for  a lousy sausage and egg on a biscuit.  </P> <P> I also eat on airlines -- for humanitarian reasons. It's not the flight  attendants' fault that the shrimp is limp and the omelet has the consistency of  a handbag. It would hurt their feelings not to take a stab at it. When you  cruise up and down those aisles watching faces frozen in horror as people bury  their food under their napkins, it gets through to you. People can take just so  much rejection. On international flights, when you're flying from one time zone  to another, I have eaten four meals in five hours. It's the only thing to do.  </P> <P> The reason I eat in hospitals is threefold. First, I am paying $800 a day for  it. Second, if you leave so much as a piece of parsley on your plate, a  nutritionist will appear at your elbow demanding to know why you don't want to  get well. And third, it's something to do between your bath and your back rub.  </P> <P> Dieters will stubbornly hold out and say that my theory is without substance.  They will contend that if you're really serious about cutting back, you will  not have regard for feelings, courtesy or even integrity. I disagree.  </P> <P> A few years ago I went to Russia to have a dialogue with Russian women on peace  between our two countries. They held a tea and brought in 50 or 60 desserts and  insisted each one be sampled. That was a great personal sacrifice for me. I  wasn't even hungry. But look what I did for all mankind!  </P></p>

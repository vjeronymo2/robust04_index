			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: Marco Polo shopped here - Further along the Silk Road, Stanley Stewart joins the heaving throng of wheeler-dealers in the ancient bazaar at Khotan FOR 2,000 YEARS the Taklamakan desert was the greatest barrier on the Silk Road to China. Entire caravans were routinely engulfed by its sands. Marco Polo described it as a 'country that looks as if it had never been traversed by man or beast.' The Silk Road skirted the Taklamakan warily, keeping to the string of oasis towns around its rim, which were visions of delight to weary travellers. Marco Polo spoke highly of one of the larger oases, Khotan, famous for its silks, its jade and its carpets. It was good to be in a part of the world where Marco Polo's recommendation still meant something, and I set off for Khotan without delay. In the pre-dawn the bus station in Kashgar was a scrum of donkey carts, beggars and passengers dwarfed by baggage. Men lashed sacks the size of garden sheds on to the roofs of the buses. Wayward camels ate their way through a bed of geraniums. Beggars patrolled the crowds, chanting the blessings of Allah, their only competition a Latin tango playing over the loudspeakers. My fellow passengers were Uyghurs, the middle men of the Silk Road, a Turkic people native to the Taklamakan basin. They are Moslems who took their religion and culture from western traders while offering obeisance to an eastern government, conveniently distant, 2,000 miles away in Beijing. The women wore bright headscarves, silk frocks and orthopaedic stockings. The men wore tall boots, coats with bright silk sashes, pretty embroidered hats and daggers on their belts. Among them were a sprinkling of Pakistanis, who come across the Karakorams, the Silk Road's other great barrier, to trade. They saw me as a natural ally in these god-forsaken parts where the natives, to their horror, knew nothing of the twin pillars of civilisation: cricket and the English language. They dealt in carpets, Thermos flasks, silks, tea sets, cheap jewellery and, less publicly, in eagles. The birds are caught in the Kunlun mountains and smuggled back to Pakistan. A protected species, they fetch a high price in the Gulf where they are used for hunting. From the bus I watched the desert gradually invade the crops of Kashgaria. Sand dunes, smooth as whales, marched into the midst of fields. Soon the road was the only mark of man, and the desert, blowing across its surface, seemed intent on consuming it as well. Away to the south was a vision of another world: the snow peaks of the Pamirs, K2 prominent among them. My neighbour was a dour fellow in a tall astrakhan hat cradling a doctor's black bag on his lap. The bag contained scraps of newspaper for rolling his cigarettes. The splendid way he rolled them was rather spoiled by the fact that they gradually fell apart as he smoked them, showering our laps with live sparks. He found me fascinating and never took his eyes off me, as if he could not imagine what I might do next. Sadly for him, I did very little besides doze and read, though he did not seem disappointed, judging by his open-mouthed astonishment. When I took out a book he lifted it silently from my hands and peered at it, incomprehending, for long minutes. Finally, he tired of me and fell asleep in my lap. Towards evening, by the time the desert had begun to seem infinite, we were suddenly among fields of corn. Water surged through irrigation ditches. Poplars showered leaves down through the bars of sunlight and shade. The bus scattered a group of women, seated in the middle of the road eating melon. The town of Khotan comes in two parts: the new and the old, the Chinese and the Uyghur. The Chinese population is small but the imprint of Chinese rule is unmistakable in the wide boulevards, the municipal buildings, the civic order of the new town. I descended with relief into the old Uyghur town, crowded, chaotic, lively. The air smelt of grilling kebabs and the streets were unruly with camels, donkey carts and errant cyclists. Chief among the latter were the Pakistanis. Cycling, the primary means of transportation in China, was new to them, and one of the sights of Khotan was the Pakistanis bumping into trees. In the early years of this century Khotan was one of the destinations of a remarkable archaeological race when Europeans vied with each other to uncover the lost cities and art treasures of the Silk Road. Crates of booty were taken across the Karakorams to the museums of Europe. Presumably it is the fear of further depradations that keeps the small museum in Khotan closed much of the time. The note on the door - 'Welcome to your visit', pencilled in English - had a faintly mocking tone. The lobby walls were decorated with cartoons depicting evil-looking foreigners extracting antiquities from unwitting peasants. A small crowd gathered to see if I recognised myself. Carpets, jade and silk are still part of the local economy. Jade caravans no longer set off for the imperial court at Beijing but local craftsmen produce exquisite jewellery and carvings. Khotan has become one of China's chief centres of silk production, a status befitting a town that proved the key to carrying the secret of silk to the West. For centuries the Chinese had guarded the process jealously. In 440 AD a Chinese princess was betrothed to the ruler of Khotan. Horrified at leaving sericulture behind, she smuggled silkworm eggs past the border guards by hiding them in her headdress. A century later Nestorian monks brought silkworms from Khotan to Byzantium. Some of today's silk goes into Khotan's carpets which are much sought after throughout Central Asia. Export is growing rapidly to Japan and Europe, but in Khotan you can stroll through the bazaar, take tea with a carpet-seller and bargain over the price while joking with his grandchildren. The atmosphere of the Silk Road survives in the weekly bazaar where you can buy anything from a cradle to a camel. By morning the crowds are almost impenetrable. In Hat Alley bearded patriarchs go from stall to stall, settling fur-rimmed creations on to their shaven heads for the approval of friends. Veiled women bargain for pink negligees. Between the horse-shoe sellers and the inner tube salesmen was the paint department where a row of old men, their beards stained with colour, spooned little piles of powdered colour on to squares of newspaper. Harness sellers displayed horse collars with tall scarlet plumes while carpenters sold wardrobes that resembled gaudy juke-boxes. Wizened apothecaries presided over mysterious displays of roots, ground bones and animal horns. The horse market was a racecourse. Prospective buyers, keen to test-drive the goods, galloped them round a circuit, swerving their mounts this way and that to test their responsiveness. A mule of particular unresponsiveness upset three melon carts and galloped off through the crowd bearing an elderly gentlemen. Neither was seen again. The most sought-after goods in the bazaar were among the most worthless. The Pakistani traders had brought sacks of cheap costume jewellery with them and the fever among the local women for these baubles was incredible They fought to get their hands on them. The traders were frequently obliged to flee when the crush became too great. I found one cowering in the timber-yard, trying to catch his breath before another onslaught. 'Business is good', I said. He shrugged. 'What is common in one place becomes a great rarity somewhere else.' It is what brought Marco Polo to Khotan, and what kept the Silk Road open, against the toughest geographical odds, for more than 2,000 years. Daily buses run between Kashgar and Khotan. The run is long, about 12 hours, and the buses uncomfortable. The journey can be broken at Yarkand. The less adventuresome may prefer to fly from Aksu (an hour's bus journey from Kashgar) or from the capital of Sinkiang, Urumchi. The Khotan Hotel is of international standard, while the No 1 Guesthouse is comfortable but more spartan. Both have restaurants. The bazaar takes place on Sundays. The China International Tourist Office in Khotan can supply English-speaking guides. Stanley Stewart is the author of Old Serpent Nile: A Journey to the Source, published by John Murray (Pounds 16.95). His book about his journey along the Silk Road will be published by the same house later this year.</p>

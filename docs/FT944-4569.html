			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Di Pietro has had enough, perhaps: Robert Graham looks at the motivations behind this week's decision by Italy's best-known anti-corruption magistrate to quit his job Resignations in Italy are usually threats and rarely final. Thus, Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate, has kept everyone guessing by stripping off his 'toga' in court on Tuesday and announcing his resignation. His departure will not become final until January, giving him plenty of time to heed the chorus urging him to remain a magistrate. If Mr Di Pietro intended a dramatic demonstration of his frustration with the increasing political difficulties of investigating corruption in sensitive areas of Italian life, then he has already achieved his aim. This policeman who studied at night to become a magistrate, and who has revolutionised investigative work through computerisation, has elicited a huge groundswell of public support. Even President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has urged him to reconsider his decision. Milan magistrates have already used the resignation threat successfully before against Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government. In July, they forced the justice ministry to withdraw legislation curbing magistrates' powers of preventive detention by announcing their collective resignations - the announcement was made by Mr Di Pietro. This time, however, he has presented himself more as a victim and the message behind his resignation letter is more ambiguous. He complained that he could no longer work as he had become a sort of political football, kicked around by a self-seeking government and opposition. Clearly there was an element of weariness and personal pique. But there is sound evidence to back his complaint about the increasingly politicised atmosphere surrounding his anti-corruption investigations, which includes Mr Berlusconi as head of his Fininvest empire. The government has sent justice ministry inspectors to Milan to check claims that the magistrates have abused their authority. It is unprecedented for a government to conduct such an investigation into inquiries which are still in progress; and the action is all the more questionable because those inquiries concern the prime minister himself. Mr Di Pietro was also one of those most affected by last month's appeal court decision to switch a key investigation to nearby Brescia on the grounds that the rights of the accused were not properly guaranteed. This investigation was into the widespread practice of businesses bribing the Guardia di Finanza financial police to ensure benign tax inspections. It also involved Fininvest - and, as a result, the legal status of Milan's impending interrogation (it probably have been by Mr Di Pietro) of Mr Berlusconi in this respect is in doubt. But if Mr Di Pietro is now crying foul over government attempts to block his investigations, he can scarcely pretend that his actions have not been political. He has not protested about the deliberate leaks of information discrediting an entire political class since he made his first corruption arrest in February 1992 in what have come to be known as the 'clean hands' investigations. He has appeared to enjoy his celebrity. In September, he chose an invitation to the annual businessmen's meeting at Cernobbio near Milan to launch his ideas about reaching a political solution to the clean hands corruption inquiries. The ideas fell on deaf ears largely because politicians in both the government and opposition felt the move should come from parliament, not the magistrature. He was said to have been very bitter about the loss of this opportunity to tackle what remains a huge unresolved problem: How do the justice system and Italy's institutions come to terms with corruption when it is all pervasive? Can the investigations be open-ended and therefore never-ending? This is one of the issues highlighted now. Mr Di Pietro has been instrumental in proving the existence of corruption. Indeed, his resignation came after he had asked for prison sentences on 24 businessmen and politicians, including all five leaders of the parties in the previous Christian Democrat-led coalitions. But sooner or later the government and parliament have to decide how long it is feasible for these investigations go on without risking destabilising the country permanently. The earlier Amato government nearly fell on this issue because legislation looked like a pardon for all those found guilty of corruption. The same happened in July when legislation curbing the magistrates' powers of preventive detention was seen as a sell-out to corrupt politicians. If Mr Di Pietro's resignation is also seen as a protest against such a sell-out, it complicates the finding of a political solution to 'clean hands'. But even if Mr Di Pietro genuinely leaves his job, he will still have a role to play. He cannot return to being a simple citizen in his native southern Italy. Now, more than ever, he is a national figure with enormous political weight: a prize to be poached by any party or government. Mr Berlusconi realised this when he vainly courted him in May for the interior portfolio.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Romania emerges from a long winter: The economic situation is improving despite political setbacks THE International Monetary Fund's decision last month to grant Romania a stand-by credit of Dollars 500m and World Bank agreement on a Dollars 400m loan for 1992-3 are proof that the country's economic situation is improving, even while it continues to struggle with the issue of electoral legislation. Romania has stabilised considerably since September when three days of miner-led riots in Bucharest toppled Mr Petre Roman's reformist government. In contrast, this winter was marked by an absence of unrest with few work stoppages or popular protests, despite the further erosion of living standards experienced by most Romanians. Romania has also begun to receive more support from the outside world, after two years of diplomatic isolation. Last month, talks began for Romania's associate membership of the European Community, while the country has recently signed bilateral treaties with Germany, Greece and several former Soviet republics. Above all, US-Romanian relations have improved, culminating in last month's visit by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, the most senior US official to visit Romania since early 1990. But perhaps the greatest reason for increased optimism is that the government, led since October by Mr Theodor Stolojan, an economist, has begun to tackle economic reform once more. In recent weeks, the government has unveiled a new economic strategy, drawn up with the help of the IMF, which withheld its final tranche of credit last year. The immediate goal is to stabilise the economy which is performing at below 65 per cent of 1989 levels. More specifically, the new strategy aims to halt the decline in production; control inflation which has averaged more than 14 per cent per month so far this year; and build up the country's gold and hard currency reserves, currently at a little below Dollars 1bn, ahead of next winter's fuel imports which this year cost the country around Dollars 500m per month. So far, the government appears to be putting its strategy into practice, albeit slowly. In the past month the national bank has raised interest rates from 28 per cent to 80 per cent, ended restrictions on companies' hard currency holdings and begun to devalue the leu, the national currency. However, while Romania's position has undoubtedly improved, any optimism is tempered by a look to the immediate future. Rising unemployment is liable to increase social tensions. As the government admits, its anti-inflationary policies will at least double unemployment to more than 1m, or around 12 per cent of the workforce, by the end of the year. For many Romanians, with average real incomes already reduced by more than 30 per cent since 1989, the months ahead will be even more difficult. In the meantime, the political outlook is discouraging. A dispute between the government and parliament over the timing of general elections (which should have been held before May 20) resulted this week in a parliamentary rejection of electoral legislation. Romania is now unlikely to hold elections before October. The decision comes as a blow to Mr Stolojan, a non-partisan, caretaker prime minister, who has won support for his economic policies but has been unable to convince an increasingly divided parliament of the need for electoral legislation. Until elections take place, there is unlikely to be a significant upturn in foreign investment, which on March 31 had only reached Dollars 188m in the period since January 1990. Nor are donor countries expected to pay up pledged credits and aid of more than Dollars 2bn for 1992, money the country desperately needs to undertake further reform. At the same time, parliament's in-fighting has held up legislation critical for reform. The country is still without an adequate bankruptcy law or legislation to re-establish a stock exchange, while delays in passing new foreign investment regulations are holding up an important exploration deal involving four western oil companies. Meanwhile, Mr Stolojan, who is not expected to stay in politics, courageously soldiers on. He says he is implementing his strategy ahead of the elections because it represents the only course of action available. But the questions remain. Future governments, faced with one of eastern Europe's weakest economies and high unemployment, may not have the strength to continue what he has started.</p>

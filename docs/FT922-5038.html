			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Solicitors face levy to meet sharp rise in fraud claims SOLICITORS IN England and Wales face a special levy of more than Pounds 1,000 this autumn on top of their annual insurance premiums to meet a big increase in professional fraud claims. The Law Society, the solicitors' governing body, also proposes tough restrictions on the right of solicitors to practise on their own. Dishonest sole practitioners are largely responsible for the rise in payments made by the profession's compensation fund from Pounds 11.7m last year to an estimated Pounds 20m this year. Much of the increase in claims stems from the increase in mortgage fraud involving solicitors. The Metropolitan Police have put the value of mortgage fraud involving solicitors at more than Pounds 1bn. The society disputes that figure. The compensation fund was set up by the society to meet claims - not covered by professional indemnity insurance - that result from the dishonest conduct of sole practitioners and cases where all partners of a firm have been dishonest. The profession already has to raise Pounds 178m this year for the solicitors' indemnity fund. To meet the growing cost of dishonest solicitors, the society is proposing to raise Pounds 50m for the fund this year. Solicitors who hold clients' money - partners - will each have to pay at least Pounds 1,591 made up of an annual contribution of Pounds 600 plus a special levy when they renew their practising certificates this autumn. Contributions to the indemnity fund will also rise significantly in the autumn. The contributions of sole practitioners will rise by 31 per cent and those of two-partner and three-partner firms by 18 per cent, while the contributions of most larger firms will remain the same. Sole practitioners will in future face bi-annual accounts checks by the society and restrictions on their right to handle clients' money. The society will also vote later this week on whether to cap payments out of the compensation fund at Pounds 50,000. The society is not keen to cap the fund in relation to private clients, as it feels that would be a public-relations disaster. It is considering a cap on payments to banks and building societies arising out of dishonest conduct by solicitors, on the ground that institutions should be more aware than individuals of the risks involved.</p>

TQ94&hyph;2&hyph;23&hyph;000 and TM94&hyph;4&hyph;23&hyph;000. Such reduction in the CD commodity sales rate and increase in the demand sales rate are due to (1) lower prices being paid to Eastern Shore's suppliers under its market responsive gas supply contracts and (2) an increase in demand-related costs from upstream suppliers due to a revision in their Gas Research Institute (GRI) Charge effective January 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eastern Shore states that copies of the filing have been served upon its jurisdictional customers and interested State Commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 and Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests shall be filed on or before January 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Takeover will leave workers out of pocket RJB MINING, the private Nottinghamshire mining company, yesterday made a formal offer to take over Monktonhall Mineworkers, the miners' consortium which operates a pit near Edinburgh, for Pounds 167,000. The 167 members of the consortium, who each paid Pounds 10,000 for their share, are being offered Pounds 1,000 per share. The board of Monktonhall is recommending the miners to accept the offer. It is telling them that if they do not do so the company will go into liquidation. It lost Pounds 3.7m in the year ended May 31 and has net liabilities of Pounds 2m. The offer from RJB Mining, which was floated on the stock exchange in June, is likely to end the shortlived coal miners' consortium which leased Monktonhall from British Coal last year. It was undercapitalised and suffered initial production difficulties in spite of having contracts to sell its output. The takeover would avert liquidation but would mean Bank of Scotland, the secured creditor, writing off Pounds 1.8m. RJB would invest Pounds 3m in developing Monktonhall and expect to receive a subsidy from the Department of Trade and Industry. Lothian regional council, which refused to help Monktonhall Mineworkers when it was formed, would provide a subsidy. Scottish Power would remain Monktonhall's main customer. The directors of Monktonhall Mineworkers will resign if the offer is accepted and Mr Bert Brown, the managing director, will leave. RJB would offer shareholders who took voluntary severance the sum of Pounds 3,000. Those who remained employees would have a production-related bonus scheme which, if targets were met, would mean payments of up to Pounds 3,000 for next year and a further Pounds 1,000 for 1995. RJB expects to retain almost all the current workforce 182 men. The miners have until November 18 to decide on the offer. RJB is insisting on a 90 per cent level of acceptance to make the offer valid. Mr Jackie Aitchison, chairman of Monktonhall, said it was disappointing that Monktonhall had not been able to go it alone. He refused to say whether anyone had let the consortium down, or comment on the fact that the DTI and Lothian region, which were now offering finance, had previously refused it. For RJB the purchase of Monktonhall, which has current capacity of 300,000 tonnes a year, is a chance to expand its deep-mined output.</p>

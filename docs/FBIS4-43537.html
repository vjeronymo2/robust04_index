This decision, which was  made around 4 PM [1400 GMT] during an audience in the Villa  Vauban [residence of the Grand Duke], had been preceded in the  morning and in the afternoon by separate consultative  discussions between the Grand Duke and the party chairmen Ben  Fayot (LSAP) [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg], Charles  Goerens (DP) [Democratic Party], and Robert Mehlen (ADR) [Action  Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness], and with Jup  Weber (GLEI-GAP) [Green Ecologist Initiative List/The Green  Alternative].    This very afternoon Jacques Santer is holding exploratory  talks first with the DP and then with the LSAP. Early this  evening he will then convene the expanded CSV [Christian Social  People's Party] national council in the metropolitan "Carrefour"  (Convict Center) in order to decide which of the two parties is  to be invited to enter into coalition negotiations. On Friday  [17 June], the day after tomorrow, the Prime Minister will  submit an interim report on the development to the Grand Duke,  after which the actual coalition negotiations could start as  early as Saturday. Despite certain timetable obligations on the  part of various government members, these could be pushed ahead  swiftly and brought to a conclusion towards the middle of July.  [passage omitted]</p>

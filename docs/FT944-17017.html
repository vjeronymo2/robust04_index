			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Sugar daddies of the technology colleges / A look at how a government initiative gets its funding Children at St Aidan's high school in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, will soon have a new network of 50 computers for lessons ranging from drama to geography, thanks to a government initiative to attract sponsorship of educational technology. St Aidan's is among 50 so-called technology colleges, the latest of which were announced yesterday by the Department for Education. All have been set up since February as a result of an unusual partnership between government ministers and Sir Cyril Taylor, a radical educationalist who is chairman of the City Technology Colleges Trust. While Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, caught the headlines with the announcement of eight more colleges, all of them existing secondary schools, Sir Cyril has been responsible for much of the less visible activity. Sir Cyril, a former Procter &amp; Gamble advertising manager, served in the 1950s with the King's African Rifles in Kenya against the Mau Mau guerrillas. Nowadays he is battling to promote science and technology teaching through greater involvement by business. In recent months he has organised and paid for a series of dinners at London's solidly Conservative Carlton Club to tell small groups of business leaders about the aims behind technology colleges. Mrs Shephard was to have attended the latest one, held last month, but fell ill and her place was taken by Mr Robin Squire, the schools minister. Previous dinners have been attended by Mr John Patten, the former education secretary who lost his job in the summer ministerial reshuffle. The guests on these occasions have included Mr Steve Grigg, education and strategic liaison director at British Aerospace, a strong supporter of closer links between industry and schools. BAe is putting Pounds 150,000 into two technology colleges - one of them St Aidan's - while backing relatively small scale projects at a further 40 or so schools. Mr Grigg said: 'The dinners are not about cadging people to become sponsors but are a way to promote discussion about bringing companies closer to education to help UK Ltd.' Less enthusiastic about technology colleges is Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman of food and drink maker Cadbury Schweppes and who was at last month's dinner. Mr Cadbury said his company 'had chosen a different route' for spending money on schools, by concentrating on projects involving a range of schools mainly in the Birmingham area. Sir Cyril is described by a friend as 'a brilliant educational entrepreneur  -someone who likes to get things done'. In the early 1960s he set up the American Institute for Foreign Study, a private company which arranges student transfers to and from the US. He started the CTC Trust, a charity, in 1987. Since then he has been informal adviser to a series of Conservative education secretaries. He is on friendly terms with Mr John Major, the prime minister, with whom he and other leading business people had dinner earlier this year. When the trust first started its brief was to help promote city technology colleges, a series of 15 purpose-built new schools funded by private sponsors with large amounts of cash, typically Pounds 1m per school. In the past year the trust has redirected its energies towards attracting sponsors for the more modest series of technology colleges. The trust has a grant of Pounds 300,000 a year from the education department. Sir Cyril said the trust had had 'a very high success rate' in targeting companies which later became sponsors of colleges. The colleges were an 'extremely cost efficient investment'. Asked about the dinners, Sir Cyril did not want to disclose his guests but last month's gathering included representatives from US computer companies Intel and Oracle, New York investment bankers Salomon Brothers, North West Water and Rolls-Royce. The 50 technology colleges set up so far have all arranged at least Pounds 100,000 of private funding from a total of more than 120 companies, charities or private donors. In each case the school has had an equivalent amount of cash from the education department. The money goes on capital projects such as new laboratories and computers, while the government also provides a small yearly grant for extra revenue costs. Corporate backers have included ICL, Midland Bank, Tate &amp; Lyle, National Westminster Bank, Apricot Computers and Thames Water. Not all the companies Sir Cyril has talked to have proved receptive. One criticism - voiced by Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of food maker Northern Foods and who was at last month's Carlton Club dinner - is that the government is seeking extra funds from corporate sponsors to help reduce the load of schools funding on the taxpayer. More bullish is Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of electrical goods retailer Dixons, and another dinner guest in recent months. Mr Kalms's company put Pounds 2m into a City Technology College in Bradford, Yorkshire and more recently he contributed Pounds 100,000 of his own money to two technology colleges in northern England.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Philippine acquisition by MUI Malayan United Industries, (MUI), a Malaysian-based conglomerate with holdings in hotels, trading, property and newspaper concerns, is continuing its regional buying spree by purchasing a 'significant stake' in Shangri-La Properties (SLPI), a loss-making Philippine property company. The acquisition, worth at least MDollars 30.4m (USDollars 11.7m), marks the fourth overseas venture by MUI since selling its Malaysian banking and financial concerns to the Malaysian-based Hong Leong group last January for MDollars 1.1bn. SLPI owns 8.7 hectares of prime business land in Manila, including the Shangri-La hotel and shopping mall. MUI has agreed to purchase at least 55 per cent of SLPI's proposed Peso 1.12bn (Dollars 41m) rights issue, as well as any remaining shares not taken up by investors, leaving MUI with a stake of between 21.67 and 39.41 per cent. Proceeds from the rights issue will be used to retire debt, paving the way for further office building and condominium development. MUI said the SLPI purchase would provide it with a vehicle for the group's expansion plans in the Philippines. MUI is controlled by Tan Sri Khoo Kay Peng, a reclusive Malaysian-Chinese businessman and close business associate of Mr Robert Kuok, another Malaysian Chinese regarded as one of south-east Asia's richest businessmen and who controls about one-quarter of SLPI. Since last December Mr Khoo has made substantial investments in two Kuok-controlled companies - the South China Morning Post (Holdings), the Hong Kong publisher, and Kerry Financial Services, a Hong Kong finance company. The other major shareholder of SLPI is Philippine tycoon Mr Alfredo Ramos, who controls 39.1 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Samret Sar: "The Logging War in Koh Kong </F> Province Has Not Ended Yet. Who Should Be Responsible?"]    [Text] According to a report from Koh Kong Province, in an  operation launched on the night of 8 June, the combined  ministerial team for cracking down on illegal smuggling along  the Sre Ambel Pass held up a barge trying to smuggle processed  wood out of the country.    The head of the team reported: While we were holding up the  barge, three motor boats from Koh Kong Province's combined team  (one of which belongs to the provincial office of forestry and  wildlife) led by Ung Voan, second deputy governor of Koh Kong,  surrounded the inter-ministerial team's motor boat, directing  all their spotlights on it as a threat. Seeing that it was  outnumbered by the Koh Kong provincial team, the combined  ministerial team then released the timber barge.    The report added that the inter-ministerial team also saw 22  other timber barges tagging after the provincial boats out of  that area.    This is the second time this week that the Koh Kong  provincial team helped the timber barges get out of Andong Toek  area, claiming that it would take action against the barges  after bringing them to Koh Kong Province. In the first event on  4 June, the Koh Kong team brought 12 barges carrying about 400  cubic meters of processed wood out of this area, claiming that  it would take action against the barges when they returned to  Koh Kong Province. But not a single timber barge was seen in  Koh Kong. When asked about it, the provincial team said that  all the barges fled along the way.    The report said that these 23 barges carried a total of 750  cubic meters of processed wood.    The sources of the inter-ministerial team reported that the  timber carried in the 23 barges were worth about 5,500,000 Thai  baht or 750 million riel.    It is not yet known whether this second batch of timber  barges will arrive in Koh Kong or not since the first batch  already failed to arrive. And if they do not arrive there,  what measures will the Ministry of Interior take against Mr. Ung  Voan?    The logging war in Koh Kong Province is still going on so  terrifyingly. The bad consequences of such anarchy will only  cause more complicated problems and distrust.    Those who have kept a close watch on this matter say: In  such a situation, who will listen to whom and who is to be  responsible for all the bad consequences?</p>

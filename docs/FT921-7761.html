			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Coal director warns of drop in sales BRITISH COAL'S sales to the electricity industry could drop from 65m to 25m tonnes by 1996, Mr Malcolm Edwards, the company's commercial director, told the Commons energy committee yesterday. This was because of the threat to coal-fired power stations from the many new gas-fired power stations being built in England and Wales. The sales cut would force British Coal to reduce the number of pits from about 50 to even fewer than the 14 that NM Rothschild, the government's advisers on the British Coal privatisation, have estimated would survive. Mr Edwards' appearance before MPs followed controversial efforts by the British Coal chairman to dismiss him. Although Mr Edwards is still officially BC's commercial director, he is expected to leave the company when his lawyers have settled terms. Mr Edwards said coal imports, the subsidised nuclear industry and other fuels were also threats to British Coal. If the government removed the advantages these other fuels enjoyed, British Coal could still win a five-year contract to sell 50m tonnes of coal to the electricity generators. He said British Coal could help itself by cutting costs and prices to the electricity industry. However, he said, the price should not fall below Pounds 1.60 per gigajoule, compared with Pounds 1.85 today. Although imports were only around Pounds 1.35 per gigajoule, UK coal offered better security without exchange rate risk. It was unlikely that British Coal would lose all its sales to gas and imported coal. 'I'd say the centre of gravity for demand for British Coal was closer to 25m tonnes,' he said. This compares with the 30m to 35m tonnes predicted by NM Rothschild. Mr Edwards also said there was no economic justification for building many of the new gas stations because the power they would produce would be expensive at 2.9p per unit compared with 1.8p to 2.2p at existing coal stations. The reason they were able to go ahead in spite of being uncompetitive was because they were backed by long-term contracts to sell power to the 12 regional electricity companies which buy power from generators and sell to customers, and so did not have to compete in the market place. The reason the regional electricity companies had been anxious to back independent generation projects was to gain bargaining power with the two big generators, National Power and PowerGen, Mr Edwards said. National Power and PowerGen had then felt obliged to build gas stations to defend their market share. The industry would be relieved if this competitive investment in gas could be stopped, he believed. British Coal said yesterday that it welcomed Mr Edwards' warnings about the 'dash for gas'. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman for a year, had 'made it plain that all electricity users stand to lose from excessive and unnecessary investment in new gas-fired stations', the company said.

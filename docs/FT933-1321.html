			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / La Generale may use cash from cement sale for acquisitions HEIDELBERGER Zement, Germany's largest producer of building materials, has bought a 43 per cent stake in CBR, the Belgian cement company, triggering a BFr53bn (Pounds 1bn) offer for the whole company. If the deal is approved by competition authorities, the merged group will be the fourth largest building materials company in Europe, with annual turnover of DM5.23bn (Pounds 2bn). Heidelberger agreed to buy the stake from Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, which has been trying to reduce its exposure to cyclical industrial stocks. Viscount Etienne Davignon, chairman of La Generale, said the cash raised by the sale of the CBR stake would be held in reserve for possible acquisitions. 'It's clearly not a cushion (against recession) and we don't intend to put it into bits and pieces,' he said. Mr Davignon added that without the additional money, La Generale had been unable to fulfil its ambition to be an active 'professional investor' in its businesses. The German group said that it was seeking a majority stake in CBR, but it wanted to maintain its stock market listing, and allow it to develop as 'an independently managed Belgian-Dutch company with a large independent shareholder base'. The German company is paying BFr22.5bn for La Generale's shares, at BFr11,750 each. That compares with the price of BFr11,475 at which CBR's shares were suspended on the Brussels bourse two days ago. The shares remained frozen yesterday. La Generale's shares fell BFr100 to close at BFr2,490 and in Frankfurt Heidelberger was suspended at DM1,090. Under Brussels stock exchange rules, Heidelberger must offer at least BFr11,750 to other shareholders. Mr Peter Schuhmacher, Heidelberger chairman, said both companies were efficient and modern and recent investments would bear fruit immediately. Heidelberger produces a wider range of building materials than CBR, which concentrates on cement, aggregates and concrete. La Generale sees the financial and services sectors as its main source of profit. The CBR stake accounted for about 9.6 per cent of the value of the Belgian group's portfolio at end-June.

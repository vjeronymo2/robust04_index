			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WIDENED TRADE DEFICIT SENDS DOW DOWN 8.73  </P> <P> Wall Street closed lower in quiet trading today, as weaker trade figures hurt  stocks, bonds and the dollar.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 8.73 points to 2,544.76.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 7 to 5 on the New York  Stock Exchange, with 618 up, 865 down and 519 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 152.35 million shares, against 131.96 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index fell 0.46 to 184.91.  </P> <P> The trade deficit widened 23.6% to $10.24 billion in May on a surge in imports.  The strong demand raised concerns that the Federal Reserve may not be able to  ease credit further, triggering a rise in credit market interest rates.  </P> <P> But stock market losses were small, with a recent rise in takeover activity  lending support. The most actively traded stock was Marion Laboratories Inc.,  which agreed earlier in the day to be acquired by Dow Chemical Co.  </P> <P> News of the jump in the trade deficit jolted the bond market this morning,  depressing prices and pushing up short-term interest rates for the second  straight day.  </P> <P> A rising trade deficit signals faster economic growth and therefore higher  inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income holdings such as bonds, and  puts pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to constrict borrowing to slow the  economy down.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which lost 1/2 point or $5 per $1,000 face  amount Monday, fell another 1/2 point by late morning. Its yield, which moves  inversely to price, rose to 8.17% from 8.12% late Monday.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  fell about 3/16 point, intermediate maturities fell 5/16 point and long-term  issues fell about 1/2 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service  reported.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 2.67 to 1,183.65.  </P> <P> Industrial and utility corporate bonds also weakened. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures returns on a portfolio of 80 corporate  bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.68 to 329.31.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.17% as the discount rose 5 basis  points from the level at auction Monday to 7.91%. Yields on six-month bills  rose to 8.16% as the discount rose 8 basis points from the level at auction  Monday to 7.74%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.02% as the discount rose 5  basis points to 7.48%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 9 1/4%, unchanged from late Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (9): Easing the difficulties - Paris PARIS can seem a difficult city in which to do business because neither it nor its inhabitants like making concessions to foreigners. But there is no need to be dismayed by the off-handed approach of average Parisians, or by the city's famous traffic jams. The visiting business traveller can easily manage by following three general tips - for getting around, finding hotel accommodation and for eating. Transport: Wherever possible, travel by metro. This is an efficient and very cheap way of avoiding the hair-raising experience of Paris traffic, even though taxis are also cheap by European standards. Within the city boundaries, a metro stop is never more than 500 metres or so away and trains pass every 90 seconds at peak hours. This means you can guarantee to cross the city in around 20 minutes. Few taxi drivers can legally beat that, at least not in business hours. That leaves you with the problem of finding your way to meetings by foot from your metro stop. The best map is the pocket version of the aptly named L'Indispensable, available in stationers everywhere. The principle of Paris street lay-outs is simple: numbers ascend in the direction of the flow of the Seine (east to west) in streets parallel with the river, or start with low numbers near the river to high ones further from it, in streets perpendicular to the Seine. In both cases, odd numbers on the left, evens on the right. Hotels: Avoid the standard international chains - that would be a waste of a visit to Paris and could damagingly indicate to French business contacts that you are out of touch. It is possible to put yourself up with style and taste in almost any price range, from the 1,400 hotels in the city. To start at the top, there is the Ritz in Place Vendome (former home to Hemingway and Coco Chanel), Plaza Athenee in Avenue Montaigne for the better sort of media folk, or the Crillon, next door to the US embassy on Place de la Concorde for glitterati of all types. For more sensible budgets, the recently refurbished Montalembert, just off rue de Bac on the left bank, is admired by the designer crowd, or there is L'Hotel, a temple of Art Deco in rue des Beaux Arts, where Oscar Wilde eked out his last days. Pavillon de la Reine, near the fictional site of Inspector Maigret's flat just off Place des Vosges has great charm. For travellers paying for their own accommodation, the best strategy is to go for one of the several score of picturesque small hotels around the back streets of Saint Germain or on the Ile Saint Louis. Food: Choosing a restaurant suited to your guests' taste and your own budget is probably easier than in most cities, because more detailed guide books have been written on eateries in Paris than most European capitals. The key is to leave enough time to do some homework. The Michelin rosette system is quite a good guide to quality, and accurate on prices, though it is a good idea to get a second opinion from another good guide, like the - often more critical - Gault Millau. Any good hotel should have both volumes. Any hotel proprietor worth his salt will be happy to provide advice, because food is a serious subject in Paris. Here are a few personal favourites: Le Grand Vefour in Palais Royal, for a lovely 18th Century interior and a menu that more than merits its two Michelin rosettes; Chez Pauline in nearby rue Villedo for unpretentious Lyonnaise cooking, a fine range of Armagnacs and a pleasant atmosphere; or Chez Georges in rue du Mail for an up-market bistro.</p>

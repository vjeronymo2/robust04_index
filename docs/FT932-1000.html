			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / SocGen and BNP hit by Ferruzzi SOCIETE GENERALE and Banque Nationale de Paris are two of the foreign banks most heavily exposed to Ferruzzi, the diversified Italian industrial group, which owes foreign lenders about L6,500bn (Pounds 2.8bn). French banks, which also include Credit Lyonnais, figure among the biggest of Ferruzzi's foreign creditors because of loans to Eridania Beghin-Say, the group's Paris-based agro-industrial business. EBS had net debts of FFr14bn (Pounds 1.67bn) at the end of last year, while the ratio of its net debts to equity was 88 per cent. Some French banks also lent directly to the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company. Details of the group's bank credits remain secret. The local heads of both French banks were in discussions, believed to be about the Ferruzzi crisis. The talks on Ferruzzi's borrowings came amid signs of a rapprochement between the group's five main Italian creditor banks, handling the restructuring, and leading foreign lenders. Mr Guido Rosa, the local head of Societe Generale, who is also chairman of the foreign banks' association in Italy, is expected to be one of possibly two foreign bankers who may be co-opted on to the five-bank committee. Separately, further details have emerged about the Italian banks' exposure. Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of the members of the five-bank committee, is thought to have lent about L1,000bn, while Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the big treasury-owned bank, which is not on the committee, is thought to have lent slightly less. Attempts to uncover the extent of banks' exposure have been accompanied by efforts by some creditor banks to distinguish between lending to Ferruzzi's profitable operating subsidiaries, which have strong cash flows, and Ferfin. The bulk of lending by Citibank is tied to the operating subsidiaries. Most of the bank's positions in the syndicated loans it arranged were sold on to other institutions. Citibank's overall exposure to the Ferruzzi group is now more than L100bn. Among other foreign banks believed to have lent heavily are Union Bank of Switzerland and some big German banks.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Arts: A new piano to conquer - Weekend concerts in London The renewed Wigmore Hall boasts a gleaming new Bosendorfer, grand as could be and sumptuous in tone. It sounds as though visiting pianists will need some time to master the beast: even Gyorgy Fischer, a week ago, had trouble keeping Rossini's lightest accompaniments from challenging Cecilia Bartoli's light mezzo. On Friday, Imogen Cooper put her best foot forward in one of Schubert's enchanting chains of 'German dances', D. 783, and in five Smetana polkas. For Schubert she got the instrument to sing, and her Smetana pranced and careened with a good measure of unbuttoned cheerfulness. Janacek's Sonata 1: X: 1905, a stark torso, had some intense feeling, though it moved a bit stiffly. His sudden black gestures of rage and protest are no part of Miss Cooper's natural mode. Schubert's limpid devices, however, are - or ought to be; and it was sad to hear the great B-flat Sonata, D. 960, emerging so shyly and wanly from her instrument. Every bar of it bespoke an intelligent musician with a deep (even paralysing?) respect for the music, but they added up to a performance very short of depth, breadth or specific gravity. The Scherzo and the Finale plucked up a little courage, but too late. In her anxiety not to let the piano roar, one suspected, she had reduced it to an anaemic mumble. It was not enhanced by her chosen preface, Schoenberg's Six Little Pieces op. 19 (for which she decreed that there should be no applause): after exemplary recent performances by Katharina Wolpe and Mitsuko Uchida, cleanly etched and taut, Miss Cooper's watercolours sounded just well-meant and over-pedalled. On the following evening the Domus piano quartet were unquenchably lively in Mozart - particularly in the boy-composer's 'concerto' adaptation, K107/2, of a JC Bach keyboard sonata - and Richard Strauss. As usual, Susan Tomes' bright fingers lent fine point and rhythmic electricity to the 18th-century exercise, and all four players between them solved whatever problems of balance there may be in Strauss's early, lusty C minor Quartet. But for three or four passages that want a franker warmth than comes easily to Domus, whose precise tingle is on the brittle side, this was a performance of impeccable spirit. The showpiece of the concert was meant nevertheless to be the long-forgotten piano-quartet version of Mozart's inspired E-flat Quintet for piano and winds, K. 452. It may or may not be from Mozart's own hand; probably not, but it was creatively rewritten for the alternate medium, and actually published before the original was. The loss of the bold wind-colours is plain, of course - but the performance here was no fair test of the success of the more homogeneous score, which was not conceived for anything like a modern grand piano. A lighter period instrument was sorely missed. Miss Tomes did not overplay, quite the contrary; and yet the string trio was reduced almost to marginal wittering, with the result that the most striking effects of the wind-version were all too conspicuous by their absence. Mozart's two 'real' piano-quartets are designed to give the solo instrument its head. In the Quintet with forward winds the jovial competition is much more even, whereas the string-version supplies the piano with only tame foils. I want to hear Domus play it with Miss Tomes at, say, the keyboard of an old Broadwood.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 8 (XINHUA) -- Hsu Hui-yu, deputy  secretary-general of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF), and his party arrived in Hangzhou, capital of  Zhejiang Province, this afternoon.    At the invitation of the mainland's Association for  Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), Hsu and his party, including  some experts, have come to Zhejiang to inquire into the Qiandao  Lake incident. They were met by ARATS officials at the airport.    The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Chunan  County  on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat and the  robbery and murder of 32 tourists from Taiwan and the mainland.  Of the dead, 24 were from Taiwan.    The 21-member SEF party has nine SEF officials, six experts,  five relatives of the victims and one travel agency official.    Li Yafei, deputy secretary-general of ARATS, will preside  over a meeting to invite mainland inspectors handling the case  to inform the SEF party of the case.    Arrangements will be made for the SEF party to join an  investigation tour on Qiandao Lake and visit relatives of  mainland victims of the crime.    The appropriate departments of Zhejiang Province will also  listen to comments from relatives of the Taiwan victims.    At the airport, Hsu Hui-yu stressed that the purpose of his  party's trip to Zhejiang is to learn about the progress of the  mainland's handling of the case.    He said, "We will raise our questions from an objective,  rational and professional angle."    He said that the tragedy shocked the people across the  straits and only by healing the wound promptly can the relations  across the straits be promoted.    The SEF party will leave Hangzhou for Taiwan on May 14.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Assets of Polly Peck face early sale Administrators to Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate formerly controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, expect to sell its main remaining assets in the next year. Mr Chris Barlow of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who has taken over as a joint administrator from Mr Michael Jordan, said yesterday the group's holdings in electronics groups Vestel and Sansui were likely to be sold in the next few months. Advisers have been retained to assist with timing and pricing, and preliminary estimates suggest that proceeds from all the remaining assets may raise more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m). Mr Barlow was speaking as a copy of the latest six-monthly report on Polly Peck's administration was circulated to the group's creditors. It says a draft statement of claim is being finalised for a potential legal action against Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's principal auditors, and approval to begin proceedings will shortly be sought from a sub-committee of creditors. It sticks to its previous estimates that creditors will ultimately receive a dividend of 3.7p to 12.5p in the pound, and that there is 'no likelihood' of any payments to shareholders. Unsecured creditors will receive proceeds through an entity called Arvi, which has claimed assets owned by Polly Peck's Dutch holding company, Holdings BV. Arvi will receive between 27 per cent and 39 per cent of the assets. The range depends on the outcome of possible litigation with two other claimants, Finance and Finance NV, which owe certain creditors money. Arvi will also receive between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the claims against Finance NV. The total range of claims against Holdings from Arvi, Finance and Finance NV is Pounds 570m to Pounds 681m, while total claims from all creditors are between Pounds 1.4bn and Pounds 1.6bn. Total Polly Peck International receipts since it entered administration in October 1990 were Pounds 101.8m at May 24 this year. Payments were Pounds 100.1m - of which Pounds 33.7m went to the administrators and other professionals. The administrators are shortly to lodge defences against indictments brought against them by the Istanbul public prosecutor's office. In the past few months they have obtained injunctions to prevent Mr Nadir gaining control of the Crystal Cove hotel in northern Cyprus. He continues to control Jasmine Beach Hotel and Unipac, which the administrators say belong to Polly Peck.</p>

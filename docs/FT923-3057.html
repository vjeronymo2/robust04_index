			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Kohl in secret visit to Bundesbank MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, paid a secret visit to the Bundesbank in Frankfurt on Friday to discuss a realignment of currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism and a cut in German interest rates. Confirmation of the visit, which also involved Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, and Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary for finance, emerged yesterday. It is likely to fuel accusations that the government put unprecedented political pressure on the independent central bank to persuade it to relax its high interest rate policy. Bundesbank officials, however, are adamant that they were the ones who had to persuade the chancellor and his finance minister to support a full ERM realignment, hitherto blocked by other European Community governments such as France. Indeed, senior government officials yesterday maintained that Germany was ready to cut its interest rates - in exchange for a realignment - more than a week before the deal was finalised on Sunday. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said in Kiel last night: 'It is a misunderstanding to maintain that we were forced into interest rate cuts. We have accompanied several realignments, including that of 1987, with an interest rate reduction.' Responding to the charge that the Bundesbank's independence had been 'lost', Mr Schlesinger said the central bank had never had full independence under fixed exchange rates, either in the Bretton Woods system until 1973 or in the European Monetary System. A number of commentators expressed alarm at the apparent loss of independence, including Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce. 'The chamber will be watching to see how the independence of the Bundesbank is protected,' he said.</p>

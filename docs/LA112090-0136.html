			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE TO OPEN CENTER FOR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago College plans to open the Orange County Small Business  Development Center early next year.  </P> <P> The center, which will provide consulting and referral services to residents  who need help in starting or maintaining a small business, will be the only one  of its kind in the county, college officials said.  </P> <P> "We hope to direct people so they don't have to stumble around through a myriad  of agencies," said Bonnie Slager, assistant dean of the business division at  Rancho Santiago College.  </P> <P> The center will offer counseling, technical assistance, loan packaging and  access to government small business finance programs. It will also sponsor  classes, workshops and conferences in cooperation with other business  organizations within the county.  </P> <P> "It's a really good way for people in a small business to get into an organized  support system," Slager said. "There are a lot of people out there who are  really lost in terms of knowing what they have to do to get started and where  to get help."  </P> <P> The center is being funded through a three-year $500,000 grant from the  California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office and is one of 18 such centers  in the state.  </P> <P> It will be housed, rent free, at the city's Santa Ana Business Enterprise  Center at 901 E. Santa Ana Blvd.  </P> <P> The center will have one full-time consultant and one full-time clerical staff  member as well as a number of part-time consultants. They will make referrals  to relevant agencies and aid in problem solving, Slager said.  </P></p>

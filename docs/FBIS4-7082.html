			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 22 KYODO -- A group of Japanese  steel exporters appealed to the United States on Friday to  reject a bill designed to implement the Uruguay Round trade  agreement, which the Japanese claim would take the teeth out of  the global free trade pact.    Representatives of the Japan Iron and Steel Exporters  Association made the appeal when they visited the Commerce  Department and the U.S. Trade Representative Office.    The bill, called the GATT Fair Trade Enforcement Act of  1994,  was introduced earlier this month by Rep. Ralph Regula, a  Republican from Ohio, and Rep. Norman Mineta, a Democrat from  California.    The association officials said the bill includes a broad  series of protectionist amendments, among them measures which  would make it easier for the U.S. Government to impose  antidumping duties on steel imports.    These measures include a provision that would make it  possible to maintain antidumping duties unless exporters prove  there will be no possibility of dumping in the future.    Noting that it is impossible for an individual company to  demonstrate what future prices will be, the officials said the  provision is apparently intended to slap antidumping duties  beyond the five-year period allowed under the Uruguay Round  trade pact.    The Regula-Mineta legislation also includes a provision that  would allocate funds collected from antidumping duties to U.S.  companies which file related antidumping petitions to help them  finance pensions, and research and development.    The possibility of the bill passing Congress without any  amendment is slim, but Japanese steel exporters fear that some  measures in the bill might be incorporated in legislation to be  drafted by the Clinton administration in late May in order to  implement the Uruguay Round trade agreement.</p>

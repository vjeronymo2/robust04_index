			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic  Party [DP] will vote against the Uruguay Round agreement on a  new world trade order when it is referred to the National  Assembly for ratification because it would make the country's  farmland desolate, party chairman Yi Ki-taek said in a policy  speech delivered at a legislative plenary session on Friday.    The party cannot approve the market opening schedules the  government has submitted to the secretariat of the general  agreement on tariffs and trade because they were prepared  without consultation with the DP, he told parliament.    Yi then called for scrapping the National Security Law,  which  he called "a leftover of the Cold War era," and enacting a new  law protecting democratic order to replace it.    Commenting on political reforms, he echoed ruling Democratic  Liberal Party chairman Kim Chong-pil's call for passage of the  reform bills by parliament during its current session.    The redistricting plan being studied by the ruling party  should be limited to merging counties into their adjacent  cities, and the central government should delegate many of its  powers to local governments for effective local autonomy.    The ruling party should not make use of the redistricting  plan to achieve its political objectives, he warned.    Yi also called for an immediate summit meeting between North  and South Korea, adding, "I believe that even if a summit is out  of question now I, in the capacity of the opposition leader,  must meet the North Korean leaders to solve inter-Korean issues."    He welcomed North Korea's belated decision to allow  international inspections of its nuclear facilities and said,  "there still remain problems and the government should make  diplomatic efforts to solve the nuclear issue in three-way  negotiations among Washington, Pyongyang and Seoul."    Calling for revision of the denuclearization declaration on  the Korean peninsula, which bars North and South Korea from  possessing nuclear fuel-reprocessing facilities after the  settlement of the nuclear issue, Yi said the annual military  exercise with the United States, "Team Spirit," must be  suspended as it stands in the way of a peaceful solution to the  nuclear issue.    The government should give top priority in its economic  management plan to fighting rising costs as the people now  suffer from runaway inflation, he stressed. He called for the  central bank to be independent from the government, tax reforms,  amendments to labor laws, a law replacing the emergency  presidential order requiring the use of real names in all  financial transactions, and measures against water pollution.    The opposition leader urged President Kim Yong-sam to  present  a clear direction for his reform program and to carry it out  lawfully, calling the reforms of the past year "a reform for  show and demonstration."</p>

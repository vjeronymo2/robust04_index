			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STAGE IS SET;  </P> <P> IF IT'S DRAMA YOU WANT, THE ATLAS BAR &amp; GRILL HAS IT  </P> <P> Mario Tamayo has a knack for transforming unpromising L.A. locations into  fun-filled dining spots like Cha Cha Cha and Cafe Mambo. Those first ventures  were modest in scale and decorated with little more than bright paint.  </P> <P> But Atlas Bar &amp; Grill is a big step upward. Working with artist-designer  Ron Meyers, he's turned a cavernous expanse in the Wiltern Center, on Wilshire  Boulevard, into a stunning set for Tamayo's blend of informal eating and live  entertainment.  </P> <P> Meyers kept much of the furniture and layout left by the previous restaurant  occupant, L. A. Ole. But he has transformed what was an overpowering void into  a setting as theatrical as anything you've seen on Broadway. The dining area is  separated from the entrance facade by a fence of gilded wands. A wrought-iron  screen of mythological figures that suggests a pencil sketch suspended in  midair separates the dining area from the bar and somewhat open kitchen. The  screen defines the dining area, giving it an exuberant, surprisingly intimate  feeling, and diners can admire its multiple reflections in a mirror over the  bar.  </P> <P> The restaurant's unusual lights are starburst fixtures of incandescent tubes  and zigzag shades that hint at the Wiltern's flamboyant Art Deco ornamentation.  Decorations shaped like lightning bolts draped in crystal add to the eclectic  decor. And yellow walls reflect a warm glow reminiscent of candlelight.  </P> <P> A small performance space is flanked by golden sunbursts on doors that conceal  stage equipment when it's not in use. Excessive noise is absorbed by cork floor  tiles and acoustic ceiling panels so that diners can actually carry on a  conversation at the tables -- a rare treat in today's stylish but noisy  restaurants.  </P></p>

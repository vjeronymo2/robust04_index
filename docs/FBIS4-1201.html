			<p>BFN     [Text] The South African Army has become the latest  institution to express serious concerns about the capabilities  of the National Peace Keeping Force [NPKF]. The chief of the  Army, General Hattingh Pretorius, said in Heidelberg in the  Transvaal that the Defense Force was lately perceived as being  the only organization that could ensure stability and protect  the country from anarchy and chaos. He said the image of the  SADF [South African Defense Force] was now more positive than  that of any other security force.</p>

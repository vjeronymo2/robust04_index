			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Tapie hands on baton to Pentland: The Adidas shoe is now on another foot MR STEPHEN Rubin, chairman of Pentland, says he has spent a lifetime trying to get out of shoes. Yesterday's announcement that his company had finally won control of Adidas means it is unlikely that he will ever achieve that ambition. The purchase represents an opportunity to achieve Pentland's other long-held ambition of owning one of the world's best-known brand names, which also happens to be in shoes. Pentland set it sights on Adidas last summer, when it bought a 20 per cent stake from Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French businessman who paid FFr1.6bn (Pounds 165m) for the sporting goods group in a highly leveraged deal in 1990. Pentland also negotiated the pre-emptive rights over any bid for Adidas which have proved to be the company's ace, following weeks of speculation over a possible management buy-out. Pentland - with roots in Mr Rubin's family business, the Liverpool Shoe Company - shot to fame with its transformation of a loss-making sports shoe manufacturer, Reebok. In only 10 years, holding a 55 per cent stake, Pentland transformed Reebok into an international group with annual turnover of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m). By the late 1980s, however, it became apparent that Reebok had outgrown its majority shareholder. A small setback for Reebok's profits was able to knock a disproportionately large hole in Pentland's return. By 1990, Pentland's stake, originally bought for only Dollars 77,500, had fallen to 31.6 per cent. That investment yielded a total profit of Dollars 777m, with the last sale of Reebok shares at Dollars 27 last year. Reebok yesterday closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 24 3/8 . With the proceeds of the Reebok investment, Pentland has built a group which owns the worldwide rights to Speedo swimwear as well as sourcing and licensing agreements for a series of sports related products. Yet it has found it difficult to match the Reebok success. Adidas, like competitors, has found life more difficult in recent years. Mr Frank Farrant, Pentland's finance director, rejected criticism that, by buying Adidas, Pentland is returning to the problems it had with a rapidly growing Reebok. 'Pentland is much bigger now in its own right,' he said. 'We have had the experience of building up Reebok and we have more financial muscle.' Nevertheless, the sports shoe market of the 1990s is very different from that of the fitness-mad 1980s. The US and Europe are the focus of fierce competition by players such as Nike and Reebok. Pentland also makes no secret of the fact that Adidas has suffered setbacks in Germany, where Nike and Reebok have squeezed its share by more than 10 points to about 40 per cent. Mr Farrant maintains Adidas will find opportunities in eastern Europe, Asia, the Far East and even the US. Adidas's 3 per cent share in the US, compared with 28 per cent for Nike and 23 per cent for Reebok, is a strength, not a weakness, he says. The first task will be to bring the 1 per cent net margins at Adidas nearer to the 14 per cent and 15 per cent achieved by its main competitors. Although existing management has already begun rationalising Adidas, Mr Farrant said there was more to do. After the deal is completed, rationalisation costs would total less than DM50m (Pounds 17m). Mr Rubin said current management will be left to carry on the business they know best. 'All our successes have been where we have given management as much power as possible,' he said. Meanwhile, Mr Tapie faces the task of reconstructing his business armed with the FFr500m profit on his Adidas investment. Although he has spent the past few months waxing and waning over whether to sell Adidas, Mr Tapie really had no choice. The Adidas acquisition was far bigger than his existing businesses and marked a move into the mainstream for Mr Tapie, who had previously specialised in buying up bankrupt companies. BTF borrowed FFr1.6bn in short-term loans to do the deal. The pressure of repaying these loans has already forced Mr Tapie to sell almost all his original interests. After the Adidas sale, BTF will be left with only two companies - Testut, a weighing machine manufacturer which lost FFr8m on sales of FFr450m in 1991, and Scaime, a small industrial company, which produced profits of FFr2m on sales of FFr60m. Both companies are on the market. Mr Elie Felous, who took over as BTF's chairman in April when Mr Tapie began a short-lived ministerial career, said that, after selling Testut and Scaime, BTF should have surplus cash of about FFr1bn. That will be used to buy new businesses, although Mr Felous said it had not yet been decided how the money would be invested, or whether Mr Tapie will return to his role as chairman. BTF's investors will probably have to wait until the autumn to hear the answers to both questions. Mr Tapie and Mr Felous, like many other French businessmen, plan to take long summer breaks. 'July and August are months for relaxation, not for business decisions,' said Mr Felous. 'We will leave all that until the rentree after the holiday season.'  ----------------------------------------------           SPORTS SHOE MARKET SHARE  ----------------------------------------------                    ADIDAS    NIKE    REEBOK  ---------------------------------------------- WORLD (excl.

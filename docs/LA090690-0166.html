			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY FINED $2,000 FOR UNREPORTED  DONATION  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was fined $2,000 Wednesday by the state Fair  Political Practices Commission, which said he failed to disclose receiving  $1,800 from a contract-seeking company while serving on a local transportation  commission.  </P> <P> The FPPC said that Bradley, while an appointed member of the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission, chaired the meeting at which the panel voted to  award a contract for an environmental study to a local firm, Gruen Associates.  </P> <P> The study was aimed at detailing the impact of light rail service routes on the  San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "Since he chaired the particular meeting in which this contract was voted upon,  he participated in the decision," the FPPC said.  </P> <P> Before the Feb. 11, 1987, vote, Bradley's political campaign had received three  checks from Gruen in 1986 -- one for $600 in March, another for $200 in August  and a third for $1,000 in October.  </P></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Wine at Waddesdon - Appetisers Britain is to have a new centre for wine appreciation, in the cellars of an extraordinary monument to connoisseurship, Waddesdon Manor, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. This grand Victorian country house, constructed by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild in the style of a 16th century Loire chateau, will be open to the public from the beginning of April, after four years of meticulous renovation by Jacob, the fourth Lord Rothschild. Well aware of the fascination of Victorian kitchens for the British public (vide Brighton Pavilion, Castle Drogo and countless television programmes), Lord Rothschild and his team have transformed Waddesdon's substantial below-stairs area into an example of a 'gentleman's working cellar' - a neat example of lateral, or rather vertical, thinking. As an acknowledgement of the importance of wine to various branches of the family, the cellars will hold thousands of bottles of the Rothschild first growths, Chateaux Lafite and Mouton, many of them from the last century. There will be a shop selling young vintages of these wines and their less aristocratic relations (now produced as far afield as Chile and California), and there are plans to host wine-related exhibitions and special wine tastings, both in the cellars and in the Dairy, a construction in Waddesdon's grounds which has more in common with Marie-Antoinette and Versailles than with anything as prosaic as a cow. More details from Ben Howkins on 071-493 8111. Jancis Robinson. Pierre Androuet's Guide to Cheeses (revised edition, Aidan Ellis, Pounds 9.99, 551 pages) has always been an essential for those seriously interested in cheese. It also has drawbacks: the translation is stiff; Androuet is on uncertain ground when it comes to foreign cheeses and the style is often comically magisterial and Gallic. Androuet is nonetheless wonderfully sound on the important issues: pasteurisation and the role of pasture in taste and, of course, the seasons; the pleasures of which are being progressively nullified by pasteurisation.

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Next target: high-risk homes and drivers The Royal Bank of Scotland, the owners of Direct Line, the UK's fastest growing insurer, yesterday issued a fresh challenge to the UK's traditional insurance market by announcing the launch of a new telephone-based insurance company for so-called 'non-standard risks'. The company will sell policies to motorists and householders who currently find it difficult or expensive to obtain cover, following steep increases in premiums. From next year, it will aim to offer cheaper insurance to an estimated 6m motorists who are classified as higher risk because of their age, or because they drive fast cars or have poor claims records. 'We are not encouraging 17-year-olds to drive Ferraris,' explained Mr Peter Wood, who will be non-executive chairman of the joint venture. 'But at the moment many drivers are poorly served and find it impossible to get affordable insurance. When they do find an insurer they are subject to arbitrary rate increases and poor service.' Formed in 1985, Direct Line now insures more than 1.25m of the estimated 12m motorists regarded as 'standard risk'. It aims to attract an additional 1m motor policyholders in the next 12 months and is also stepping up its sales effort in the household insurance market. Direct Line already offers household insurance to 273,000 home-owners and is keen to eat into the market share of the large composite companies, which sell most of their policies through building societies. Mr Wood's company is critical of household policy commission rates of up to 30 per cent and recently presented a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading. Analysts believe the new motor insurance company will add to the pressures faced by some UK insurance companies, who mainly rely on sales through retail brokers. They have lost market share to Direct Line, Churchill and other 'direct writers', which use a combination of mass media marketing and telephone sales to sell direct to the public. Lloyd's syndicates and some smaller companies, which specialise in the 'non-standard' market, could also be vulnerable. Mr Steven Bird, an analyst with Smith New Court, said: 'In the past the composites would have retreated to the non-standard market. They will now find Mr Wood lurking there. They have nowhere to hide.' Another analyst commented: 'They have already been knocked sideways by the growth of direct writers in the motor market and had hoped to concentrate on the higher risk end of the market.' A profitable non-standard market, served by specialist underwriters, has emerged in the US. Before setting up its new venture, Direct line visited specialist companies such as Progressive of Cleveland, Ohio. One of the UK's composite insurers, Guardian Royal Exchange, owns two specialist US subsidiaries - Globe Insurance and American Ambassador - which are expanding in some US regional markets. The new venture would 'incorporate the hallmarks of Direct Line', said Mr Wood - direct telephone sales and slick back room operations. This combination has allowed the company to reduce expenses to less than 50 per cent of those of its competitors and to offer premium rates between 5 and 15 per cent cheaper. The new non-standard company will bring down rates, although its policies will generally offer less cover than in the standard market. 'The idea is to bring affordable insurance to people who are priced out of the market at the moment,' explained Ms Jane Dickson, company secretary of Direct Line. The marketing campaign is likely to place more emphasis on specialist motor and other publications than on television adverts. And the new venture's telesales operators - who underwrite policies with the help of sophisticated computer software - may need greater experience of the insurance industry. The new company will hope to achieve the same high 'retention rates' as Direct Line, with more than four out of five policyholders choosing to renew their policies with the company each year. 'We will stimulate the market and make it more competitive. A better way of doing business is needed,' says Mr Wood.</p>

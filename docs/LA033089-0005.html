			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT WENT WRONG?  </P> <P> The 240,000 barrels of crude oil that have spewed from the ruptured hull of the  tanker Exxon Valdez since it ran aground Friday have blackened more than the  pristine waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound.  </P> <P> They also have sullied the credibility of Exxon Co. U.S.A, which owns the  vessel, of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which manages the trans-Alaskan  pipeline and of the state and federal officials whose responsibility it is to  see that these private firms operate in a responsible manner.  </P> <P> This is a harsh judgment, but the facts of this shocking and unnecessary  environmental catastrophe make no other possible. These facts also make it  mandatory that Congress take a rigorous and skeptical look at the Bush  Administration's claim that oil drilling can be expanded into the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge without unacceptable consequences.  </P> <P> While the tardy and inexcusably chaotic cleanup of the worst oil spill ever to  foul American waters proceeds, vexing questions demand answers:  </P> <P>  -- Why were the vessel's master, who has a history alcohol abuse, and two  senior officers absent from the bridge when it strayed out of the shipping  channel? Why was an unqualifiedthird mate piloting the ship?  </P> <P>  -- Why did Exxon officials fail so miserably in their responsibility to have  an effective contingency cleanup plan in place? Why didn't they have the  requisite equipment on site? Why did the company's officials move so slowly to  contain the spill, thereby squandering the initial two days of good weather  that might have made a quick cleanup feasible?.  </P> <P>  -- Why did Alyeska rebuff earlier offers by Valdez city officials to stockpile  cleanup equipment, assuring the local leaders -- falsely, as it now turns out  -- that the oil companies had adequate supplies on hand?  </P> <P>  -- Why did the Alaskan state government, which has the primary responsibility  for legal oversight of these matters, fail to exercise it?  </P> <P>  -- Why has the Bush Administration been so slow to intervene into what was  from the first day obviously a major environmental crisis?  </P> <P> In fact, the President waited until Tuesday before sending senior aides to the  scene of the spill, and even then seemed to express doubts that the federal  government ought to take a major role in the cleanup. Bush's approach to this  disaster is perplexing.  </P></p>

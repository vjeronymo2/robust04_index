			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: A Caribbean Odyssey - Derek Walcott's new play 'MONSTERS, we make them ourselves.' So ends The Odyssey at The Other Place, Stratford: selected stories from Homer over three hours with a cast of 16, a band and special effects. The text is by the Caribbean poet Derek Walcott, and direction by Gregory Doran. The result is a play, busy like the mackerel-crowded seas around Ithaca: attractive and lively fare. Walcott's Caribbean tribute to Homer, Omeros, was the best long poem of 1990. His text for The Odyssey draws on the visceral language of Omeros. This, with inventive, energetic and lyrical direction attempts the impossible task of putting Homer on stage. Epic poetry is not theatre, but dignified verse and serious actions in narrative form. The text is not inherently dramatic, for it deals with events that have already happened. In Homer, Odysseus hears of his own exploits from a poet, and weeps: 'You sing so finely of the fate of the Greeks, all that they did and endured and toiled, as if you had been there yourself or heard it from someone who was.' Epic asks 'what happened then?' Tragedy asks, 'what is happening now?" The sandy set fronts a clear plastic screen. The costumes mix Greek and Caribbean, making the journey home to Ithaca more exotic. There is a wonderful storm scene before Scheria, a sexy sojourn with Circe, and a run-in with the Cyclops. The Underworld is a subway station, the Flatbush Avenue Express roaring past. True to form, Odysseus (Ron Cook) is wily and Penelope (Amanda Harris) faithful; their qualities are challenged by an assortment of rejuvenated Homeric figures around them. Circe (Bella Enahoro) is all sinewy eroticism and Nausicaa (Sophie Okonedo) all flirty charm: 'just tell your wife you met me and were swept overboard.' Geoffrey Freshwater finds viciousness in the Cyclops and David Westhead croaking age in Nestor. A blind blues poet (Rudolph Walker) keeps the action moving forward, but the best parts of the evening are the descriptions of offstage events. That is what Epic means. As Gorgias said in the Helen, 'words tell of the fortune and misfortune of other lives and other people, the heart feels a feeling of its own.' The strengths lie in the language: 'Imagine a blue cave, alabaster and porphyry, blue waves on its ceiling' or 'Our ribbed bodies long for their original shore.' The verse itself, in six-pulse lines, needs close following. Clear, sharp verse-speaking makes concentration easy. The content varies from the witty: 'I saw the wooden horse blocking the stars - Troy fell for it'; to the cruel: 'Helen - still miss Troy?" At the moment, The Odyssey lacks expansiveness and shape. It fails to match the scope of Walcott's vision: 'the sea speaks the same language around the world's shores.' Leaving the theatre, one should feel that Odysseus' journey is still happening somewhere. Walcott closed Omeros with that haunting idea: 'When he left the beach the sea was still going on.'</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Defense Department is investigating the Boeing Co.'s billing practices for  research and development costs related to government contracts, the company  said in Seattle. Boeing spokesman Paul Binder declined to provide details of  the billing practices probe, but he did confirm that an investigation is under  way. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported in its Saturday editions that it  has obtained internal Boeing memos that say the company is under subpoena to  preserve a wide assortment of documents. A memo dated June 13 named the target  as the Sea Lance program, an anti-submarine weapon Boeing is developing for the  Navy, the newspaper reported.  </P></p>

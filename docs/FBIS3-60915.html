Adelaide Mendez, 50, had reported that she and her live-in  boyfriend Scott Monroe Nelson, 55, from Houston, Texas, were  walking to a restaurant late Tuesday when two men in a car  abducted him.    Mendez said she believed Nelson was kidnapped on the orders  of his Filipina wife, Nimfa Pilapil, who was demanding child  support.    But investigators said they were wary of Mendez's account  because she could not recall exactly where the kidnapping  occurred, or the color and make of the car used in the abduction.    Mendez was being investigated and police released no further  information on her.</p>

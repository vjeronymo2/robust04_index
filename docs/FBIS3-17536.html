In his words, the Russian possible signing of a  corresponding  framework agreement will not infringe Russian interests but help  to enhance Russian influence on many foreign political processes  in Europe and throughout the world.    The deputy foreign minister stressed that Russian-NATO  contacts within the Partnership for Peace framework will not  hamper comprehensive cooperation with Commonwealth states, which  are of special interest for Russia.    Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Valeriy  Manilov said that the Russian adoption of the Partnership for  Peace program has not been "directly" discussed at the Security  Council, but will be considered as part of Russian foreign  political activities at the next council meeting.    He said that Russian participation in the program is a  "compromise between supporters and opponents of NATO expansion".  A refusal from this partnership may result in Russian political  isolation on the European continent. Manilov described the  program as a "door to European collective security".    First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin told the Duma  meeting that the NATO program carries no threat to Russian  interests. He stressed that Russia, being a great power,  carries a special responsibility and special obligations on the  upkeep of universal peace and stability.    The State Duma will return to the discussion of Russian  participation in the Partnership for Peace program at the next  stage of parliamentary hearings on the issue.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 TREASURER CANDIDATES RAISE MORE THAN $1 MILLION  </P> <P> The two leading candidates for the office of state treasurer, Republican  incumbent Thomas W. Hayes and Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown, raised a  total of more than $1 million in campaign funds during the first half of 1989,  contribution reports showed Tuesday.  </P> <P> In another statewide race, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner collected  $616,000 in his quest to become attorney general -- nearly four times the  $156,000 raised by his closest opponent, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith,  the reports showed. Both are Democrats.  </P> <P> The campaign for the newly elective post of insurance commissioner got off to a  modest start with Democratic television commentator Bill Press raising $104,000  and Roxani Gillespie, the current appointed insurance commissioner, collecting  $75,000.  </P> <P> For the most part, fund-raising reports filed this week indicated that the  campaign restrictions of Proposition 73 have done little to reduce the ability  of politicians to raise money. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco),  for example, reported collecting $696,000 during the first half of the year.  </P> <P> The pace of fund-raising in the treasurer's race demonstrates that the 1990  campaign is certain to be a hard-fought contest for what was once considered a  relatively minor state office.  </P> <P> Brown, sister of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., raised $676,000 for her  campaign during the six-month period -- more than any candidate seeking a  statewide office other than governor. But in an interview, Brown still  portrayed her campaign as an uphill battle against Hayes.  </P> <P> "I still see my candidacy as being one of an underdog, given the fact there is  someone sitting in that office," she said. "I really am going to have a  formidable challenge but I am working hard to equalize (Hayes') advantage by  raising enough money to run a very credible and viable campaign."  </P> <P> Hayes, who was appointed treasurer last year by Gov. George Deukmejian,  collected $383,000 during the same period for his first campaign for elective  office. But a spokeswoman said Hayes is not worried about Brown's early  fund-raising edge.  </P> <P> "We will raise what it takes to get the message out there, to show the  difference between the candidates," said Donna Lucas, a spokeswoman for Hayes.  "We're happy with the amount of money that we've raised."  </P> <P> Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine, a second Republican candidate in the race,  trails Hayes with contributions of $156,000.  </P> <P> In the attorney general campaign, Republican Daniel E. Lungren lags far behind  both Democrats in fund-raising. Lungren, a former congressman from Long Beach  whose appointment to the treasurer's post was rejected by the Legislature  before Hayes got the job, raised only $29,000 in his bid to become the state's  top law enforcement officer.  </P> <P> In the race for lieutenant governor, two Orange County Republican state  senators, John Seymour and Marian Bergeson, each raised more than incumbent Lt.  Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who is seeking a third term.  </P> <P> Seymour, of Anaheim, reported $354,000 while Bergeson, of Newport Beach, raised  $363,000. However, $225,000 of the sum Bergeson reported was actually money she  raised before 1989 for her state Senate campaign and transferred this year into  her lieutenant governor account.  </P> <P> McCarthy, a Democrat who was defeated in his attempt to oust U.S. Sen. Pete  Wilson last year, has raised $222,000 for his reelection campaign.  </P> <P> In the state Senate, both President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles)  and Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno reported raising substantial sums.  Roberti reported raising $308,000, while Maddy collected $353,000 during the  first half of the year.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Clay Evans contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHEEHAN FACES CHALLENGE, BRADLEY IN LPGA EVENT  </P> <P> There's a challenge that Patty Sheehan is determined to meet -- to win the du  Maurier Classic.  </P> <P> Sheehan, 33, has won two of the last three LPGA events heading into the second  of four majors, starting today at the Westmount Golf and Country Club.  </P> <P> "I'm really looking forward to this because it is a major championship," said  Sheehan, who won at the McDonald's Championship on June 10 and the Rochester  Invitational last week.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, I haven't played extremely well in this tournament. I don't  really have an explanation why, but that's why I'm looking forward to this week  because I have been playing so well."  </P> <P> Sheehan and Pat Bradley, trying for a fourth du Maurier title, are the only  competitors with three wins this year. Sheehan, who also opened the year with a  win in the Jamaica Classic in January, would like to be the first to win four.  </P> <P> She leads the LPGA money list with more than $357,000, about $33,000 more than  Bradley. It's the ninth consecutive year she has earned more than $200,000 on  the tour, putting her fifth on the all-time list with more than $2.45 million.  </P> <P> Top prize in the four-day event is $90,000 from a total purse of $600,000.  </P> <P> Sheehan had a quick practice round Monday on the rolling, 6,415-yard, par-73  course. She then had an equally quick visit to New York on Tuesday where she  received the All-American Collegiate Hall of Fame award. She is only the fourth  woman to be so honored in the award's 26 years.  </P> <P> Back in Canada on Wednesday, Sheehan got attuned to the 59-year-old course  being used for the du Maurier for the first time.  </P> <P> "It's beautiful, old, traditional and in great shape," she said with  enthusiasm. "It's truly pleasurable to play a golf course that's in great  shape."  </P></p>

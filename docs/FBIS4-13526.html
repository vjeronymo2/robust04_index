			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aharon Klein] </F>   [Excerpt] The Palestinian general security services is one  of the issues on which an agreement has been achieved. The  Palestinian services' jurisdiction will apply throughout the  territories. This constitutes a crucial -- possibly cardinal --  precedent.    This sphere of activity is the first in which PLO-Fatah has  been granted freedom of action outside the Gaza Strip and  Jericho area. The Palestinians will be able to set up preemptive  intelligence offices in Nabulus, Tulkarm, Hebron, Ramallah, and  other cities in the territories. Since both sides have a vested  interest in the matter, an agreement in this spirit was recently  attained in the Cairo talks. Although the Palestinians had  reneged on a previously achieved agreement on the issue, a new  agreement similar to the previous one has now emerged.    The Gaza Strip preemptive intelligence, or rather preemptive  security (al-amn al-wiqa'i), will be headed by Muhammad Dahlan,  member of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks.  'Arafat selected 34-year-old Dahlan, a native Gazan, for this  pivotal, powerful, and consequential position because of his  extensive connections with local activists.    Dahlan, who was deported at the beginning of 1987, had been  one of the founders of the Fatah Shabibah [youth movement], and  he had organized the mass disturbances which preceded the  intifadah. He maintained his connections with Gaza Strip  activists throughout the intifadah and while in Tunis. Dahlan  had been put in charge of the military activities in the Gaza  Strip, and this capacity plus his connections with the locals  made him a central and powerful figure close to 'Arafat.  Dahlan's appointment to the sensitive position undoubtedly  reflects 'Arafat's full confidence in him.    The head of the preemptive intelligence in Judaea and  Samaria  will be Jibril al-Rajub. Al-Rajub, 41, a deportee since 1988,  was born in the village of Dura in the Hebron District. As a  Fatah activist, he was arrested for terrorist activity and  served a prison sentence in Israel. He was released in 1986 in  the framework of the "Jibril deal," immediately after which he  resumed his Fatah activities, becoming one of Faysal  al-Husayni's close aides. Al- Rajub cultivated extensive ties  with local activists, as a result of which he became one of the  central PLO-Tunis figures and an 'Arafat aide. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> IV. Covered Acts and Omissions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Proposed &sect;6.6 provides elaboration on the scope of the statutory protection for covered entities and individuals. Paragraph (a) states the relevant dates of coverage. Paragraph (b) repeats the provision of section 224(a) that limits coverage to claims for damage for personal injury or death resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions. Paragraph (c) states that for covered individuals, only acts or omissions within the scope of their employment (or contract for services, in the case of covered contractors) are covered. Thus, for example, ``moonlighting'' activities of a physician employed by a covered grantee would not be covered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;6.6 addresses the limitation that only acts or omissions related to the grant-supported activity are covered. The Department is aware that there has been some confusion since the enactment of section 224(g) about the types of activities that would be covered. In particular, there have been questions about the issue of when coverage is available where individuals who are not registered patients of the grantee are treated. This paragraph provides clear standards for answering these questions. Coverage will be available for the treatment of non-patients of the covered entities only when the Secretary determines either that (1) the provision of the services to such individuals benefits patients of the entity and general populations that could be served by the entity through community-wide intervention efforts within the communities served by the entity, or (2) the provision of services to such individuals facilitates the provision of services to patients of the entity, or (3) such services are otherwise required to be provided to such individuals under an employment contract or similar arrangement between the entity and the covered individual. Examples of situations within the scope of proposed &sect;6.6(d) are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A community health center deemed to be a covered entity establishes a school-based or school-linked health program as part of its grant supported activity. Even though the students treated are not necessarily registered patients of the center, the center and its health care practitioners will be covered for services provided, if the Secretary makes the determination in subparagraph (1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A migrant health center requires its physicians to obtain staff privileges at a community hospital. As a condition of obtaining such privileges, and thus being able to admit the center's patients to the hospital, the physicians must agree to provide occasional coverage of the hospital's emergency room. The Secretary would be authorized to determine that this coverage is necessary to facilitate the provision of services to the grantee's patients, and that it would therefore be covered by subparagraph (2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A homeless health services grantee makes arrangements with local community providers for after-hours coverage of its patients. The grantee's physicians are required by their employment contracts to provide periodic cross-coverage for patients of these providers, in order to make this arrangement feasible. The Secretary may determine that the arrangement is within the scope of subparagraph (3). Again, however, it should be understood that this would not extend the scope of coverage under Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 to ``moonlighting'' activities by center health care practitioners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule is not intended to constitute, and does not constitute, a comprehensive notice pertaining to any provision of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 except to the extent that procedures pertaining to implementation of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 are described explicitly above. The applicability of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 and 42 U.S.C. 233(a) to a particular claim or case will depend upon the determination or certification (as appropriate) by the Attorney General that the individual or entity is covered by Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 and was acting within the scope of employment, in accordance with normal Department of Justice procedures. A determination or certification by the Attorney General is subject to judicial review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Economic Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, benefits, incentives, equity, and availability of information. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require special analysis. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that we include an analysis of all rules the significantly impact small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed regulations provide information whereby health care entities or individual scan determine when, and to what extent they are likely to be protected for medical malpractice under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Therefore, the Secretary certifies that the proposed regulations will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

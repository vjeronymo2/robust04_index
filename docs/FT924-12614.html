			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Mansfield Brewery expansion MANSFIELD Brewery is buying 31 social clubs, mainly in Derbyshire and Yorkshire, from Courage. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The clubs have a total membership of more than 50,000 people. They will be given new tenancy agreements, including a right to buy at a designated time. Mr Richard Chadburn, Mansfield's operations and personnel director, said that he expected about half the clubs would eventually take advantage of the provision. 'They will then switch from being tenants to become free-trade customers,' he said.</p>

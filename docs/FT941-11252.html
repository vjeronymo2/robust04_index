			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Malawi controls lifted The Reserve Bank of Malawi has lifted exchange controls and authorised commercial banks to buy and sell foreign currencies at market rates, writes Nick Young from Blantyre. Asof next week businesses will no longer need to apply to the Reserve Bank for foreign exchange allocations to pay for imports. Regular exporters, principally oftobacco, tea and sugar, will be encouraged to open hard currency accounts with commercial banks. This liberalisation package, intended to enhance to export competitiveness and simulate growth, comes amid chronic foreign exchange shortage.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> KIDS;  </P> <P> A CLOSE CRAWL  </P> <P> REACHING INTO AN assortment of pillowcases and wicker baskets, the Lizard Lady  performs birthday magic: She keeps a party of 5-year-olds spellbound for an  hour. Her traveling reptile repertoire includes Alana the Iguana, various  skinks and snakes, and Bob the Tortoise, who may attempt to escape with all  deliberate speed.  </P> <P> A preschool teacher during the week, Melanie Bishop knows how to talk to kids,  providing a running commentary on reptile habits. All of the children are  allowed to touch her pets, but only the birthday child gets the privilege of  holding them.  </P> <P> But lest some of the young party guests feel left out, the Lizard Lady has one  more surprise for the grand finale: Her name is Sheila, and she's an 8-foot  python. Unlike the Lizard Lady's other reptiles, Sheila can be "worn" by one or  more giggly kids (and adults).  </P> <P>  Party rates are $125 and up. The Lizard Lady can be reached at (818) 781-8367.  (818)  </P> <P> KAY DIEHL  </P></p>

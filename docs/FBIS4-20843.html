			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Satellite for Mail"] </F>   [Text] Conversion is entering the life of the Russian  Plesetsk cosmodrome increasingly widely. The Arkhangelsk Oblast  newspaper VOLNA reports that last year regular launches of  launch vehicles made on the basis of combat ICBM's. Thus with  the aid of the new "Start-1" launch vehicle an experimental  electronic mail satellite was put into orbit.    In all last year 36 space vehicles were launched from the  world's northernmost cosmodrome, only eight of them in the  interests of the Defense Ministry. This year's program includes  the launch of the new "Koronas" geophysical satellite which will  continue the study of the polar aurora in the upper strata of  the atmosphere and will begin regular observations of the Sun.  And the "Okean" satellite will search for shoals of fish and  investigate the ice on Arctic shipping routes.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Guinness sheds its baggage The elegance of the new cross shareholdings between Guinness and LVMH neatly underlines the shortcomings of the previous structure. By exchanging its indirect 24 per cent holding in LVMH for a direct 34 per cent stake in the Moet Hennessy drinks operation, Guinness swaps an illiquid investment for a tighter grip on the part of a business which interests it. That helps secure the Guinness-MH joint ventures, which are central to the company's Far Eastern ambitions. Guinness's pre-emption rights on MH shares will also stand it in good stead if Mr Bernard Arnault, who controls LVMH, loses interest in drinks. Meanwhile, the Pounds 416m of cash which Guinness will receive usefully cuts the high capital commitment to the cross shareholding and reduces its Pounds 1.8bn debt. Part of the cost of these advantages comes in a 4 per cent dilution in Guinness' earnings. That may dampen enthusiasm, especially given the company's wary view of the year ahead. But it looks a small price for disengagement from Mr Arnault's wider ambitions. Given that LVMH held the upper hand in the relationship before the changes, one must also look to Mr Arnault's motives in agreeing to a deal which suits Guinness quite so well. The cash now lodged in LVMH may be the key, and a large acquisition may not be far away. Whether Guinness has made the right long term decision turns on the relative prospects for upmarket drinks against luxury branded goods and whatever other ideas Mr Arnault has. In the near term at least, the drinks market will remain sober. The arguments for upmarket booze brands cascading through developing countries also do not look as compelling as they did in the gung-ho 1980s. But that portfolio may well be a more secure franchise than the world of fancy luggage and media ambition.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Tesco customers trading down in recession SIR IAN MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, vigorously countered suggestions that the grocery chain's newest stores were trading below expectation. But he accepted that its customers were conspicuously trading down as a result of the recession. 'We have opened 12 new stores this year and they are among the best we have ever opened,' Sir Ian said when presenting Tesco's interim results yesterday. There was, however, widespread evidence of customers buying less expensive foods. 'We have more customers in the younger age groups - between 25 and 40 - who by and large have been affected worse by the recession than the senior citizens,' he said. Tesco intends to open 13 more stores in the second half, although its opening programme is developing at a slower rate than mapped out at the time of its Pounds 572m rights issue in February 1991. Sir Ian said this reflected problems of winning planning approval at individual sites rather than any change of policy. 'There is absolutely no change in the strategic direction at all,' he said. Tesco ended the period with 401 stores and trading area of 11m sq ft. Next year it will add 900,000 sq ft of selling space. Capital expenditure for the full year is expected to be about Pounds 730m. During the half year the company spent Pounds 317m, of which Pounds 266m went on new store developments. Mr David Reid, finance director, said: 'Opening new stores in a recession is a lot harder than before and the returns across the industry are coming down a bit, but they can afford to come down.' The company was also affected by the sharp fall in prices for many food items. Over the past three half-year periods the grocery industry's like-for-like sales increases have fallen from 4.1 per cent to 3.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Price deflation for fruit and vegetables this summer was a 'staggering' 18 per cent, Sir Ian said. The fall in the value of sterling may halt the deflationary pressures as 25 per cent of Tesco's goods are imported. However, the company does not expect a rapid change in the position and has already bought-forward currencies until Christmas. Tesco noticed a sharp increase in the demand for multi-save items and introduced a number of 'value lines' in many stores. However, sales of some high-value lines such as sandwiches, fresh ready meals and champagne increased substantially.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (14): Birth of a trade block - The meaning of NAFTA THE initials NAFTA represent a significant diplomatic victory for the US automobile assembly and parts industry in its long-running battle for market share in the North American market against Japanese competition. For the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was clinched in August after months of negotiations, will force Japanese manufacturers to increase the local content of vehicles they sell in the US market and give their American rivals an advantage in the fast-growing Mexican market. The agreement also promises to end much of the current statistical controversy between the US and Japanese industries over precisely what constitutes 'local content' in a North American vehicle. The Nafta agreement, which has yet to be ratified by the legislatures of the three countries involved, will create a free-trade area of 360m people in Canada, the US and Mexico. Thousands of tariffs, duties and non-tariff barriers will be eliminated over the next decade and a half. The agreement will supersede an existing free-trade agreement between the US and Canada. Trade in automobiles and automobile parts constitutes one of the most important elements of the agreement and focuses on two main areas. First, existing Mexican rules which specify that any cars sold in that country must have a 36 per cent local content will be relaxed to 29 per cent over a 10 year period. Second, vehicles built in any of the countries but sold in one of the other two will require a 62.5 per cent content of North American parts to avoid duty. This will be phased in over eight years. For the first four years, the local content requirement will be 50 per cent  -the same as it is now under the US-Canadian pact. And it will then be held at 56 per cent for another four years. The major winners from the pact appear to be: the US and Canadian assembly plants of the Big Three US manufacturers, which are expecting a sharp boost to sales from a newly opened Mexican market. Demand for cars is growing rapidly in Mexico as the country's economy booms. US automotive parts companies, which see an opportunity both to sell more parts into the Mexican market and to so-called Japanese transplants - Japanese car plants in the US and Canada - which need to boost their local content. the Mexican automobile industry. Less efficient parts of the industry - essentially manufacturers of big cars - are likely to suffer from more efficient American competition. But this seems likely to be offset eventually by increased production in Mexico by the Big Three of small vehicles to serve the entire North American market. Cheap Mexican manufacturing costs could help the Big Three claw back parts of the small car market which have been lost over the past decade to offshore Asian competition. The main losers look like being: the US United Auto Workers' Union, which fears the Big Three will shift jobs from the US to Mexico, where labour costs are far below those of the US and environmental regulations relatively relaxed. 'This deal in its present form will vaporise thousands and thousands more good-paying American jobs,' according to Mr Owen Bieber, the UAW's president. However, there is such overcapacity in the US market that no-one expects a rush by the Big Three to locate south of the border and many analysts argue that the UAW would lose these small car jobs anyway to Asian competition. Far better, runs the argument, to lose them to Mexicans in the same trading bloc, thus creating wealth which may then be spent on more luxurious cars built in the US. Japanese manufacturers, who immediately branded the pact a 'giant step in the wrong direction'. The Japanese had been pressing for the domestic content rules to stay at the present 50 per cent. The Japanese will be at a disadvantage relative to the Big Three because their local content is generally less than their North American rivals now, and because the Big Three have a much larger existing manufacturing base in Mexico, which under Nafta they will be able to include for domestic content purposes. Of the Japanese, only Nissan currently builds vehicles in Mexico, making some 142,000 units a year, compared with 192,000 for General Motors, 220,000 for Ford and 194,000 for Chrysler. The Japanese will therefore have to increase their North American content significantly, which they complain will mean expensive retooling. It remains unclear just how much this will benefit US-owned parts manufacturing companies. The reason is that 350 to 400 Japanese parts companies already have manufacturing operations in the US and the Japanese assemblers, with eight transitional years until the new content rules come fully into effect, seem certain to continue relying heavily on their compatriots. That said, the Japanese assemblers are under strong political pressure to buy more parts from manufacturers located in the US, be they US or Japanese owned. Last January, President Bush made a controversial visit to Japan, accompanied by the chairmen of the Big Three, to pressure the Japanese to buy more from the US and thus reduce the huge Japanese surplus on auto trade with the US. The Japanese agreed to increase purchases of US parts from Dollars 10bn in 1991 to Dollars 19bn in 1994. Most of this is expected to go into cars built in America for the local market, rather than being US parts exports to Japan. However, precisely what constitutes 'local content' is currently far from clear - a situation highlighted by the case of Honda Civics built in Canada and sold in the US. According to Honda, these contain 69 per cent North American parts, and should thus qualify for duty free entry to the US under the 50 per cent rule. The US customs service contends they only have a 46 per cent North American content. A key reason for the ruling was that Honda engines which go into the Civics, and which are made in the US, were deemed not to be American because they contained less than 50 per cent local content. Under the customs rules, they were therefore 'rolled down' to count as zero local content. If they contained over 50 per cent, they would be 'rolled up' to be 100 per cent locally manufactured. Nafta promises to inject more rationality into the system. It will do away with 'roll up' and 'roll down' and instead trace individual parts back to their point of origin to establish just how truly North American they are.</p>

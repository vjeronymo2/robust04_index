			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA HOPES TO GET OIL AND GAS FROM OTHER SOVIET REPUBLICS WILLING TO  BARTER;  </P> <P> SECESSION: THE BREAKAWAY STATE WOULD TRADE MILK AND MEAT. BUT DELIVERY IS A  MAJOR PROBLEM.  </P> <P> VILNIUS, Soviet Union -- With hopes for substantial help from the West fading,  Lithuanian leaders set their sights Wednesday on obtaining oil and gas from  Soviet republics and cities willing to defy Moscow's embargo orders in exchange  for milk and meat.  </P> <P> But Western analysts noted that even those regions willing to risk the  Kremlin's wrath, either because they politically support Lithuania or because  they want to obtain the scarce food supplies, are likely to face serious  difficulties in delivering oil or gas supplies to the Baltic republic: The  country's pipelines, roads and railways are centrally controlled.  </P> <P> The Vilnius government, meanwhile, issued a grim report about the future impact  of the Moscow-imposed economic sanctions, noting that food shortages affecting  items such as sugar, salt, rice and margarine are likely and warning that the  republic could only guarantee salaries, pension checks and student grants for  month of April.  </P> <P> Lithuanian leaders said they are searching for new solutions in the face of the  U.S. failure to lend significant material or moral support to the republic,  which declared its independence from the Soviet Union on March 11 and is now  facing a Kremlin-imposed oil and natural gas embargo.  </P> <P> "One opinion is that the United States must support (President Mikhail S.)  Gorbachev so democratic processes can take place in the Soviet Union," said  Lithuanian legislator Virgilijius Chapaitis in an interview. "But the  Lithuanian issue shows that when democratic processes are really taking place,  they are prevented."  </P> <P> President Bush said Tuesday that he is adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward  the Lithuanian struggle before deciding whether to impose sanctions because he  does not want to act against the Soviet Union in a way that could damage  Gorbachev's power base.  </P> <P> His position prompted bitterness here, in part because the United States long  encouraged Lithuanian nationalists by its public refusal to recognize the  republic's forcible 1940 incorporation into the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But that traditional policy of support for Lithuania and its sister Baltic  republics of Latvia and Estonia is in conflict with Washington's current desire  to promote Gorbachev and to make use of an improved political climate to  achieve strides in superpower relations.  </P> <P> Lithuanians agreed that they understand but added that they are nevertheless  disappointed.  </P> <P> "We would like to see this relationship (between Washington and Moscow)  prosper, of course, but not at our expense," Deputy President Ceslovas  Stankevicius said in an interview. He said he would like the United States, at  the very least, to seek guarantees from Moscow that it would not block  alternative supplies of oil and gas from reaching Lithuania.  </P> <P> "I find it hard to believe that the United States of America will really refuse  to help," he said. "It will be catastrophic if the West washes their hands of  us, catastrophic for Lithuania, for perestroika (restructuring) and for all the  things Western countries want to see happen in the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov spoke informally Wednesday, meanwhile,  with a group of journalists and deputies from the Lithuanian Parliament in the  lobby of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow during a break in hearings. He reiterated  previous demands that Lithuania repeal its independence-oriented laws, the  journalists reported. The Soviet Union so far has refused requests from  Lithuania to open negotiations as a way out of the crisis.  </P> <P> That position also was restated Wednesday by Yevgeny M. Primakov, one of  Gorbachev's closest advisers, who told the official news agency Tass that talks  could begin "only if Lithuania withdraws to the March 10 line, i.e., the day  before Lithuania proclaimed independence."  </P> <P> He said the Lithuanian declaration of independence could not be considered  serious because it was taken without due consideration, an apparent reference  to Moscow's position that a republic-wide referendum on the issue should have  been held.  </P> <P> "Crucial decisions that affect not only the fate of perestroika in the Soviet  Union but also stability in the world cannot be taken all of a sudden," he told  Tass.  </P> <P> Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, whose weeklong trip to  Scandinavia yielded little but words of encouragement, was put in charge of a  new committee set up to devise ways around the Moscow blockade.  </P> <P> "We've been talking a lot, and we haven't come up with anything concrete yet.  Enough talking. Let's really get something done," Prunskiene told Parliament on  Wednesday in announcing the latest strategy.  </P> <P> She said Lithuania is seeking independent economic ties with the cities of  Moscow, Leningrad and Lvov, in the western Ukraine.  </P> <P> "Lithuania could supply them with meat and milk in exchange for the goods that  we need," she said, noting that Lithuania produces all of its meat and dairy  needs.  </P> <P> In addition, she said, a Lithuanian delegation will be traveling to Eastern  Europe this week to seek trading partners.  </P> <P> Deputy Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas told Parliament that 7,500 factory  workers have been laid off their jobs to date but that all would be receiving  vacation pay until the end of April. He said 46 Lithuanian factories currently  are working at a reduced production rates.  </P> <P> The number of furloughed workers, however, would jump to 35,000 at the  beginning of May, he said, adding that at that point the government could no  longer guarantee salaries, pensions or student grants.  </P> <P> He said the building industry is "in a catastrophe" due to a lack of metal  reaching the republic and warned that shortages could be expected in cooking  oil, margarine, sugar, salt, flour, rice and cereals. He also noted that  Lithuania is considering halting exports of 8,000 tons of meat a month to  Moscow and 4,000 tons a month to Leningrad, as well as milk exports to the two  cities. The republic already has stopped the export of manufactured goods to  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The media in Lithuania reported that food hoarding is occurring in some areas.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian Parliament, meanwhile, passed a law giving the government  emergency power to impose legal restrictions for up to a month to deal with the  blockade, including the right to fine anyone violating rationing restrictions  on oil products 500 to 800 rubles (about $800 to $1,300 at the official  exchange rate.)  </P> <P> For the moment, the fact that no country appears willing to help is still  angering many in this capital city.  </P> <P> Commented 22-year-old Vilana Pilinkaite, an art history student drinking plum  juice in the popular Cafe Ensemble a few steps from Vilnius University:  </P> <P> "The West's failure to address this economic blockade is the equivalent of a  moral blockade by the West," she said, "and that is a crime also."  </P> <P> Schrader, a free-lance journalist, reported from Vilnius and Times staff writer  Hamilton from Moscow.  </P></p>

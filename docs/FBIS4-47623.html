			<p>SUMMARY                                           The recent rise in the yen appears to be putting pressure on the  Japanese Government to step up efforts to resolve trade friction  with the United States and take steps to reduce Japan's trade  surplus.  However, the government appears to have no detailed  strategy for breaking the impasse and remains firmly opposed to  the objective criteria demanded by the United States.  Moreover,  the weak political position of the minority coalition means that  progress on areas of interest to Washington in the framework  talks is likely to remain slow.                                   END SUMMARY     The ruling Japanese coalition moved swiftly in the wake of the  recent rise in the yen to reaffirm its commitment to take steps  to open Japanese markets, reduce Japan's trade surplus and defuse  trade tensions with the United States.  On 30 April, two days  after they took office, cabinet ministers in charge of economic  affairs held an emergency meeting to discuss how to deal with the  yen's surge, according to a Kyodo report the same day.  At the  meeting, they reportedly agreed on the need to devise concrete  measures to open Japanese markets and come up with tax reform  proposals.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai reportedly  told the press after the meeting that the ministers agreed that  spurring domestic demand and reducing Japan's trade surplus,  especially the surplus with the United States, would help  stabilize the yen.  The 5 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported that  the new government believed that it was "essential" to implement  "structural economic reform, including deregulation" to halt the  yen's rise.  The article indicated that Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata planned to meet with administrative vice ministers in all of  the government ministries to urge them to draw up "positive"  steps to deregulate the economy and to meet with cabinet  ministers responsible for economic affairs to discuss the issue.     Concern over the yen's rise may also be reducing--at least  somewhat--resistance to deregulation and market opening measures  in parts of the bureaucracy.  The 11 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun  quoted an unnamed Ministry of Finance source as worrying that if  the market-opening package that Tokyo has promised to compile by  the end of June "falls short of U.S. demands," Washington might  attempt to drive up the yen further--a move that, the source  reportedly said, would "dampen" the Japanese economy and slow  Japan's recovery from its current recession.     Continued Opposition to Targets     However, the government appears to have few new ideas on how to  defuse trade tensions with Washington.  Both the cabinet and the  bureaucracy appear to remain firmly opposed to Washington's  demand for setting objective criteria to measure Japan's trade  performance, especially if these criteria might be interpreted as  numerical targets.     -- Minister of International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata, for  example, has recently spoken out against targets on a number of  occasions.  In an interview in the 29 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun,  he stated that the government could not set targets to reduce  Japan's trade surplus because the surplus was "largely" caused by  the activities of private enterprises.  During meetings with  German Economic Minister Guenther Rexrodt on the margins of a 5-7  May Muenster Conference on East-West Economic Relations in  Warsaw, Hata apparently solicited Germany's support for Japan's  stance on targets, stating that Tokyo opposed the targets because  "they are linked to managed trade" (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 8 May).  Hata also reportedly alluded to Tokyo's opposition to targets  during meetings with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on the margins  of the same meeting.  According to the 7 May Yomiuri Shimbun,  Hata told Brown that while Tokyo wants to conclude the U.S.-Japan  framework talks, it did not want to do so in a way that "could  result in managed trade" --a formulation Tokyo uses to  characterize the use of targets.     -- A 25 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun report quoted unnamed Ministry  of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials as stating that Japan "has  not changed its principle that 'numerical targets' should never  be accepted."     While some senior officials have called for flexibility on the  issue of objective criteria, they, too, appear to have no clear  idea of how to define the criteria in ways acceptable to both  Washington and Tokyo.  For example, Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa stated in a 30 April Yomiuri Shimbun interview that it  is "important for Japan to "flesh out the 'objective criteria'  demanded by the United States."  He gave no details of what  proposals Tokyo might make, indicating only that in the process  of defining objective criteria, Japan "should not relent on its  principle of opposing any numerical targets."  Similarly, Vice  Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu,  told the 11 April Nikkei Weekly that while he remained opposed to  the setting of numerical targets, he believed that Washington and  Tokyo should break out of the "vicious circle" in which  Washington demands targets and Tokyo rejects them.  He said that  both sides should seek a "third path" somewhere between what he  characterized as Washington's "results-oriented" approach and  Tokyo's "process-oriented approach."  He offered no ideas,  however, as to what this third path might be.     Slow Progress on Deregulation     The Japanese press has provided little insight into progress on  Tokyo's promise, made in its 29 March market opening proposal, to  deregulate portions of the Japanese economy.  Available reporting  suggests that this progress is slow and that many plans may not  have progressed beyond the study stage.  A 4 May Nihon Keizai  Shimbun article reported that the government had drawn up a  "guideline" for the deregulation measures it has committed itself  to draw up by the end of June.  According to the article, this  guideline calls for the "review" of 51 regulations in 16 separate  areas, including a proposal for abolishing, in stages, the Large-  Scale Retail Stores Law which limits the operations of larger  retail stores.  The report indicated that this guideline was only  the "foundation" for intra-governmental discussions of specific  measures.  It added, without providing details, that many of the  specific measures were likely to encounter opposition from the  bureaucracy.     Among the deregulation measures that have been announced are some  that are likely to have little effect on increasing Japanese  imports.  For example, according to an 11 May Kyodo report, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) decided on 11  May to abolish regulations requiring Japanese exports to be  inspected for quality before being shipped overseas.     Opposition to New Stimulus Measures     At the same time, portions of the Japanese bureaucracy,  especially the Ministry of Finance (MOF), appear to be gearing up  to resist any new U.S. or European pressure for Tokyo to  implement additional measures to stimulate the Japanese economy  and promote domestic demand beyond those incorporated in the  fiscal year 1994 budget now before the Japanese Diet.     -- Vice Minister of Finance Jiro Saito reportedly told a 21 April  news conference that Japan would respond to an International  Monetary Fund report calling for additional Japanese measures to  stimulate its faltering economy by taking "continued measures and  not additional ones" (Kyodo, 21 April).     -- The 21 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted unnamed Finance  Ministry sources as expressing concern that Washington might ask  Japan to draw up additional measures to stimulate the Japanese  economy that MOF did not consider necessary.     -- Governor of the Bank of Japan Yasushi Mieno argued, during a  speech on 19 April, that additional macroeconomic measures will  not help Japan curb its trade surplus, but might overheat the  Japanese economy, according to a Kyodo report that day.  He  reportedly argued that if Japan adopts an "overly ambitions  macroeconomic policy to rectify its external imbalances, this may  well result in inflation and overheated economic activity."     -- Ryutaro Komiya, a professor at Aoyama Gakuin University with  close ties to the government--he is director general of the  Research Institute of International Trade and Industry, a  research arm of MITI--appeared to agree with Mieno's line of  argument.  In an interview in the 19 April Asahi Shimbun, he  stated that further fiscal measures may "destabilize" rather than  stimulate the Japanese economy.     Tax Reform     The ruling coalition appears to have no clear strategy to deal  with the opposition that any tax reform proposals it puts forward  will probably encounter in the Diet, especially from the Social  Democratic Party of Japan.  Speaking about tax reform in his  policy speech before the Diet on 10 May, Prime Minister Hata  appeared to go no further than the vague wording of the policy  agreement hammered out by the ruling coalition parties, including  the SDPJ, before the SDPJ seceded from the coalition.  Hata spoke  of the need to institute "sweeping tax reform" in order "to  actively develop welfare policies" to support an "aging society,"  while at the same time "giving consideration to improving the  fiscal structure . . . and ensuring fiscal sources to support tax  reduction."  The 11 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the  Tax System Research Council was studying possible compromise  reform proposals that might gain SDPJ support, including a plan  that would incorporate both an income tax and a system of  selected increases in the consumption tax.  Under this plan,  according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the consumption tax on food  would remain low in accordance with proposals supported by the  SDPJ.     Outlook     The minority coalition's political weakness will probably prevent  it from taking any bold steps or making any substantial progress  in any of the areas of interest to the United States in the  framework talks--especially on the more controversial issues,  such as tax reform.  At the same time, however, the coalition  will probably be under some political pressure to take steps to  address trade friction with Washington.  Failure to do so would  give the opposition parties, particularly the Liberal Democratic  Party, additional ammunition to attack the coalition in the Diet.  (AUTHOR:  BOUNDS.

This announcement was  made today by the agent from the Federal Public Prosecutor's  Office, Juan Carlos Mendoza Arguelles. The prosecutor refused to  go into detail on the investigation, or to disclose the  identities of the persons interrogated. However, it was  established that they include the warden, Genaro Agustin  Sepulveda Lopez; the deputy director, whose identity was  concealed; and the security commanders, Fernando Gonzalez  Hernandez, Guadalupe Guadarrama, and Fernando Miramontes.    The prison officials are not officially detained, but it was  indicated that, if they prove responsible for the escape, arrest  warrants might be issued against them.    Meanwhile, at the Prisons Directorate in Ciudad Victoria,  its  head, Francisco Castellanos de la Garza, refused to be  interviewed to provide information on the escape. The  authorities have not yet established how and when the drug  trafficker managed to escape without being seen by the guard  personnel.    Ayala Garcia's disappearance was not announced until Monday  afternoon, when the roll was called. He was serving a 17-year  sentence imposed by the seventh district judge, Juan Bonilla  Pizano, for crimes against health.</p>

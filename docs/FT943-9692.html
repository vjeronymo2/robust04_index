			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Cash-stuffed envelopes and Korean business: The changing relationship between government and chaebol FRESH allegations that two big conglomerates paid bribes to win construction orders for state-run nuclear power plants in the early 1990s is only the latest reminder of the widespread corruption that has affected relations between government and business in South Korea. The tight state control over Korea's industrialisation programme since the 1960s gave bureaucrats and politicians unlimited opportunities to demand bribes and kickbacks from companies. The claim that two of the country's largest groups paid Won400m (Pounds 323,000) to a former president of Korea Electric Power, the state-owned electricity monopoly, is seen as a typical example of the corruption that afflicted government. The passing of cash-stuffed 'white envelopes' to officials became an accepted fact of life for companies dependent on government approval for almost all aspects of their business operations. If any company failed to adhere to the system of institutional bribery, it faced the threat of official retribution and the loss of business. Kukje, one of the country's biggest industrial groups, was dismantled on government orders in 1985 after its chairman apparently refused to make political donations to the ruling party. The inauguration last year of President Kim Young-sam, the country's first civilian leader after three decades of military-backed rule, promised an end to the corruption. Mr Kim quickly introduced measures to fight graft. Politicians and senior bureaucrats were forced to disclose their personal assets. The use of anonymous bank accounts was banned to deprive them of the ability to hide bribes. Government auditors conducted extensive investigations of state agencies for evidence of past corruption, notably defence procurement contracts since the late 1980s. Korean industrial groups, or chaebol, initially welcomed the anti-corruption campaign, which they saw as a first step toward economic deregulation by weakening bureaucratic control over their activity. The chaebol also viewed the move as financially beneficial since an estimated 6 per cent of their net profits on average was spent bribing officials. But executives have since come to believe the anti-corruption campaign may prove to be a double-edged sword that could be used to intimidate the chaebol. There are suspicions in boardrooms that the government has selectively used the corruption investigations to punish companies, including Hyundai and Pohang Iron and Steel, whose leaders opposed Mr Kim's presidential campaign in 1992. Mr Kim's government has displayed an ambiguous attitude toward the chaebol. On the one hand, the president recognises their importance as the main engines of the Korean economy and their role as pioneers in penetrating global markets. But Mr Kim also shares the distrust of most Koreans about their economic dominance in the domestic market and the influential position they gained by co-operating closely with the former military government. The dilemma confronting the government is that economic deregulation is likely to provide opportunities for the chaebol to expand their economic strength at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses. The government has adopted a policy of gradually reforming and dismantling the chaebol by weakening cross-holding arrangements among subsidiaries in each industrial group. It also plans to dilute the shareholdings of their family owners through inheritance taxes. But it will take at least one or two decades to achieve these results. In the meantime, the government must find ways to prevent the chaebol from growing more powerful once state controls on industry are lifted. This has not proved easy, and the problem has contributed to delays in proposed economic reforms, including widening the ownership of banks and privatising state companies. The government fears the reforms could allow the chaebol to expand into these sectors unless adequate safeguards are introduced. The threat of launching corruption investigations into the past activities of the chaebol could prove to be at least a short-term solution to keeping the industrial giants in line while further barriers to their expansion are erected.</p>

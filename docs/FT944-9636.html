			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Second-hand goods treated as new - EU consumer product safety laws New EU consumer protection and product safety laws which took force in the UK last month have introduced criminal penalties of which many UK companies are still unaware, according to the Institute of Export's legal advisers. A statutory instrument amending UK company law came into effect on October 3, enforcing a 1992 directive from the Council of Ministers. The main thrust is to extend consumer protection and product safety regulations to second-hand goods which were previously exempt. Second-hand goods are now expected to perform as new, however illogical and unsound this may seem. The new law is enforceable throughout the EU by local trading standards officers. 'No one is sure how big the market is for reconditioned goods, but it must be worth hundreds of millions of pounds domestically,' says Michael Thornton, a partner in Laytons, the institute's solicitors. 'The bulk of the trade is in white goods, brown goods and teltronics.' There are some large and medium-sized companies supplying second-hand and reconditioned goods to world markets - eastern Europe and parts of the Third World are targets - but much of the trade is among hundreds of small businesses, often operating from poorly-sited, retail units long abandoned by high street traders. They repair and recondition consumer durables such as refrigerators, microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners, lawnmowers, television sets, video recorders, cameras, and electronic equipment. Many are sole traders whose business has grown from doing local repairs. 'Our experience so far is that people haven't really thought about whether their commercial terms of trading still protect them,' Thornton says. 'If someone sells second-hand vacuum cleaners, he or she is now treated as a manufacturer of primary goods. 'Moreover, if they import their supplies into the EU already reconditioned, they are now regarded under EU and UK law as their manufacturer.' Previously, no warranties applied to second-hand goods other than the normal ones under the Sale of Goods Act, which meant they had to be basically fit for the purpose for which they were sold. Thornton says a Warrington supplier of reconditioned white goods to Spain has already provided a foretaste of what may be coming. Spain enforced the directive ahead of the UK but the owners of the Warrington company did not worry because they felt its BS5750 quality controls, coupled with a relatively high margin on many of its second-hand goods, would enable them to absorb the costs of putting faults right or giving people their money back. But this proved optimistic once the second-hand goods could be treated by customers as though they had been bought brand new. The company has been forced into insolvency because the cost of rectifying comparatively few faults has wiped out its margin. An additional aspect of the directive which is concerning lawyers is that manufacturers and suppliers must also worry about what use a product might be put to, even if it is far removed from the purpose for which it was sold. Thornton says: 'The seller now has to ask who is going to use these goods, or who might use them. Will this lead to liabilities over and above what they have been used to?' The new regulations also allow the authorities - in the UK's case, local trading standards officers - to force a general recall of goods sold, with attendant publicity, if a recurring fault is found. Prosecution is possible if a supplier fails to recall goods when ordered to do so. Trading standards officers will also be able to contribute details to a Europe-wide database as part of a trans-EU monitoring system. Criminal sanctions now include three months' prison for guilty directors and senior managers and fines of up to Pounds 5,000 on summary conviction. The regulations are silent on penalties that might be imposed by higher courts for conviction on indictment.</p>

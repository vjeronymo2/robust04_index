			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW TENNIS COURTS NOW IN USE AT CROWDED BELL GARDENS HIGH  </P> <P> In the first joint project with the Montebello Unified School District, city  and district officials recently opened new tennis courts at Bell Gardens High  School. The courts are the first step in a much-needed expansion and redesign  of the high school.  </P> <P> "This is a nice first for the city," Bell Gardens High School Principal Frances  Riley said. "It also gave us the psychological go-ahead we need to believe our  school really is going to be expanded and refurbished."  </P> <P> With more than 3,000 students, Bell Gardens High is the most crowded in the  district and has the heaviest Latino enrollment. It also has the campus most in  need of repair.  </P> <P> The school district and the city split the cost of the $450,000 courts, which  will be open to the public after hours. Riley said the school district is  responsible for maintenance.  </P></p>

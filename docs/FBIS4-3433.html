			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 20 (XINHUA) -- A recent visit to  South China by a British business delegation has concluded not  only with the group purchasing supplies from China, but also  with plans to sell British products to the vast mainland market.    Co-hosted by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC)  and British Airways, the business mission representing six major  U.K. consumer goods retailers and manufacturers visited Hong  Kong and factories and retailers in the Pearl River Delta last  week to explore business opportunities.    "We increased our buying during this visit but have also  received an unexpected bonus by ending up with actively selling  our products," said David Oxham, director of Automated Security  (Holdings) Plc, the largest security system company in Britain.    The boom in China's retail market has resulted in the need  for complementary services such as shop surveillance systems, he  said.    Marketing director of Britain's largest eyewear retailers,  Dollond Aitchison Group Plc, Ian Johnson, said "it is  encouraging to see a consumer market on the mainland and not  just infrastructure opportunities."    "This visit has encouraged me to consider returning to  attend  trade fairs in this region rather than only visiting those in  Europe. The Hong Kong optical fair in November could provide  fresh opportunities," Johnson said.    Other areas in which the group saw business potential was in  service development and management training for Chinese  enterprises.    Hong Kong would have an enormous role both directly and as  middle-man for foreign partners in these sectors, the British  delegation members commented.    The delegation also expressed interest in the potential for  establishing joint ventures in China, but considered it  necessary to have the involvement of a Hong Kong partner.    "Hong Kong is necessary for our business to facilitate areas  such as banking, quality control and communications - this  assistance outweighs its costs," said the merchandise director  of a major mail order house, Empire Stores Plc, James Skelsey.  "Most of what we buy in China is sourced through Hong Kong," he  added.</p>

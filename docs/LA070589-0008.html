			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3,965 SOVIET JEWS EMIGRATE IN JUNE AS SURGE CONTINUES  </P> <P> Nearly 4,000 Jews left the Soviet Union in June, a new rise in emigration that  makes the exodus in the first six months of 1989 bigger than that in all of  1988, a resettlement agency said Tuesday.  </P> <P> This year, 20,162 Soviet Jews have been allowed to leave the country, the  Intergovernmental Committee for Migration said, compared to a 1988 total of  20,082 -- the highest outflow since 1980.  </P> <P> In June, 3,965 emigres arrived in Vienna, the second-highest total this year  after April. Of these, 89 decided to go to Israel, committee spokeswoman Regina  Boucault said.  </P> <P> Only 613 emigrants -- 3% of the total -- have chosen to resettle in Israel this  year, she said. Most are going to the United States.  </P> <P> Emigration has soared to twice last year's rate, a move seen partly as a Soviet  effort to improve ties with Israel and the United States.  </P> <P> About 300,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement program began  in 1971. The largest official exodus, 51,328, was recorded in 1979, before the  Soviet intervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West relations.  </P></p>

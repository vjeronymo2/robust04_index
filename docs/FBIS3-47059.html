Saito told a press conference that it is "clearly a  misunderstanding" to assume that Japan has lost its drive in the  trade talks.    He pointed out that there is still a month before February  11  when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill  Clinton meet in Washington.    Japan and the United States have promised to come up with an  agreement on the bilateral framework trade talks by then.    Little progress has been reported so far on the talks, which  is being held under the Japan-U.S. trade framework accord  concluded last July.    Saito also said the trade negotiations are "two-way talks"  and are not aimed at having Japan alone make concessions.    He said there are various points where the United States  should compromise and called for Washington's continued efforts  to boost its competition and to reduce its financial deficit.    Specifically, Saito urged some U.S. states to further open  their markets to foreign companies and businesses, saying  markets in some of the U.S. states are "not as open as some  foreign countries desire" because of the difference in systems  from state to state.</p>

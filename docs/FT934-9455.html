			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Stores brighten Store shares were again a positive feature in the market as two leading brokers suggested that the sector was in for a bright pre-Christmas run. In hefty research notes, Hoare Govett and NatWest Securities both argue that the pick-up in consumer spending - indicated by the most recent consumer spending statistics - will gain momentum into the Christmas shopping period, with upside seen for selected stocks with exposure to the traditional seasonal upswing. While NatWest has some worries about any dampening effect of the Budget later this month, Hoare Govett is more bullish. Analyst Ms Emma Burdett said: 'We believe that the Budget will leave the majority of consumers little worse off and Christmas trading will show a significant improvement on last year.' Both houses favour Kingfisher, up 6 at 646p, Dixons, ahead 2 at 282p, and MFI, 2 1/2 forward at 143p. NatWest also likes Argos, up 6 1/2 at 345p, while Hoare recommends Sears, ahead 2 at 117p. However, the two brokers believe the upswing to be relatively short-lived and take a much more cautious stance on the sector post the Christmas period.</p>

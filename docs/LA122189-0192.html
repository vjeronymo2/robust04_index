			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING/FINANCE  </P> <P> Purchase Completed: Royal Trustco Ltd., the Toronto financial services  conglomerate that bought Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa in mid-October, has  completed its purchase of Pacific First Financial Corp., a Seattle thrift  holding company.  </P> <P> And the Seattle firm has completed its previously announced purchase of the  California-based residential real estate construction lending unit of Old Stone  Bank, a federal S&amp;L based in Providence, R.I.  </P> <P> Like the purchase of Pacific Savings, the purchase of the Old Stone assets will  help Royal Trust establish a thrift operation along the West Coast. Pacific  First Financial operates S&amp;Ls in Washington and Oregon and manages Pacific  Savings, now called Pacific First Bank. Eventually, all thrift operations will  be merged into one and will be run out of Seattle.  </P> <P> As part of its deal to acquire Pacific First Financial, Royal Trust agreed to  sell over time about 1.4 million shares of Glenfed Inc., the Glendale holding  company of Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan. Royal Trust had acquired 9.5%,  or about 2.5 million shares, of Glenfed and must reduce its holdings to less  than 5% to comply with federal law. Compiled by James S. Granelli / Times staff  writer  </P></p>

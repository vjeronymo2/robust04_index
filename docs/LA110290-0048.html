			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONNORS THROWS FOR 5 TOUCHDOWNS IN HART'S 56-0 WIN  </P> <P> Hart High's chances for a Foothill League title may have been seriously  weakened by last week's loss to Schurr, but the game was long forgotten  Thursday night.  </P> <P> Hart regrouped and trounced San Gabriel, 56-0, in a Foothill League game at  Keppel High.  </P> <P> "We wanted to start over," said quarterback Ryan Connors, who completed 12 of  16 passes for 261 yards and five touchdowns despite playing only 1 1/2  quarters.  </P> <P> "We are out of the Foothill League title (picture) and now we just have to put  that behind us and look ahead toward CIF (playoffs)."  </P> <P> Hart improved to 6-3, 3-1 in league play. San Gabriel is 0-9, 0-4.  </P> <P> Connors, who passed for more than 200 yards for the fifth consecutive game and  the sixth time this season to bring his season total to 1,773 yards, threw for  194 yards and three touchdowns in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Brady Vilensky tied his school record with eight point-after kicks. Eight Hart  receivers caught passes. Brian Bernier caught three for 98 yards and two  touchdowns. Doug Distaso caught two touchdown passes for 46 yards.  </P> <P> "It's tough to play games after coming back from a big loss," Hart Coach Mike  Herrington said about last week's 42-35 defeat. "You wonder what it's going to  be like and if you're going to be able to execute."  </P> <P> That was not a problem Thursday night.  </P> <P> Hart led, 42-0, at halftime and did not punt in the game. The Indians rolled up  291 yards in the first half and 430 in the game. San Gabriel was limited to  zero net yardage in the first half.  </P> <P> Connors connected with Bernier on a 29-yard scoring pass to put the Indians  ahead, 7-0, 1 minute 19 seconds into the game.  </P> <P> San Gabriel punter Leo Figueroa bobbled the snap on the Matadors' ensuing  series and Hart's Jami Wolocko recovered at the San Gabriel 19.  </P> <P> Scott Blanchard hauled in a 19-yard pass from Connors to put Hart ahead, 14-0,  with 8:33 remaining in the first period.  </P> <P> Less than 3 1/2 minutes later, Connors hit Distaso on a 44-yard touchdown pass  to increase the margin to 21-0.  </P> <P> Hart added three touchdowns in the second quarter. Connors connected with  Bernier on a nine-yard scoring pass and Distaso caught a 55-yard touchdown pass  to give Hart a 35-0 lead.  </P></p>

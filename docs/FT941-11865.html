			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / People: Miller and Timberlake join forces Tim Miller, formerly marketing director at unit trust company M&amp;G and before that, managing director of Framlington Group, plans to make his own foray into the unit trust business. He has taken a 52 per cent stake in Portfolio Fund Management whose leading unit trust is a 'fund of funds' called Portfolio Trust, which invests in other unit trusts. According to Micropal, which tracks the performance of unit trusts, Portfolio Trust was the top performer of its type last year, and for the two-three- and four-year periods since its launch. It will be relaunched under the name Portfolio Fund of Funds. Richard Timberlake, former managing director of Fidelity Investment Services and currently chairman of Fund Research, will retain a 47 per cent stake in the company and act as investment manager. Miller, who resigned from the board of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance and unit trust industries over its refusal to force fuller fee disclosure, says he is instituting a novel fee structure for his own unit trust. Investors in funds of funds have effectively been double-charged because they pay fees to their own fund manager and to each of the managers of the unit trusts they buy. First, the fund will negotiate reduced fees on the unit trusts it purchases because it will buy in bulk. Second, Miller says, it will offer a US-style fee structure that shrinks as the size of the investment rises and investors buying more than Pounds 100,000 of units will pay no up-front charges. Third, if assets under management grow substantially, the economies of scale will be passed on to unitholders. This is a radical departure from the practice at Miller's former employers where shareholders are the sole beneficiary of growth.</p>

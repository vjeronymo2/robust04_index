			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERARD SCHWARZ: CLASS BENEATH THE BATON  </P> <P> Re Martin Bernheimer's "Confessions of a Talented Workaholic," Nov. 26:  </P> <P> A few years ago, Gerard Schwarz led the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra in a  program of Strauss and Haydn at UCLA. Claudio Arrau was the soloist, performing  works both immediately before and after the intermission.  </P> <P> After completing the Strauss "Burleske," Schwarz followed Arrau onto the stage  for their bows. Schwarz immediately noticed that the volume of applause rose  perceptibly as he appeared. He stopped in his tracks and started to applaud  Arrau -- focusing the attention of the audience upon the soloist.  </P> <P> After the intermission, Arrau returned to the piano, to the applause of the  audience. Schwarz? He deftly weaved his way from the back of the orchestra and  took his position on the podium.  </P> <P> Class. Real class.  </P> <P> MICHAEL T. GEORGE, Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Walid Shuqayr: "Tokyo: Christopher May Carry </F> Practical Proposals"]    [Excerpts] Japanese officials have told AL-HAYAH that U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher's upcoming tour of the  Middle East "may bring U.S. ideas and proposals for the sake of  achieving progress in the bilateral Syrian-Israeli negotiations."    They pointed out that Christopher's recent visit to Syria  "carried a proposal on gradual Israeli withdrawal from the Golan  (Majdal Shams First), but Syria did not accept it. But the  discussions which have taken place may enable him in his  upcoming visit to prepare suitable ideas and proposals regarding  practical measures. In that case, Syria will be willing to  engage in better discussions with him, in a manner leading to  the required progress on this track."    The Japanese officials added: "It seems it is a matter of  time as to when give and take will begin between Syria and  Israel." [passage omitted]    An authoritative [Japanese] Foreign Ministry source, who  asked to remain anonymous, said: "Israeli prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin expressed to us his wish to convey his view to  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in connection with bilateral  negotiations between the two countries, his conception of peace  between them, the regional need for peace, and the need to push  Syria to take further steps in these negotiations and to  participate in the multilaterals. We conveyed the message to  the Syrians. And the Syrians gave their answers to the  Israelis' questions we conveyed to them. But they also wanted  us -- so it seems -- to convey their message and position to the  Americans." [passage omitted]    The source added: "Rabin believes that Syria is not serious  in seeking peace, and he wants it to join him. The Syrians are  not far from saying that the time has come to focus on the  Syrian track. They rejected the Israeli proposals talking of  withdrawing first from one area of the Golan. And their reply  to the specific questions the Japanese delegation conveyed to  Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' about acceptable  proposals regarding the timetable for withdrawal from the Golan  was: The Israelis occupied the Golan Heights in six days...the  withdrawal can be completed in the same period."    The source pointed out that al-Shar' told the Japanese  delegation that "it took Israel less than two years to complete  the withdrawal from the Sinai desert, which is much larger than  the Golan." He was commenting on Israel's talk of a phased  withdrawal from the Golan over eight years.    The Japanese source said that "while Rabin believes Syria is  unwilling to conduct a serious and detailed discussion of the  issues of peace, environment, and economic cooperation in the  framework of the multilaterals, the Syrian side responded  cautiously to Tokyo's encouragement to join the negotiations.  President al-Asad said he is not against them, but Syria will  participate in them only when or after progress has been made in  the bilaterals -- progress that is practical and clear."    The source believes that "the Syrian position is tactical.  President al-Asad is fully aware that the time has come to make  a decision, and that the historic moment for peace emerged when  he informed U.S. President Bill Clinton at the Geneva summit of  his willingness to establish normal peaceful relations with  Israel. But he wants a high price for that. He knows that Rabin  is willing to relinquish all the Golan gradually and to  demilitarize the border. But he wants more than what Rabin is  proposing. Maybe he wants clear guarantees."</p>

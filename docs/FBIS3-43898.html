			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 18 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] would get 70.3 per cent of votes in the coming  elections if its support in the TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana,  Venda, Ciskei] states was taken into account, according to the  Human Sciences Research Council [HSRC]. In a statement on  Tuesday the HSRC said it had processed data not included in its  November/December survey which put the ANC's support at 67 per  cent.    The National Party's support was 15.5 per cent compared to  tte HSRC's earlier estimate of 17 per cent without taking the  TBVC states into consideration. The Inkatha Freedom Party could  count on 4.5 per cent, compared to the previous six per cent  forecast.    The Conservative Party's support remained at three per cent,  while support for other right-wing parties slipped from two per  cent to 1.8 per cent, taking the TBVc states into account.    The "large discrepancy" between the ANC's support in the PWV  region (71 per cent) and nationally (67 per cent, excluding TBVC  states) was largely due to the influence of Natal-kwaZulu and  the Western Cape, the statement said.    The ANC was the largest party in natal but obtained only 50  per cent of the vote, while in the Western Cape the ANC was the  party chosen by 36 per cent of those surveyed.    Spoilt papers were a "very serious prospect" and the HSRC  was  attempting to encourage and assist voter education efforts.</p>

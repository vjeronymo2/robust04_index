			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST : LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS PLEASED WITH 7% DROP IN WATER USE IN MAY  </P> <P> Long Beach water use declined in May by 7% from the previous year, cheering  Water Department officials who have urged residents to cut back on their water  use.  </P> <P> "This overall just shows people are consistently saving as opposed to last  year," said Bob Cole, assistant general manager of the Long Beach Water  Department.  </P> <P> "The response has been great."  </P> <P> Even before the call for voluntary conservation efforts went out last month,  local water customers were cutting back, according to Water Department figures,  which show that April use was 8% below the previous year.  </P> <P> The department gets 60% of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of  Southern California, which is trying to conserve water in the fourth year of a  statewide drought. The remaining 40% comes from local ground water wells, which  have remained at adequate levels, Cole said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MALAYSIA;  </P> <P> U.S. TEAM TO CHECK MYSTERY SKELETONS  </P> <P> U.S. military experts will travel to Malaysia soon to find out if a collection  of skeletons -- said to be remains of American servicemen killed in Vietnam --  are indeed those of humans, a Pentagon spokesman said in Washington. The  remains and 28 U.S. Army identification tags were found on a boat carrying nine  Vietnamese men that landed Monday in a southeastern coastal village in  Malaysia. There is some speculation that the Vietnamese, possibly desperate to  resettle in the United States, may have used the MIA ploy to induce U.S.  authorities to grant them refuge.  </P></p>

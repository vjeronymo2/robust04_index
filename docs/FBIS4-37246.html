			<p>BFN     [Text] House of representatives delegations left Sanaa  this morning for visits to fraternal Arab states.    A delegation led by brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab, member of  the  House Speakership Council, and includes brothers Ahmad Muhammad  Sufan, Mansur Ahmad Sayf, and 'Abdallah al-Mukaybili travelled  to the Arab Maghreb.    Another delegation, led by brother Yahya Mansur Abu-Isba',  chairman of the Public Liberties and Human Rights Committee in  the House, and including Deputies brothers Dr. 'Abdallah 'Ali  al-Maqalih and Mahdi Abu-Bakr al-Hamid, headed for Egypt, Libya,  Sudan, and Djibouti. A third delegation left for Syria and  Lebanon. It is led by Deputy brother Sultan al-Barakani and  includes brothers 'Abbas 'Ali al-Mu'ayyad and Ahmad al-Hayyan.  A fourth team left for Iraq and Jordan. It is headed by  brother Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kidsi and includes brothers  Muhammad Naji 'Allaw and 'Abduh Muhammad al-Kanabi.    The delegations are going abroad to supplement Yemeni  diplomacy and convey a true picture of developments in Yemen to  fraternal Arab parliaments, with a view to securing sustained  support for Yemeni unity as a pan-Arab gain, as well as a  national Yemeni achievement. The aim is also to make it clear  that there are separatist elements out to impose secession by  force of arms.    In a predeparture statement to the Yemeni News Agency,  SABA',  brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud explained the mission assigned  to the delegations sent out by the House to the Arab states.  They are carrying messages from the brother speaker to his Arab  counterparts spelling out our country's stance on current  developments in Yemen and the dimensions of the anti-unity  conspiracy. These contacts are necessitated by bonds of Arab  brotherhood, since Yemeni unity is not an exclusively Yemeni  concern, but a brick in the edifice of Arab unity. As such,  Yemeni unity is as much an Arab concern as it is an affair  relevant to Arab masses and states, he added.    Brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab said he hoped these delegations will  accomplish their task.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Books: Thrills in the bond market ZERO COUPON by Paul Erdman Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 350 pages You have to admire Paul Erdman's nerve in writing a thriller based on municipal bonds. As a character in his story says, they are 'so mundane, so tedious, so pedestrian'. At least the author managed to find a catchier title than Capital Appreciation Bonds, the alternative description of the eponymous income-free securities. To be fair, the novel does not by any means entirely revolve around zero coupon munis. It races along at a fair lick unless you unwisely stop to consider fault lines in the plot. Much more extravagantly it climaxes with a late 1995 German political crisis in which the chancellor is exposed for corruption, the Bundesbank chairman resigns and his successor shoots himself for failing to save the D-Mark, which suffers the same fate as sterling in September 1992. Norman Lamont, at least, would enjoy this. After three years in jail for a junk bond scam, Willy Saxon emerges in mid-1995 with Dollars 75m stashed away in Liechtenstein and an ambition to get right back into the game. He does not want to end up like poor old Bernie Cornfeld, a dead-end 46-year-old surrounded by champagne and girls. So without even a tuxedo to his name, he moves into typical financial thrillerland - San Francisco - where everybody can be bribed, bullied, blackmailed or laid. He has spent most of his time in the correctional institution in the library, picking up information technology knowhow, and before you can say Sparcserver workstation he is corrupting cronies in the kind of Californian restaurant where Pinot Grigio is considered the last word in sophistication. Pausing only to explain to the occasional glamorous billionaire widow the virtues of tax-free municipal bonds, Saxon is soon jetsetting across the globe. Erdman's brand name-dropping style, with regular mention of real people, suffers from poor research, however. Saxon travels on an airline named British Air, and for some reason thinks George Soros runs Quantum Fund out of London rather than New York. Erdman also believes that the City of London would be open for business on Monday January 2. Incidentally, names like Claridge's, Barron's, Warren Buffett and (occasionally) Deutsche Bank are wrongly spelt. The plot revolves around Saxon's plans to buy a collapsing investment bank called Prescott &amp; Quackenbush and turn it into an aggressive trader in derivatives. Along the way he picks up a stake in a dodgy credit rating agency to help him stuff a dozy investment institution with fraudulent bonds. But his big coup is to turn a hastily-assembled collection of former jailbirds and disgraced ex-Volkswagen currency traders into the hottest derivatives team since the days of Liar's Poker. When Germany suffers political and financial collapse just after Christmas they are somehow the only people to notice and short the DM before the markets close for the New Year holiday. Poor old George Soros is left trailing behind, although at least by this time he has moved as far as New Jersey. There is the required overdose of financial mumbo-jumbo, including talk of non-linear analysis through neural networks and genetic algorithms, and trading in a variety of semi-plausible products ranging from reverse floaters to index currency option notes. Only occasionally, fortunately, are there paragraphs of turgid explanation. Zero coupon bonds are, of course, by no means a figment of the lurid novelist's imagination although the variant described here appears to be more on the lines of the zero coupon perpetuals occasionally touted around the bond markets on April 1. Paul Erdman puts the nonsense over with considerable style, and the book could help to while away a flight on British Air, whatever that may be. But after Willy Saxon pockets his profit the grim fate of Germany is left to the imagination, just as it arouses the reader's curiosity: better not read it on Lufthansa.</p>

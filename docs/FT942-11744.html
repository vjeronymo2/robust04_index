			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: OMV posts record Sch4.4bn loss OMV, the Austrian oil, gas and chemicals group, yesterday reported record losses for 1993 but a move back to profit in the first quarter of this year. It said losses for last year totalled Sch4.43bn (Dollars 369m), against Sch604.6m in 1992, on turnover of Sch81.93bn, down about 1 per cent. Losses on ordinary activity were Sch924m, compared with Sch264.5m in 1992. But an extraordinary loss of Sch3.49bn, to cover restructuring, inflated the deficit. There will be no dividend for 1993. Positive developments in the gas and trading branches, and in refining in the second half of the year, could not compensate for losses in the chemicals and plastics branches, Mr Richard Schenz, chairman, said. The group has gone through a restructuring with plant closures and cost-cutting. More than 900 jobs were cut leaving the group workforce at 11,743 at the end of 1993. Gas and trading generated operating profits of Sch1.44bn and Sch160m respectively, with all other activities showing a loss. The biggest deficit was in the plastics division with an operating loss of Sch1.2bn. The group made a Sch190m pre-tax profit for the first quarter of this year, reflecting mainly the positive effect of restructuring over the past two years, Mr Schenz said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Address to the Reader": "We Are With You Again"] </F>   [Text] Hello, dear readers. After a month-and-a-half-long  absence, UTRO finally has found its way into your mail box. The  interruption was hard for both you and us. Our telephones rang  off the hook: What has happened to the newspaper? We once heard  crying on the other end of the line: "I am recovering from a  heart attack... You are all I have. And now the box is empty--so  I do not have you anymore either, do I?..." Most calls, however,  ended with the sentence: "Hold on, we are with you!"    The cause of the protracted silence hardly needs any  comment.  We are not living in a desert, and everybody hears about  stoppages of giant enterprises, the bankruptcy of entire  industrial sectors, and delinquency files. We have also been  unable to escape this fate--no paper or money. It is doubly  disappointing that the oxygen vent was closed at the time the  subscription campaign began... But even on the brink of disaster  we found out once again that there are enough good people in the  world for whom the notion "credit of confidence" is not an empty  sound. They believe in the newspaper's vitality, and this is why  we are with you today.    We are still struggling with tremendous hardships. But we  want to assure our loyal readers, like-minded in spirit, that  the newspaper will try to not let you down in your expectations.  It will honestly inform you about everything that is happening  in the kray. We will continue to delve into such topics as  economics and politics, social protection and ecology, culture  and science, spirituality and human rights. Such notions as work  and morality, honor and conscience, love for the Motherland and  duty--everything that makes the nation that preaches them  great--will never get rusty or lose their value in the eyes of  our authors. Neither will we ignore the shoots of healthy  entrepreneurship, the reforms taking root, and the normal  market, as well the as strengthening ties with the countries of  the Asia-Pacific region. There is only one item that is banned  here--dirt. In every sense of this word--whether it is  distorting the substance of the issue in published materials or  catering to unhealthy instincts--in short, catering to the  "consumer."    With the right of a friend, the newspaper expects of its  allies-readers one thing--patience and tolerance. Initially we  will not be able to publish five times a week--we will somewhat  reduce the periodicity and will have an issue on Tuesday,  Thursday, and Saturday. And let the reader not be offended by  some excessive advertising--we cannot survive without it  economically. Moreover, we invite the active business  cooperation of businessmen, entrepreneurs, and economic  managers. We will gladly publish any private advertisement for a  moderate price.    In short, let us shake hands for friendship. Stay with us,  friends, for the second half of the year. Our index is 53402.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow Feb 24 TASS--If facilities for recycling  liquid radioactive waste is not built in Russia's Far East  within the next two months, Russia will possibly have to dump  this waste in the Sea of Japan again in order to avert an  ecological disaster.    A choice whether to build the appropriate recycling  facilities estimated at about $10 million or to dump the waste  in the sea is to be made by the Russian Government, according to  Viktor Kutsenko, head of the Russian Ministry for Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources' Department for Ecological  Safety. He also said the government was presently considering a  request from the ministry to immediately solve the issue of  waste disposal.    Taking into account the current financial difficulties and  therefore uncertainty over the recycling facilities project,  Russia did not join the London convention on a complete ban on  dumping radioactive and industrial wastes in the seas, which  took effect from 21 February.    Not acceding to the convention, Russia is losing  politically,  believes Valeriy Chelyukanov, a senior official at the Russian  Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environment Monitoring.  However, from the point of view of ecological safety, this  decision was fully justified. If something happens to the  tanker overloaded with liquid radioactive waste, which is now at  moorage in the Zolotoy Rog bay near Vladivostok, the environment  and people's health will be heavily damaged.    Waste dumping in the sea does not threaten a catastrophe. A  high-speed tanker dumps its load in the open sea, and the wastes  are instantly dissolved in the water. Taking into consideration  the present radioactive contamination of the Sea of Japan,  "Russia's supplement" will be negligible and not cause any  damage for the environment.</p>

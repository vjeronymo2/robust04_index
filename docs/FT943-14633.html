			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei's modest decline as yen rise goes on The yen's renewed rise against the dollar pushed share prices lower, but declines were smaller than most investors expected, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. There were reports that public investment funds were buying equities to trim inflated cash positions as the Nikkei 225 average recovered from a morning low of 20,294.06 to close off 72.61 at 20,400.48, down for the fifth consecutive session but after a peak of 20,419.48 during the last 20 minutes. In New York, on Monday, the dollar had fallen to the Y96 level. This prompted new worries in Tokyo over the effect on Japan's exporters, and on the economy which has started to show the first signs of recovery; in Tokyo the dollar finally closed Y1.48 lower at Y97.07, in spite of dollar buying intervention by the Bank of Japan. Market participants were reluctant to select a level to which the yen would rise. 'We have a real dollar crisis on our hands and it all depends on how much the Federal Reserve Bank is going to take,' said Mr Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Baring Securities. He added that an easing of the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar would be unlikely until data revealing a worsening of the Japanese economy was released. Volume rose from 210m to 303m shares. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 9.01 to 1,647.15 while the Nikkei 300 fell 1.27 to 299.47. Losers outnumbered gainers by 764 to 228 with 174 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.64 to 1,331.77. High-technology exporters were hit by the yen's rise. Hitachi lost Y10 to Y1,020 while Toshiba declined Y12 to Y789. Sony fell Y80 to Y5,920 and TDK plunged Y110 to Y4,530. Car stocks were also weak, with Nissan Motor down Y15 to Y805 and Honda Motor retreating Y30 to Y1,730. Large capital stocks lost ground, with Kawasaki Steel falling Y5 to Y395. Mitsubishi Oil, the most active issue of the day, jumped Y50 to Y1,200. The company announced that it had discovered a second oil field off the coast of Vietnam, encouraging buying orders. The stock's trading volume amounted for 13 per cent of the first section's activity. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 107.50 to 22,911.15 in volume of 21.8m shares. The OSE average declined for the fifth consecutive day on a decline in export oriented stocks. Roundup The region saw a mix of performances yesterday. HONG KONG bounced 2.3 per cent higher in a technical rebound following the recent sell-off. The Hang Seng index finished up 196.51 at 8,591.45 in turnover that improved to a provisional HKDollars 2.47bn from Monday's final HKDollars 1.82bn. Property issues, worst hit in the recent downturn, were among the day's best performers. Cheung Kong and Sun Hung Kai Properties each rose by HKDollars 1.40, to HKDollars 32.20 and HKDollars 44.50 respectively. Hongkong Land gained 50 cents to HKDollars 18.50. SYDNEY was lifted during the afternoon session by favourable results from Advance Bank, up 33 cents at ADollars 9.58, which reported a rise in earnings for the year ending May 31 of 81 per cent. The bank also announced that it was raising the dividend to 50 cents from the previous year's 30 cents. This helped the All Ordinaries index to a gain of 11.7 at 1,972.9, just below an intraday high of 1,973.9. Turnover was Dollars 417m. Among retail stocks the takeover target, Foodland, shed 9 cents to ADollars 4.65 after the Federal Court granted a temporary injunction against Rank Commercial's Dollars 501m bid. Coles Myer, which would have acquired Foodland's Australian assets under the bid, closed 3 cents firmer at ADollars 4.23. SEOUL saw an across-the-board rebound following Monday's falls stemming from the death of the North Korean president, Kim Il-sung. The composite stock index added 11.75 to 960.59. Real estate and property issues spearheaded the rises. Pangrim Spinning went limit up, adding Won2,000 to Won68,600. SINGAPORE was firmer, led by bargain hunting in selected shipyard and property stocks while speculators bought shares and warrants of Yeo Hiap Seng on expectations of a takeover by Ng Teng Fong, the property tycoon. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 8.10 to 2,159.35 as YHS shares rose 20 cents to SDollars 3.74. KUALA LUMPUR was mixed as volume shrank to 66m shares, one of its lowest levels this year, as investors shied away from a market lacking direction and foreign interest. The composite index gave up 3.26 to 985.62, dragged down by a 50 cent drop in Telecom Malaysia to MDollars 18.80. Tenaga Nasional fell 10 cents to MDollars 13.20, remaining under pressure from foreign funds switching out of the stock. MANILA was dragged down by a fall in the heavily-weighted stock, PLDT, which lost more than 2 per cent to a year's low of 1,425 pesos. The composite index shed 10.43 to 2,533.32. Turnover rose to 745.02m pesos from 670.9m. BOMBAY rose on selective buying of the country's biggest mutual fund, the the Unit Trust of India. The BSE 30-share index ended up 54.62 or 1.3 per cent at 4,134.79. BANGKOK moved in a tight range with the SET index improving just 1.69 to 1,280.06 as turnover moderated to Bt4.5bn. Brokers commented that many investors remained absent from the market following a no confidence vote in parliament against four government ministers. WELLINGTON reversed a nine-day losing streak, with the NZSE-40 capital index closing up 9.28 at 1,954.79 in low turnover of NZDollars 22.7m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("Golos Armenii" daily), 04/23/94 -- RMK  [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] Minister of Foreign Affairs  Arkadiy Gukasyan held a briefing yesterday, dedicated to the  CSCE Minsk Group meeting in Prague on April 11-15. The Minister  also spoke on the reasons why the meeting between the Armenian,  Azeri and RMK representatives, planned to be held in Moscow on  April 15, failed. According to Mr. Gukasyan, Azerbaijan caused  the failure, by not accepting the Russian cease fire initiative.    A. Gukasyan positively evaluated Jan Eliasson's work and  stressed that the new CSCE Chairman realistically estimates the  opportunities and demonstrates a constructive approach to  resolution of the Karabakh problem. If he continues working in  a similar manner, concrete results will be possible soon.    The Minister stressed the importance of documents on  increasing trust between the conflicting sides, prepared in  Prague. The document will be signed by the CSCE High Officials  Committee. A plan on the initial stage of introducing CSCE  observer mission was also coordinated during the meeting in  Prague.    Mr. Gukasyan stressed once again the importance of  coordinating the Russian, CSCE and UN peace initiatives.</p>

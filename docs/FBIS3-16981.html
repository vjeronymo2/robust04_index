			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yerevan/Moscow March 21 TASS - A group of experts  from the Iranian air forces and civil aviation agency, headed by  General Ali Rezvani, arrived on Monday to the site of a crash of  the Iranian C-130 aircraft which killed 34 people on Friday,  Armenian Vice-President Gagik Arutyunyan told reporters today.    The plane had to fly through the Armenian airspace bound for  Tehran, but deviated 100 kilometres from the route for unknown  reasons and hit the ground several miles of [as received]  Stepanakert, the adminstrative centre of the break-away  Nagorno-Karabakh province of Azerbaijan.    The group of Iranian experts is accompanied by a civil  aviation official of the Commonwealth of Independent States.  According to the vice-president, experts are expected to  complete the investigation and be back in yerevan later in the  day.    The vice president stated that there had been no radio  communication betwen traffic controllers of the Yerevan airport  and the crew of the Iranian plane. Both the traffic controllers  and the crew communicated with a Russian passenger aircraft  which was on its regular flight in the Armenia's airspace at the  moment. Records of these conversations are now being studied by  experts.    Meanwhile, Russian military experts do not exclude a  possibility that the Iranian C-130 plane was on a reconnaissance  mission in Nagorno-Karabakh.    The experts believe that it is most unlikely that the crash  had been caused by the depressurization of the cockpit.    Colonel Aleksey Grekhov, navigator-inspector of the safety  department of the military transport aviation of the Russian air  forces, told ITAR-TASS that "there had not been a single case  when an airplane hit the ground because of depressurization".  According to the colonel, almost all air trafic in the Afghan  war had been carried out by depressurized aircraft "but all  flights were a success unless the planes had been attacked".    The experts are cautious about any resolute conclusions  until  they get answers to some questions. Why did the crew of the  plane have an unusually big number of members (13 instead of a  regular crew of four)? Why did not the plane ask for landing in  Gyandzha or Shamkhor in Azerbaijan where runways of former  Soviet military airfields were big enough for all types of heavy  planes? Why did the plane maintain radio exchange only with a  Russian aircraft and not with any of the ground services?</p>

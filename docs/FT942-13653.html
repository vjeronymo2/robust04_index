			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Markets: Fed casts a dark shadow over sunny profits - Wall Street The first quarter reporting season is in full swing, and judging by the results released so far, US corporate earnings continued to improve during the first three months of this year. Yet, the stock market, which should be delighted by the steady growth in profitability, is anything but: in several notable cases (Motorola, Chrysler, Caterpillar), an impressive first quarter earnings report has prompted heavy selling of shares. The indifferent reaction of investors to good results lately has not been confined to a few big name stocks. Company earnings were mostly strong this week, yet over the first four trading days the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a net 9 points. It seems that these days, there is no pleasing anyone on Wall Street. There is some logic behind the market's capricious behaviour, however. The stock market is always going to struggle to make headway in a week that opens with an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve - especially if the timing of the rate increase (which lifted the Fed funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow from each other, from 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent) catches investors by surprise. It was the second monetary policy tightening within a month, and the third such move since early February. Apart from the fact that higher interest rates tend to make equities look less attractive compared to fixed-income investments, investors' main worry about higher interest rates is that, after a time-lag, the higher cost of borrowing will start to slow the pace of economic and corporate earnings growth, probably by the third or fourth quarter of this year. So, while the current earnings picture may be bright, investors feel that the outlook for earnings is darkening almost daily. As is always the case with stock market investing, the future is more important than the present. Thus, Chrysler reported record first quarter profits on Tuesday that exceeded analysts' expectations, but the car maker's share price dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 48 1/2 in heavy trading. It also explains why shares in Caterpillar fell Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 103 1/2 on Wednesday after the agricultural equipment manufacturer posted equally impressive quarterly earnings. Investors also fear that the Fed is not yet done tightening its monetary screws. The central bank appears determined to prevent the expanding economy from sparking a resurgence in inflation, and three rate increases of a quarter-point each are unlikely to be enough to satisfy the Fed's anti-inflationary desires. If the Fed does move again soon, analysts expect it will be before the next meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee, which is scheduled for May 17. Moreover, some market watchers are warning that the next time it raises rates, the Fed might not be satisfied with just putting up the fed funds rate again. The more important discount rate (the rate at which banks borrow money from the Fed), which has not moved since July 1992, could go up from 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent. That would certainly hammer home the message that the Fed is vigilant against inflation, but it might also inflict a hammer-blow to the stock market's already fragile confidence. Against this background, many analysts on Wall Street are now saying that the current stock market 'correction' has further to go. The Dow has already fallen 8 per cent from its January 31 high of 3,978.36, and the average forecast for the size of the correction has been around 10 per cent, which would ultimately take the Dow down to around 3,580. Yet, with more rate increases expected around the corner and concern about future earnings deepening, those forecasts are being revised, and the majority of analysts are now predicting that the Dow will drop to between 3,400 and 3,200 before the final stage of the correction is completed. That the Dow is not already careering toward those lows has something to do IBM, which this week managed to buck the prevailing trend and release a set of quarterly results that was received rapturously by the stock market. IBM shares, which have languished for so long as investors waited for 'Big Blue' to shake off its blues, jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 after the company reported a profit of Dollars 392m for the first three months of the year. Although comparisons with the same quarter's earnings a year ago were complicated by various special items, the market was clearly delighted with the figures. The sharp rise in IBM shares helped power a 54-point rally by the Dow, and ended a string of four consecutive losing days for the market. Monday    3620.42 - 41.05 Tuesday   3619.82 - 00.60 Wednesday 3598.71 - 21.11 Thursday  3652.54 + 53.83 Friday    3648.68 -  3.86</p>

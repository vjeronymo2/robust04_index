			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Motor Racing: A two-horse roundabout TOMORROW at the newly-rebuilt circuit of Kyalami, South Africa, the lights will flash from red to green and the Formula One motor-racing roundabout will twirl into life once more. The eyes of the 100m-plus global TV audience claimed by the Formula One Constructors Association will be focused on Ayrton Senna and the burlier (though much slimmed down) figure of Nigel Mansell. With Ferrari struggling to retrieve its pride and competitiveness from the managerial and mechanical shambles which have marked the past two years, few believe that this year will see much more than a two-horse race. Senna, still only 31, is coolly committed to securing his fourth world championship in his Marlboro McLaren Honda. He has a fair chance of eclipsing the five championships of the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio. For Mansell, time is running out. At 38, the Englishman knows that this could be his final stab at the title which has taunted him and his blue and yellow Canon Williams-Renault. The doggedness, raw courage and driving skills he displayed last year to become Senna's runner-up are unlikely to survive another season, should there be a repeat of last year's early mechanical unreliability which effectively robbed him of the title. Yet for a time last season it was the famously well-oiled Marlboro McLaren-Honda organisation which was to be seen clinging on with one hand, while scrabbling for the spanners with the other. This is something that Ron Dennis, the team's boss, is adamant will not be repeated this year. After Senna won the opening rounds of the season with ease, Dennis concluded that the McLaren-Honda's superiority was such that the championship was in the bag and the team could concentrate on developing its 1992 car. That was a mistake. By mid-season the Williams-Renault's semi-automatic gearbox had stopped confusing itself; Renault had found more power, and even the other-wordly skills of Senna were unable to hold Mansell at bay. For once, the facade cracked and both partners in McLaren-Honda looked vulnerable: the Honda engine outclassed on power; McLaren's engineers fruitlessly seeking ad hoc chassis 'fixes' like any merely mortal grand prix team. It was, says Dennis, a case of 'a long-term strategy which was inappropriate once it became clear that we had a short-term problem. The most difficult thing to do is bring a grand prix team back to competitiveness in the middle of a season.' All the more impressive, then, that thanks to a blitzkrieg effort both by McLaren and Honda's 7,000-strong research and development engineering establishment in Japan, the team fought back. And last week prime minister John Major, with Senna's victorious MP4/6B racer parked in front of No 10 Downing Street, handed Dennis the 1991 World Constructors' Championship trophy. On his rise from school-leaver mechanic in the Woking, Surrey, area which is still his base, to chief executive of an organisation which employs over 300, Dennis has consciously cultivated a coldly clinical public persona in which the conduct of the business is strongly reflected. In reality, Dennis is a cool but essentially courteous and likeable figure, by no means lacking in humour. Indeed, there lingers about him an impression that he still cannot quite believe his success, and that at midnight, somehow, his technological masterpieces might just turn into pumpkins. This side of Dennis was reflected in the wide-grinned pleasure so evident at Downing Street last week. It will be hidden once more when he and his perfectionist squad of red and white clad technicians (new kit obligatory for every grand prix) watch the lights change tomorrow. To the satisfaction of the world's media and to the delight of sponsors such as Philip Morris, whose Marlboro brand colours are synonymous with McLaren, the characters climbing on to the carousel are as colourful as ever. So are the scripts and sub-plots of this high-speed global soap. Alain Prost, the former world champion and ex-partner (usually sparring) of Senna at McLaren, who was sacked from Ferrari last year after daring to criticise the team, is without a drive at Kyalami, having failed to sew up a deal to drive for Ligier, and perhaps revive the French team's battered reputation now that it is to share the powerful Renault F1 engine with Williams. Jean Alesi, in the aerodynamically revolutionary new Ferrari F92A, and new team-mate Ivan Capelli, had their hopes of improving the fortunes of Ferrari lifted in Thursday's unofficial practice, testing fifth and sixth behind the Williams and McLarens. Camel Benetton Ford, colourful but anything but united last year as its management shifted and sport boss Tom Walkinshaw took over, could upset the applecart if the young German Michael Schumacher can concentrate on his speed instead of contract disputes. And this year, to the further delight of the media, there is a female interest, in the form of Giovanna Amati, the first woman driver to make the F1 grade since Lella Lombardi in the mid-1970s. Already proven in the 'junior' formula to grand prix F3000, la Amati is driving for Brabham. Brabham, however, is one of several teams which are but a shadow of their former selves, ownership and control having long since passed from their world champion and founder, Sir Jack. As ever, money shortages lie at the root of the pressures on smaller GP teams as recession starts to bite even at such normally well-cosseted heels. It could get worse. A well-known Formula One constructor once confided to me that, in comparison with the largesse to be found in grand prix racing, obtaining a licence to print money seemed like a lot of effort for little reward. That was in the early 1980s, since when the sums involved in sponsoring GP teams have accelerated almost as quickly as the cars. The stakes have risen so fast largely because the tobacco industry has had its other promotional avenues closed off. Yet early in February, the European Parliament voted to ban all tobacco advertising. The vote remains a long way from legislation but showed strongly which way the anti-tobacco smoke is blowing. Last season the Marlboro, Gitanes and Camel brands between them supported a total of 18 grand prix teams, providing cash and resources totalling Dollars 100m (Pounds 57m).</p>

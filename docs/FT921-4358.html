			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Canadian threat to hit back at US 'just bluster' THREATS of retaliation against US exports by Canada's prime minister Brian Mulroney were yesterday dismissed as 'just bluster' by a key US senator. A spokesman for Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade sub-committee, said the US would probably take any Canadian counter-retaliation to Gatt. Counter-retaliation for punitive duties on softwood lumber would be 'a blatant violation of Canada's Gatt obligations'. A preliminary Commerce Department ruling on Friday had found an export subsidy of 14.48 per cent on Canadian soft wood shipments was allowable under Gatt, whereas counter-retaliation was not, the spokesman added. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mulroney last Friday blamed 'special interests getting to certain groups of people in the Congress who then are applying pressure on those agencies that depend on them for funding'. Mr Mulroney added: 'I'm not big on gunboat diplomacy, but we are not without our own resources.' Senator Baucus took the lead on the US response to Canada's termination last October of a Softwood Lumber Memorandum of Understanding which led to the Commerce Department finding. Along with 67 other senators, he urged the administration to act on 'the Canadian threat to the US timber industry'. The overwhelming response was just one sign of election year politics at play in US trade policy. The Bush administration has been thrown into turmoil by the challenge of Mr Patrick Buchanan to President Bush. While Mr Bush is retreating to Washington, his surrogates are out on the campaign trail, Mrs Carla Hills, trade representative, making the case for free trade against the protectionist Mr Buchanan. Democrats in Congress say the pace of talks on a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), involving the US, Canada and Mexico, has been slowing since the New Hampshire primary, when the pattern began of the president losing more than one-third of his party's vote to Mr Buchanan or to uncommitted slates. The Democratic primaries have brought the president some luck: the two front-runners, former senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, favour Nafta. But they want 'the right kind of Nafta' with acceptable environmental safeguards and a workers' adjustment programme. These must still be worked out, and time is likely to be too short this year.</p>

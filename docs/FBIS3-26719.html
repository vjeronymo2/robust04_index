The year 1994 is very important and crucial for our country's  efforts to deepen reform. The introduction of successive major  reform measures, such as those designed to establish a market  system and a macroeconomic regulatory and control system, will  lead to some new contradictions and problems. How do we guard  against danger while living in peace and take precautions to  maintain a stable public order? At the beginning of the new  year, this reporter interviewed Shu Huaide, secretary general of  the Central Commission on Politics and Law and director of the  Office of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management  of Public Security [CCCMPS].    [Zhao Haibo] Public order is currently one of the topics of  great concern to the people. The central authorities have  always considered this issue important and have tried to solve  it by every possible means. Would you please discuss the  situation in this respect?    [Shu Huaide] Generally speaking, our country enjoys a stable  public order. This is primarily determined by nationwide  political stability and economic development. However, it  cannot be separated from the attention devoted to the  comprehensive management of public security by the party Central  Committee, the State Council, and party committees and  governments at all levels. As pointed out by a leading central  comrade last July, "public order problems could have been more  serious had we not made relentless efforts to manage public  security comprehensively."    To be sure, we cannot be optimistic about the current state  of public order. Public order in some areas is indeed very bad.  For instance, robberies are on the increase, highway and  railway bandits are running wild, hooligans and evil forces in  some villages and small towns are running rampant in their  neighborhoods and are riding roughshod over the people, illegal  criminal activities such as plundering and stealing state assets  are increasing in oil fields, in mining areas, and along traffic  routes; and social ills such as prostitution, patronizing  prostitutes, drug abuse, and gambling persist despite repeated  efforts to ban them. In light of these salient public order  problems, the CCCMPS successively arranged four special  struggles against "theft," "highway and railway bandits,"  "prostitution and patronizing prostitutes," and the "abduction  and sale of women and children." These struggles have yielded  results for the time being thanks to the vigorous support of  leaders of party committees and governments at all levels and  the broad masses of the people. Specifically, the struggle  against highway and railway bandits launched nationwide since  last March has produced remarkable results, thereby winning  favorable comment from all sectors of society and from the  people.    [Zhao] It has become a common public understanding that  public security should be managed comprehensively.  Nevertheless, people in some areas often do not assume  responsibility although they want a piece of the cake. How  should we change this situation?    [Shu] The key lies in instituting a type of mechanism  consisting of incentives and restraints by which the  responsibility for maintaining political stability and public  order will be genuinely devolved to all departments, units, and  individuals. Last November, the CCCMPS, in conjunction with the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the CPC Central  Committee's Organization Department, the Ministry of Personnel,  and the Ministry of Supervision, formulated "Several Provisions  Regarding the Implementation of a Leadership Responsibility  System for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security,"  which established, as one of the goals for leading party and  government cadres at all levels during their tenures, the  comprehensive management of public security to ensure safety in  all quarters, and which specified this as a criterion for  evaluating job performance and for deciding on promotions,  rewards, and disciplinary actions. The CCCMPS recently jointly  issued a document with the relevant central departments  specifying that individuals named as advanced persons in the  national drive for the comprehensive management of public  security may enjoy treatment comparable to that of provincial-  or ministerial-level model workers. As its next step, the  CCCMPS plans to study and formulate laws and regulations  governing the comprehensive management of public security in an  attempt to define in legal form the responsibility of units and  citizens for maintaining public order.    [Zhao] What are the key tasks in comprehensive management  of public security in 1994?    [Shu] The gradual establishment of a socialist market  economic system and the deepening of reform in the new year will  lead to more complex conditions and heavier burdens in the arena  of public order. We must further strengthen comprehensive  management without slackening our efforts in the least.    While we have a great deal of work to do in 1994, we should  focus on the following six tasks: 1) We should firmly implement  the leadership responsibility system for comprehensive  management of public security, further heighten the sense of  political responsibility for "ensuring safety in all quarters"  among party and government leaders at all levels as well as  among all relevant departments, and strengthen the concept of  duty among cadres and people which says "maintaining public  order is the duty of everybody." 2) We should continue our  focused management approach. We should take account of reality,  pay full heed to popular demands, and focus on improving  outstanding public order problems and on areas where public  order is bad. For instance, in the cities we should first  improve chaotic public order in places where the public mingles  haphazardly -- such as train stations, wharves, cultural and  recreational facilities, and large country fairs. We should  focus on battling illegal criminal activities which disrupt  public order -- such as theft, robbery, prostitution, patronage  of prostitutes, the dissemination of obscene articles, and  market manipulation. 3) We should work hard to solve public  order problems in rural areas, relentlessly fight against  various hooligans and evil forces, further strengthen primary  party and government organizations, and solidify mass prevention  and management teams. 4) We should strengthen education of the  legal system among young people, especially among middle-school  students. 5) We should resettle, assist, and educate people who  are released upon completing their prison terms or who are  discharged from education through labor programs. We should  marshal resources in all sectors of society to create broad  avenues of employment, and should implement responsibility  systems and measures for providing assistance and education. 6)  We should intensify efforts to publicize the need for  comprehensive management of public security, and should  galvanize more cadres, workers, staff members, and people into  conscientiously participating in comprehensive management.    Comprehensive management of public security is the  fundamental solution to our country's public order problems, and  it will play an increasingly important role in maintaining  political stability and public order. I am confident it is  entirely possible to foster long-term social stability in our  country if we firmly implement various measures of  comprehensively managing public security and if we maintain the  current favorable state of political and social stability under  the guidance of the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee and the direct leadership of the  party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core.</p>

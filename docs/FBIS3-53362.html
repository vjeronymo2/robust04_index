[passage omitted]    Earlier, President Jawara had answered journalists'  questions. He expressed his sorrow at leaving this beautiful  country after a pleasant and useful visit that enabled us, the  president said, to have fruitful talks and to sign agreements  between our countries. The Gambian president added that the  trade ministers signed a trade agreement today aimed at  strengthening exchanges in that field between the two countries.    The Gambian president said: As you have seen from the joint  communique, we have specified other areas of cooperation in the  energy, fishing, maritime, and air transportation fields. I  think that all these fields will strengthen existing cooperation  between our countries. Nothing remains except for me to thank  my brother and friend, President Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya,  for the warm welcome and generous and brotherly hospitality that  I and my accompanying delegation received.    President Jawara held a one-on-one session with President  Taya this morning. After the session, the two presidents signed  the final communique, which reflected their identical points of  views on all issues discussed. They expressed their will to  develop and strengthen the friendly relations linking the two  countries. [passage omitted]</p>

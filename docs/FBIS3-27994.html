The ministry said in a statement that the postponement is  due  to a delay in compiling related statistics because the ministry  has to announce data on both December and calendar 1993.    Balance of payments data includes the closely watched  current  account and balance of trade statistics.    The postponement of the release date comes as U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor is visiting Japan on a trade  mission aimed at breaking an impasse in bilateral market-opening  trade talks.    In the framework trade talks, Washington has been demanding  that Japan set numerical targets for imports to help assess  progress in reducing Japan's massive surplus in bilateral trade.    Kantor, accompanied by Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the  National Economic Council and chief negotiator in the talks, is  to meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi  Kumagai on Wednesday.    He is also slated to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  on  Thursday.    The delay in release of December balance of payments data  involves a similar postponement of the release of data on  Japanese equity investments abroad and foreign equity  investments in Japan until Monday, instead of Friday.</p>

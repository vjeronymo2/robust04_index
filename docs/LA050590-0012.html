			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY OF LITHUANIAN NATIONALISM  </P> <P> The article by Frankel and Kux is very much like the articles which were  printed by the Nazis in the 1930s.  </P> <P> Then the mud was slung at the Jewish people. In this article it is slung at  Lithuanians. Note the derogatory adjectives, the hateful tone, the distortion  of facts and one-sided, broad generalizations which are used to arouse  contempt. Hitler built the ghettos based on contempt.  </P> <P> It is disgusting to think that a "historical writer" (Brian D. Kux) is capable  of such bigotry.  </P> <P> Mr. Frankel and Mr. Kux, your writing is more suited to the 1930s.  </P> <P> MELANIE MASKOLIUNAS  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

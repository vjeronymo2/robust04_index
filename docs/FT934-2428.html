			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Private post It is easy to sympathise with Mr Mike Heron, chairman of the UK's Post Office. His comments yesterday about a growing sense of crisis in the organisation and the need to avoid a spiral of decline may be exaggerated. But the frustration caused by the government's inability to make up its mind about the Post Office's future and by continual raiding of its coffers is real enough. Ideally, the Post Office would be privatised. This would free the group to act in a commercial manner. Gone would be the days when investment plans were curbed as a result of being included within the public sector borrowing requirement. The Post Office would also, no doubt, find scope for efficiency among its 180,000 staff. Unfortunately, privatisation does not seem to be on the agenda. Although ministers have been reviewing the options for 18 months, few believe they will back a sell-off. This is largely for political reasons. The government, mindful of its slim parliamentary majority, is anxious to avoid the sort of controversy that surrounded rail privatisation. But ministers should not settle for inaction. Instead, they should embrace a twin-track approach: granting the Post Office greater commercial freedom, while setting up a transparent regulatory structure. First, the Post Office should be free to exploit its existing assets more intensively. It should, for example, be able to use its post offices to distribute a wider range of services. The more the network is used, the less the danger of politically damaging closures. Moreover, though it is unlikely the Post Office can be free of PSBR constraints until it is privatised, there is no reason why it should not come up with imaginative proposals for attracting private finance for new investment. Such a market test for risky new ventures like electronic mail, where the Post Office's capacity to compete has yet to be proved, would in any case be better than splashing out taxpayers' cash. Second, setting up a regulator now should help calm some of the anxieties backbenchers have over privatisation. It would, for example, be possible to work out how to maintain a nationwide delivery service while opening the postal business to greater competition. Such a twin-track approach would not only be desirable in itself. It would also prepare the Post Office for the time when privatisation becomes politically feasible. Ministers cannot afford to go on dithering.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Indians court Sri Lanka 'Sri Lanka looks a much better bet for Indian business than Vietnam', said Mr Jamshyd Godrej, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, summing up prospects for Indian trade and investment in Sri Lanka, Mervyn de Silva writes from Colombo. Mr Godrej was the leader of a 15-member business delegation visiting Sri Lanka. Bilateral trade rose from Dollars 65m in 1989 to just over Dollars 300m (Pounds 205.4m) in 1992 but remains heavily in India's favour. The 1993 figure is likely to exceed Dollars 350m, according to the local chamber of commerce. 'The Indian authorities and big business seem to agree that Indian investment in joint export ventures is the best answer to the widening trade gap. We must try to attract the Indian giants,' said a spokesman for the national chamber of industries. Arvind Mills, a leading Indian textile manufacturer, will set up a Dollars 14m textile mill in the north Colombo free trade zone. Two other Indian projects, an asbestos factory and a steel rolling mill, have also been given ministry approval.</p>

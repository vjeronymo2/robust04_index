			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant shares jump Shares in Goode Durrant jumped 18p to 184p yesterday as the specialist vehicle and equipment hire group said pre-tax profits for the year to April 30 would be ahead of market expectations. There was higher-than-expected demand in its rental businesses since the start of the year, particularly at Northgate, the commercial vehicle hire arm, which saw strong trading growth in a traditionally quiet period. The results are due to be announced in mid-July.</p>

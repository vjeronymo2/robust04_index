			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F> Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky]    [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk is satisfied that the  defense ministers of Ukraine and USA during recent talks  "reached common positions on most issues which today can be  resolved," Kravchuk said at a meeting with Pentagon Chief  Willian Perry on Monday.    Kravchuk also said: "There are issues which cannot be  resolved today, but gradually they can be resolved if there is  willingness to do so."    On the same day the defense ministers of the two countries  Vitaly Radetsky and William Perry signed an agreement on  additional U.S. aid to Ukraine for the liquidation of nuclear  weapons.    As Perry told journalists after the signing ceremony,  Ukraine  will be given an additional $50 million for the dismantling of  nuclear arms. In December last year the USA granted $135  million to Ukraine for that purpose.    Noting that cooperation between the two countries is very  important in the strategical aspect, Perry stressed the  particular significance of interaction between the military  ministries of Ukraine and the USA.    Perry said that an agreement was also reached on "frequent  and close" ties between the general headquarters and leaders of  the military ministries of the two countries.    Radetsky called the fact that with the U.S. and Russian help  Ukraine managed to get out of a nuclear stalemate and sign a  trilateral Moscow statement on the liquidation of nuclear  weapons on its territory "a historic step." He said all  obstacles to Ukraine's joining the treaty on non-proliferation  of nuclear weapons had been eliminated.    Radetsky pointed out that developing cooperation between  Ukraine and the USA promotes both global and regional security.    At a meeting on the same day Perry and Ukrainian  Vice-Premier  Valery Shamrov decided to charge experts with preparing an  agreement or a communique which would reflect a common position  of Ukraine and the USA on nuclear disarmament and cooperation in  the space and rocket field.    Chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary commission on  defense  and state security issues Valentin Lemish told journalists that  probably a bilateral commission will be formed to control the  disarmament process in Ukraine.</p>

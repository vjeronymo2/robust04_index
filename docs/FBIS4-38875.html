			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report in the "Echo" column: "The Tataria </F> Public Discusses Yeltsin's Visit. Nationalists Are Unhappy Over  His Arrival, and Federalists Over His Inattention to Them"]    [Text] After Boris Yeltsin's departure from Kazan the  visit by "the high Moscow guest" continues to be discussed in  public and political organizations of Tataria. Nationalist  movements see Yeltsin's coming as a "meeting between Mintimer  Shaymiyev and the head of a foreign state." For instance,  Tatarstan Independence Party leader Nazib Galeyev explained to  SEGODNYA's correspondent: "Yeltsin is the president of a  neighboring sovereign republic whom we did not really invite and  who cannot resolve any of our internal problems." Activists of  the Solidarity committee raise the question about the failure of  a treaty recently concluded between Moscow and Kazan to  correspond to Tatarstan's fundamental law and believe that  contacts with the Russian authorities cannot be pursued until  after "the treaty has been adjusted to the republic  constitution."    The Tatarstan Republican Party, although it finds that  treaty  "infringes Tatarstan's interests," nonetheless considers Boris  Yeltsin's visit not useless "in light of budget infusions he  promised." Ruzal Yusupov, leader of Tatar republicans,  complained that "now the question is only how much Tatarstan  will get, for instance, from KamAZ [motor works] which Yeltsin  promised to help."    The bloc of "federalist" parties Equality and Legality -- as  local representatives of Russia's Choice call themselves, the  Democratic Party of Russia, the People's Party of Free Russia  (which has dissociated itself from Rutskoy and Lipitskiy and  intends to affiliate with Gaydar) and also the Accord movement,  hoped during Yeltsin's visit to "draw Moscow's attention to the  fact that Tatarstan is being ruled by a union of old party  nomenklatura and the national elite." On the day of  negotiations between Presidents Yeltsin and Shaymiyev the  "federalists" staged pickets at the walls of the Kazan Kremlin  and then used mass media to protest the fact that the Russian  president "did not wish to meet with any representatives of the  independent public."    Virtually all political organizations of Tataria stated  their  discontent with Boris Yeltsin's "limited scope of meetings" in  Kazan. A leader of the Russian Federation Citizens movement,  Vasiliy Barabash, who is senior inspector at the Lenin district  division of the Kazan City Internal Affairs Directorate, said  that plainclothes police were instructed on the day of Boris  Yeltsin's arrival to snatch placards from the pickets of  democratic organizations. According to the inspector, "security  forces from all areas around Kazan and all special task and  militia forces were brought into the city to make sure that  everywhere Yeltsin moves would be through a narrow corridor,  without communicating with the public." Conversations with  "grass-roots citizens," according to Vasiliy Barabash, were  organized in places specially designated by the authorities,  "with people prepared in advance." Republican leader Ruzal  Yusupov said he was sure that "if the Russian leader really  wanted to learn about the actual situation in the republic, he  would not have gone exclusively to show-piece sovkhozes, in the  old tradition of the stagnation era." "This cannot be helped:  Traditions are traditions; after all they are all party people,"  Ruzal Yusupov concluded in a conversation with SEGODNYA's  correspondent.</p>

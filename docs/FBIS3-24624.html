The scientific-production association engaged in  interplanetary flights realizing the need to urgently mend the  situation and assess soberly its prospects in the market of  medical equipment, has started the production of equipment for  disinfection.    The equipment enjoys success but, according to Marina  Polyakova, head of the marketing department of the Kront company  set up by the scientific-production association, because of  money shortage many medical institutions cannot afford such  equipment. Therefore, the newly-fledged businessmen decided to  simply give them several of the new instruments. For instance,  the International Mother-and-Child Care Fund and the St.  Petersburg Children's Home received EKO installations for  preparing disinfectant solutions and plastic boxes for the  treatment of medical instruments.    The value of the gifts (about 2.5 million roubles) is not so  high according to the present standards, but the precedent is  important: among sponsors is the world-famous, but no longer  wealthy space company which actually does not get allocations  from the budget for its conversion and itself experiences  serious financial difficulties.</p>

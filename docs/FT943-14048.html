			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Tory MP in sacking row with whips The government was last night embroiled in a dispute with a ministerial aide who said that whips had lied when they said he was sacked, just days before the cabinet reshuffle. Mr Tim Devlin yesterday insisted that he resigned - in spite of attempts by ministers and whips to persuade him to stay on - in protest against planned defence cuts in his Stockton South constituency. When Mr Devlin, the parliamentary private secretary to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, said he had resigned he was immediately contradicted by Conservative party managers. They took the unprecedented step of saying that he had been dismissed for his 'poor voting record and general ineffectiveness'. Friends of Mr Devlin asked why the whips should sack a ministerial aide when they could remove him from office quietly next week. Last night Mrs Marjorie Simpson, chair of the Stockton South constituency party, said she believed the whips were lying and backed Mr Devlin. The whips' office said Mr Devlin was sacked after he missed four important Commons votes. They said Mr Devlin's dismissal was connected solely with party discipline. Party managers said that with a majority of 15 they were not prepared to allow members of government to 'cherry pick' which votes they were prepared to attend. The whips said the attorney general had been kept informed of Mr Devlin's dismissal and had accepted their judgment. Sir Nicholas's office would not comment. Last night Mr Devlin - who has the reputation of being a rebel within government - said on BBC radio: 'I am staggered. The chief whip and the deputy chief whip Greg Knight and the attorney general have been trying all week to stop me from resigning. It has been rumoured in the press for a few days that I was going to resign. But they announce I am sacked. I find that unbelievable.' Asked whether the whips had been lying, Mr Devlin responded: 'Yes.' Mr Devlin said Sir Nicholas had tried to persuade him to remain and fight his corner in the government. But he felt unable to do so once the defence white paper had revealed the loss of 384 jobs in his constituency. Mr Devlin's removal gave rise to speculation that Sir Nicholas might be dropped from the government in next week's reshuffle. The rumours were fuelled by the announcement that Mr Devlin's duties were to be carried out by Mr Gary Streeter, Tory MP for Plymouth Sutton, who will remain PPS to Sir Derek Spencer, the solicitor general. Party managers denied that the affair would have any effect on Sir Nicholas's future. Mr Devlin has featured in newspaper reports about his lobbying for the release from prison of a man charged in connection with drugs dealing and who was also alleged to have been a police informer. The man left the country after charges were dropped. While the matter was an embarrassment to the attorney general, government advisers made it clear that it had nothing to do with Mr Devlin's return to the backbenches.</p>

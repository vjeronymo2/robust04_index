			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WATER DISTRICT TO REPORT ON GARVEY RESERVOIR  </P> <P> Under pressure from Monterey Park officials and state Sen. Charles M. Calderon  (D-Whittier), the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has agreed  to submit a full environmental impact report before beginning repair work on  Garvey Reservoir, which last year leaked and flooded more than a dozen homes.  </P> <P> The 35-year-old reservoir was shut and drained nearly dry in November, when  divers discovered two cracks in the clay liner.  </P> <P> Since then, the water district has proposed to reinforce the reservoir with  concrete and asphalt lining, dig more wells and install an intricate drainage  system. Repairs would cost an estimated $20 million to $25 million and take a  year to complete.  </P></p>

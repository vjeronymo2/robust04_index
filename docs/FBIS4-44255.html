			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Ireland's Other Agenda"] </F>   [Text] The Anglo-Irish declaration signed by John Major  and Albert Reynolds last December was based, in part, on a  premise which has proved to be completely false. In private,  ministers insisted that the IRA was operationally weak and that  the Republican movement would find it extremely difficult to  renew its campaign of violence once a ceasefire was declared.  The risks involved in wooing Sinn Fein, it was argued, were  worth taking in order to exploit this opportunity.    The IRA's activities in the past six months have made a  mockery of these extravagant notions. Its campaign against  civilians and troops has continued mercilessly; in March, its  mortar assault on Heathrow took the security service completely  by surprise. Soon after, an army helicopter was brought down by  IRA fire in Co Armagh. Further "spectaculars" have been promised  by Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams. On the other side of the  sectarian divide, meanwhile, Loyalist violence has intensified  horribly. The Loughin Island massacre nine days ago was a  brutal reminder that the Loyalist gangs are no less murderous  than their Republican adversaries. Even if Sinn Fein announces  a temporary ceasefire in the next few days -- as some predict --  the paramilitary menace will remain.    The bloodshed of the last six months is clear evidence that  the existing programme of Anglo-Irish diplomacy is not enough.  Constitutional reform in the North -- leading to the  establishment of an administrative assembly by the end of the  year -- should now be at the heart of Mr Major's Irish strategy.  But so too should a full review of the security options open to  ministers.    Too often, the debate on Irish security is reduced to a  sterile argument between the supporters and opponents of  selective internment. In fact, this is only one of many options  which ministers should be investigating -- and by no means the  most important. There is still scope for improved cross-border  arrangements, for instance. British helicopters and cars should  be given greater freedom to pursue suspects into the Republic;  the long-planned extradition reforms in the South should be  completed as swiftly as possible; and liaison between the Royal  Ulster Constabulary [RUC] and the Republic's security forces  should be strengthened.    As we report on today's Agenda page, there are also a number  of basic legislative and procedural steps which could be taken  to increase the pressure on the paramilitaries. Telephone  intercept evidence could be made admissible in court, as it is  in America. The existing powers of specialised investigators to  interrogate suspects involved in terrorism and of the state to  prosecute those who refuse to answer questions could be widened.  The Italian "supergrass" system -- much admired by the RUC --  should be further explored by the British Government.    The potential benefits of these proposals must, of course,  be  weighed against their potential impact upon civil liberties.  But few ministers have shown a real interest in such questions  when they have been raised by Unionist politicians or RUC  officers. The Government remains committed to the belief that  the problems of Ulster can be resolved by Anglo-Irish diplomacy,  and to a fatalistic acceptance that the IRA can never be beaten.  The first assumption is manifestly mistaken; and the second,  contrary to ministers assertions, has yet truly to be tested.</p>

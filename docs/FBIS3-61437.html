Petrov Scientific  Research Institute of Oncology; UDC 551.5 10.4]    [Abstract] One of the authors' previous articles proposed  the possible role of HC compounds in the destruction of the  ozone layer due to photodissociation of HC with the formation of  NO radicals. This article addresses the contribution of HC to  the formation of atmospheric NO. Atmospheric HC content is  seasonably variable (highest concentrations occur in summer) and  depends on the degree of industrialization of a region. HC is  photochemically formed at the surface of bodies of water, and is  dissociated by solar radiation, forming NO radicals. It is  important to determine the rate of photolysis of HC. A slight  dependence of this rate on altitude was found. Data is presented  of ground-level measurements of HC over the course of the day.  It is found that the contribution of HC to the formation of  atmospheric NO is probably small compared to known sources of  NO. However, on individual days when HC content reaches extreme  levels, HC photolysis may lead to the formation of a significant  amount of NO radicals. Consideration of the formation of NO from  HC may be important in solving local problems, in particular, in  the study of air pollution near reservoirs or industrial areas,  key sources of HC. The combustion of organic fuel may be an  important source of atmospheric HC. Tables 2; references 6: 4  Russian, 2 Western.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wellington Wellington Holdings, the polymer products manufacturer floated last March, saw pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 June rise 47 per cent, from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.84m. Turnover rose 9.5 per cent to Pounds 23.3m. The maiden interim dividend is 1.2p. Earnings per share were 6.18p (3.87p), although Mr Brian Kent, chairman, said the figure was not directly comparable with last year's owing to the increase in the number of shares since flotation. On a pro forma basis earnings per share rose 27 per cent to 6.34p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the  regent, today received Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN  secretary general to Yemen. The latest Yemeni developments and  efforts to resolve the conflict were discussed during the  meeting. Brahimi arrived in Amman at dawn today.    Speaking to reporters on his meeting with His Highness Crown  Prince Hasan, Brahimi said:    [Brahimi] First of all, I was very pleased to meet with  his royal highness and to listen to what he said on the subject  of Yemen because Jordan played a role in trying to bring views  closer. We greatly benefited from his information and views. I  thanked him and asked him to convey my greetings and best wishes  to his majesty the king. I hope we will continue to be in  contact with Jordan as is the case with other parties in order  to follow up the issues we are undertaking.    [Announcer] On the outcome of his meetings in Yemen, Brahimi  said:    [Brahimi] Regarding the outcome of our meetings,  contacts and talks with the parties are continuing.    [Announcer] Asked about the nature of his mission in Yemen  and the conflicting parties' cooperation with the international  efforts, Brahimi said:    [Brahimi] We are doing two things. We are collecting  fact-finding information for a report to the secretary general.  In the meantime, and because we are working in a region to  which we belong, we are trying to bring closer the views of  brothers with whom we are linked by old ties. Sometimes, we  make progress and sometimes we do not; but we are continuing  talks. I told you two things. There is preparation for a  report and this is very easy, but in the meantime we try not to  be satisfied with this. We try to achieve the two basic points  on which the whole world is unanimous and the Yemeni brothers do  not object to them. These are the need to stop fighting and  entrench the cease-fire and to start dialogue between them. We  are considering the possibility of entrenching the cease-fire  and opening the door for dialogue among brothers.</p>

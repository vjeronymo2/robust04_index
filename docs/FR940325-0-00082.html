			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters sought additional guidance on how to determine baseline in industrial areas, particularly how to distinguish the effects of the release or discharge in question from the effects of other conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 11.72(c) through (k), which were not affected by this rulemaking, provide considerable guidance on the calculation of baseline. Additional clarification is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were a few comments about the discussion in the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice concerning the appropriate baseline for a river that in addition to being injured by a hazardous substance release also regularly receives sewer overflows that do not constitute hazardous substance releases under CERCLA. Some commenters noted that the Department stated that the effects of the sewer overflows did not render restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources pointless but did affect the baseline condition that must be reestablished. These commenters sought additional clarification that PRPs could not be held liable for the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring fish if the sewer overflows would kill any stocked fish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Baseline conditions are those that would have existed had the release or discharge in question not occurred. In the hypothetical case offered by the commenters, PRPs' liability for stocking fish depends on whether fish would have existed in the river but for the release in question. If fish would not survive in the river regardless of whether the release had occurred, then PRPs would not be liable for the cost of stocking fish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Measure of Damages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were a number of comments on the proposed measure of damages. Several commenters supported the proposal to allow trustee officials to recover compensable value in addition to restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. However, many others thought that allowing recovery of compensable value in addition to restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs violated the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> holding that restoration costs are the preferred measure of damages. These commenters stated that compensable value should only be recovered when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is infeasible or poses grossly disproportionate costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department believes that providing trustee officials with the discretion to assess compensable value is consistent with the holding in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> because it will help ensure that the public is more fully compensated for injuries to natural resources.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> did hold that restoration costs are the preferred measure of damages. However, nothing in the decision prohibits the Department from allowing trustee officials to assess compensable values in addition to restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. In fact, the court explicitly stated that ``Congress intended the damage assessment regulations to capture fully all aspects of loss.'' 880 F.2d at 463. Further, even under &sect;11.81(b) of the original rule, claims based on restoration costs could include damages for diminution of use values during the recovery period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters stated that even if the Department decides to allow assessment of compensable value for CERCLA claims, it should not allow assessment of compensable value for CWA claims. These commenters stated that unlike section 107(a)(C) of CERCLA, which imposes liability for ``damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources,'' section 311(f)(4) of CWA merely refers to the ``costs of removal,'' which include ``any costs incurred by the Federal government or any State government in the restoration or replacement of natural resources.'' Furthermore, these commenters stated that nothing in the legislative history of CWA suggests that lost use values were intended to be recoverable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the specific issue raised by these commenters was not remanded by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and is not within the scope of this rulemaking, the Department believes that compensable values are recoverable under CWA. CWA provides that damages ``shall include any costs or expenses incurred by the Federal government or any State government in the restoration or replacement of natural resources damaged or destroyed.'' CWA sec. 311(f)(4). Similarly, CERCLA provides that damages ``shall not be limited by the sums which can be used to restore or replace such resources.'' CERCLA sec. 107(f)(1). The court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> compared these two provisions and concluded: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> These directives are in harmony: restoration is the basic measure of damages, but damages can exceed restoration cost in some cases. 880 F.2d at 450. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated that CERCLA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SS Zoe Colocotroni,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 628 F.2d 652 (1st Cir. 1980),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 450 U.S. 912 (1981) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Puerto Rico  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SS Zoe Colocotroni <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), require inclusion of an exception from the basic measure of damages when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs are grossly disproportionate to the lost value of the resource. A number of these commenters disagreed with the Department's statements in the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice that no exceptions were needed because some form of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources will always be performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: HP unveils low-cost workstation IN AN aggressive bid to expand its share of the Dollars 9bn market for computer workstations, Hewlett-Packard will today launch an 'entry-level' Dollars 5,000 computer workstation that is almost twice as fast as any in its price range. HP has set its sights on the market for low-end workstations, currently dominated by Sun Microsystems, which is the highest volume segment of the workstation market. Digital Equipment also entered the field last month, with a Dollars 4,000 workstation and International Business Machines is also expected to announce new low-end models next week. HP claims to have leap-frogged competitors by offering significantly higher performance in a low-cost computer. While Sun and Digital's 'entry-level' workstations offer performance of about 20 specmarks - a widely accepted measure of computer performance  - HP's new workstation is rated at 34 specmarks. Sun currently holds about 40 per cent of the entire workstation market, with Hewlett-Packard second at 16 per cent, according to market researchers.</p>

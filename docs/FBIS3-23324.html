According to a reliable source with well-placed connections  to the PKK Central Committee, Ocalan said this in a recent  meeting with his commanders in charge of terrorist activities  against Turkey.    Ocalan's instructions to the commanders were to upgrade  violence in the region until the celebrations for the March 21  Kurdish new year of Nevroz and beginning as of that day, "start  a people's uprising."    His instructions, said the source, were similar to those in  1992 and implied that the consequences of the Nevroz this year  could be similar as well. In March 1992, Ocalan ordered a  Kurdish uprising in Turkey and called for the establishment of  "liberated zones." A total of 103 demonstrators were killed in  clashes with security forces.    Local sources in Diyarbakir said, meanwhile, that the PKK's  instructions related to Nevroz celebrations had not yet been  relayed to anyone but heightened activity and public  demonstrations were possible.    They note that the recent troop buildup in the region is not  only a measure to maintain electoral security but also to insure  peace on March 21.    According to one security source who asked not to be  identified, "if the PKK decides to do anything this year, there  will be much bloodshed. But it will be the loser."    The general concern among political party executives in  Diyarbakir is that Turkey may be preparing for an all-out  showdown with the PKK and that any terrorist activity in late  March could trigger this "operation."</p>

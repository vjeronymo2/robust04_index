			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Shell first quarter steady at Pounds 949m Shell Transport and Trading, the world's largest integrated oil company, yesterday reported a slight dip in first-quarter net profits to Pounds 949m from Pounds 971m, as improvements in refining and marketing offset a steep fall in exploration and production profits. The results, calculated on a replacement cost of supplies basis, were mid-range of analysts' forecasts. Shell shares closed down a penny at 741p. Earnings per share were 10.3p, compared with 10.1p last time. The Pounds 2.1bn cash flow from operations was flat compared with last year. The financial strength of Shell was underscored by its low gearing of 17.6 per cent. A 13 per cent rise in downstream profits to Pounds 488m (Pounds 431m) was attributed to higher sales volumes and lower costs. The company said world demand for oil products is stronger than last year. Oil product sales rose worldwide, although downstream margins in Asia and Europe deteriorated compared with the same period last year. A 23 per cent fall in the crude oil price caused profits from exploration and production to drop by 27 per cent, to Pounds 425m (Pounds 584m). But average production of 1.83m barrels a day was 5.5 per cent up, as a result of new fields coming onstream in the UK North Sea. Shell's first-quarter profits are usually bolstered by high seasonal demand for natural gas, a market segment in which the company has a strong position. First-quarter sales volumes rose by 3.3 per cent to 7.17bn cubic feet a day. Chemicals returned to profit after three years of losses. First-quarter profits were Pounds 56m, compared with a Pounds 22m loss last time. The company attributed much of the improvement to restructuring initiatives, but it also confirmed that demand for chemicals is recovering as growth returns to western economies. Shell has about 13 per cent of its capital employed in the chemical sector, according to London brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, and would there-fore benefit significantly from any strong upturn in demand. But the company said the outlook for the sector was dependent on the pace of economic recovery in Europe, where there is chronic over-capacity.</p>

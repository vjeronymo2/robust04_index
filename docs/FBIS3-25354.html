			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Parliament has approved a resolution extending the  state of emergency declared by the president, Flight Lieutenant  Rawlings, on Thursday [10 February] in seven districts of the  Northern Region from seven days to three months, in accordance  with Article 32, Clause 4 of the Constitution. Moving the  motion at today's sitting, the minister of interior, Colonel  Osei-Wusu, explained that since the declaration of the state of  emergency, there have been reports of wanton killings of babies,  women, and unarmed persons. He said that it is now obvious that  some of the groups involved in the fighting are bent on causing  more carnage.    Col. Osei-Wusu said the current situation is such that the  state of emergency must continue to enable the task force to  achieve its objectives of ensuring the cessation of hostilities  and disarming the combatants. Parliament appealed to the  soldiers engaged in the peacekeeping exercise not to act on  their emotion but to use diplomacy, dialogue, and minimum force  in the execution of the peacekeeping mission.</p>

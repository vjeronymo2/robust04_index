			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURF COUNTY, USA;  </P> <P> A REAL JOB? SELLING CARS? SAY IT AIN'T SO, CORKY  </P> <P> Surf star Corky Carroll, whose reputation for being out of a job was as big as  some of the giant waves he has surfed, has -- alas -- found gainful employment  selling cars.  </P> <P> Carroll, 43, surfing's iconoclast, forged a surfing career while supporting  himself with such odd jobs as dishwasher, waiter, ski-boot riveter and  musician.  </P> <P> Those who recall a beer commercial featuring Carroll probably remember its  punch line, playing on the surfing hero's lifelong job defiance.  </P> <P> Now, it's get up, put on a shirt and tie and head for Jim Slemons Honda in San  Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Corky may have a job, but it doesn't sound 9-to-5. In fact, during a recent  weekday when a nice, four-foot swell was hitting Orange County beaches, the  Cork could not be found on the showroom floor.  </P> <P> "Corky isn't coming in today," a Slemons receptionist said. "He's due to come  in tomorrow . . . around 3 p.m." DAVID REYES  </P></p>

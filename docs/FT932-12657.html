			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Matra-Hachette swings back into black for year MATRA-HACHETTE, the French group formed late last year by the merger of the Matra defence electronics business with Hachette's media interests, yesterday confirmed that it returned to the black in 1992 with a net profit of FFr354m (Dollars 65m) against a FFr1.68bn loss in 1991, and forecast a sharp increase in profits for 1993. Mr Philippe Camus, chairman of the group's financial council, said Matra-Hachette was considering ways of further streamlining its interests. One option is believed to be a merger with the Lagardere group, the company chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, which controls Matra-Hachette. Lagardere also returned to profit last year by making FFr96m against a net loss of FFr448m in 1991, when it was hit by Hachette's losses on La Cinq, the failed French television station. It has raised its dividend from FFr1.50 to FFr2.20. The merger of Matra and Hachette, which was highly controversial when first announced due to the apparent incompatibility of the two companies, has been followed by the pooling of their head office functions. It has also accelerated operational restructuring in terms of asset sales. Matra-Hachette saw turnover rise from FFr53.11bn in 1991 to FFr55.1bn in 1992 with operating profits up from FFr2.32bn to FFr2.78bn. The 1991 figures have been restated to allow for the merger. The group also benefited from a sharp fall in exceptional losses from FFr2.19bn in 1991 (when Hachette was hit by La Cinq's collapse) to FFr391m last year, representing asset sales and restructuring costs. However financial losses rose from FFr892m to FFr1.05bn over the same period. Matra-Hachette is paying a dividend of FFr2.20 a share.</p>

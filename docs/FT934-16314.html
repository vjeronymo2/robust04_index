			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Howard aims to curb 'tidal wave' of crime MR Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday announced 27 law and order initiatives to combat 'a tidal wave of concern about crime'. He won a standing ovation for a tough speech promising to provide extra prisons, extend police powers, tighten bail provisions and crack down on young offenders. The package met many of the demands from angry representatives speaking from the floor. However, the debate suggested that party activists are unlikely to be satisfied. The biggest ovation went to Mr Andrew Rosindell, the Young Conservatives' chairman, for demanding the return of hanging and birching. Lord Archer, the novelist and former Conservative MP, also won a standing ovation for a rousing speech which was widely seen as a bid to replace Sir Norman Fowler as party chairman. Mr Howard's first conference speech as home secretary said the balance of the criminal justice system had tilted too far in favour of criminals. He said the government would accept many of the 352 recommendations of Lord Runciman's Royal Commission into criminal justice. However, he said no decision had been made on Lord Runciman's suggestion that defendants should lose the right to elect trial by jury. The main measures announced were: Right to silence: suspects retain the right not to answer police questions, but prosecutors may invite judges and juries to infer guilt. Policing: part-time rural parish constables; powers to stop trespassers disrupting country sports; less paperwork to release officers for frontline duties. Terrorism: tougher stop and search powers; offences of gathering information for terrorist purposes and reasonable suspicion of connection with terrorist activities. Prisons: four new private sector prisons - in addition to two already announced; crack down on drug use by testing of prisoners. Court procedures: relaxation of restrictions on use of DNA samples; faster eviction for squatters; abolition of warnings by rape trial judges on truthfulness of victims; ban on jury service by offenders on bail. Juries: new offence of witness intimidation; retrials where juries have been 'nobbled'. Bail and cautions: end to repeat cautioning; conditions on police bail; arrest breaches of police bail; end to presumption in favour of bail for suspects accused of offences while on bail; power to revoke bail; automatic custody for convicted rapists and murderers accused of reoffending. Young offenders: doubled maximum sentence for 15-year-olds; secure training centres for 12- to 14-year-olds; review of community sentencing toughness. Victims: accept 11 recommendations of royal commission, including consultation on bail, better information on trial dates and segregation of offenders and victims. Sentencing: Criminal Cases Review Authority to look at miscarriages of justice; extended attorney general's right of appeal against lenient sentencing.</p>

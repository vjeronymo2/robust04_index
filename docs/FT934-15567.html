			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nikkei 300 share index launched A NEW capitalisation-weighted index of 300 leading shares listed on the Tokyo stock exchange is being launched. The index is expected to end a two-year debate over the volatility of the Nikkei 225 index, a simple price-weighted average of 225 stocks, which is used by the Osaka Securities Exchange and overseas markets as a base for the controversial stock futures contract. Japanese financial authorities have blamed the heavy trading in the futures market for driving investors away from the stock market. After a spate of restrictions to curb trading in the futures and options markets failed to bring investors back into stock investments, the ministry of finance and stock exchange authorities agreed that the simple weighted index, which is seen as easily manipulated, was at fault. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun business newspaper said the Nikkei 300 was an additional index and that the Nikkei 225 would continue to be used as a benchmark for the Tokyo stock market. The Osaka exchange is expected to introduce a new stock index futures contract based on the new index to replace the Nikkei 225 futures contract next January. The Nikkei 300 is heavily weighted in the banking sector, with 10 banks comprising 23.77 per cent of the index's capitalisation.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Beside the seaside - William Packer visits exhibitions in Cornwall and Norfolk The opening of an important, custom-built, publicly-funded gallery is always to be remarked, and all the more so the further it is from London; we are all regionalists and devolutionaries now. The Tate's offspring, tucked into the site of the old gasometer above Porthmeor Beach at the back of the town, opened its doors to the public in mid-summer, to general applause which, even now, has hardly died down. The 100,000th visitor came through the door the week before last, half a year ahead of expectation and but half a day after the Patrons of New Art and a clutch of Friends of the Academy. The place was packed. Not that it is hard to pack, being no more than a circuit of three or four smallish exhibition rooms with a larger and more open sculpture gallery at a lower level. For the time being it remains its own attraction, an intricate and ingenious response by the architects, Eldred Evans and David Shalev, to the exigencies of a steep and awkward site. The exterior, with its curves and balconies and flattened top, is discreetly modern, hinting at the long tradition of seaside architecture. Inside, the sense of place is constantly reinforced by the spectactular view, high over the beach and out to sea, that is caught at every turn, as inescapable as the scream of the gulls and the crash of the surf. But it has to be by the work on the walls and the programmes and policies of display that the enterprise is to be justified. The first rehang, barely three months on, suggests that the finer tuning is already under way. And the Tate at St Ives has its built-in limitations, as it would appear to be dedicated to St Ives in its particular role and period, roughly from the mid-1920s to around 1960, as a crucible of British modernism. The point is that were this to be inflexibly so, it would unduly limit St Ives itself, to say nothing of Cornwall. It is still too early to enter even a mild reservation with any fairness and besides, as it is, there is so much to admire and enjoy. The current offerings include an impressive study display of work by Terry Frost from the early 1950s, when his observation of boats rocking in the harbour, and the shifting, repetitive patterns of the tides, commited him finally to abstraction. In the general hang it is good to see John Wells given a proper prominence, an artist for too long grievously under-recognised, and Bryan Wynter too, a similar case. But it is not unreasonable to point an opportunity that is waiting to be taken. St Ives has had its moments, even of international importance, but it has never been the only significant local centre within our wider national school; and the art-historical significance of west Cornwall extends rather further back than the moment when Christopher Wood and Ben Nicholson came puffing round the corner on the branch-line from Hayle. Many good artists have gone on working in or near St Ives ever since. It would be a mistake for the Tate at St Ives merely to be a Wood-Nicholson-Hepworth benefit for the early years, or, for the matter of that, a Heron-Lanyon-Frost-Hilton benefit later on, rich though their creative legacies are. Their work needs to be viewed in a wider context to explain the enduring attraction and importance of the far west of Cornwall to successive generations of British artists. That is the true opportunity. Given his long friendship with Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson, it is perhaps surprising that Henry Moore, too, did not fetch up at St Ives. But he never did: indeed at times he could hardly have been further away. In 1922, his elder sister Mary took up the post of schoolmistress at the village of Wighton, set back a mile or two from the north Norfolk coast. She persuaded their parents to move with her, though their father died almost immediately, which effectively removed the family home from its native Castleford. Henry, a student at the Royal College in London, spent his holidays at Wighton and it was there, in the garden behind the school-house, that he first began what was to be his life-long practice of carving in the open air. His broken chisels, stuck in the wall to hold up the roses, and some half-worked blocks of stone, were found by the present owners, an American artist, Alfred Cohen and his wife Diana, who were unaware of the Moore connection when they bought the by-now disused school as house and studio some 15 years ago. In 1983 they opened the School House as an occasional gallery, which anniversary is now marked by Henry Moore and the Sea. Already shown at Portland and Chichester, with further venues in prospect, its stay at Wighton must surely be special. It is the smallest travelling exhibition that the Henry Moore Foundation has ever put on, consisting of a baker's dozen of maquettes and small sculptures and a number of etchings and lithographs. All but one sculpture, a tiny mother-and-child arch of 1959, date from the 1970s and 1980s in the artist's old age The connection with the sea is thus not direct, but rather a remembered experience, drawing upon the found objects, the pebbles, shells and dried bones that Moore picked up on beaches all his life. It is as though, looking at this small collection in this most charming of galleries, we pick up the shell and put it to our ear. The Tate Gallery, St Ives: sponsored by First Class Pullman, Intercity. Henry Moore and the Sea: The School House Gallery, Wighton, Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, until November 15.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 45 POSTAL JOBS SHIFTED OUT OF PASADENA  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service has cut 45 jobs in the Pasadena division as part of a  nationwide effort to control costs and increase efficiency.  </P> <P> The jobs in finance, human resources, marketing and operations support -- some  of which are already vacant -- will shift to departments of the Van Nuys  Division, officials said.  </P> <P> The Pasadena changes, which are anticipated to save $1.5 million annually, will  take effect Sept. 23, the beginning of the Postal Service's new fiscal year.  </P> <P> "The Pasadena mail processing center is not closing down, and no postal  employees are losing employment," said Jose L. Castellano, acting Pasadena  Management Sectional Center manager/postmaster.  </P> <P> The Postal Service stopped filling administrative vacancies three months ago,  including those at regional and headquarters levels, in anticipation of the  consolidation, he said.  </P> <P> All employees affected by the realignment will retain current grades and  salaries, he said.  </P> <P> "It is important for our customers to realize that the changes will have no  adverse impact on their mail service," Castellano said.  </P> <P> Pasadena has been a Management Sectional Center of the Van Nuys Division since  a Postal Service realignment in early 1986.  </P></p>

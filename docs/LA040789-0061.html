			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: 'YOU DO THIS FOR THE LOVE OF THEATER,' SAYS A HOMEMAKER PLAYING A  GANGSTER'S GIRLFRIEND.  </P> <P> After working all day at a variety of jobs, members of the Manhattan Beach  Community Church spend their nights having fun with theater.  </P> <P> With an eye on tonight's opening of the '30s musical "Anything Goes," the 40  cast members began rehearsing five nights a week in March to polish the  singing, tap-dancing and acting that goes into the shipboard comedy sparkling  with classic Cole Porter tunes.  </P> <P> And if that weren't enough, some of them scoured secondhand stores for costumes  or joined in building the handsome ocean liner set in which the orchestra  occupies the top deck.  </P> <P> "Sweet poison" is how the musical's director, Lyn Coulter, describes the  church's venture into community theater, where folks with professional  experience mingle with the likes of teachers, homemakers and aerospace  engineers in putting on at least two shows a year.  </P> <P> "The creative instinct of all of us is involved," said Coulter, an insurance  agent who calls herself an "old song-and-dance girl" because of stage  appearances she made as a teen-ager. "It's a chance to get away from everyday  life and put on some sequins."  </P> <P> The church, which is affiliated with the United Church of Christ, began doing  theater 41 years ago when two church members, one a writer and the other a  musician, started staging original plays.  </P> <P> Over the years, the home-grown works were replaced by shows with Broadway  pedigrees that are presented in the 300-seat Community Hall Theater. They have  included musicals such as "The Sound of Music" and "Guys and Dolls," as well as  "You Can't Take It With You" and other plays. The church quaintly labels these  non-musicals "talkies."  </P> <P> While casting for the shows is open, leading roles go only to church members.  And judging by the varying demands of "Anything Goes," the church has more than  enough professionals and other able people to draw on.  </P> <P> Kriss Light, who plays Reno Sweeney, the evangelist turned nightclub owner,  works professionally as a country-Western singer.  </P> <P> Her real-life husband is Tom Killam, who several years ago performed with the  Los Angeles Free Shakespeare Festival and did TV comedies. In "Anything Goes,"  he's Billy Crocker, who finds himself in trouble after being mistaken for  public enemy No. 1.  </P> <P> Pat Edwards, who plays the girl Billy is in love with, has sung with the Roger  Wagner Chorale and is a member of the Jane Hardester Singers at El Camino  College.  </P> <P> "Years ago, I tried to make living as an actor," said Killam, who is a general  contractor. "But then I got married, had children and needed a regular  paycheck."  </P> <P> Killam said it was the church production of "No Time for Sergeants" that got  him back into theater two years ago. "I had a ball," he said.  </P> <P> "You do this for the love of theater," said Lois Bourgon, a homemaker and  one-time nightclub singer and dancer who has the showy role of a gangster's  girlfriend in "Anything Goes."  </P> <P> But not everyone comes with a resume that includes professional work. A chorus  of sailors includes two engineers, an astronomer and a stockbroker.  </P> <P> Killam said: "It's amazing how many talented people there are around this  church."  </P> <P> What: "Anything Goes."  </P> <P> Where: Manhattan Beach Community Church, 303 S. Peck Ave., Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> When: Today, Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 7:30 p.m.; Thursday, 7:30 p.m.; next  April 14 and April 15, 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Admission: $8, adults; $5, seniors, students and children.  </P> <P> Information: 318-2894; 372-3587.

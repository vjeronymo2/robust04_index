			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / House sales faltering, estate agents report: Election uncertainty blamed for hindering recovery THE REVIVAL in the housing market which appeared to have started at the beginning of this year has not been sustained, according to a survey of almost 100 estate agents published yesterday. The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) shows sales and prices continuing to lag in many areas. It provides little comfort for Conservatives, who hoped that increased activity in the housing market might encourage a greater feeling of well-being among voters  - the so-called 'feel good' factor. Estate agents said election uncertainty was smothering confidence among potential buyers. Many said the revival in interest from potential buyers at the start of this year had failed to translate into higher sales in spite of government attempts to stimulate the market by placing a moratorium until August on stamp duty on purchases below Pounds 250,000. The findings conflict with the experience of large housebuilders, which have seen a marked improvement in their sales in January and February. New houses, however, account for only about 10 per cent of sales. One reason for the better sales performance of new properties is that builders badly need to generate cash. They have therefore been more realistic about prices and have offered sales incentives to encourage reluctant buyers. Builders have also reported a slowing in sales this month, as the election draws near. Wilson Bowden, one of the 10 largest housebuilders, said sales, which had risen to 140 a week in February, were now running at about 125 a week. Almost 40 per cent of estate agents responding to the RICS said prices had fallen further in the previous three months. Almost no agents said that prices had risen. Halifax and Nationwide, the two largest building societies, said average prices fell 1 per cent last month after a similar fall in January. According to the institution concern about rising unemployment has meant that housing markets in London and south-east England remain among the worst affected, with potential buyers staying away until the result of the election is known and conditions improve. Elsewhere markets remained subdued, with one or two exceptions such as Sunderland, where confidence was boosted by Nissan's decision to spend Pounds 200m and create 600 jobs at its car plant near the city. The institution said the ingredients for a gentle recovery in the housing market  - pent-up demand, lower prices and cheaper finance  - were being prevented from taking effect by uncertainty caused by the election.</p>

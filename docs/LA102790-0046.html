			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD  </P> <P> The parents of a Carlsbad man murdered in January, 1989, by his estranged wife  were awarded $1.2 million in a wrongful-death lawsuit decided by a Vista  Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> The assessment was made by Judge Franklin Mitchell against Roberta Pearce, who  was convicted of first-degree murder for enlisting the help of two teen-age  boys in stabbing to death Robert (Wayne) Pearce outside his apartment.  </P> <P> The two boys were ordered to share part of the assessment.  </P> <P> But Dennis Atchley, the attorney for the victim's divorced parents, Charles  Pearce and Rita Church, said it was unlikely the Illinois couple will ever  collect more than $40,000, which was her share of the equity of the couple's  Valley Center home before the murder. Roberta Pearce, a one-time teacher's aide  at Escondido's Orange Glen High School, has since declared bankruptcy.  </P> <P> She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, and the  two boys, Isaac Hill and Anthony Pilato -- who were 15 at the time they stabbed  Pearce to death -- are in the custody of the California Youth Authority until  they turn 25.  </P> <P> Pearce's attorney, Thomas Nares, called the award "pretty much meaningless. It  could have been for $5 million," he said. "It wouldn't make much difference.  It's all kind of moot."  </P></p>

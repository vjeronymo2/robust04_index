			<p>BFN     [Text] Twenty-two Azeri opposition parties formed a  national resistance movement on May 19 in Baku.    Their leaders met at the headquarters of the National  Independence party. They said the movement was formed to  counter "all attempts to introduce a Russian or Commonwealth  army contingent in Azerbaijan."    The movement is to work to protect democracy and  Azerbaijan's  sovereignty and insure the return of the Armenian-occupied Azeri  territories, the restoration of the republic's territorial  integrity and the inviolability of the national frontiers.    According to preliminary reports, the national resistance  movement is planning to hold a rally on May 21 to protest the  possible introduction of Russian or Commonwealth peacekeepers in  Azerbaijan.    A peacekeeping contingent can be introduced in Azerbaijan  under a protocol that was discussed, under Russian mediation, by  the Armenian and Azeri Defense Ministers and the commander of  the Karabakh defense forces earlier this week. The Azeri  minister refused to sign the protocol. The Azeri leaders link  its signing to the conclusion of a comprehensive political  agreement on Nagorni Karabakh. In their view, the captured  territories must be returned to Azerbaijan, the refugees must be  repatriated and moves must be made to revive the Karabakh  economy.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Fry plans Euro utilities trust Johnson Fry is hoping to raise up to Pounds 100m with a split capital investment trust specialising in European utility companies. There will be two classes of share. The zero dividend preference, with an equivalent gross annual rate of 9.46 per cent, will account for 29 per cent of the capital at launch. Ordinary income shares will account for 71 per cent and aim to provide an initial yield of 6 per cent. They will also have some entitlement to capital gains at the end of the trust's planned 10-year life, after the zeros' entitlement has been met. The public offer for the income shares closes on June 7, and that for the zeros on June 9. First dealings are expected on June 20.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Delors warns of risk to Maastricht MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, has issued a new call to arms to the partisans of a federal European union. He warned that unless a bold 'new initiative' emerges quickly, the Maastricht treaty and its envisaged economic and monetary union will be a dead letter. 'Why should we hide it? If we go on like this, there will be no convergence in economic policies and, consequently, no single currency. The commitments in the Maastricht treaty will come to nothing,' Mr Delors told a weekend meeting of his French Socialist supporters in Brittany. The Commission president, politically bruised by the year-long delay in ratifying Maastricht and the damage to the credibility of the Emu project caused by this month's near implosion of the European exchange rate mechanism, warned that Europe faced sinking into decline through 'the absence of a broad and long-term vision'. 'This risk is so obvious in the light of Europe's powerlessness that one might well expect a startled rebound on the part of certain heads of state and government,' Mr Delors said, in implicit reference to the hopes now placed in the EC's traditional Bonn-Paris axis to get European integration back on the rails. The Commission president's wide-ranging speech was more analytical than prescriptive, peppered with references to the 'myopia and insouciance' of some nationalist and 'ultra-liberal' EC governments which he said saw Europe merely as a giant free trade zone. He derided the embryonic common foreign and security policy contained in Maastricht as a racing car with a two-stroke engine, incapable of handling a crisis like Yugoslavia, even if a joint foreign policy structure were fully functional. He said that the EC's classic strategy of 'small steps forward' had 'reached its limits', and that the time had come 'to spell out the political Europe that we want'. This was 'the federal approach, which alone sets limits to the powers of European institutions, and guarantees the powers of the nation-states and regions'. On Emu, he insisted there was no remedy in reorganising the ERM, 'even if that in itself would be welcome'. This remark squares with the EC's formal agenda of getting the second stage of Emu - with a European Monetary Institute as forerunner to a European central bank - set up by January. But some observers yesterday saw Mr Delors' call as encouragement for a mini-Emu with harder currencies grouping around the D-Mark.</p>

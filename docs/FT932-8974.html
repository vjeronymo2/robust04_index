			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / The polecat's return: Country Note AS GAMEKEEPERS continue to become endangered species in many areas of the UK, the victims of their constant vigilance during the past century and a half are beginning to return to the countryside. Some have not been seen in living memory over large parts of the country and were long ago crossed off the list of native fauna by most people. One of these is the polecat, which has been waiting in the wings, mostly holed up in the wilder parts of Wales, until conditions were right to move back on to the English stage. The end of gin traps and the protection given to it by the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act are part of the reason for its current expansion. So, too, is the growing rabbit population, which is surviving better in our warmer winters and reaching higher levels in between bouts of myxamatosis. Polecats are voracious rabbit-eaters: more than a third of their diet consists of rabbits and almost three-quarters is mammalian in content, largely mice and voles. Polecats hunt mainly at night and are quite happy to pursue prey underground, being able to slip into quite small spaces. They chase their quarry with a series of large leaps and jump on to it, dispatching it with a bite to the back of the neck. They are known to feed on amphibians and can cope with the poison glands of toads which deter many other species. Like moles with worms, they will cache numbers of frogs and toads, which are bitten at the base of the skull to paralyse rather than kill them and so keep them fresh until required. They live solitary lives. Each has a number of dens, spending about 24 hours at each before moving on to the next. In winter they tend to den in farm outbuildings or near dwellings on the edge of settlements where prey will be more numerous, and where they are more likely to be seen. But few people would recognise the dark, lithe, ferret-sized animal with a masked face as a native and, as it has now crossed the River Severn and is moving steadily eastwards, it is likely to feature increasingly in press reports of strange animals crossing roads at night or turning up in suburban gardens. Dr Johnny Birks, of English Nature, who has recently started a two-year project studying the return of what he sees as a long-lost friend, is concerned that, like the mink, the polecat will be regarded as an invading alien and will receive a similar exaggerated and hostile press. He is currently collecting road casualty polecats in the border counties in an attempt to assess the status and speed of its spread. His task is made more complicated by the fact that polecat ferrets have a very close resemblance to wild polecats; only careful measurements of the skull will distinguish the two. It also has one other snag - the polecat's smell. Not for nothing is it also called the foul marten . . .</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Overload in the people's car: The costs crisis afflicting VW stems from the cosseting offered by Germany's social economy The problems at Volkswagen are as old and as durable as the dear old Beetle itself. Foremost among them has long been the carmaker's chronic inability to confront the simple truth: that its costs are too high. Now, 55 years after the launch of the Beetle phenomenon, in the middle of the motor industry's worst post-war slump, Ferdinand Piech and Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua are bidding to effect a cure. But while their abilities are not in doubt, their rough-and-tough methods, and criminal allegations against Lopez are threatening to destroy dreams that VW can be restored speedily to full health. The malaise was apparent back in the 1930s, when Ferdinand Porsche was developing his pop-eyed rear-engined runabout and when Adolf Hitler was growing increasingly excited by 'his' Volkswagen: his people's car. 'I have no doubt that the outstanding ability of the designer, and at a later date the economic acumen of the manufacturers, will make it possible to make available to the German people cars which are low-priced and cheap to run, similar to those the American people have enjoyed for a long time,' Hitler proclaimed at the 1936 Berlin motor show. As Dan Post, the celebrated Beetle historian, noted *, Mr Schickelgruber failed to mention that in 1936 an American had to work only 300 hours to buy a car while a German would have to toil for 800. The differentials have narrowed, the world has shrunk, and the Volkswagen concern has ballooned into an international giant since the Wolfsburg works opened in 1938. In May that year the first 'KdF' (Kraft durch Freude - Strength through Joy) cars rattled out at a handsome 990 Reichsmarks apiece. But the dangers inherent in overblown costs have persisted. They were ignored for years as VW cars first filled the garages of Germans benefiting from the post-war economic miracle, and later moved off into international markets as puttering proof of Germany's reputation for engineering excellence. Progress through technology, or Vorsprung durch Technik, to borrow a phrase beloved of Piech, Porsche's grandson, and by a fateful twist, today's chairman at VW, served the German motor industry well in its youth and adolescence. But high costs threaten to be the death of it in its maturity, Piech says. Piech, former head of Audi, the VW quality car division, and patron of its Vorsprung durch Technik slogan, took charge of the group in January this year as it toppled into its worst losses ever. A technical man by training, he was chosen for the skills he displayed in re-engineering Audi into the most profitable part of VW. He, in turn, chose another engineer, the controversial Lopez, formerly General Motors' cost-cutting wizard, to help him with his work. Since March, when Lopez arrived shrouded in suspicions of having stolen GM industrial secrets, the rehabilitation work has been progressing at speed. The eccentric Basque is said to work from five in the morning to midnight every day. In less than six months, Piech claims, he discovered and applied cost-saving methods worth DM700m. But as allegations and evidence mount up, it appears increasingly unlikely that the dynamic duo will remain together for long. Thr group could find a replacement relatively easy for Lopez. There are plenty of managers who understand and can implement the 'lean' production and group working methods he uses, but it would be more damaging if Piech were forced to go. Since he arrived, he has hacked hard at VW's internal costs structure, its civil service-style bureaucracy, and its cosy relationships with its mostly German, high-cost components suppliers. He has also set about cutting its bloated workforce. While his claims of having DM8.7bn-worth of savings 'in my pocket' do not bear close inspection, and even he has given up on his earlier claims of reaching break-even this year, there is ample evidence that the Austrian engineer is giving VW the shake-out of its life. As Lopez and his team terrorise components suppliers, Piech is carving into investment plans, paring every budget to the bone. He is even making a brave show of tackling over-employment, the single most important cause of the group's malaise. Since his arrival in January, Piech has announced the shedding of about 20,000 jobs in VW's six German works. But in keeping with post-war industrial tradition, there is not a single redundancy among them. Natural wastage and early retirement on generous terms are, as usual, the order of the day. There is no role for hire-and-fire methods in Germany's social economy, where even the threat of industrial conflict is anathema. But Volkswagen is a special case. As a 'new' industry in post-war Germany, it was cosseted under government control. Based in a traditional Social Democrat (SDP) stronghold, Lower Saxony, it was an exemplar. It was a pillar of the social economy: a creator of jobs and wealth in what used to be a faraway, hard-up corner of West Germany, tucked close against the old East German border. When Bonn sold off the last 16 per cent of its holding in 1988, commentators cheered: at last action would be taken to reduce VW's cost base, they said. At the time, VW's profit margin was exactly one third that of its main European competitors. 'I don't know of a single example where a company has lost the government as a shareholder where it hasn't led to fundamental change,' one analysts wrote at the time. But the commentators appeared to have forgotten the 20 per cent holding left under the control of the Lower Saxony government. The state authorities, today wearing the red and green colours of an SPD/Green party coalition, together with worker representatives on the company's board of supervisors, still control VW's fate. As a result, Volkswagen has continued until now to be managed more in the style of a social security office than a commercial concern. It has fired workers only once in its entire history. Even today, its in-house pay agreement is the most generous in the German car industry. Two weeks ago, seeking to shave another 3,000 jobs from its domestic payroll, the management offered an extraordinary deal, allowing employees to retire at 55 on 90 per cent of their net income until the normal retirement age of 60. In an industry where labour costs account for 70 per cent of the total cost of a typical vehicle, according to the VDA automotive industry association, the workforce is the single most important source of potential economies. VW calculates that its latest early retirement package should bring the number employed in its six domestic plants to about 100,000. Industry observers, given to understand that the desired target is 80,000, are puzzled. Times may be desperate, but even hard men such as Piech and Lopez would have no hope of gaining the assent of their labour-oriented supervisory board to job losses on such a scale within the two years they have given themselves to turn the company around. Accordingly they have gone about their other cost-saving activities with sometimes alarming vigour. But the fact that they were put in charge, and that Piech won agreement to his first phase of job cuts, reflects the new chairman's powers of persuasion and the Lower Saxony government's belated acceptance that fundamental change is needed if VW is to prosper in Europe's single market and in an increasingly liberalised global economy. Now, several years behind innovative, privately-controlled companies such as BMW, and at least two years behind most other German industrial groups, where task-master bankers hold large stakes, sit on supervisory boards and hold the whip hand over management, the duo has set about a crash cure. There is no time for niceties, they say. Without drastic action now, says Lopez, the Japanese will colonise European industry and 'become our landlords'. For Piech the issue is the 'survival' of Germany's second-biggest industrial concern. Both arguments are deliberately pitched to disseminate fear and prepare the ground - in the supervisory board and the workforce - for their Blitzkrieg tactics. But they have signally failed to convince the watchers beyond the borders of Lower Saxony. The Austrian Piech and the Spaniard Lopez appear to have overlooked that change on the scale they demand, especially in Germany's conservative business culture, requires management, not force. They have also to remember that the ground rules of a social economy demand consensus, not coercion, and not just with a company's own workforce and supervisors. While Lopez's purchasing department 'warriors' are allegedly dashing around, tearing up component suppliers' contracts and demanding instant price cuts on pain of loss of contracts, more conventional managers are pursuing similar ends through dissimilar means. Proceeding according to the tiresome but tested principle that co-operation is preferable to confrontation in Germany, business competitors in the motor sector and other industries are negotiating their way to improved competitiveness, at a gentler pace. Most important, they are operating out of public earshot. However great VW's difficulties and however inspired the new management may be, a director at one competitor says its methods are unacceptable. The fact that Volkswagen is so large, so well-known and seen internationally as a flagship of German industry, makes 'this bullying' all the more reprehensible, he adds. VW, Germany's most persuasive argument for privatisation, is also its most suitable case for treatment. But as its supervisory board appears to have realised, with recent hints that Lopez may have to go, the malaise afflicting it is an indigenous German ailment which demands German therapy for an effective and lasting cure. * Volkswagen Nine Lives Later, 1930-1965, by Dan Post, Motor-Era Books, Arcadia, California</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A witness for the Galloway Company testified in support of TAPP and Galloway's own proposals to exclude sweetened condensed milk, ice cream and ice cream mix from pricing under a multiple component pricing system. The witness stated that such products should continue to be priced under the current pricing system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Galloway witness said that some Class II manufactured products, together with other products such as sour cream, whipping cream, half and half, eggnog, yogurt, nonfat dry milk and butter, are not affected in yield by the protein content of the milk from which the products are manufactured. Instead, according to the witness, it is total skim solids that affect the yield of these products. Accordingly, the witness stated, it would not be equitable to price such products under a multiple component pricing system which prices protein at a level higher than the remaining skim solids in the milk. The witness argued that these products should be left out of any MCP plan adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Galloway witness testified, and post-hearing briefs filed on behalf of Anderson-Erickson (A&hyph;E) and Galloway asserted, that yields are affected by the level of total skim solids rather than protein, making the pricing of protein irrelevant for Class II pricing. The Galloway witness testified that there have been months in which the monthly average protein level and other nonfat solids level of milk moved in opposite directions. In addition, the A&hyph;E and Galloway briefs asserted that MCP would significantly increase the cost of Class II milk, which would put them at an even greater disadvantage than currently with respect to products made from nonfat dry milk priced at the Class III-A price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Galloway witness stated that the primary product manufactured by the Galloway Company is sweetened condensed milk. According to the witness, this product competes on a national basis with other manufacturers who do not have to procure their milk under Federal orders with MCP provisions. The witness stated that it would be unfair to force his organization to procure milk under a set of regulations that differ from those regulating his competitors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A portion of the TAPP proposal would require a classification change for sweetened condensed milk from Class II to Class III. Although the Galloway witness expressed strong concern over the impact of multiple component pricing on his company, the effect of the classification of sweetened condensed milk on the Galloway company is not part of the MCP issue. Reclassification of this product is a separate issue that was discussed thoroughly at a previous hearing, and in the decision issued as a result of that hearing (58 FR 27774). No new evidence was presented at this hearing that would justify reclassifying sweetened condensed milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Milk used to produce sweetened condensed milk, or any other Class II product, should not be exempted from multiple component pricing. The MCP plan recommended for adoption will cover all Class II and Class III products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testimony at the hearing indicated that there are essentially two groups of Class II products that differ with respect to the impact of multiple component pricing on the handlers that make these products. The first group of Class II products are those in which there generally seemed to be agreement in the hearing record that yields are greatly affected by the level of protein in the milk. These products include the various cottage cheeses and other similar soft, high-moisture cheeses. The handlers that make these products benefit directly from higher levels of protein in milk and should be accountable to the pool for this added benefit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second group of Class II products are those where there was some disagreement in the record about the affect of protein on the yield. These products include ice cream and frozen desserts and mixes, fluid creams, sour creams, yogurt, sweetened condensed milk and others. Considerable debate took place on whether it was appropriate to include these products in a multiple component pricing system.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: SNIFFLE'S PLACE IS IN THE HOME  </P> <P> I have never understood the dynamics of a cold. We all know it carries with it  chills, fever, nausea, a runny nose, coughing and headache, not to mention the  ability to spread germs. But it carries another side effect that is rarely  mentioned: A cold makes you social.  </P> <P> I've seen recluses who have not been out of their homes in 10 years. The moment  they get a cold, the first thing they do is to drag themselves out of bed, get  dressed and go to a crowded theater.  </P> <P> That's why colds are considered the gift that keeps on giving.  </P> <P> At a supermarket the other day, I met a friend hanging over her cart. Her eyes  were puffy and red, her cheeks were flushed, she dabbed at her nose, and her  voice was barely audible through parched lips.  </P> <P> "What are you doing here?" I asked. She coughed on my cauliflower.  </P> <P> "If I stayed home, I'd think about dying," she said. "I might as well be on my  feet."  </P> <P> It seems the most cruel and inhumane advice a doctor can give to a cold  sufferer is, "Go to bed and drink lots of liquids."  </P> <P> I can just hear her responding: "Let me get this straight. You want me to  stretch out on a nice warm bed and sleep and watch TV all day and not spread  germs to the entire city? You quack. I'm getting a second opinion. This is my  life we're talking about."  </P> <P> The tendency to walk a cold to death and to entertain it at parties, concerts,  lectures and restaurants has to be a part of the disease. Why else would the  schools be full of children who would skip school if they slept on their hair  "funny" but not if they had walking pneumonia?  </P> <P> There's an adage, "You can lead a cold to bed, but you can't make it lie down."  Scientists thought they had found a vaccine that made rabbits develop  antibodies. Then someone remembered rabbits don't get colds anyway. Our only  hope is to find a cure for the common cold.  </P> <P> Until then, I'd advise all well people to stay in bed, drink plenty of liquids,  and let the sickies run the world.  </P></p>

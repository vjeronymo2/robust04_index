			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Nigerian budget ends market reform era Nigeria's 1994 budget has abandoned market reforms begun in 1986 and reintroduced economic controls which critics say have set the clock back nine years. A foreign exchange rate fixed at N22 to the dollar, interest rates of 12 to 15 per cent and a ban on free repatriation of export proceeds appear to have killed any hope of Nigeria reaching agreement with the IMF during the mission to Lagos later this month. A deal with the IMF could have opened the way to fresh funds and substantial relief on servicing Nigeria's Dollars 30bn external debt which is more than Dollars 6bn in arrears to the Paris Club of sovereign creditors. The budget leaves a question mark over the future of Mr Kalu I Kalu, recently appointed finance minister for the second time, who is known to favour complete deregulation of the economy and an agreement with foreign official creditors as soon as possible. Nigeria has not serviced its Paris Club debt for two years, since the last rescheduling agreement and talks with the IMF and World Bank failed last year over the government's foreign exchange rate policy, lack of transparency in oil revenues and heavy subsidies on domestic fuel. The speech reflects the concerns of manufacturers who claim that they are being forced out of business by high interest rates and lack of foreign exchange. 'They have thrown out the baby with the bath water,' said Mr Atedo Peterside, a merchant banker in Lagos last night. 'We could have had fiscal discipline and some tariff reforms which would have given manufacturers 90 per cent of what they want without giving up all the gains of deregulation since 1986.' Deregulation got a bad name under previous head of state Gen Ibrahim Babangida, but some of his reforms were welcomed by the private sector. Gen Sani Abacha's budget is likely to drive much foreign currency trading underground. Two months after seizing power Gen Abacha said in his first economic policy statement that Nigeria would strive to reach accommodation with the foreign creditors, but seems to offer them little. He has budgeted for a large state surplus in 1994 of over Dollars 5.5bn which would allow room to pay external debts but it is not clear how the government can achieve it. The budget provides for Dollars 11.5bn revenue, nearly 50 per cent more than in 1993 when the assumed oil price was 35 per cent higher. Apart from the introduction of modified value added tax on selected goods and some higher duty on luxury imports, there is no new source of revenue and nearly all the government's income derives from oil exports.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AGASSI AND LENDL WIN AT FRENCH OPEN;  </P> <P> WILANDER ALSO MOVES INTO 3RD ROUND; LORI MCNEIL UPSET IN WOMEN'S DIVISION  </P> <P> Andre Agassi led a U.S charge into the third round of the French Open today,  but the favorite for the men's title, Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia, moved  toward peak clay-court form on the second leg of his bid for the Grand Slam.  </P> <P> Agassi, the No. 5 seed, outclassed Italy's Paolo Cane 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 on Center  Court.  </P> <P> But the top-seeded Lendl, the Australian Open champion, fared even better,  destroying Derrick Rostagno of the United States 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 as he swept  toward a fourth French crown.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Too Much for Italian  </P> <P> Agassi's solid service, heavy ground strokes and court speed were too much for  the Italian.  </P> <P> Agassi also defeated Cane in the first round in Paris last year and went on to  reach the semifinals.  </P> <P> "Although I beat Cane easily last year, it was all kind of new to me, and it  wasn't until the quarterfinals that I felt great," Agassi said. "Last year,  being in the semifinal was enough for me. Now I feel I have the mind to go all  the way. That creates a whole different level of tennis."  </P> <P> Agassi was joined in round three by Michael Chang of Placentia, who hammered  Pete Sampras of Rancho Palos Verdes 6-1, 6-1, 6-1.  </P> <P> Chang, who reached the round of 16 at last year's U.S. Open as a 16-year-old,  took just 1 hour, 37 minutes on the day's opening Center Court match to beat  his fellow 17-year-old.  </P> <P> Defending champion Mats Wilander, putting a disastrous year behind him, scored  another straight-set victory today and surged into the third round.  </P> <P> The Swede, only seeded fourth after a season in which he has failed to win a  tournament and has lost to a succession of unheralded opponents, beat Diego  Perez of Uruguay 6-3, 7-6, 6-3.  </P> <P> Lori McNeil of the United States became the fifth women's seed to bow out of  the tournament when she was upset 6-2, 6-1 by Manon Bollegraf of the  Netherlands.  </P> <P> "I just had an off day," McNeil said. "She forced me a lot and rushed me. I  never settled down."  </P> <P> Manuela Maleeva, the No. 6 seed, reached round three by beating Sandra  Wasserman of Belgium 6-3, 5-7, 6-3.  </P> <P> In doubles play, top-seeded Americans Rick Leach and Jim Pugh bowed out in the  first round today without so much as a fight.  </P> <P> Leach and Pugh, who won the Australian Open and Nabisco Masters titles last  year when they surged to the No. 1 spot in the world rankings, were beaten by  Ricki Osterthun of West Germany and Alex Antonitsch of Austria 6-2, 6-4.  </P> <P> Leach was too disappointed to attend the post-match news conference, but Pugh  summed up the feelings of both players.  </P> <P> "It was probably the worst match we have ever played," he said. "Usually we  fight to the last point, but here we went down very early."  </P></p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / How to Spend it: Furniture from the formidable Fendis - The Italian fashion house's designs for the home Until now Fendi, the Italian fashion house, has been known mainly for its expensive-looking luggage (distinguished as is customary in these circles by initials, in this case, a reversed double F) and its swankily extrovert fur collection. It is also famous, in Italy at least, for being run by five go-getting sisters - Anna, Carla, Franca, Alda and Paola. In 1925, the first Fendi furs and small leather purses were made by Adele Fendi in a small workshop in the Via del Plesbiscito in Rome. Though Rome is filled with fine creators of desirable leather goods, the Fendis nonetheless managed to attach to theirs the kind of aura that turned a piece of Fendi luggage from being just a handy way of carting about belongings into a grandiose statement about wealth and taste. Their furs, too, have always had about them a kind of Roman swagger - at a time when other designers were turning out furs that were discreet and classical, Fendi made them fun (the in-house catch-phrase for what they did was to 'demystify') which is why the choice of Karl Lagerfeld in 1964 as the designer of the fur collection was so inspired. It is true that these days his conscience about using fur is troubling him and he has gone a bit sober on them but through most of his years as their designer he has kept their collection right at the cutting-edge of the pelt trade. From furs and leather purses Fendi went on to provide more goodies for those with Fendi tastes - ready-to-wear clothing, scarves, ties, gloves, pens, stationery, shoes, lighters . . . name a life-style accessory and Fendi will have provided it. Every proper fashion house these days seems to feel the need to market a fragrance, and so the Fendi fragrance for women was launched shortly after the one for men. You might have thought the Fendi world was now complete. You would have thought wrong. From the concept of dressing the woman, it is but a short step to dressing the home and this is what Fendi proposes to do. It has expanded into what, for lack of more enterprising words, I can only call the life-style arena - Fendi fans need no longer surround themselves with furniture of dubious lineage. Those who relate to the Fendi label can sit in Fendi chairs, lounge on Fendi sofas and eat off Fendi tables. Fendi Casa, as the furniture line is called, is designed by a group of in-house designers but, as is the tradition of the house, one of the formidable sisters, in this case Anna, supervises it. The best thing to be said about the range is that it looks unquestionably Italian. But this is not the Italy of the cornetto, of Neapolitan arias, Venetian gondolas and pizzerias, but the quiet dignified Italy that exists behind the shutters in even the busiest cities. It reminds one of the shaded sitting-rooms in tall Milan houses, of quiet formal dining-rooms in Roman apartments. As the photograph of the sitting-room shows, the simple lines of the room are never dull, the lack of clutter generates a feeling of great strength and tranquillity. The design lineage, which the house of Fendi openly acknowledges, is Biedermeier, fin-de-siecle Vienna and the best of Art Deco. Not all the pieces are to my personal taste - a few suffer from the over-heaviness of line common in bourgeois Italian homes - I like best the strong chair photographed here (Domiziana) and the less formal range known as Espositore. Here there is little that is startlingly new but much that is pleasing. The range depends upon using very chic fabrics in a soft, draping, informal way. Though today the idea of abandoning stiff upholstery in favour of loose draped fabrics may seem old-hat, when Fendi first launched it in 1988 it was quite new in its field. The notion that very expensive furniture might borrow from the slightly Bohemian aesthetic of the Hippy seemed, at the time, quite revolutionary. Instead of taking the Indian bedspread or the Bedouin rug, however, Fendi has taken severely striped fabric and used it to drape sofas, cover tables, upholster steamer chairs, directors' chairs and folding tables. The effect is nonchalant and offers the sort of furniture that could fit into almost any home from the formal to the most laid-back. Though Fendi Casa has been around for a little while in Italy, it is only for the first time becoming available in the UK. It is on sale, exclusively to order, through Charles Page, 61 Fairfax Road, Swiss Cottage, London NW6 4EE (tel: 071-328 9851). In the shop there are a few examples of the range to be seen and tested as well as samples of the whole fabric range. Every piece of furniture can be covered in any of the fab-rics. Prices are not low - fine leather and high-quality fabrics are used throughout. Domiziana, for instance, the chair photographed, costs Pounds 1,435, while the Farnese range of chairs and sofas run at about Pounds 965 for a single chair, Pounds 1,930 for the two-seater sofa and Pounds 3,050 for a three-seater sofa.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi 9 April -- An Iberia news agency  correspondent reports that representatives of the Round Table  political bloc [supporters of former President Zviad  Gamsakhurdia] gathered near the Philharmonic Concert Hall today  at 1300 hours and attempted to hold an unauthorized rally. The  police dispersed the gathered. Several people were arrested.  Some of the ralliers marched peacefully towards Rustaveli  Prospekt to lay flowers at the memorial to those killed on 9  April [day in 1989 Soviet troops dispersed a peaceful rally  killing 20 people]. By 1400 hours about 2,000 supporters of the  former Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia approached the  House of Government with the intention of holding a rally there.  The area in front of the Government House was guarded by some  500 policemen led by Gela Lanchava.    The ralliers then went to the Mtatsminda Pantheon and paid  homage to Merab Kostava.</p>

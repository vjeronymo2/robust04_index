			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Humberside to get jobs boost from power plant Up to 700 jobs are to be created in building a Pounds 520m gas-fired power station near Grimsby, Humberside County Council said yesterday. The station is being built by a consortium including Midlands Electricity, the regional power company, IVO, the Finnish electricity company, and Tomen, the Japanese trading company. The council said the station was one of the biggest inward investments into the UK. It is due to open in 1997. Mr Norman O'Neill, of the council's economic development sub-committee, said the investment was the first of many. Construction of the station, which will have a capacity of 750MW, has been seen as a setback for coal. When it is fully operational it will displace up to 2m tonnes of coal a year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Tang Dongning [3282 2639 1337]: "China </F> Overcomes a Technical Problem in Power Grid Stability for the  First Time with a Unique Leading Theory in International  Applications"]    [Text] People have difficulty imagining what the outcome  would be should there be a loss of stability in large power  grids, which are so inseparable from our national economy and  social life. Dr. Xue Yusheng [5641 4416 0524], chief engineer in  the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's Nanjing Automation  Institute, has created a completely new electric power system  computation method, the Expanded Equal-Area Criterion (EEAC).  After a year of on-line application in China, it has  successfully achieved power grid transient state safety  monitoring and control. This achievement is an indication that  an acute technical problem that has troubled the world's  electric power industry for a long time has been solved.    EEAC, called "Xue's Method" by international academic  circles, was invented while Xue Yusheng was studying for his  doctorate at Liege University in Belgium in 1986. At the time,  it was internationally recognized that all representative  electric power system transient state direct safety analysis  methods were established on their own empirical assumptions and  that they were very ill-adapted to the quick and accurate  analytical computations required by extremely complex large  power grids. Thus, for many years electric power S&amp;T circles  in  all countries have continuously striven to explore new routes.  The EEAC direct method, the unique creation of a Chinese person,  effectively simplifies the extremely complex stability problems  of large electric power systems into an equal-value dual-machine  system stability problem, and is the only rapid computation  method in the world at present using a purely analytical mode to  resolve electric power system stability. It has a high degree of  precision and its actual applied speed is two numerical grades  faster than the numerical integration methods of the past. In  1991, the French Electric Power Company (EDF), the largest in  the world, applied EEAC in its power grid system and operating  program. Because of its obviously superior computation precision  and speed, many countries are now tracking this achievement.    Because EEAC was still in the static stage at the end of  1991, Dr. Xue Yusheng and a scientific research group led by  him, further developed a dynamic state EEAC and developed a  critical identification method. This raised the precision of  EEAC up to a new stage and freed operating personnel from their  a priori knowledge and took a major step toward its use in  engineering. In China, the Nanjing Automation Institute has  placed EEAC into formal on-line operation in the East China  Grid's real-time energy management system. The results over the  past year confirm that EEAC provides great assistance in  avoiding power grid destabilization accidents.    At the EEAC examination and acceptance meeting held on 2  April 1994, Ministry of Electric Power Industry minister Shi  Dazhen [0670 1129 2923] called on power grids in all areas of  China to extend and apply this internationally advanced  stability computation method to raise safe and stable operation  of China's power grids to a new level.</p>

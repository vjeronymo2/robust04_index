			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Pollard Rejection"] </F>   [Text] It is both tragic and ironic that the recent arrest  of CIA spy Aldrich Ames, which should have made it easier for  President Bill Clinton to pardon Jonathan Pollard, actually  played an apparently decisive role in preventing his release.  What seems to have affected Clinton's decision most is the kind  of message a clemency for Pollard would send at this time. In  the eyes of the public, there is little difference between  spies. And showing leniency for one spy immediately after  another is apprehended -- with the possibility that still others  are operating -- would probably be an unpopular move. Being  under fire himself, Clinton must have felt that he was in no  position to make such a move.    Yet on merit the Ames case should have worked in Pollard's  favor. It has made clear that the nasty innuendoes about Pollard  selling Israel material that was then conveyed to the Soviet  Union by Communist moles here were baseless. And the charges  that he may have caused the death of American agents in the USSR  are even more unreasonable. With the Soviets having a CIA mole  in charge of U.S. agents in the USSR, any other information  about American operations in the Soviet Union -- something  Pollard had little reason to be interested in anyway -- was  rendered superfluous. The recent charges that Pollard, in  isolation almost throughout his stay in prison, managed to  transmit even more secrets to Israel after his arrest are simply  ludicrous.    Nor does it make sense to say, as CIA chief James Woolsey  did  in explaining why he opposed the clemency, that it makes little  difference whether the spy worked for a friendly country of for  the U.S.'s most dangerous enemy. It is traditional and  customary, and perfectly logical, to treat spies for friendly  countries leniently. In most cases they serve relatively light  sentences. The U.S. has treated such spies very differently  from the way it has treated Pollard. And Israel has been  remarkably lenient with American spies.    Yet the intelligence establishment in the U.S. seems to  believe Pollard deserves life in prison, the maximum punishment  in peace time. It is the kind of punishment usually reserved  for the Ameses of this world, the traitors who sell secret  information to America's most implacable enemy. Unlike Pollard,  Ames endangered the U.S. and caused the death of at least 10  American agents. But in what can only be called a travesty of  justice, Ames's sentence will be no heavier than Pollard's.    The existence of this double standard can only be explained  by a prevailing antagonism toward Israel in some parts of the  American government. Why it exists is not quite comprehensible.  None of the pat explanations is satisfactory. One can only  hope now that it will not be long before another opportunity to  appeal to the president will arise, and that the circumstances  will be more conducive to clemency. Pollard has suffered enough.</p>

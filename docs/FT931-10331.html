			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Revenue staff reject pay system MEMBERS of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation have rejected revised plans for performance pay. They voted by 34,147 to 6,588 to back a campaign of non-co-operation. The Revenue was one of the first government departments to introduce a performance-pay system, but after complaints from both staff and managers revised proposals were introduced on an experimental basis.</p>

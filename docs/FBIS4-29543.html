			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["YONHAP report from Tokyo"] </F>   [Text] According to Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the United  States requested Japan to support the emergency evacuation of  foreigners in the ROK, including U.S. citizens, when Japan  begins to transport Japanese people in the ROK back to Japan in  the case of an extremely tense situation on the Korean peninsula.    YOMIURI SHIMBUN today quoted a Japanese Government source as  saying that, upon the request, the government is hurrying the  revision of laws concerning the Self-Defense Force to enable the  Self-Defense Force to dispatch its aircraft for the  transportation of foreigners. The Japanese Government is also  reviewing the immigration and customs process for an emergency,  and the deployment of naval vessels for mass transportation.    The source said when President Clinton had a telephone  conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Hata on 14 June,  President Clinton conveyed his intention to build up U.S. Forces  in the ROK and asked Japan to help transport Americans.</p>

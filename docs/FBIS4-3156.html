			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 17 (XINHUA) -- President Bill  Clinton said today that the United States opposes lifting the  U.N.-authorized sanctions against the Serbs for the time being,  as suggested by some European countries.    While stressing a diplomatic solution to the Bosnian crisis,  Clinton reiterated that Washington remains committed to its role  in NATO under the United Nations.    Clinton, having communications on Bosnia with British Prime  Minister John Major and Russian President Boris Yeltsin earlier  today, did not rule out further NATO air strikes on Serbs around  Gorazde.    "It depends on the U.N. commander on the ground," he said.    The U.S. "is still a very important part of the NATO  alliance  and we are committed to doing whatever we're asked to do,"  Clinton said.    The situation around Gorazde, one of the six Bosnian Muslim  "safe areas" designated by the U.N., remains confusing.    There were reports that Serb tanks were retreating and  fighting subsided in the Muslim enclave encircled by the Serbs.    Meanwhile, Charles Redman, the U.S. ambassador to Bosnia,  told NBC's "Meet the Press" program that Gorazde was under the  military and tactical control of the Serbs.    U.S. airplanes under NATO launched two air strikes against  Bosnian Serb positions during the past two weeks.    In retaliation, the Serbs held more than 100 U.N. soldiers  as  hostages.    One British jet fighter was shot down Saturday over Gorazde.    However, Clinton said, negotiations between the U.N. and the  Bosnian Serbs had "some progress," such as the Serb agreement to  release 16 Canadian soldiers.</p>

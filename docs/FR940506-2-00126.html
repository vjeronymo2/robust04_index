The Elk River Railroad, Inc. (TERRI) filed a petition for exemption seeking authority to construct and operate a 30-mile line of railroad from Hartland to Falling Rock, in Clay and Kanawha Counties, WV. Because of the proposed construction and operation's potential for significant environmental impacts, SEA has determined that preparation of a DEIS is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DEIS will address the environmental impacts associated with this proposed construction and operation and will be served on all the parties to the proceeding and made available to the public. There will be a 45 day comment period from the date the DEIS is served to allow the public opportunity to comment. After assessing all of the comments to the DEIS, SEA will then issue a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) that will include SEA's final recommendations to the Commission. The Commission will consider the FEIS and the environmental record in making its decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the scoping process is to identify significant environmental issues and determine the scope of issues to be addressed in the DEIS. Issues typically addressed in DEIS's include alternatives to the proposed action, impacts on transportation systems, land use, socio-economic impacts directly related to changes in the physical environment, energy resources, air quality, noise quality, public health and safety, biological resources, water quality, historic resources, coastal zone management consistency review, and mitigation to reduce or avoid impacts on the environment. Persons that cannot attend the scoping meetings may submit questions and comments in writing up to 30 days after the scoping meetings. Written comments may be submitted directly to the Commission no later than July 1, 1994. Public scoping meetings will be held on the following dates:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;May 31, 1994, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m at the Clendenin Community Center (next to the Town Hall) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;June 1, 1994, from 4 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Clay High School Cafeteria. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Michael J.

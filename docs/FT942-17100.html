			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Sweden to reduce borrowing Sweden's borrowing requirement for the 1993-94 budget year is likely to be SKr220bn (Pounds 19bn), well below the government's forecast of SKr270bn published in January, Mr Staffan Crona, director general of Sweden's National Debt Office, said yesterday. The National Debt Office also forecasts that the borrowing requirement in 1994-95 will be SKr210bn, down from an estimate of SKr220bn in January. Mr Crona told journalists in London that the lower 1993-94 forecast reflected the impact of Sweden's economic recovery on the budget, likely privatisation receipts, including the planned sale of the state's holding in Pharmacia, and the end of the financial crisis in Sweden.</p>

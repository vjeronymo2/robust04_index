			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Arts: From Diner to Bugsy - Screen / Nigel Andrews talks to film director Barry Levinson CONSIDER THIS American career story. A man starts out writing sketches for comedy shows on local TV. He graduates to scripting for Mel Brooks and gets to stab Mr Brooks in the shower in a cameo role in High Anxiety. He turns director with a cult teenage-recall film called Diner. He follows with two giant box-office hits called Good Morning Vietnam and Rain Man. He turns round and makes a tiny autobiographical film, Avalon. He then turns round again and summons ten Oscar nominations with a big-budget, Warren Beatty-starring gangster film called Bugsy. That Barry Levinson, in both career and habitat, is a rule unto himself is clear from his office at 20th Century Fox: lots of friendly clatter, plastic coffee-cups and a tousled Mr L who eats out of takeaway Chinese cartons. Levinson - I met him before Bugsy had opened, let alone won a Golden Globe and Critics Prize for Best Film of 1991 - gives the impression of running a cottage industry. But as a film-maker he is more and more fascinated by the way humble human values are corrupted by dwarfing ambitions or cultural tyrannies. Avalon was about the curse of TV on postwar family life. Rain Man was about the potential curse of a yuppie's greed on an autistic brother. And the potent black-comedy elements in Bugsy come from the inner clash between Siegel's vestigial seam of charm and innocence and his giant streak of malevolent ambition. 'What fascinated me is, here was a gangster who wanted to be a film star, who used glamour to disguise his more sociopathic behaviour. I'd always seen gangsters as East Coast: overcoats, hats, the Godfather look. I'd never seen a 'Hollywood' gangster before, a man who needed that finesse and facade in order to function. 'Bugsy Siegel wanted to be an actor. But he failed, so he became another kind of star. He built the Flamingo Hotel, which was the foundation stone of Las Vegas, and he took the Hollywood glamour to the desert where he played host to the entertainers.' But doesn't the film itself, especially in presenting Siegel in the ladykilling form of Warren Beatty, risk glamorising evil? 'No, I don't think so. The danger is that society itself allows these men to exist. A killer doesn't walk around a party looking like a killer. He can be handsome, debonair; the fact that he is among us and unobserved is what's frightening.' So is the volatile performance the director has coaxed from Warren Beatty. Typically of a Levinson film Bugsy itself is as mixed-mood as its main character. 'If it works, it's because we've totally broken up the gangster genre. We're more humorous, more romantic, but along with that there's a darker side. It might offend some people who think 'Oh you can only be a comedy or a romance or a thriller.' We're all of those things.' Bugsy, Oscars regardless, has paid for its sophistication by performing unspectacularly at the box office. But then Levinson, with a few lapses, has consistently seemed more interested in selling truth than in selling tickets. Even when sucked into the rubbish zone, as with Young Sherlock Holmes or the more empty-headed parts of The Natural and Good Morning Vietnam, he has struggled out again and tried to renew his identity. His Baltimore trilogy - Diner, Tin Men, Avalon - is a unique attempt by a high-profile American director to make a plain-spun movie series about his own home town. The big films help to finance the small. 'There's nothing worse to a studio than a director saying 'I want to do a personal film.' It's almost offensive to them. So by doing a Rain Man, it lets you do an Avalon.' And Avalon is all about the kind of processed thinking that mass entertainment encourages and that the studios, Levinson implies, subscribe to. 'The key to that piece was television. TV, I believe, has had an effect we cannot yet understand, in undermining families and all kinds of values. I remember the TV coming into my family's house, all wrapped up like a wonderful gift, and everybody gathered round. I remember visiting my grandfather; he was all alone with the TV on in the background and I thought, 'There is a story here.' An entire sense of communal living has disappeared. People start having their trays in front of the TV; the family dinner, that kind of togetherness, becomes a thing of the past.' The curse of television doesn't stop with the family. 'Because of TV today we want to understand everything instantly or we want nothing to do with it. Take advertising. You have to sell your movie in a 30-second slot. How do you do it? You can't. So you simplify and coarsen what it's about. I have a fear we will end up with an age of Batmans and Terminators and whatever else is high, high concept. I think we're seeing the death of complexity when films like, say, Treasure Of The Sierra Madre won't get made any more. 'People have been brainwashed to want great simplicity. How else do you explain that here in America in the 1990s abortion is a major political issue? When there are so many world concerns - famines, wars, economic crises - we're hammering away at abortion. It's because it's an emotional, quick issue and everyone can take sides about it. It's the TV culture. Everything has to march to the signal and tempo it sets.' The same hatred of pre-fabricated ideas and rhythms influenced his direction of Rain Man. Inheriting the project from Spielberg, who had worked on it for months but was then obliged to go and make Indiana Jones 3, Levinson risked studio odium by throwing out much of the stuff his predecessor had left behind. 'The biggest change was getting rid of the adventure elements. Chases, fights. I said, 'Let's just have two guys on the road.' There's ambitious Charlie, who's got a soft centre. And Raymond, the immovable autistic. Let's have the con man try to con the guy who can't be reached. At some point he, Charlie, will have to turn back on himself because the other guy won't respond. It's like hitting a ball at a wall. So that was what we did. Made it a character study, pure and simple.' Which is what at heart Bugsy is. The question is: what sort of character? I'm still preoccupied with the glamorised gangster question. Bugsy is part of a flood of Mafia and mobster films issuing from Hollywood during the last twelvemonth. What is the attraction? And what does the phenomenon tell us about the world or America itself? 'We are this young country,' answers Levinson after a pause, 'with no history. We didn't have kings or queens. We didn't have King Arthur. So we've invented our own mythology, which has become part of the genres we work. It may be part of our sick society that we keep dredging up this criminal past. But there is a fascination. Maybe we have to know ourselves thoroughly before we can cure ourselves.'</p>

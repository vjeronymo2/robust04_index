			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China needs to reciprocate"] </F>   [Text] It would be bad taste to consider President Bill  Clinton's decision to extend Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) trading  status to China for another year as a case of eating humble pie.  It was painful to have to acknowledge that he had been wrong to  use the trade bludgeon to improve human rights in China. Saying  the policy had "outlived its usefulness" would not fool those  who had tracked this doomed approach, but it was the best  construction that could be put on a policy blunder. But Mr.  Clinton was honest; credit due to him for that would, it is  hoped, ease the disappointment of having to endure another  setback in a spell of political and personal reverses. For  China, there must be immense satisfaction that it has bent  America to its will on the cold logic of economics and its  strategic importance to a world which has discarded one by one  the old assumptions valid during the era of the U.S.-Soviet  contest. But it should not gloat. The MFN tussle was not a  chess game to determine which of the two countries could  manoeuvre more smartly. China prevailed in spite of itself; its  harsh treatment of citizens who disagree openly with the  government cannot continue, with or without the censure of world  opinion. Rather, what this episode proved was that despite  mutual distaste -- over America's meddlesome policies and  China's intrusive policing of its citizenry -- the U.S. and  China need to seek a form of accomodation that will stand them  in good stead into the next century. China can be a benign  force for stability in the Asia- Pacific region: exerting  pressure on North Korea to minimise the nuclear risk, its  vibrant growth spreading prosperity down to Indochina and  Southeast Asia, economic expansion taking the sting out of  whatever hegemonic intensions it may have.    Recognising that withholding trade privileges would bring  misery to millions of workers in China, Hong Kong and the U.S.  in return for minimal gains in human rights compliance would,  one hopes, bring about a new enlightenment in America's  relations with big and potentially powerful nations. Economic  need now surpasses pure ideology. That has been much conceded  by Mr. Clinton with the tacit disavowal of his executive order  linking renewed MFN to "significant progress" in China's  handling of human rights issues. Consider some numbers -- 182  countries enjoy MFN with the U.S. with only nine denied it;  150,000 American jobs will be in jeopardy if China could sell  only a fraction of the U.S.$33 billion worth of goods it sold to  the U.S. last year.    For people in Asia, relief that a collision has been averted  must be tempered by this realisation: as much as Mr. Clinton's  backdown will not be cost-free where his domestic standing and  re-election chances are concerned, China needs to return the  favour. That simply means that it has to treat its people  better. Torture, disappearances in the night, inhumane  incarceration, now an embarrassment, would be unacceptable  infractions as China comes up in the world. The White House  National Security Adviser, Mr. Anthony Lake, was not trying to  salvage a bad situation when he said the American spotlight on  human rights had concentrated Chinese minds on the issue.  America did make a candid contribution. Mr. Clinton says his  country will persist with the crusade. With the linkage with  trade removed, it all looks more palatable. Asian countries, on  their part, have to use moral persuasion and quiet diplomacy to  impress upon China the need to reciprocate America's gesture by  taking the brutishness out of its treatment of political  prisoners. But a distinction has to be made: using human rights  as a cover for imposing so-called minimum labour standards as a  means of cancelling out the developing world's advantage must be  exposed for what it is. The U.S. and France, egged on by  certain human rights watchdog groups, have kept this on the  backburner despite a roasting they received at the GATT  conference in Morocco recently. But it will not go away.</p>

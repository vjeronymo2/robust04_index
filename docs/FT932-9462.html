			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc concentrates shortage forecast TODAY'S HUGE surplus of zinc concentrates, the raw material used by smelters, will swing into a big shortfall in the next two to three years, warns a study by consultants Brook Hunt &amp; Associates. The shortfall could rise to 1.2m tonnes by 2000 and 2.8m tonnes in 2005. Brook Hunt says the problem is being caused by today's low prices and smelters' high treatment charges which have made about half the western world zinc mine capacity uneconomic and caused the closure so far in 1993 of 400,000 tonnes of mine capacity. The study identifies those smelters that might lose their concentrate supplies because of mine closures and says several companies which today rely on their own mines may be forced into the custom concentrate market in future. The Zinc Concentrate Market to 2005. Pounds 8,000 from Brook Hunt, 11 London Street, Chertsey, Surrey, KT16 8AP, UK.</p>

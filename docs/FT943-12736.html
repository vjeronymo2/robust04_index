			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Treuhand deal on Eko Stahl The Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday agreed to provide a fresh financing package for Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's loss-making steel mill, until the end of the year. However Mr Wolf Schode, spokesman for the agency, confirmed it was hoping to sell the mill in the autumn, after Riva, the privately-owned Italian steel manufacturer, pulled out of a contract to buy Eko Stahl in May. Mr Schode said Eko Stahl would receive DM50m (Pounds 20.6m) to cover losses, adding that the European Commission had already been told and he was 'not pessimistic' that the grant would be accepted by Brussels. The Commission last month started proceedings concerning the legality of state aid to Eko Stahl.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The National Committee  of the Quebec Communist Party of Canada recently adopted a  resolution supporting the Pyongyang declaration "Let us defend  and advance the cause of socialism."    The resolution denounced the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean authorities' provocative acts of constantly threatening  peace on the Korean peninsula.    Condemning the large-scale campaign against the DPRK over  its  "nuclear issue" as a move to destabilize the socialist Korea,  the resolution expressed solidarity with the Korean people in  their struggle for defence of socialism.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking to an Interfax correspondent today, Sergey  Filatov, head of the Russian president's administration, denied  rumors of his allegedly imminent departure from the post. It  appears that it is in someone's interest to keep bombarding  public opinion with all sorts of speculation about resignations,  dismissals, and reshuffles in the top echelons of power. The  purpose of this permanent campaign is to break the rhythm of  reforms and to prevent society from consolidating, Filatov said.    Sergey Filatov, who has been at the head of the presidential  administration since the end of January 1993, believes the top  priority for Russia's top leadership at this stage is purposeful  work aimed at strengthening civil peace and carrying out  economic reforms.</p>

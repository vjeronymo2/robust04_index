In an interview with AUGSBURGER  ALLGEMEINE, Frisch said that one must assume that "the PKK gets  financial, logistical, and personal assistance from RAF  sympathizers, maybe also from the commando echelon." There have  been several "solidarity actions" for the PKK by the RAF scene,  Frisch said.</p>

This press release signed by Bernard Sansaricq says: The  Senate office makes it a point to inform national and  international institutions and the general public that,  following the Senate resolution of 4 February dissolving the  former office headed by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, and following  the new elections that were held, Senator Jean-Louis is no  longer empowered to represent, or to make commitments on the  part of, the Senate.    This new office is headed by Bernard Sansaricq and made up  of  a number of legislators elected in the contested 18 January  elections.    This office was formed the day after the visit to the Senate  by U.S. Ambassador William Lacy Swing. The U.S. diplomat had  openly brought his support to Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, head of  the office formed in August, 1993. It was thus in response to  this step by the U.S. ambassador that the other senators decided  to form a new office. Edner Jean filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] Thus, hesitation has ended. The  contested legislators elected in the 18 January elections,  supported by five regular senators from the Alliance for  Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP], on 4 February made good on their  warning. The resolution to dismiss him -- that sword of Damocles  that had been hanging over his head -- finally fell upon Firmin  Jean-Louis, and his position as head of the Senate was put to a  vote by the antiestablishment senators, who opted for the split.    In their complaints, the senators reproached the legally  elected president of the National Assembly for his lack of  capability and, mostly, for his unconditional support to the  Malval government with a view to imposing on Haitian territory  the consequences, so hastily planned, of the embargo supported  by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    Such an attitude, deemed detrimental to the interests of  Haiti in general, was interpreted by the contested legislators  and the ACP senators as an act of high treason. However, it is  basically the U.S. ambassador's visit to Senate President Firmin  Jean-Louis that prompted the events. [Senator Thomas Eddy  Dupiton] Considering that, to crown the infamy, Senator Firmin  Jean-Louis, president of the Senate of the Republic, met with  U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing on 3 February to sign with him  a joint statement on official Senate letterhead, as if Swing  were a Haitian senator; and considering that the Senate office  as currently constituted is a cause of tension and exacerbation  of the political crisis the country is in; and considering that  it is the duty of the Senate faction that is still sane and  responsible to shoulder, in this serious circumstance, its  patriotic responsibilities in conformity with the duly validated  mandate it received from the voters of the nation's nine  geographical departments; and considering that for all those  reasons, it is urgent that those legislators take measures to  protect the collective interest, which is in danger:    Article 1: As of today the Senate office formed by  acclamation on 10 August 1993 is and remains dismissed. [end  recording]    [Jean] Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton, who was seen as the  future replacement for Firmim Jean-Louis -- he had officially  announced his candidacy -- withdrew that candidacy at the last  moment in favor of Bernard Sansaricq. Dupiton considered that he  had already played the role of Saint John the Baptist, having  been the first to shout in the desert to demand the dismissal of  the legal Senate office.    Dupiton wants to pass the ball to Sansaricq, whom he looks  upon as Jesus, the messiah who will come to free the Senate and  the country as a whole.    Bernard Sansaricq, then, has been unanimously elected head  of  the ACP [Senate] office and the contested legislators elected on  18 January.    Sansaricq is assisted by Ronel Manigat, as vice president,  one of the contested legislators elected on 18 January. Ebrane  Cadet, the acting president who just completed his mission, has  become first secretary. The only woman among the senators was  elected second secretary; and Osny Eugene, another contested  legislator elected on 18 January, is the quaestor. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Technology: Development in common - Andrew Fisher on countries planning technological expansion What do composite materials in Malaysia, solar energy in Botswana, telecommunications in Malta and packaging technology in Cyprus have in common? The answer is twofold: these countries are all keen to develop industries based on advanced technologies and they are all in the Commonwealth. Helping these and other countries try to move their economies deeper into the modern industrial age is the Commonwealth Consultative Group on Technology Management. In February, it launched its Private Sector Partnership aimed at linking industry with the often complicated process of technology transfer. Much of the impetus for the partnership approach has come from Malaysia which has embarked on an ambitious Vision 2020 programme to transform it into a fully developed country. 'We cannot be in the front line of modern technology,' said Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister announcing the country's programme two years ago. 'But we must always try to catch up at least in those fields where we may have certain advantages.' One area Malaysia is trying to build up is products using composite materials, as in the Eagle XTS light aircraft being developed with Australia. With CCGTM's help, Malaysia is keen to use its knowledge of composites to make aircraft components and other products such as sporting equipment. It intends to set up a zone in the Malacca region for joint ventures in composites. 'Other countries are looking to see what Malaysia is doing,' says Michaela Smith, manager of CCGTM. Three Malaysian companies, YTL (construction and power), Sapura (communications equipment) and Globe Silk Store, have joined the Private Sector Partnership. UK members include Cable &amp; Wireless, GEC-Marconi, Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, Short Brothers and Shell International. However, membership is not restricted to the Commonwealth. Non-Commonwealth nations can become involved in individual projects or advisory programmes set up through the partnership; CCGTM has contacted France, Denmark and Germany about possible involvement. The partnership functions by drawing together the skills, contacts and resources of its members and using these to help countries upgrade their technological base. In Botswana, solar energy, telecommunications and coating of diamonds for industrial use are areas in which partnership members are involved. Cyprus, helped by CCGTM in the area of quality management, is keen to develop in the textile and packaging sectors, possibly with help from Malaysian industry. As part of its drive to become a telecommunications hub in the Mediterranean region, Malta has called on the help of the CCGTM partnership to involve international interests. Those showing interest include Mercury (the UK operation of Cable &amp; Wireless), Hong Kong and Malaysian telecommunications interests, and Hong Kong shipping and banking concerns. The Private Sector Partnership has responded to around 100 separate requests for advice. The concept has also sparked interest outside the 50-member Commonwealth. Next week, Smith and colleagues will be in Washington to talk to the Organisation of American States (OAS) about the partnership programme's relevance for South America. She hopes CCGTM and the OAS could eventually work together on technology transfer projects. Jonathan Solomon, executive director for strategy and corporate business development at Cable &amp; Wireless, believes the CCGTM's partnership - soon to be set up as a UK-based company - could become a model for other organisations. The benefits from the CCGTM's efforts will take time to show through, however. 'We want to help countries galvanise their own people,' says Omar Abdul Rahman, scientific adviser to the Malaysian prime minister. 'We want more Commonwealth companies to be involved.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangalore 9 May -- Efforts are being made to  increase the strike range of the country's most sophisticated  weapon `Agni' [long range surface-to-surface missile]. At  present its range is limited to 1,500 km. Agni's shape may also  be changed.    Dr. A.N. Agarwal, director of the Agni program, gave this  information while addressing a function organized by the Indian  Institute of Technology, Madras. He revealed that there will be  no change in the warhead which at present is capable of carrying  one tonne of explosives. However, efforts are being made to  increase the payload capacity during the third stage of the  missile development, but it has no connection with the warhead  load.    Dr. Agarwal said that the first successful flight of the  missile proved that India has been able to acquire the  technology of the 10-tonne G [as published] missile type. The  later flights proved that the reentry payload can hit the  smallest of targets.    What after Agni? Replying to the question, Dr. Agarwal said  that we are further refining the latest system of flight data  analyses.    Dr. Agarwal said that the Indian missile program has emerged  from many pressures. This has given recognition to India in  this field. He said that most of the modern missile techniques  are controlled by very few countries. India has developed the  technique from indigenous technology and available limited  facilities at its own institutes and with the help of its own  scientists.    He said that the country's young scientists have taken up  the  new challenges. Equipment banned under the Missile Technology  Control regime are being developed. He assured that the country  will make rapid progress in this field in future.    On the subject of missile technology development, Dr.  Agarwal  said this was a small program due to which the country can now  sit and talk with the superpowers on an equal basis. He said  the developed nations are stubborn in this connection and they  do not even want to give an ordinary database technique to  developing nations.    About research work being done in different fields, he said  India will become strong technologically and economically in  next 20 to 25 years.</p>

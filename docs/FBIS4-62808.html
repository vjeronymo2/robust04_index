			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Feature comprising unattributed report "based on data from </F> the Russian Federation Government Economic Conditions Center,"  plus editorial commentary: "26 April-4 May: The Week's Prices.  A Market Is a Market"]    [Text] According to the latest data from the weekly  monitoring of prices by state statistics organs, the overall  inflation index for the past week stood at 102.2 percent, and at  160 percent for the period since the beginning of the year.  Prices of food products rose by 1.9 percent, and prices of  other products by 2.3 percent; the price of paid public services  rose by 3.8 percent.    The largest price increases for basic consumer goods and  paid  services -- 5.7 percent -- were recorded in the Ural region,  where the largest increases in Russia were recorded for nonfood  goods -- 6 percent -- and paid services: 36 percent.    At the beginning of May the prices of basic food products  were 1.1 percent up on the end of April in organized trade and  5.4 percent up in nonorganized trade. The largest increases  were for products sold in the city markets, where fruit prices  increased by 10.8 percent in the week, prices of groats and  pasta by 7.6 percent, vegetable prices by 5.6 percent, and  prices of meat products by 5.1 percent. In all regions prices  during the holidays and the days leading up to them rose most of  all for meat products -- by 4-6 percent -- and also fruit and  vegetables -- by 4-14 percent, mainly as a result of increases  in the city and informal markets. Only prices of vegetable oil  and vodka remained unchanged, in both the stores and the markets.    The average cost of a basket of the 19 most important  products on 4 May was 48,500 rubles [R], a 60-percent increase  in the period since the beginning of the year. The cost of this  basket at organized trade prices was R46,500, and at market  prices R59,700.    The lowest cost of the basket was again recorded in the  Volga  region -- R38,200. The "dearest" region for the cost of the  basket remains the Far East region -- R83,000.    Among the list of nonfood goods, fuel prices continued to  increase at an accelerated rate -- more than 10 percent in the  course of the week. Among other goods the most notable price  increases were for nitroglycerine (4.5 percent), wallpaper once  again (3.7 percent), and matches (3.2 percent). Prices of  tobacco products were virtually unchanged.    The largest price increases were in the Ural region -- 6  percent. This change in the average prices in the region over  the week was the result of increases of more than 10 percent on  fuel, and also children's clothing and footwear.    There remains a significant gap between the minimum and the  maximum prices of identical goods in different Russian cities.  Thus during the whole of April and at the beginning of May the  difference in prices of analgin [type of painkiller] was 1,200  percent and of cotton fabrics around 500 percent.  <H5>  Our Commentary </H5>   Readers are anxious to know what products make up the basket  of 19 goods. Obviously this is no idle question; it is prompted  by a desire to know what average prices the analysis is based  upon, and whether the basket corresponds to people's real needs.    We publish the list of average prices for 4 May. The prices,  as you can see, are very close to the real ones. In Moscow  (which is the 34th most expensive city), at least, prices of  some products -- particularly granulated sugar (R560-R580), eggs  (R650-R1,000), and raw materials (from R4,800) -- were even a  little lower.    As for the nutritional norm, let us once again stipulate:  This list, in the form in which it is published, can in no way  be considered a biological norm recommended by medics. This  indicator is taken by economists in order to trace the change in  the inflation level in the country. And although it initially  contains a sensible starting point for the nutrition of a  healthy male, nevertheless, you won't be able to determine  whether the state statisticians' approaches to assessing our  economic situation are right just by the simple addition of the  figures. This is demonstrated by the round figures for weight:  It appears that in the course of a month an adult consumes a  total of exactly one kilogram, and smokes one packet of filter  cigarettes. This is nonsense. So here is the list -- but do  not be hasty with your conclusions.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

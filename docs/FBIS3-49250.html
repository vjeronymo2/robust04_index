			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 6 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vojislav Seselj,  chairman of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], today condemned the  behavior of the Belgrade regime toward elections in the republic  of Serb Krajina, labeling it as "backroom dealing."    At a news conference, Seselj said that "backroom dealing by  the Belgrade regime police in Krajina unveils the mechanism that  the regime is also secretly using in Serbia." According to him,  authorities in Serbia believe that by TV manipulations in the  next 12 days, ahead of the fresh round of elections in Krajina,  they can change the will of the Krajina people. "The Serbian  Radical Party will do everything to prevent it," Seselj stressed.    He also announced that the Radicals will "do everything" to  prevent the continuation of the government campaign against  private business owners, members of the Serbian Radical Party,  which has taken on the form of thwarting their business  activities in order to ruin them financially.    Seselj also condemned, as he put it, the state terror  against  organizers of the latest strikes, which, according to him, are  an expression of workers' discontent. "The regime must do  something to avoid strikes, but not to achieve it by arresting  organizers, but by improving the living standard of all those  employed," he added.    Seselj read out a list of deputies to the Serbian Assembly  appointed by the Main Committee of the Serbian Radical Party.  Out of 39 SRS deputies to the republican parliament, these are  the SRS MP's from the electoral district of Belgrade: Dragan  Todorovic, Aleksandar Vucic, Stevan Vukajlovic, Dusica Nikolic,  Stevo Dragisic, Miroslav Dereta, and Miroslav Bogdanovic.

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTERED COMMUNISTS SEEK NEW POLISH ROLE  </P> <P> Poland's Communist Party on Monday launched a potentially historic effort to  pull itself back from the brink of political destruction and become the first  Communist party in the East Bloc to find a niche for itself in a pluralistic  system.  </P> <P> "This is a very special moment," Leszek Miller, a member of the party  Politburo, said as he opened the party's first leadership meeting since it gave  up its monopoly on power to a Solidarity-led coalition government earlier this  month.  </P> <P> He said the party will transform itself into "a new socialist party" able to  compete in democratic conditions, or "we will inevitably be pushed aside to the  margin of political life, and we will be dominated and removed not only by  Solidarity but also by other political forces."  </P> <P> In an unprecedented action meant to underline the party's commitment to a new  style, the party Central Committee opened the first phase of Monday's meeting  to the Western press.  </P> <P> The leadership meeting was called to begin preparations for a congress early  next year that is expected to overhaul the party's ideology, its statutes and  possibly its name. It is known officially as the Polish United Workers' Party.  The current session is to take place in two parts, with no decisions made until  later this month after a plebiscite among party members on alternate  strategies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skepticism Over Survival  </P> <P> Many analysts are skeptical about whether the party can survive local elections  scheduled for next year and national elections in 1993 no matter what it does.  Others expect the party to split under the pressures of trying to reform  itself, with either the more liberal wing or the conservative hard-liners  breaking away if the debate over strategy goes against them.  </P> <P> "It never happened that a Communist party could cope with democracy and  freedom," Solidarity official Bronislaw Geremek said Monday in an interview. He  is chairman of the labor movement's 161-member parliamentary delegation and  principal adviser to its chairman, Lech Walesa.  </P> <P> "That's the end of the Communist Party," Geremek went on, "and I think one can  say it proudly. They know it and we know it. The question is only how to go  about it."  </P> <P> He said the future of the Communist Party is "the main political question at  the moment, and it was so from the beginning of this process."  </P> <P> The Communist parties of Western Europe compete in pluralistic systems, but  they have never been in a position of obtaining power and then having to  relinquish it.  </P> <P> The Polish Communists, installed in power by Soviet troops nearly 45 years ago  at the end of World War II, were soundly defeated by Solidarity-backed  candidates last June in elections for Parliament.  </P> <P> They now control four of the 23 Cabinet-level posts in the new coalition  government and the presidency.  </P> <P> In a televised address last week, party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski  warned "all members and sympathizers to understand that there is no return to  the party's old role." And he added: "With the mechanisms of power in its  hands, the (party) has been growing weaker and weaker over the years. It is now  ridding itself of many burdens and faces a historic opportunity to boost its  political vitality and influences."  </P> <P> From a peak of over 3 million members in the late 1970s, party membership has  fallen to a reported 2 million, while the average age of its members has risen  from 40 to 46.  </P> <P> At least a million party members, according to Rakowski, hold jobs in the civil  service and the country's economic administration under the so-called  nomenklatura system of reserving key jobs throughout society for party members.  And they feel particularly threatened as the Solidarity prime minister, Tadeusz  Mazowiecki, begins to overhaul the government and economic bureaucracies in an  attempt to halt a national tailspin.  </P></p>

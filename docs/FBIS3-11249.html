			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio warned that  "towns will not be allowed to go without civilian or military  authorities." He was referring to Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa,  Escuintla, and San Lucas Toliman municipalities, Solola  Department, whose residents seek the withdrawal of security  forces.    Upon returning from a three-day trip to Mexico, De Leon  Carpio attributed the residents' dissatisfaction with the  authorities to several causes, including social corruption, and  the fact that justice is not properly managed. The president  explained that many of the irregularities that delay law  enforcement will be corrected when the new Penal Code goes into  effect, but he emphasized that the problem lies not only in the  laws but in the human element as well.    We have training programs for law enforcement personnel  which  will guarantee a change in the current situation, but there are  other elements outside justice management that prevent the  normal governing of the country.    The people's discontent in those areas where the security  forces have been asked to withdraw is understandable if we  consider that the citizens' attitudes are affected by other  factors such as poverty, injustice, and social disorder.    The president described his trip to Mexico as positive in  every respect and said he worked with a full agenda for several  exhausting but satisfying days to achieve the benefits obtained  for our country.

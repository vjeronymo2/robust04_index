			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sound around the houses A SOUND system which upstages today's two-speaker stereo sound by giving the impression that music is coming from all around has long been promised. Now Perfect Pitch of London has developed a system called Om which, it believes, will bring such an effect within the price range of smaller recording studios. The home stereo user will not need to buy extra equipment. Instead, a devise in the studio, incorporated at the mixing stage, filters the sound by reflecting it off an electronic circuit. This fools the ear of the listener, when playing the music at home, into thinking that the sound is emerging from in front, behind and from each side  -rather than from the two speakers. The Perfect Pitch equipment to achieve these psycho-acoustic effects is available from Select Systems of Hanworth, Middlesex, for Pounds 3,500. Select Systems: UK, 081 893 8662.</p>

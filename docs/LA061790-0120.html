			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZUSA'S POLICE CHIEF MAY FINALLY GET POMONA POST  </P> <P> The Police Department, without a permanent police chief since Richard Tefank  was fired last September, may get a new chief this week.  </P> <P> City Administrator Julio Fuentes said he will recommend that the City Council  on Monday confirm his choice of Azusa Police Chief Lloyd Wood, 50, who has 28  years' experience in law enforcement.  </P> <P> Wood, who has been under consideration for the job since February, had insisted  earlier that he would accept the appointment only with a long-term employment  agreement. Wood said he has given up his insistence on a three-year agreement  and will accept the appointment to serve at the pleasure of the city  administrator and council.  </P> <P> He said he decided to take the job without the security of an employment  contract because it had become controversial and he wants the job. He said he  wants the challenge of working with a larger department in a larger city.  </P> <P> After nine years in Azusa, he said, "I've done everything I can do. There's no  challenge anymore." He said the departure of Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant,  ousted in a recall election earlier this month, had nothing to do with his  decision. Bryant had opposed Wood for the chief's job.  </P> <P> Fuentes said he will recommend that the council confirm the appointment of  Wood, effective July 18.  </P></p>

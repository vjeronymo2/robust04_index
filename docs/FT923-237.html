			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (26): Publishing - reading between the lines / A look at mega-mergers and the Frankfurt Book Fair HOW FAR can the accelerating internationalisation of book marketing and concentration of publishing go? Much farther, if the recent merger of the UK-based Reed International with the Dutch publisher Elsevier, forming one of the world's largest publishing and information groups, is anything to go by. The 1980's saw some mammoth publishing takeovers - Reed paying Pounds 540m for Octopus, News Corporation Dollars 300m for Harper and Row, Hachette Dollars 470m for Grolier, and Maxwell Communications Corporation the (restrospectively outlandish) sum of Dollars 2.6bn for the US publisher Macmillan - which, along with acquisitions in other media and advertising areas, were more volcanic than fertile. This year's Frankfurt book fair, is, according to some observers, likely to be calmer than in previous years, reflecting the strains felt by consumer book publishers everywhere. At the same time, its importance can only grow as the European Community's single market becomes a reality and transnational publishers generate more ways of selling a product across frontiers. According to Paul Hamlyn, chairman of Octopus, part of the Reed group: 'Book publishing will become more international and there will be more hook-ups between America and Britain; we didn't do the Elsevier deal because of books, but it helps.' Of much greater, though less headline-grabbing significance, has been the stealthy process by which English has become the international language for educational, business and information publishers. The Reed-Elsevier merger exemplifies the shift towards multinationalism via the unifying factor of the English language. Although a Dutch company, Elsevier has made itself a globally important English-language publisher through its science publications. Its merger with Reed will smooth access to other markets. The combined group would have revenues of Pounds 2.44bn and pre-tax profits of Pounds 424m, based on forecasts for the year ending December 31 1991. Attempts to market books on a more global level are being made by other publishers through means other than straightforward mergers. For example, an international consortium of 16 publishers, led by Orion in the UK and Basic Books in the US (a division of HarperCollins), announced at the start of September a co-operative venture to publish scientific texts under a joint imprint called Science Masters. The initial 12 texts will be simultaneously marketed in more than 50 countries, initially in 16 large markets from the autumn of 1994. Within the EC, one issue which is currently on slow burn - though it may heat up before the end of the century - concerns the levying of Value Added Tax on books. Zero rating on books currently prevails in Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal and the UK, but there is pressure to get those countries into line with other EC members, most of which levy VAT at 6 per cent. The global market for book publishing is still dominated by the US. While the former Soviet republics and China are huge publishers, lack of reliable statistics, political turmoil and absence of accurate means of financial comparison means that the measure is still the US market. According to a 1992 survey by Euromonitor, studying the performance of the international book market in 1990, the US remains the largest book publishing market, measured in terms of publishers' net sales, at Dollars 7.9bn (Pounds 4.46bn) annually, followed by Germany (Dollars 5.1bn), France (Dollars 2.83bn), Italy (Dollars 2.81bn), the UK (Dollars 2.35bn) and Spain (Dollars 2.15bn). But in terms of per capita annual spending on books, the league table looks very different: Germany Dollars 64.79; Spain Dollars 55.74; France Dollars 50.32; Italy Dollars 48.86; UKDollars 41.40; and the US Dollars 31.94. In the US the recession has meant that publishers are being more cautious, cutting the volume of new titles. According to Publishers Week, in 1990 the number of titles published in the US fell by 27 per cent to 46,976, with imported titles falling ever further, by 35 per cent. Particularly badly hit were hardback and trade publications, falling from 53,446 in 1989 to 38,884 in 1990. Mass market paperbacks fared better, dropping from 3,722 titles in 1989 to 3,347 in 1990. In value terms sales rose by 4.4 per cent in real terms over 1989, following three years of real growth averaging 6.5 per cent. In the US consumer expenditure on books and maps reached Dollars 12.5bn in 1990, up 3 per cent in real terms but still less than 1 per cent of total consumer spending. Euromonitor forecasts real growth in the US book publishing industry of 33 per cent by 1995, ahead of all other markets, with Germany (29 per cent) in second place. But there are still growth possibilities in children's books and in mystery fiction, which almost 13 per cent of all adults purchased in 1990, making it the best-selling category. The outlook for the immediate future in the US is conditioned by at least one major demographic change; between now and 1995 some 3m school students will enter the market, which should encourage educational specialist publishers. In the UK the last decade has seen considerable growth. Publishers' revenues more than doubled, from Pounds 907m in 1981 to Pounds 1.9bn in 1990, with real annual growth of about 2.5 per cent. But 1991 was a very poor year for the UK book trade; the number of books sold to the public - which account for two-thirds of the Pounds 2.1bn overall UK market - fell by between 10 and 15 per cent on 1990. Euromonitor forecasts real growth in the UK market of 5 per cent by 1995. Publishers have been forced to cut costs by reducing the number of books printed and publishing fewer new titles. Last year there were thousands of job losses across the 18,000-strong industry, with 600 redundancies in one month alone. 'It's a tough time for everybody and the US market is rougher than here. There is a consumer resistance both in the US and the UK; the competition for the leisure pound and dollar is getting greater. But it is an increasing market; a lot of people do not buy books at all so the potential is there,' says Paul Hamlyn. In the UK the industry has polarised, between very large generalist conglomerates and very small specialists, both in publishing and retailing. Smaller publishing houses have been swallowed up by larger ones, so that of the top ten UK publishers by turnover, only three - Macmillan, Oxford University Press and Hodder &amp; Stoughton - are now not part of a large media conglomerate. Specialist publishers of professional and educational books, with more captive audiences, have done much better than publishers of consumer books. The dominant issue in UK book publishing is the future of the Net Book Agreement, the mechanism which sets minimum prices for most books. A year ago Dillons, the chain owned by the Pentos group, discounted the prices of a range of books, following Reed's decision to publish its books outside the NBA. Were the NBA to disappear the multinationals could become more powerful, able to exploit the competitive advantage of size. The NBA's abolition could encourage book sellers to demand higher discounts from their suppliers' publishers, thereby squeezing publishers' margins. 'I think the NBA is an absurdity now, only fit for dinosaurs. It should go and people in the book industry should spend their time thinking about selling more books. If the NBA disappeared book sales would increase by 10 to 25 per cent because they would be sold in places where the public is; in the UK the public are not exposed to books now,' argues Hamlyn.</p>

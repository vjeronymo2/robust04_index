The treaty was  signed on October 14, 1993. The treaty confirms the current  border, and provides for the marking of the border on the  terrain and for maintenance of the markers. It also provides  for the creation of a joint commission to monitor compliance  with the treaty. It will remain in force for ten years and  supersedes a similar treaty between Czechoslovakia and the  Soviet Union signed in 1973, when Ukraine was still a Soviet  Republic.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Amazon tribe urges expulsion of miners THE leader of the Amazon's largest surviving tribe yesterday protested to Brazil's President Itamar Franco about an invasion of illegal goldminers threatening his people. Mr Davi Kopenawa Yanomami told Mr Franco that the Yanomami people faced extinction from diseases such as malaria and influenza brought into their territory by the garimpeiros (miners). He called for immediate action to remove the miners. According to government figures 11,000 garimpeiros are operating illegally inside the reserve in northern Brazil where the remaining 9,000 Yanomamis live. Health Ministry officials recently withdrew from the area, warning of a repeat of the 1987 invasion which resulted in 1,500 tribespeople dying from malaria.</p>

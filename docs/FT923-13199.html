			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK life companies The market had been expecting dire new business figures from Legal &amp; General. But the reality yesterday of a one fifth drop in worldwide annual premiums and a one third slide in single premiums served to knock a further 2 per cent off the shares. Admittedly, L &amp; G has been losing ground to its rivals as part of a conscious effort to cut back its distribution network. Nevertheless, the increasingly harsh impact of low consumer confidence on the insurers raises the question of whether the sector is as defensive as investors still seem to think. Life companies, for instance, have outperformed the market by about 10 per cent in the last four to five weeks on the grounds that there is huge hidden shareholder wealth in their life funds which will prop up dividends for ever and a day. It is certainly true that the gradual move towards accruals accounting has served to highlight this crock of gold, and that where companies are under pressure to get their hands on it ways of doing so can be found. Most of the bigger groups hotly deny similar intent, but there was intense industry interest last month when London and Manchester announced that it had won Department of Trade and Industry blessing to transfer surpluses on investments from non-profit and unit linked policies to the profit and loss account. All the same high bonuses, over-generous payouts and various misadventures - not least L &amp; G's exposure to mortgage guarantee insurance - have left the life companies weaker than they were even six months ago. It is worth bearing in mind that the bulls went on buying the composite insurers throughout much of last year on the argument that their strong balance sheets would support at least a maintainted level of dividends. That cosy theory will shortly be put to the test.</p>

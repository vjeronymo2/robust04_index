			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal requirements of the order that would affect handlers would be the requirements that they pay assessments on fresh market shipments of Walla Walla Sweet Onions to fund research and promotion programs and that container markings would be regulated. The amount of the assessment rate is not specified in the proposed order, but witnesses at the hearing indicated that an appropriate rate might be five cents per 50-pound bag for administrative costs; research and promotion costs could require an additional five to seven cents per bag or more. Any assessment rate to cover committee expenses that may be established would be recommended by the committee to the Secretary for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order would also impose some reporting and recordkeeping requirements on handlers. Handler testimony indicated that the expected burden that would be imposed with respect to these requirements would be negligible. Most of the information that would be reported to the committee is already compiled by handlers for other uses and is readily available. In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implement the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) and section 3504(h) of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping requirements that may be imposed by this order would be submitted to OMB for approval. Those requirements would not become effective prior to OMB approval. Any requirements imposed would be evaluated against the potential benefits to be derived and it is expected that any added burden resulting from increased recordkeeping would not be significant when compared to those anticipated benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reporting and recordkeeping requirements issued under comparable marketing order programs impose an average annual burden on each regulated handler of about one hour with a two year record requirement. It is reasonable to expect that a comparable burden may be imposed under this order on the estimated nine handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act requires that prior to the issuance of an order, a referendum be conducted of affected producers to determine if they favor issuance of the order. The ballot material that will be used in conducting the referendum will be submitted to and approved by OMB prior to use. It is estimated that it would take an average of 10 minutes for each of the approximately 50 Walla Walla Sweet Onion growers to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting. Additionally, it has been estimated that it would take approximately ten minutes for each of the nine handlers to complete the marketing agreement. In determining that the order would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, all of the issues discussed above were considered. The order provisions have been carefully reviewed and every effort has been made to eliminate any unnecessary costs or requirements. Although the order may impose some additional costs and requirements on handlers, it is anticipated that the order would help to strengthen demand for Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Therefore, any additional costs should be offset by the benefits derived from expanded markets and sales benefitting handlers and producers alike. Accordingly, it is determined that the order would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small handlers or producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Material Issues:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The material issues presented on the record of the hearing are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Whether the handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the proposed production area is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce, or directly burdens, obstructs, or affects such commerce;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Whether the economic and marketing conditions are such that they justify a need for an order which will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What the definition of the production area and the commodity to be covered by the order should be;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What the identity of the persons and the marketing transactions to be regulated should be; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. What the specific terms and provisions of the order should be, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The definition of terms used therein which are necessary and incidental to attain the declared policy and objectives of the order and the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The establishment, composition, maintenance, procedures, powers and duties of a committee that would be the local administrative agency for assisting the Secretary in the administration of the order;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

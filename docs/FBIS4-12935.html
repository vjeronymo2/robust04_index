			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 14 Apr (MENA)--Political sources in Beirut  said today that PLO military personnel in Lebanon have begun to  collect all types of light weapons carried by individuals in  Palestinian camps in Sidon and Tyre in south Lebanon. This is  being done in line with a decision by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat.    Palestinian sources reported that 'Arafat instructed Sultan  Abu-al-'Aynayn, the camps' military commander, via a message  delivered to him by a leading Lebanese personality, to collect  all personal and other weapons from the camps immediately, ahead  of their transfer to Gaza and Jericho by official Egyptian  authorities.    Abu-al-'Aynayn reportedly received a telephone call from  Lieutenant Colonel Nasr Yusuf in Tunis asking him to implement  'Arafat's decision immediately. Lt. Col. Yusuf is the official  who will command the Palestinian police force in Gaza and  Jericho.    The Palestinian source said some of the weapons have  already been gathered and their number and type recorded,  whether they are from military men or civilians.    These sources noted that Lieutenant Colonel Munir al-Maqdah,  the Fatah Forces commander in the 'Ayn al-Hulwah Camp in south  Lebanon and a man who opposes Yasir 'Arafat, has declared his  refusal to allow weapons to be gathered from his forces inside  the camp. He said in a statement today: Our rifles will remain  under the control of the Syrian and Lebanese Army.    Lebanese political circles noted that Palestinian contacts  took place during the past few weeks. The objective of these  contacts was to coordinate on gathering weapons from the  Palestinian camps in Lebanon in preparation for sending them to  the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho.    The circles also said that last Monday's storming by the  Lebanese Army of numerous arms caches belonging to a Palestinian  faction in the district of Sharhabil, east of Sidon, in south  Lebanon and the seizure of large amounts of weapons, missiles,  and hand grenades fall within the framework of a plan set out by  Lebanese and Palestinian officials.    The Lebanese circles expressed their belief that the  prevailing trend now is to empty all the Palestinian camps of  weapons as planned.    Diplomatic sources in Lebanon reported that interest is  increasing among Lebanese officials regarding the conditions of  the Palestinians in Lebanon, in particular after signs emerged  that conditions inside the camps are worrying in light of  developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.    During its meeting last night, the Lebanese Council of  Ministers refused to approve the request submitted by the 10  Palestinian factions in Lebanon to hold a political rally  organized together with Hizballah and the national resistance in  Lebanon.</p>

State Councillor Chen Junsheng, who is in charge of China's  agriculture, said it is of strategic importance to the  prosperous national economy to increase farmers' income in a  stable way and ensure adequate supply of farm produce.    The official said China could not be well off if farmers'  could not live a fairly comfortable life, adding that a brisk  national market is impossible if farmers' purchasing power is  not improved and rural markets remain low.    China's government has promised to give a comfortable life  to  its citizens by the year 2000. The goal requires the average  annual growth rate of farmers' income be more than five percent  during the remaining years.    The per capita net income of 900 million farmers for 1993 is  estimated at 880 yuan (about 100 U.S. dollars).    The figure represents a real increase of about two percent  over the previous year after inflation.    "Farmers' income has been growing too slowly during the past  several years. The average annual growth rate for 1985-1992 is  only 2.2 percent. It could be said that farmers' income has  been fluctuating," said Chen.    In order to improve farmers' income, the Chinese Government  is considering a package of measures to promote the development  of agriculture and the rural economy.    The measures under consideration include more investment in  agriculture, construction of more major grain and cotton  production centers, improvement of the grain protection system  for situations when the grain price is too low to be profitable,  and faster development of township and village enterprises.    Statistics show that about 60 percent of farmers' net income  has in recent years come from township and village enterprises.    The sustained increase of farmers' income depends  considerably on the growth rate and efficiency of rural firms.    Last year the Chinese Government announced an increase of  grain and cotton prices.    Chen said that efforts should be continued to supervise and  control the financial burdens or taxes imposed on farmers. He  stressed that it was important to prevent farmers' increased  income being taken away from them.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: 'More papist than the Pope' Case study: Soporcel A dollars 300m paper plant leads Portugal's efforts to improve it image. A mountain of finely-shaven eucalyptus wood clippings, a large smokestack and a dank lagoon of treated effluent 100 miles north of Lisbon mark a Portuguese industrial showpiece. The pulp mill and paper plant run by Soporcel, the cellulose company, show how the second poorest country in the European Union can live with the environmental constraints favoured by the richer countries in the north. Improving Soporcel's ecological track record has, however, been costly. Other sectors of the country's economy are not financially strong enough to make a similar effort - underlining the difficulty of fighting pollution in the throes of Europe-wide recession. The Portuguese government selected the country's highly export-oriented paper industry at the start of the 1990s to lead a move to improve the country's environmental image. Determined to show the rest of Europe that Portugal was no longer a home for polluting industries, the environment ministry, according to Mr Manuel Gil Mata, Soporcel's industrial director, wanted to be 'more papist than the Pope'. The company has spent Dollars 33m since 1991 to meet government requirements that are now tougher than those recommended by the EU. The Dollars 300m paper plant near the coastal town of Figueira da Foz started operation in May 1991 on a 60-acre site already occupied by a pulp mill. Supported by loans from the European Investment Bank, the plant ranks as one of the largest in the world. The paper industry is heavily polluting, a consequence both of the residues left over from separating wood and cellulose and of chlorine- and sulphur-based chemicals used in paper-making. 'Three or four years ago, this industry in Portugal was thought to be a very profitable one. The ministry considered the industry had a big investment capacity and this could be used to bring us up to the top environmental standards in Europe,' Mr Gil Mata says. Soporcel has been bearing the brunt of the world-wide downturn, making losses in 1992 and 1993. But, backed by its main shareholders - state-owned investment bank Caixa Geral de Depositos and the Anglo-French paper-maker Arjo Wiggins - Soporcel should meet national and EU standards for emissions in the next few years. Other Portuguese paper companies, with older plants, are in a less happy position. Reflecting its favourable starting point, Soporcel has budgeted a mere Dollars 4m to 1996 to reduce discharges. Mr Gil Mata, also chairman of the environmental committee of the Portuguese pulp and paper association, says the three other paper mills will need to spend Dollars 50m by 1995 and a further Dollars 135m in 1996 to meet requirements. The scale of the figures casts doubt on the feasibility of the plan. Mr Gil Mata says Soporcel's environmental drive is a valuable marketing tool for the quality-conscious German and French markets. But he is sceptical about extending the approach to other sectors. 'We were the first, and we are the last.' This is the sixth part of a ten-part series. Tomorrow: Financial services</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Islamabad, May 4 -- "Exploding a nuclear device  will take the nation out of the present state of dejection and  bring our friends like China and Iran closer to us".    This was stated by an exponent of pan-Islamism, former chief  of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lt Gen (Retd) [retired]  Hamid Gul while addressing a select gathering of the citizens  here on Wednesday. The meeting was organised by the Citizens  Action Committee.    The former ISI chief, who played a pivotal role during the  Afghan Jehad observed that now Pakistan should go nuclear. He  said this could infuse a new life in the nation, which according  to him was facing a decadence like situation. He said the  Pressler Amendment is aimed at cutting off aid to a country  which is following the nuclear option whereas it is not against  those nations that have already acquired the nuclear capability.    Advocating his case Gen Hamid Gul said by doing so Pakistan  will stand at par with India when new nominations for the  nuclear club may take place in 1995. Besides, he said, our best  friends like China and Iran which consider us fast becoming  American surrogate will come closer to us.    The former ISI chief said a wave of re-awakening had run  throughout the Islamic world. The secular world was falling  apart and the secular philosophy, he said, had failed to hold  the nations together. He said only Islam provided a basis for  movement and mobilisation with a forward looking philosophy  while secularism has no future.    He said not the governments but the people of the Islamic  world are coming closer for a common cause. [passage omitted]</p>

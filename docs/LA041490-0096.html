			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SNOQUALMIE: IT'S NO 'TWIN PEAKS';  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE WASHINGTON TOWN THAT SERVED AS THE SETTING FOR THE NIGHTTIME  SOAP LIKES THE SHOW BUT NOT ALL THE ATTENTION.  </P> <P> Fred Reed claims that most of this city's bowlers checked out early this week  from his Mt. Si bowling lanes to watch ABC's "Twin Peaks" when it made its  debut Sunday night, followed by the series start Thursday. The new murder  mystery series, created by "Blue Velvet" director David Lynch, was filmed in  part in Snoqualmie, a logging town 25 miles east of Seattle hard by Snoqualmie  Falls.  </P> <P> Most people wanted to compare notes, to see how the location work matched with  the final television version, how many familiar sights they could spot. But a  "Twin Peaks" mystery of another sort is bedeviling the residents: are some of  this town's 1,500 residents engaged in bloody satanic rituals, plunging to  untimely deaths from the top of 246-foot Snoqualmie Falls, or facing off in the  backwoods to solve lovers' quarrels with dueling chain saws? That's the  impression some residents claim has been produced. Not by the television series  but by a reporter for the tabloid weekly the Star.  </P> <P> When Lynch selected this mountain retreat and its smaller twin city North Bend  as his fictional Twin Peaks, Snoqualmie residents welcomed the attention. But  then the Star claimed to find a dark side to Snoqualmie, darker even than the  television portrayal.  </P> <P> According to the April 10 issue of the Star: "Real Twin Peaks Town Hides Dark  Secrets of Its Own." At first, residents were outraged or amused over  Snoqualmie's image as the fun-with-chain-saws capital. Even Police Chief Dan  Isely claimed that the Star article became "kind of a joke with a lot of the  people in the town."  </P> <P> Star reporter Dave Lafontaine wrote that Snoqualmie's majestic woods hide  hooded satanic cults who draw pentagons with human blood and leaving mutilated  cats, goats and chickens hanging from the trees. "Scores" of suicides have  jumped into thundering Snoqualmie Falls. Residents still whisper about a former  Snoqualmie citizen: serial sex murderer Ted Bundy, executed last year in  Florida.  </P> <P> Also common in Snoqualmie, according to the Star, are knife fights over women  between drunken loggers, often ending in shootings and "chain-saw duels."  </P> <P> All this somehow seems weirdly appropriate for the filming location of "Twin  Peaks," whose story revolves around the murder of a high school homecoming  queen.  </P> <P> According to Isely, the peaceful people of this logging town are no more likely  to duel with chain saws than they are to ship the body of the homecoming queen  down the falls in a plastic bag. "It's (the Star's portrayal) so blown out of  proportion that if anybody believes that of a town of 1,500 people in the  Northwest -- well, I'm concerned about that person," Isely said.  </P> <P> Dan Olah, marketing director for Snoqualmie's Railway Museum, said of the Star  and the television series: "both are based on fiction, and both are amusing,"  adding that the only rumor he's heard about viciousness of loggers concerns one  logger who can "eat a hot dog and drink a beer through his nose at the same  time."  </P> <P> Some in Snoqualmie fail to see the humor in the town's portrayals. "Nobody is  happy about the Star article," said Mayor Jeanne Hansen. Businessman George  Swenson, 64, who was born in Snoqualmie, said that while he found the Star  article funny, it spoiled the town's enjoyment of "Twin Peaks." "They'd like to  tangle up the town in the series' story line," he said.  </P> <P> But most everybody here seems more ready to laugh than cry about the town's  notoriety.  </P> <P> Kwok Louie, owner of North Bend's Hangchow restaurant, has a picture of two  chain saws hanging on the wall of his bar like some absurd family coat-of-arms.  A sign outside Big Edd's Dine In/Drive Thru Tavern warns: "Please Check Your  Chainsaw Before Entering."  </P> <P> As far as the television series is concerned, many of the town residents so far  have found it slow and hard to follow. Most said they watched to see what  buildings, places and people they could recognize.  </P> <P> Dog trainer Bill Williams, having his hair cut at Ed's Barber Shop by Doug  Bergquist, was unenthusiastic. "They didn't have no dogs in there," he  complained. "And where'd they get those actors? Geez, it was worse than a high  school play!" Then he drove off in a truck bearing the license plate "DAWG."  </P> <P> A visit to Coast to Coast Total Hardware found co-owner Betty Carmichael deep  in discussion about "Twin Peaks" with her employees. "It wasn't the crime, it  was the Peyton Place image that I didn't like," Carmichael said. "I know it's  silly, but this is your home, and it isn't anything like that."  </P> <P> City Hall account clerk Peggy Skinner called "Twin Peaks" hokey, but admitted  she watched Thursday's episode "to see if they are going to solve anything, at  least one more night."  </P> <P> Skinner does not believe the sinister goings-on in the movie will lead tourists  to avoid the town. "It's so much the opposite -- about the worst crime here is  that a few garbage cans get knocked over," she said. "But it may attract  visitors to this bad, bad town."  </P> <P> On Friday morning, Snoqualmie residents were celebrating because a decision to  make nearby Snoqualmie Ridge part of the city of Snoqualmie had been accepted,  allowing for the development of 2,000 new homes and a professional golf course.  Clearly, growth in the area has not been stopped by chain saws. The development  was approved Thursday night by town officials who obviously had heavier duty to  perform than to watch the high-rated show.  </P> <P> Still, those who oppose growth in the area remain hopeful that things will  remain the same. "There are some who say, 'Well, maybe all these stories will  stop all those Californians from moving up here," Isely said.  </P></p>

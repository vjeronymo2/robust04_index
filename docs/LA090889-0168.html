			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOVIET FAVORED-NATION STATUS URGED  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Manufacturers called on the Bush Administration today to  waive a legal obstacle blocking the Soviet Union from gaining  most-favored-nation status in a bid to promote greater trade between the two  nations.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union is likely to be a much more important market tomorrow than  today and American manufacturers want to be an important player in that  market," Jerry Jasinowski, executive vice president of NAM, told business and  government officials at a trade forum sponsored by the association.  </P> <P> A major stumbling block to the Soviet Union acquiring most-favored status is an  amendment to the 1974 Trade Act. Among the conditions of the Jackson-Vanik  amendment is that nations allow the free emigration of citizens, a provision  targeted at the emigration policies concerning Soviet Jews, association members  said.  </P></p>

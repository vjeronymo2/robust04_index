			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Shock waves hit defence contractors: Pentagon in bid to cancel new weapons A Pentagon order to examine delaying or cancelling most of the armed services' biggest new weapons systems has sent shock waves through the defence industry and Congress. Defence contractors, while officially silent on an issue that they say is the Pentagon's decision, are warning that serious cuts in procurement programmes could mean the US will enter the second decade of the next century with ageing equipment and no technological edge over its opponents. And some members of Congress say the order, which tells the services to produce plans for cancelling or postponing 10 of their largest equipment projects in order to fit inside the budget envelope, is new evidence that the Pentagon needs to rethink last year's Bottom Up Review. The review spelt out the force structure that would be needed in order to be able to fight two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts. But some critics say that goal is too ambitious to fit in today's budget - either the mission must be scaled back, or the money available for defence must be increased. 'Now the question is whether they are going to be true to the Bottom Up Review with the budget they have. It might make the Congress and the administration think whether they are going to abandon that or find more money,' said Mr Don Fuqua, president of the Aerospace Industries Association. The order to rethink the major weapons programmes, which came in a memorandum from Mr John Deutch, the deputy defence secretary, has also anguished members of Congress, who have only just agreed on the final version of their defence authorisation bill for next fiscal year. Although the Deutch memo is part of the budget process for fiscal 1996, some members are irked by the thought of wasting money on programmes which already face the axe. The programmes targeted by Mr Deutch include the air force's F-22 fighter, the army's Comanche helicopter, the navy's Aegis destroyer and the marines' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. Mr Garry Riley, vice-president of Lockheed and project manager for the F-22, declined to comment on the Pentagon's plan, but argued that the F-22, which would replace the current F-15 Eagle and is built jointly by two Lockheed divisions and Boeing, would be needed in the 21st century. 'The F-15 is a super airplane. It is able to hold its own with today's threat. But 20 years from today it won't be able to hold its own and that's why we need the F-22,' Mr Riley said yesterday. Mr Deutch stressed that his list was of candidates for cancellation or postponement, and no decisions had yet been made. But he acknowledged that the budget crunch was forcing the Pentagon to trade some of its long-term modernisation in order to maintain good operating conditions for the troops today. 'The fact of the matter is we are delaying modernisation and capitalisation for near-term readiness and people,' he said, adding that the less sophisticated enemies faced by the US today left some room to do this.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / People: Citifutures Has Jack Wigglesworth come to rest for a while? Ever since the longstanding and well known Greenwells partner left in 1986, he has had quite a variety of jobs, none of which has lasted very long. Now, having worked as a consultant to J P Morgan Futures for a year, he is joining Citifutures, full-time, in the new position of director of marketing. He says that with two children still in full-time education he 'fancied' a permanent position. The JP Morgan post, as business development director, was 'ongoing but without the feel of a permanent job'. He left Greenwells after 15 years, 13 as a partner, for Lloyds Merchant Bank. There he was head of government bond sales but the primary gilts dealership was closed down nine months later. He also had a two-year stint at Henderson Administration. Wigglesworth, joint deputy chairman of Liffe, says that Citifutures has always had a policy of forging closer links with the derivatives exchanges, so that his familiarity with Liffe was regarded as an asset.</p>

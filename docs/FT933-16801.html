			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tobermory distillery in Pounds 1m sale BURN STEWART, the independent Scotch whisky distiller, is to buy Ledaig malt distillery at Tobermory, Isle of Mull. The deal, expected to be announced today, is estimated at about Pounds 1m. The distillery, at present owned by Mr Stewart Jowett, a Yorkshire businessman, will give Burn Stewart the rights to the Tobermory and Ledaig brands as well as stocks of maturing whisky. The distillery has had a chequered history. It was established in 1823 but was closed from 1928 to 1972, when it was owned by Distillers, and was closed again for most of the 1980s.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Top cards at American Express fail to deal a winner - Alan Friedman finds investors unimpressed by the enhanced role for the US company's chairman THE most eloquent judgment concerning the surprise announcement that Mr James Robinson had survived as chairman of American Express and succeeded in having his protege installed as chief executive came from Wall Street. On Monday, with investors widely expecting Mr Robinson to leave the troubled financial services and travel group, the company's share price continued to rise sharply. It was widely known in the New York financial world that the American Express board was divided by internecine politics as Mr Robinson fought to save himself and have Mr Harvey Golub, the president, named as chief executive. It was also learned yesterday that Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, was contacted by the search committee about the job, having previously been canvassed about a move to another position at American Express more than 18 months ago. Then, late on Monday it was announced that Mr Golub would take over as chief executive and that Mr Robinson would not only stay on as chairman but would also take over as chairman and chief executive of the lossmaking Shearson Lehman investment banking and brokerage unit. The American Express share price promptly went into a free-fall, and by the close in New York yesterday had dropped by Dollars 1 3/4 , a decline of nearly 7 per cent, wiping more than Dollars 800m off the company's market capitalisation. Trading volume stood at 6.3m shares, more than three times the average level. The consensus view among analysts is that the 57-year-old Mr Robinson, who is blamed by many for presiding over a sloppy management and substantial credit losses at the group's card division, should have left the company. But a handful of the normally-available Wall Street analysts who follow American Express agreed to comment only if they were not named. 'This is a travesty. The entire market was hoping that Mr Robinson would go. That is what we were led to believe in December,' said one analyst at a leading New York securities firm. 'The market has not been pleased with Mr Robinson's stewardship of the company and had been hoping he would go. His job now is to make Shearson run again and focus on costs,' said Mr Guy Moszkowski, a leading analyst at Sanford Bernstein, a research company. The group's 1992 net earnings, which fell by 44.7 per cent to Dollars 436m, in part because of a Dollars 116m loss from Shearson Lehman, illustrated the financial problems at American Express. The core Travel Related Services (TRS) division, for example, saw its 1992 net profit tumble to Dollars 243m from Dollars 396m in 1991. Admittedly, the decline was affected by special charges. But the depth of problems at TRS and the need to cut staff and make provisions is more apparent when one considers that TRS made a profit of Dollars 956m in 1990, meaning its most recent earnings have collapsed by 75.6 per cent in two years. Analysts like Mr Moszkowski say it could take until 1996 before TRS returns to its 1990 level of profitability. Analysts say investors had felt an enormous sense of relief about American Express ever since it emerged in early December that Mr Robinson had been asked by the American Express board to search for a successor as chief executive. Although Mr Robinson denied he was being forced out, executives at American Express say he fought 'a battle royal' to hang on to both his job as chairman and his prestige. 'What he did was to take care of himself,' said an American Express executive. Mr Golub, who was named by Mr Robinson as president only 18 months ago, is respected for his technical skills, but is not considered a man of great vision. The big loser in the American Express shake-up is Mr Howard Clark, the former group finance director who was installed as chairman and chief executive of Shearson two years ago. Mr Robinson yesterday took both of those jobs, banishing Mr Clark to the ill-defined role of vice-chairman of Shearson. Mr Robinson declined to be interviewed yesterday, but in his official statement on Monday he said his primary mission would now be to work at Shearson Lehman. He even hinted at possibly making a public offer of Shearson stock. No one, meanwhile, is willing to predict how long he will stay on as chairman of American Express. The company and its investors are still reeling from Monday's shake-up.</p>

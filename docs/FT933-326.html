			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Midland Bank issues first preferred stock MIDLAND Bank, the UK clearing bank owned by HSBC Holdings, yesterday launched its first offering of preferred stock, which counts as Tier 1 capital under Basle capital adequacy rules, writes Tracy Corrigan. The offering consists of a Dollars 250m issue of non-cumulative preference shares, arranged by Merrill Lynch and placed with US retail investors. Midland is well-capitalised with a total capital ratio of 11.4 per cent as at June 30 - well above the 8 per cent minimum requirement - of which 6.5 per cent is Tier 1 capital. However, all of Midland's existing Tier 1 capital is denominated in sterling and the bank has substantial dollar assets.</p>

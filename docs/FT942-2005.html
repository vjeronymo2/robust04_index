			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: GKN bought Engineering group GKN, which yesterday returned to the premier list of FT-SE 100 companies, was among a handful of stocks that bucked the poor market trend. The shares gained 7 1/2 at 594p in trade of 1.4m, with a large part of the day's buying said to have come from index funds. Sentiment was further boosted by reports of a positive note from Kleinwort Benson and the stock basked in some of the glow surrounding British Steel. The two jointly own steel company United Engineering Steels. Higher oil prices and a broker's upgrade failed to stop British Petroleum sliding 7 1/2 to 404p, with around 7m shares traded. The market was believed to be fretting over the future of the near 10 per cent stake held by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO). With the shares ending last week at an all-time high, there was a strong argument that the Emirate's international investment arm might want to take profits from its 540m-share holding. However, some analysts said the stake was a prestige holding for the country and very unlikely to be offloaded at a time of political uncertainty. Meanwhile, Nomura's oils team raised its 1994 average oil price forecast by a dollar to Dollars 17 a barrel and advised clients to make a short-term switch from Shell Transport into BP because of the respective benefits to earnings. The Japanese house said BP's 1995 earnings will improve by 13.4 per cent because of the rise in oil prices but Shell's profits will only increase by half as much. The dividend race between the regional electricity companies (recs) continued apace, with East Midlands producing a healthy 16.4 per cent increase, although profits slumped after a hefty exceptional charge. The pre-tax figure of Pounds 51.2m was at the bottom end of market expect-ations and followed a Pounds 129.5m charge taken against restructuring costs. The company also announced plans to seek shareholder approval to buy back up to 10 per cent of its issued share capital. The East Midlands performance was described as 'moderately good' by analysts, although the shares slid back with the weak utilities sector, closing 9 down at 568p. Manweb, which reports today, rose 3 to 679p. Analysts are looking for profits of around Pounds 130m and a final dividend of 22.5p. Among water stocks, Wessex held up well, closing just a penny off at 603p. The market is anticipating a bumper dividend payout from the company at today's finals, with some optimistic analysts pencilling in 24.5p, against last year's 21.5p. Profits should come in at around Pounds 103m. Elsewhere, the sector weakness was compounded by several stocks going ex-rights. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo receded 15 1/2 to 563 1/2 p following sharp rises recently. There was some nervousness over a statement that the company was considering legal action against plans by Novopharm, the Canadian pharmaceutical group, to market a generic version of its best-selling ulcer treatment drug Zantac in the US. TSB Group held steady at 225p in response to a reiterated recommendation from SGST and ahead of half-year figures due on Thursday. The market is expecting a profit of around Pounds 215m - up from Pounds 80m previously - because of a sharp fall in bad debt provisions. Traders said there was also talk that Nomura was recommending the stock. Elsewhere, former building society Abbey National was pulled back in early trading after cautious weekend press comment on the recovery in the housing market. But the shares recovered from a low of 405p to close 7 1/2 off at 415p. In the oil sector, the possibility of a successful bid for Lasmo by Enterprise Oil continued to recede in spite of a shaky rumour earlier in the day that SG Warburg had been asked to buy 10 per cent of Lasmo's shares. By the close Enterprise had firmed a half-penny to 415p while Lasmo was up a penny at 150p. Thorn EMI was the subject of some debate as the market awaited the verdict on two important cases this week. First, the George Michael versus Sony court case is due to be decided in the next few days, with Thorn supporters hopeful of a positive outcome for Sony and in their view the record industry as a whole. Later in the week, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report into compact disc prices is also expected, with leaks from official sources hinting that the record companies will escape censure over pricing. Thorn shares dropped with the market, before rallying to close 20 1/2 down at 1039p. Speculative buying buoyed Shoprite Group, the discount supermarket operator, the shares gaining 6 to 65p. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel remained under a cloud as talk that a large part of the Pounds 858m rights issue may be left with the underwriters continued. The shares relinquished another 5 to 283p. The rights issue price is 265p. There were selective gains among building and construction groups following the hefty setbacks suffered last week on the back of interest rate rise fears. Among housebuilders and developers, Taylor Woodrow advanced 3 to 125p, AMEC 9 to 113p and Barratt Developments 5 to 198p. Beazer Homes was steady at 147p. USM-quoted Border Television moved forward 15 to 184p following a recommendation in the weekend press. Other statistics, Page 29</p>

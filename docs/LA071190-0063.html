			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRUSTACIS SETTLE SUIT OVER BIRTH OF SEPTUPLETS  </P> <P> A Riverside couple and their three surviving septuplets on Tuesday settled  their medical malpractice and wrongful-death lawsuit against a Los Angeles  infertility clinic for up to $6 million.  </P> <P> Then an attorney made the startling announcement that the mother, Patti  Frustaci, is pregnant with healthy twins after taking the same potent fertility  drug that she took before conceiving the nation's first septuplets in 1984.  </P> <P> The settlement with the Tyler Medical Clinic was reached over the strenuous  objection of Dr. Jaroslav Marik, who treated Frustaci with the fertility drug  Pergonal.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Marik was dismissed from the landmark lawsuit, which attorneys say  is the nation's first court test involving the standard of care in fertility  treatment.  </P> <P> The doctor was removed from the suit because he would not agree to a  settlement. He has said he was confident that a jury would vindicate him, but  his insurance company was apparently unwilling to take that risk. Attorneys for  the Frustaci family were seeking $12 million to $14 million in damages.  </P> <P> As terms of the agreement were read in Santa Monica Superior Court, Patti  Frustaci wept quietly. Outside court, Frustaci described an "overwhelming"  sense of relief after five years of litigation coupled with the stress of  caring for three premature infants, who have health and developmental problems.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge David Rothman, who approved the settlement, had met with  the Frustaci children -- Patti, Richard and Stephen -- on Monday to ascertain  for himself their disputed condition. "The amount of money being paid is just  under all the circumstances," the judge said Tuesday. "It is obvious to me . .  . that the children are in need of this and would benefit from it."  </P> <P> The husband, Sam Frustaci, an industrial products salesman from Riverside, was  with the children on Monday but did not attend Tuesday's hearing.  </P> <P> Frustaci attorney Browne Greene described the 5-year-olds as severely impaired,  with mental retardation and health problems, while the doctor's attorney, Craig  Dummit, said only Stephen will have serious lifelong problems.  </P> <P> The septuplets were delivered by Cesarean section at St. Joseph Hospital in the  City of Orange. One was stillborn. Three others died within 19 days. The  Frustacis also have an older son, Joseph, born 14 months before the septuplets  after Marik treated Patti Frustaci with Pergonal.  </P> <P> The Frustaci lawsuit contended Marik failed to properly monitor treatments and  should not have completed the fertilization process, given her condition that  month.  </P> <P> During a news conference after the brief hearing, Greene said, "This is a very  happy day for the Frustaci family." Then he announced that Patti Frustaci is  two months' pregnant with a due date of Dec. 30.  </P> <P> Despite her struggle in caring for the surviving septuplets, Frustaci, a  35-year-old former schoolteacher, said she underwent further fertility  treatment at another clinic in Southern California. "I desire to have another  normal child," she said.  </P> <P> Under terms of the settlement, the Frustacis will receive a $450,000 payment  immediately. Beginning in August, the children will begin to receive monthly  payments until their 18th birthdays. Stephen will receive $1,000 a month,  Richard $600, and Patti, the healthiest from birth, $400. Those payments total  $2.16 million, which is guaranteed even if the children die.  </P> <P> After 18, the monthly payments for Stephen increase to $3,000. Richard will  receive $2,000 and Patti $1,000 until death. If they reach a normal life  expectancy of 71.2 years for males and 78.2 years for females, the settlement  will amount to more than $6 million.  </P> <P> The payouts will be made through the purchase of an annuity expected to cost  more than $1 million in 1990 dollars, though Marik's attorney said it will cost  less.  </P> <P> Marik was not in court when the settlement was announced, but he later met with  reporters. He said he felt like a student who had prepared for five years for  an exam only to have it canceled. Marik said he recommended that Patti Frustaci  take additional tests before fertilization. But he said Frustaci declined,  citing the cost and inconvenience -- an allegation she denied.  </P> <P> Marik said he did not interpret the settlement as a vote of no confidence in  his treatment, but a practical dollars-and-cents decision not to risk the  uncertainty of a jury verdict. The silver-haired infertility pioneer said he  was not responsible for Frustaci's multiple births. "Why do you have to have  somebody at fault? " he asked. "These things can happen."  </P> <P> The settlement talks -- which took place over three tense days as jury  selection started Monday -- were unusual, according to attorneys for both sides  and legal experts.  </P> <P> It is rare for an insurance company to negotiate a settlement without the  consent of the insured, said medical malpractice attorney Bill Newkirk, who is  not connected to the case. Newkirk said he had seen the situation only once  before in his 16 years of experience and said it indicated to him that the  plaintiff's case was strong.  </P> <P> Marik, a co-owner and employee of the clinic, had blocked settlement talks  since the case was filed in October, 1985. The way was cleared for settlement  when a provisional clinic director recently was appointed in another court  where Marik and his longtime partner, Dr. Stanley Friedman, are litigating over  the dissolution of their practice.  </P> <P> The court-appointed director voted with Friedman to allow settlement  discussions. Marik's attorney, Dummit, was not involved in the talks and at  most times paced the halls with reporters awaiting word of the negotiations.  </P> <P> Despite the settlement, Marik will not have a blemish on his record because he  was dismissed as a defendant. But Marik said that publicity over the lawsuit  has harmed his practice. He held up a crammed appointment schedule for 1984,  then compared it to his sparse current schedule.  </P> <P> The Riverside family has been in the limelight since Frustaci's pregnancy was  announced in early 1985. People around the nation became involved in the  waiting game to see if the pregnancy would continue until the fetuses had a  chance of survival. Reporters and camera crews stood watch at St. Joseph  Hospital in Orange, where Patti Frustaci was a patient for months.  </P> <P> Despite the recommendation of her obstetrician that the fetuses had a slim  chance of surviving until term, Frustaci, a Mormon, declined to have an  abortion, for religious and moral reasons.  </P> <P> After they were born, the watch shifted to Childrens Hospital of Orange County  and became a death watch as the premature infants, tubes and ventilators  covering their tiny bodies, struggled to survive.  </P> <P> Patti Frustaci said this week that she will never get over the deaths of her  four children. Outside her house, she said, she has planted four rose bushes --  colored peach, violet, yellow and red -- one for each dead child. She takes the  blossoms to their graves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Pergonal is a commonly used fertility drug made of the same hormones that  naturally stimulate production of follicle cells in the ovaries. Since it  bypasses a regulating gland in the brain and works directly on the ovaries, it  increases the risk of multiple births. While only one follicle cell, from which  a ripened egg emerges, usually matures in fertile women, multiple egg-producing  follicles are stimulated in women treated with Pergonal.  </P></p>

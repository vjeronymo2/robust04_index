While examining a government work report with army deputies  to the National People's Congress, he called on officers and men  of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to make new contributions  to China's reform, development and stability.    Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military  Commission, said that new reform measures taken earlier this  year in taxation, banking, investment, planning, foreign trade  and enterprise reform are a "decisive battle" for the country's  reform program and open policy implementation.    He said: "victory of this battle and establishment of a  framework for a socialist market economic structure will provide  a powerful guarantee for a sustained, rapid and sound growth of  China's economy.    "We must have a secure and stable social and political  environment to achieve this victory.    "Officers and men must be fully aware of their historical  responsibilities and strengthen army building so as to better  carry out their sacred mission of safeguarding China's security  and unification, and defending its modernization drive."    Jiang Zemin, who is also the general secretary of the  Chinese  Communist Party Central Committee, praised officers and men for  having stood the test in the course of reform and opening up,  and for their being of one heart and mind with the party Central  Committee.    He also called for efforts to improve ideological work among  officers and men in the course of creating a socialist market  economy.    He stressed the importance of setting lofty ideals,  observing  discipline, seeking unity, subordinating personal interests to  the overall interests of the nation and unswervingly following  the party's basic line of taking economic development as the  central task.    President Jiang described reform, opening up and the  modernization drive as a "grand and arduous" undertaking, which  requires the mobilization of all social sectors.    He said the undertaking makes it imperative to bring into  full play the initiative and creativeness of all officers and  men so that they will better contribute to army modernization  and China's prosperity and long-term stability.    The most important task at present is to improve education  among officers and men in Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, army building during the  new period, party's basic line, army's functions and patriotism,  he said.    Jiang also stressed the need to improve living conditions  for  officers and men, noting: "Army units at all levels must try  their best to step up agricultural and sideline production."    It is an important guiding principle of the party to place  equal emphasis on material progress and ideological and cultural  progress, he noted.    He called on the Army to stand in the forefront of society  in  promoting ideological and cultural progress.    Army units at all levels must persist in strict training of  soldiers and explore new ways for troop command, he said.    "We must further improve unity between the Army and the  government and between the Army and the people," he said in  conclusion.</p>

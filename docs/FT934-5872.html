			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Oil slides after Opec talks failure The last prop was knocked from under the oil market on Wednesday when ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in Vienna, abandoned their attempt to agree a reduced production ceiling. The next day saw crude prices plunge nearly 80 cents a barrel to touch a five year low, and in late trading yesterday the February futures position at the International Petroleum Exchange was still languishing at Dollars 14.75 a barrel, down Dollars 1.27 on the week. The week began with traders cautiously hopeful that the Opec ministers would bite the bullet, and the February futures price edged up 28 cents a barrel on Monday moring. That gain was quickly erased, however, as the meeting got down to business and it became apparent that consensus was sadly lacking. Despite flagging demand in consuming countries and a resulting decline in prices several of the ministers proved immovably opposed to making the cut of between 3 and 5 per cent in the 24.52m barrels-a-day ceiling that analysts thought necessary to reverse the slide. For the platinum and palladium markets Tuesday was an uncomfortable day. Already tending lower, the prices took something of a hammering after Engelhard Corporation of the US announced that it had developed a new motor emission control system. Fearing that this would threaten the use of the platinum group metals in the manufacture of autocatalysts, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange marked down platinum's January futures price by 2.3 per cent to Dollars 372.10 a troy ounce and palladium's March price by 2.75 per cent to Dollars 125.50 an ounce. It transpired, however, that the Engelhard system, which trapped hydrocarbon emissions during the first two minutes of vehicle operation that a catalytic converter took to become effective, would be an addition to, rather than a replacement for, traditional converters using platinum group metals. Most of the falls were therefore recovered. Before the Thanksgiving closure Nymex's January platinum price was quoted at Dollars 375.7 an ounce and further gains were subsequently made in London. At the London Commodity Exchange most attention was focused on the cocoa market, which moved up to test a fresh resistance area after last week's climb to five-year highs. A Pounds 35 retreat to Pounds 1,005 a tonne in the March futures position was reversed on Wednesday afternoon, and the upturn was extended on Thursday, when a new high of Pounds 1,250 a tonne was reached. Yesterday's continued rise was halted just short of the Pounds 1,059 peak reached in July 1988. The cocoa market has been buoyed recently by hopes that the supply/demand deficits of the past two seasons could augur a longer term draw-down from world stocks. But the latest rise was attributed in part to concern about the political situation in the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer, following rumours early in the week of the death of the country's veteran President Houphouet-Boigny and a subsequent blackout on news of him. Base metals prices were generally held in narrow ranges at the London Metal Exchange. The exception was lead, which jumped Dollars 11.75 in the three months position yesterday to end Dollars 14.75 up on the week at Dollars 428.50 a tonne. Dealers gave the credit to chart-based buying that succeeded in breaking resistance in the Dollars 415-Dollars 420 area.  -----------------------------------------         LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS       (As at Thursday's close)  ----------------------------------------- tonnes  ----------------------------------------- Aluminium         +14,675 to 2,382,975 Aluminium alloy      +160 to    49,160 Copper             +1,225 to   585,975 Lead               +1,500 to   299,325 Nickel               +300 to   118,488 Zinc               +3,775 to   858,350 Tin                  -365 to    19,045  -----------------------------------------</p>

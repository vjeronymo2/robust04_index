			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Management: Tempo changes at heartbreak hotel - Michael Skapinker finds staff at the Aerostar struggling to provide creature comforts for visitors to Moscow When Yana Yevinzon emigrated to the US in 1976, the Soviet authorities tore up her passport. Two years ago, she returned to become executive housekeeper of the new Moscow Aerostar Hotel. When she boarded the Aeroflot flight, she was so frightened that her Russian momentarily deserted her. Aly Rehemtulla, a former refugee from Idi Amin's Uganda, spent his first nights at the Aerostar fighting off mosquitos in a hot windowless room. He had given up a successful career with Holiday Inn in Toronto to become rooms manager in a half-built hotel in a country convulsed by political and economic change. Why did they do it? 'The challenge,' says Yevinzon. 'Russia is the new frontier,' says Rehemtulla. 'This is the biggest adventure I have ever had.' The 417-room Aerostar, a joint venture between Aeroflot and IMP, a diversified Canadian manufacturing and services group, opened last March, aiming to provide western business visitors with the kind of facilities they find at home. Its brightly-lit marble lobby is certainly a warm refuge from the bewildering streets outside. The service is friendlier than at many western hotels. The hotel does, however, differ from western establishments. The plumbing is slightly eccentric and the rooms are not soundproof. And few western hotels have mathematicians making the beds, economists mopping the floors or surgeons doing the laundry. The Aerostar building, a 10-minute drive from the Kremlin, was built by Aeroflot to house athletes competing in the 1980 Moscow Olympics. It was never completed or used, probably because the US boycott of the games reduced the number of rooms needed. It was spotted by Kenneth Rowe, IMP chairman, during one of his regular visits to Moscow. IMP services Aeroflot aircraft in Canada. Rowe suggested to Aeroflot that they turn the building into a hotel which IMP would run. Robert Dearden, a Toronto construction worker who was hired to supervise the work, had his own ideas about what should have been done with the building. 'I would have knocked the thing down,' he says. Only one of the nine floors had plumbing or lights. A drainpipe descended from the roof through the middle of the building, neatly cutting the entrance to a room in half. The bearded Dearden, who wears an earring, a lumberjack shirt and a Montreal Canadiens cap, tried to equip the hotel locally. 'People could get what I wanted but they said they had to install it. And they said they wanted to be paid in computers or television sets. I thought: 'I haven't got time for this'.' Everything used in the refurbishment and furnishing of the hotel was imported, including the light bulbs. Three years on, Dearden has found local suppliers of some equipment and material. He employs as a middleman a multilingual Iranian doctor who, after 20 years in the country, has a wealth of Russian contacts. Patrick Doffenies, the Aerostar's French-born purchasing manager, had less luck with Russian suppliers. Doffenies spent two months concluding an agreement with a supplier of Russian wine. Only then did he discover that the Russian company could not afford to buy bottles and had been planning to sell the wine in barrels. A farmer with 3,000 cattle offered to supply beef on condition that the Aerostar built him an abattoir. A supplier of fruit from Georgia seemed more promising. He appeared well-organised and had translated all documents into English. The fruit would be flown from Georgia. Doffenies concluded an agreement. On the day the first consignment was due, the supplier phoned from Georgia to say the plane had run out of fuel. 'It was hopeless,' says Doffenies. Apart from some produce which the hotel buys from local markets in the summer, all the Aerostar's food arrives by lorry from France once a week. Lobster is flown in from Nova Scotia. Cleaning materials and office supplies are imported from the UK. Import duties fluctuate from week to week, lorries are regularly opened by customs and items frequently go missing. But by importing virtually everything it needs, the hotel provides the quality of food and cleanliness its guests expect. The result, however, can be an unbearable temptation to staff who steal from the hotel and occasionally from the guests. Marilyn Barker Paulson, the Aerostar's Canadian sales and marketing director, recalls that the food and beverage manager threatened to install a metal detector at the kitchen exits to prevent cutlery disappearing. One employee tried to smuggle sausages out in her coat lining. The penalty for theft is dismissal and there are no second chances. 'To fire someone for stealing a carton of orange juice is hard, but you have to do it,' says Rehemtulla. 'The Russian staff feel they work here, they contribute, they're entitled to take it. They see how abundant everything is here and they think if they take an orange juice, who is it going to hurt?' Of 550 Russian staff, about 30 have been dismissed for theft. Rehemtulla says this does not seem to have deterred others. Staff attitudes to service have also posed some problems. Andrew Ivanyi, the Aerostar's Hungarian-born general manager, said the hotel decided not to hire anyone who had worked in a Soviet hotel. But even with people who had not been infected by Soviet service attitudes, instilling new standards was difficult. When Yevinzon told an initial training session that the customer was always right, the staff laughed. She showed them what she meant. When one guest asked for a hair dryer - something the hotel did not then possess - Yevinzon went home and got her own. When another guest asked for his shoes to be shined, Yevinzon did the job herself in front of the staff. 'The most difficult thing to get them to understand was that it was the guest who was paying their salaries and not the government,' Yevinzon says. The employees, however, proved quick learners because, Yevinzon believes, they were so highly educated. Apart from the surgeon who does the laundry, there is a doctor running the gym, a paediatric nurse supervising one of the floors and a petroleum engineer in charge of the storeroom. Many of the cleaning staff are economics graduates. For most, money was an important attraction. The Russian staff earn an average of 12,000 roubles a month. The hotel would like to pay an additional foreign currency bonus, but this is illegal. Instead, it gives staff vouchers worth between Dollars 125 and Dollars 200 a month to spend in Moscow's hard currency stores. Many exchange the vouchers for dollars on the black market at a 20 per cent discount. Tatyana Golikova, an assistant to the training manager at the hotel, says that if she had continued in her old job as an English and German teacher she would now be earning 3,000 roubles a month. Even some in cleaning jobs see the hotel as a way to get ahead. As a trained economist Natasha Kombarova is hopelessly over qualified for making beds and cleaning baths. But she believes the Aerostar will eventually offer her the chance to become a manager. Not everyone is as enthusiastic. 'I was in shock for the first few days,' says Yuri Kiselev, a cleaner and former research economist and computer programmer. 'I'm looking for a new job somewhere else, or maybe I will be able to rise here. I'm not satisfied with my status here. This is not intelligent work.' Alexandre Biryukov, the petroleum engineer who runs the storeroom, says the quality of staff being hired now is not as high as when the hotel first started. There are other western hotels and joint ventures in Moscow and working at the Aerostar is no longer such a novelty. 'The first people who were hired were anxious about how they were doing,' he says. 'Now the attitude is: 'Why shouldn't I have this salary?''</p>

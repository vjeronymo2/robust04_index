			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 31-YR. ERA ENDS WITH LAUNCH OF CAPE ROCKET  </P> <P> After more than 400 liftoffs, NASA launched its last unmanned space rocket from  this spaceport today, propelling a $125-million Navy communications satellite  into orbit.  </P> <P> A 31-year era ended when an Atlas-Centaur rocket blazed away from the pad at  4:56 a.m. and hoisted a 5,100-pound payload intended to link land, sea and air  forces around the globe with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Command  Authority and the President's military command network.  </P> <P> Lightning in the area held up the launch for 44 minutes, and the Atlas-Centaur  lifted off with just one minute remaining in a favorable 45-minute launch  period.  </P> <P> Today's launch was delayed more than two years because of a 1987 launch pad  accident that severely damaged the rocket's Centaur stage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Rocket Left  </P> <P> The space agency has one unmanned rocket left -- a Delta that is to loft a  scientific satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., in November.  </P> <P> But today's flight is the last from Cape Canaveral, where the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration got its start and where it has launched  nearly all its rockets.  </P> <P> "It's always sad to see the end of an era," said James L. Womack, NASA's  director of expendable launch vehicles.  </P> <P> "There's a certain element of sadness, but the things we have done have been  fabulous," said Joseph Mahon, the agency's assistant administrator for space  flight.  </P> <P> With the launch, NASA's only remaining launch vehicle here is the manned space  shuttle.  </P></p>

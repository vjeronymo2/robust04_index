			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / OECD boost as Mexico edges toward stability Mexico was recovering yesterday from the initial financial turbulence caused by the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, as a likely successor emerged to be the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). Markets were reassured by the emergence of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, a former budget minister, as the strong favourite to become the party's presidential candidate and the likely successor to President Carlos Salinas. Investor confidence was also boosted by the government's announcement that Mexico will be formally accepted on April 14 as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the first new entry since 1973. The US Treasury had helped to restore calm by agreeing to lend up to Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) to Mexico in the event of a run on the currency. Financial markets were relatively stable. The principal stockmarket index closed down 0.9 per cent on the first day of trading since the assassination, but this was mainly in response to sharp falls in New York on Thursday. The exchange rate weakened a little to 3.35 pesos to the dollar, after opening at 3.33. Traders also reported a recovery in Mexican 'Brady bonds', issued in 1990 as part of the country's debt restructuring. A PRI official familiar with deliberations over the candidacy said a decision would probably be taken the week after next. Mr Zedillo, who was Mr Colosio's campaign manager, is not admired for his political skills, but has a doctorate in economics from Yale University and has worked at the central bank. He is expected to carry on the economic reforms of Mr Salinas. Mexico's constitution says presidential candidates cannot have held a senior government position for 180 days before the election. Unless the constitution was changed, which would be difficult, there are few serious contenders other than Mr Zedillo. One other candidate mentioned is Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, the PRI president, but he has little experience in government. Another possible contender, Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in the troubled southern state of Chiapas, has ruled himself out of contention. Mr Colosio was buried yesterday in his home town of Magdalena de Kino, in the northern state of Sonora. The man who has confessed to killing him, Mr Mario Aburto Martinez, was yesterday taken to the capital from the border city of Tijuana, where the assassination took place.

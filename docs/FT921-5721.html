			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Sale of gardener's cottage is taxed LEWIS v ROOK Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Balcombe, Lord Justice Ralph Gibson, and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith): February 19 1992. A GARDENER'S cottage owned by a taxpayer, situated not very closely adjacent to her main house on the opposite boundary of her estate, is not part of those buildings which constitute the dwelling house, and is therefore subject to capital gains tax on sale by the taxpayer. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the Inland Revenue from Mr Justice Mervyn Davies's decision affirming a decision by General Commissioners that the taxpayer, Lady Rook, was entitled to relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of a cottage on the boundary of her residential property. LORD JUSTICE BALCOMBE said that on June 6 1968, Lady Rook purchased Newlands, Crockham Hill, Kent for Pounds 34,501. Included in the purchase were two cottages known as Nos 1 and 2 Hop Cottages on the south boundary of the property. The total acreage of the property was 10.5 acres. The distance between No 1 Hop Cottages and Newlands was 175 metres. In February 1974, Lady Rook's gardener moved into No 1 Hop Cottages. In February 1978, he vacated No 1. On August 30 1979, Lady Rook sold No 1 for Pounds 33,000. The sale proceeds helped to finance the conversion into residential accommodation of the coach house adjacent to the main house. The gardener moved into the coach house. Lady Rook was elderly, lived alone in the main house and needed someone close at hand; hence the reason for his move. The greenhouses, tool shed and compost heaps used in connection with the main house garden were situated between the main house and No 1 Hop Cottages. During Lady Rook's ownership of it, No 1 had never been screened from the main house so that she could see the lights in the cottage and flash a light if she needed help. She also had a ship's bell which could be heard from the cottage if she needed help. That had happened more than once. Section 102(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 provided that a gain on disposal of a dwelling house was not chargeable to tax 'if the dwelling house or part of a dwelling-house has been the individual's only or main residence throughout the period of ownership . . .'. The General Commissioners found that No 1 Hop Cottages formed part of the entity which comprised the dwelling-house of Newlands. Mr Justice Mervyn Davies upheld the Commissioners' findings. He concluded that the entity constituting Lady Rook's residence included No 1 Hop Cottages, because her way of living embraced the use not only of Newlands House itself with its gardens, but also of the cottage of the gardener who attended to the gardens. That the cottage was about 190 yards distant from the house was, to his mind, not of paramount importance in the context of the Newlands set-up. He said it was a matter of degree. The Crown maintained that no reasonable tribunal of fact could have reached the conclusion that No 1 Hop Cottages and Newlands together formed one dwelling-house which was the taxpayer's residence. In Batey v Wakefield (1981) 55 TC 550, the main house ('Paddocks') was set in 1.1 acres of land. On part of that land the taxpayer built a chalet bungalow for occupation by a caretaker/gardener. It was separated from Paddocks by the width of a tennis court and a little more. Mr Justice Browne-Wilkinson said: 'difference between the two sides depends on whether one stresses the words 'a dwelling-house', as the Crown suggest, or the words 'a residence', as the taxpayer suggests. In the ordinary use of the words, if one looks at a man's residence it includes not only the physical main building but also the appurtenant buildings.' He said the lodge was occupied by the taxpayer through his employee, who was employed for the purpose of promoting the taxpayer's reasonable enjoyment of his own residence; and 'bearing in mind the fact that the buildings are very closely adjacent', it was proper to find that the lodge was part of the taxpayer's residence. Lord Justice Fox said there was no difference in principle between a coachman's flat in the stable yard used to serve the main house and a bungalow built on the comparatively small area of land held with Paddocks, for the purpose of serving Paddocks. He said it was 'a question of degree in each case', whether a separate building formed part of the residence. In Markey v Sanders (1987) 60 TC 245, Mr Justice Walton said the conditions that had to be satisfied were first, occupation of the building must increase the taxpayer's enjoyment of the main house; and second the other building must be 'very closely adjacent' to the main building'. In Williams v Merrylees (1987) 60 TC 297, a lodge some 200 metres from the main house was held by the General Commissioners to be part of a dwelling-house which was the taxpayer's residence, being 'within the curtilage of the property of and appurtenant to' the main house. An appeal by the Crown was dismissed. The current state of the authorities was not very satisfactory. It was necessary to go back to the words of the statute. What had first to be determined was what, in the particular case, constituted the 'dwelling-house'. That was an ordinary English word of which the definition in the shorter Oxford English Dictionary was 'a house occupied as a place of residence'. That dwelling-house could consist of more than one building even if the other building itself constituted a separate dwelling house (Batey v Wakefield). Nevertheless, 'what one is looking for is an entity which can be sensibly described as a dwelling-house though split up into different buildings performing different functions' (Williams v Merrylees). How, then, could that entity be identified in any given case? First, attention must be focused on the dwelling-house which was said to constitute the entity. In so far as some of the statements made in Batey v Wakefield suggested that one must first identify the residence, they were made per incuriam (inaccurate). Where it was contended that one or more separate buildings were to be treated as part of an entity which, together with the main house, comprised a dwelling-house, Mr Warren submitted that no building could form part of a dwelling-house which included a main house, unless that building was appurtenant to and within the curtilage of the main house. That was a helpful approach, since it involved the application of well-recognised legal concepts. In Methuen Campbell v Walkers (1979) QB 525,543, Lord Justice Buckley said: 'For one corporeal hereditament to fall within the curtilage of another, the former must be so intimately associated with the latter as to lead to the conclusion that the former in truth forms part and parcel of the latter . . . How far it is appropriate to regard this identity as parts of one messuage or parcel of land as extending must depend on the character and circumstances of the items under consideration.' That passage was cited with approval by all members of the Court of Appeal in Dyer v Dorset County Council (1989) QB 346, all of whom emphasised the smallness of the area comprised in the curtilage. That coincided with the close proximity test, 'very closely adjacent', in Batey and Markey. If the Commissioners in the present case had applied the right test: 'Was the Cottage within the curtilage of, and appurtenant to, Newlands, so as to be a part of the entity which, together with Newlands, constituted the dwelling-house occupied by the taxpayer as her residence?' - they could not have reached the decision they did. The cottage was 175 metres from Newlands. Newlands was on the northern boundary and the cottage on the southern boundary of a 10.5 acre estate. And they were separated by a large garden with no intervening buildings other than the greenhouses and tool shed. Those facts led to the inescapable conclusion that the cottage was not within the curtilage of and appurtenant to Newlands, and so was not part of the entity which, together with Newlands, constituted Lady Rook's dwelling-house. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For the Crown: Nicholas Warren (Inland Revenue solicitor). For Lady Rook: David Milne QC (Susan H. Newlands, Dorking).</p>

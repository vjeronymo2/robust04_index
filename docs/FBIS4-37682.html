			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Informed Lebanese sources  said today that the U.S. authorities have informed the Lebanese  Government of their readiness to extradite a number of Lebanese  people wanted in Lebanon on charges of participating in the  Sayyidat al-Najah Church explosion and the assassination of Dany  Sham'un, leader of the National Liberal Party, and his family.  The sources said that the U.S. authorities asked the Lebanese  Government to submit a complete file on the two crimes and the  persons being sought. Among the fugitives who fled to the  United States is Ghassan Tuma, head of the security apparatus of  the dissolved Lebanese Forces Party.    Lebanon has sent requests to Interpol to arrest 15 people  indicted in connection with the church explosion and the  assassination of Sham'un and his family. However, Lebanese  judicial sources have not yet received any information that the  fugitives have been arrested so they can be brought back to  Lebanon for trial before the State Security Court.    The sources said that the bills of indictment in the two  crimes will be referred to the Judicial Council within the next  two days so that a date can be set for beginning the trial of  the accused, led by Samir Ja'ja', former leader of the dissolve  Lebanese Forces Party.</p>

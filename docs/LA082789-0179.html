			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANDELION CAN MAKE A TONIC, TEA OR SALAD  </P> <P> Over the years, myriad products have been deeloped to get rid of dandelions.  But like most plants that are considered weeds, they keep coming back, not even  needing to be pollinated to keep renewing themselves.  </P> <P> Europeans brought the dandelion here because they knew its value. Dandelion  leaf tea has long been popular and is considered a tonic. The roots can be used  as a base for tea also, which was frequently used for heartburn. The leaves are  edible and are loaded with vitamin A. The contain nearly four times as much  Vitamin C as lettuce or most leafy vegetables. They even have more iron than  spinach.  </P> <P> Tea is hardly the end of uses for this yellow flower. Since the dandelion  flowers from March until September, it is an excellent plant to use to help  keep bees around so that they will pollinate all of our other flowers and  fruiting plants. When the flowers are boiled, it is possible the get a yellow  dye. The roots will produce a magenta dye when boiled.  </P> <P> Wine can be made from the blossoms and a coffee-like drink can be made from  dried, ground and roasted roots.  </P> <P> Although the dandelions we see in our yards are edible and can fill all of  these requirements and usages, commercially grown dandelions have larger and  thicker leaves.  </P> <P> If you purchase seeds and wish to grow your own, you will find they grow "just  like a weed," as you suspected. However, you can tie the leaves together so  that the leaves are rather bleached in appearance. This allows you to use them  much like endive.  </P></p>

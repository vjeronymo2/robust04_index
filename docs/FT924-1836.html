			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM upbeat on outlook for economy A revival of business confidence in 1993 was forecast by Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday in his final question time appearance in the Commons before the Christmas recess. He told MPs that Britain had a 'very solid platform' for industrial recovery. Tory backbenchers were clearly heartened by his firm endorsement of the optimism expressed by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on Monday about the prospects for the economy. The prime minister backed the view of Mr Peter Butler (C Milton Keynes North East) that there were already signs of a 'fully justified growth in business confidence' throughout the country by adding: 'You will see a good deal more of that in the months to come.' Brushing aside sceptical comments from the Labour benches, he emphasised that in addition to Britain's annual rate of inflation falling to 3 per cent, 'factory gate inflation' was down to the lowest level for a generation. Mr Major said it was the clearest sign yet that the battle against inflation  -so vital for industry, commerce, investment and jobs - was being won. To Tory cheers, he insisted: 'It is precisely because of this success that we now have the lowest interest rates in the European Community, and a very solid platform for industrial recovery next year.' Responding to further plaudits from Tory loyalists for his handling of last weekend's summit in Edinburgh, the prime minister said it would become increasingly apparent that Britain had set the agenda for the entire EC. He underlined the 'significant turnround' in the attitude of some member states to the enlargement of the EC.</p>

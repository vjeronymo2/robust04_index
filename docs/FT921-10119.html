			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Bush launches Dollars 35bn health package PRESIDENT George Bush sought to win back the political initiative on health care yesterday with a Dollars 35bn (Pounds 19bn) package to overhaul the US system. Mr Bush said he would introduce vouchers and tax deductions, worth up to Dollars 3,750 a year for a family of four, to help an estimated 95m low and middle income families buy health insurance for themselves. The president's package drew immediate criticism from the opposition Democrats, who have until now made the political running on the issue. Mr Bush told a business audience in Cleveland, Ohio: 'This is the kind of market-based reform plan that will give Americans the kind of health care they want and deserve.' The plan also proposes to cut the soaring cost of health care, which is expected to rise by an average 12-13 per cent a year for the next five years, by encouraging employers to pool their buying power into 'health insurance networks'. It also includes measures aimed at reducing waste and paperwork and at slowing the growth in spending on the government's Medicare and Medicaid health programmes. Mr Bush also wants to reform malpractice law to give doctors more protection from being sued by unhappy patients. 'It is time to put an end to these astronomical, sky's-the-limit lawsuits,' he said. Mr Richard Gephardt, leader of the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, said Mr Bush's proposals were 'totally deficient' and would not do enough to contain medical costs. 'The Bush health care plan is a Band-Aid approach that will put more money in the pockets of insurance companies and doctors but will do nothing to make health coverage affordable or ensure that all working Americans have access to quality health care,' Mr Gephardt said. Mr Bush's advisers began drafting an emergency health care reform plan in November, after Senator Harris Wofford, campaigning principally on the issue of universal access to health care, won a surprise victory in a Pennsylvania by-election over the president's hand-picked candidate. While the government provides medical support for the elderly through Medicare, and for the very poor through Medicaid, one American in seven  - for the most part employed by small businesses which cannot afford corporate health coverage - lacks any form of medical insurance. The administration and its Republican backers have hotly opposed both options proposed by the Democrats - a nationalised health insurance system similar to Canada's or a 'play or pay' system where businesses would have to choose between providing health insurance for their workers or paying a payroll tax into a central state scheme. 'When you nationalise health care you push costs higher, far higher . . . The fact is, we do not have to create a new government bureaucracy to deliver quality health care,' Mr Bush said. However, Republicans in Congress have already fallen out with the administration on how to meet the estimated Dollars 35bn-a-year cost of the tax vouchers and deductions Mr Bush is proposing.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has ordered an  increase in the number of Tunisian troops to the UN forces in  Rwanda. This took place when the president received Defense  Minister Abdelaziz Ben Dhia this morning in Carthage Palace.  This decision gives substance to the determination of our  country shown during the OAU [Organization of African Unity]  summit in Tunis of assuming its responsibility in settling  conflicts in Africa. President Ben Ali, the current chairman of  the OAU, stressed that this initiative is a response to the need  shown in the African summit for an effective contribution by  African countries to the settlement of hot conflicts in the  continent, within the framework of cooperation between the OAU  and the United Nations.

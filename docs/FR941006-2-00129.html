Section 11(a) requires SEC approval of an offer to exchange securities between open-end investment companies if the exchange occurs on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the securities to be exchanged. Section 11(c) makes section 11(a) applicable to any type of exchange offer of securities of registered unit investment trusts for the securities of any other investment company, irrespective of the basis of exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants represent that Rollover Unit Holders will not be induced or encouraged to participate in the Rollover Option through an active advertising or sales campaign. Insight recognizes its responsibility to its customers against generating excessive commissions through churning and claims that the sales charge collected will not be a significant economic incentive to salesmen to promote inappropriately the Rollover Option. Applicants further believe that the Rollover Option is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the requested order is granted, applicants agree to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

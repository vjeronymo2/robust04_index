			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Palermo, Sicily, March 20 (AFP) -- Silvio  Berlusconi, the Italian press magnate and politician, Sunday [20  March] denied reports of collusion between his Forza Italia (Go  Italy) party and the mafia.    "All the votes for Forza Italia obtained in Sicily and in  all  Italy will be votes against the mafia," the rightwinger told a  rally of 5,000 supporters, a week to the day before the next  Italian legislative elections.    "In parliament and in government we will use these votes to  lead a vigorous support for the fight against organised crime,"  Berlusconi said, microphone in hand, as he spoke to the crowd.    Leftwing politicians have accused Forza Italia of attempting  to attract mafia support for its candidates, effectively giving  it a large block vote.    "Pure slander," said a party spokesman.    However turncoats from the Cosa Nostra Sicilian mafia have  accused one of the leading figures in Berlusconi's media empire,  Fininvest, of having a money-laundering agreement with mafia  bosses, the Italian press said Sunday.    Marcello Dell'Ultri, manager of Publitalia, the advertising  arm of Fininvest, has firmly denied the accusations. "Delirious  accusations, completely unworthy slanders, without any  foundation," he said Sunday.    "I don't believe it, it's delirium, someone wants to stop  me.  They are trying to criminalise a movement entirely made up of  new people," Berlusconi said here.    The leader of the former communist Democratic Party of the  Left, Achille Occhetto, told an electoral meeting in Naples  Friday that Forza Italia had "got the declared support of the  Piromalli boss," head of a southern Italian mafia family.    During a radio debate with Berlusconi on Sunday, Occhetto  renewed his accusations. "It is paradoxical to accuse a party,  which presents itself for the first time, of collusion with the  mafia," the media magnate responded.    The Christian Democrat Minister of the Interior, Nicola  Mancino, said in an interview with the Naples daily Il Mattino  on Saturday, that there were "rumours which must be verified"  that the mafia was preparing to vote for Forza Italia.    Berlusconi said that remark was "way below the minister's  role."</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / And not a drop to spray: The water crisis in the UK Consumers unimpressed by British Rail's excuse that trains were running late last year because of the 'wrong type of snow' might not take kindly to explanations of the UK's water crisis. It was caused, experts say, by the wrong type of rain. Some 20m customers have faced hosepipe bans at some time in the past three years, and many remain in force. Scarcely any newspaper or news broadcast this week has not carried water shortage reports. And yet, consumers might ask: what drought? Where are the parched yellow lawns, the crazy paving of dried-out reservoir beds that made the last drought, in 1976, so visible? Even the Meteorological Office admits that overall rainfall in the UK has been 20 per cent above normal in the past three months. The problem since 1988 is that rain has been falling at the wrong time - in summer and autumn, instead of in winter - and in the wrong places. Scotland and northern England have been wet, while eastern and southern England have suffered their longest dry spell since 1745. In the English lowlands, concludes the Institute of Hydrology, which monitors water on behalf of the Department of the Environment, 'the current exceptionally protracted dry episode is without modern parallel'. There is widespread agreement on the severity of the problem, and the pressing need to do something about it. Prince Charles voiced his concern this week, and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, launched a wide-ranging review of water resources. The water companies are under pressure to offer some constructive ideas as they report their annual results. But there is less agreement on what should be done. What makes the problem so serious - and different from 1976 - is that this time groundwater has been most severely affected. Not only is groundwater the principal source of supply in much of southern England, it feeds natural springs which are largely responsible for the summer and autumn flow of many of the nation's rivers. It is not easily replaced. Exacerbating such problems of nature is a man-made problem - an increasingly affluent population. As dishwashers and daily baths have become commonplace, demand for water has soared by 70 per cent over the past 30 years to 38bn gallons a day. More than half of this is used by domestic customers, with a family of four likely to consume some 125 gallons a day. But consumption is not the only factor brought into focus by the drought. The structure of the water industry itself is being scrutinised. Privatisation has left the UK with twin contradictions at the heart of its water system. Water suppliers have a duty to their shareholders as well as their customers; and while the government is committed to water conservation, the water companies have a commercial obligation to supply as much water as possible. Given the inability of many companies to meet demand, the forecast increase in profits due to be reported by the water industry in England and Wales may not be welcome news for consumers. Telephone callers to the Redhill offices of East Surrey water company were greeted this week by a recorded message. 'If your call relates to our current restrictions, hosepipes and sprinklers cannot be used until further notice.' On Wednesday East Surrey announced a 42 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 5.54m and a 19.5 per cent rise in the dividend. Profit rises at the larger companies will be more modest, probably averaging 9 per cent. On Thursday, North West Water, the first big company to report, unveiled a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 230.1m in the year to March 31. Next week, Thames Water is likely to report profits increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 230m while Anglian will follow with a 12 per cent increase to Pounds 170m. Dividends are likely to average 10 per cent growth. After last year's 14 per cent average increase in profits, water companies are facing criticism for raising prices, profits and dividends while customers see few benefits. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the industry regulator, has already fired off a couple of directives, calling on companies to lower their dividend growth rates to release more funds for investment, and warning against companies using water-related profits to support non-water, and therefore non-regulated, businesses such as laboratory testing and environmental services. Mr Byatt's views on dividends are dismissed by the industry, which claims investors will shun its issues if they are not adequately rewarded. Such share offerings could be vital, because the industry urgently needs sustained investment to improve water quality, sewerage and the underground mains. The total cost of improvements required before the end of the decade is estimated at Pounds 30bn. Where that money will come from is not yet clear. The most immediate problem is to refurbish old and often crumbling pipeline systems, from which leakage sometimes accounts for a quarter of all water pumped. Some companies have started remedial action. Thames has reduced its leakage rate from 23 per cent to 17 per cent in the past three years and has an eventual target of 10 per cent. Some smaller companies, such as East Surrey, now devote more than half their spending to reducing leakage. Despite these efforts to stem water loss, critics say spending is too little, too late. The companies counter that given other requirements on water quality, including a 1995 deadline to meet stringent new rules on pesticide contents, there is just not enough cash to meet all their requirements. Longer-term remedies will also be needed to boost supplies. The National Rivers Authority earlier this year published a paper examining the options. Some of the more fanciful suggestions, including towing icebergs from the North Pole, and offshore desalination plants, were immediately dismissed as unsuitable and too costly. The idea of a national water grid, to pump water from plentiful areas to those of need, is more attractive. But once again, the NRA says, the infrastructure cost would be 'several billion pounds'. A more feasible solution might be to use the existing canal system. On the demand side, only a certain amount can be achieved through hosepipe bans and calls for prudence. The Department of the Environment, the NRA and Ofwat agree that what is needed is a sea change in public attitudes, so that water is treated as a valuable commodity, not a limitless resource. Instilling such an attitude may entail water metering, a reality in every European country except the UK and Norway. A pilot scheme in the Isle of Wight has led to savings of at least 10 per cent in water consumption. But fitting and monitoring meters would cost about Pounds 160 per household - or Pounds 4bn nationwide. Businesses, offices and public buildings could save water without such high spending. Flowsave, a Kent-based company that makes water-saving devices, estimates that most business users could reduce their wastage of non-essential water - used in washrooms, for example - by 75 per cent. Water-saving equipment has already been fitted at British Aerospace, Rover, several banks and building societies, and at the Royal Courts of Justice. There is less scope to cut down water consumption where it is central to an industrial process. Industrial usage other than the power generators accounts for less than 10 per cent of all consumption. Electricity generators are by far the biggest users, responsible for about a third of total consumption. But as PowerGen, the privatised generator, points out, water used for cooling is a fundamental part of the generating process. 'All the savings that could be made have probably already been made.' If action on both supply and demand is not taken, and rain fails for the next three or four years, the water system would face an unprecedented crisis. Both farmers and food prices could suffer, as crops will be lost. Mr Howard's review will be keenly awaited. After four years of the wrong type of rain, the last thing Britain needs is the wrong type of solutions.  ---------------------------------------------------                   ON THE WATERFRONT  ---------------------------------------------------                   England and Wales Estimated abstractions of surface and ground water  ---------------------------------------------------                             Million litres, per day Domestic water supply                        18,336 Agriculture    Spray irrigation                             378    Other usage                                  129 Electricity generators                       12,612 Other industry                                3,795 Total                                        35,249  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

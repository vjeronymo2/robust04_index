The CPC Central Committee held a Spring  Festival discussion meeting with non-communist party figures at  Zhongnanhai this afternoon. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of  the CPC Central Committee, met happily with responsible figures  from the various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of  Industry and Commerce [ACFIC], and non-party affiliated figures  to discuss state affairs, while ringing out the old and ushering  in the new year.    In his speech, Jiang Zemin said: The basic principle of our  party and state work in 1994 is: Under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line, to comprehensively implement the  guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress, as well as by  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to  accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic  system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816  6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy while  safeguarding political stability, and promoting all-round social  progress. Our overriding task for the current year is to seize  the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside  world, promote development, and maintain stability. Relevant  work in various fields must be subordinate to and serve this  overriding task.    The discussion meeting was presided over by Li Ruihuan,  member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau and  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. Hu Jintao, Li  Lanqing, Wang Hanbin, We Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, and other  leading comrades attended the meeting.    Fei Xiaotong, chairman of the Central Committee of the China  Democratic League; Sun Qimeng, chairman of the Central Committee  of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Lei  Jieqiong, chairman of the Central Committee of the China  Association for Promoting Democracy; and Wang Guangying,  honorary chairman of the ACFIC successively spoke at the  meeting. They spoke freely about the brilliant achievements  made by China on various fronts under the CPC's leadership last  year; they lauded the constant strengthening and development of  multi-party cooperation under the CPC leadership. They said:  The basic principle for 1994 put forward by the CPC Central  Committee is of great importance. Members of various democratic  parties and the ACFIC, as well as figures without party  affiliation must strive to accomplish the grand objectives set  out by the CPC Central Committee, and to perform new meritorious  services. In the course of their speeches, they expressed their  views and put forward proposals for developing the economy,  reform and opening up, building an honest government, the  construction of spiritual civilization, and educational work.    After the four non-party affiliated friends made their  speeches, General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an important  speech. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State  Council, he expressed sincere appreciation, and extended cordial  greetings to all the friends present at the meeting, to comrades  and friends from the various democratic parties and the ACFIC,  and to figures without party affiliation.    Touching on last year's work, Jiang Zemin said: Under our  party's leadership, 1993 witnessed people of all nationalities  in our country comprehensively implement the guidelines laid  down by the 14th CPC National Congress and advance triumphantly  along the road of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The CPC Central Committee took the overall  situation into consideration, paid special attention to a few  major issues, maintained and developed a favorable situation for  reform and opening up, and economic construction. To  generalize, we mainly paid special attention to major issues in  three aspects: First, through deepening reform we strengthened  and improved macroeconomic regulation and control; adhered to  the principle of promoting both material and spiritual  civilization without relaxing efforts to attain either of them;  promoted a rapid and sound development of the national economy;  and gave an impetus to all-around progress in various social  undertakings. The industrial sector maintained rapid growth,  economic efficiency among enterprises was enhanced, the rural  economy developed further, and construction of key projects was  beefed up. We made new progress in propaganda and ideological  work, in building spiritual civilization, and the anticorruption  drive. Second, we convened the Third Plenary Session of the CPC  Central Committee and adopted the "Decision on Some Issues  Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic  Structure"; and, formulated the overall plan and basic framework  for establishing a socialist market economic system in our  country, which is exerting and will continue to exert a far  reaching impact on our efforts to push forward reform and open  to the outside world, as well as on our modernization drive.  Third, we earnestly organized the publicity and study drive of  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and  launched activities to mark the birth centenary of Comrade Mao  Zedong, thereby further uniting our people of all nationalities  under the magnificent banner of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. At the same time, we also made new  achievements in our party building, defense construction, and  foreign affairs. All this has created favorable conditions for  our continuous march forward in the new year.    After discussing the basic principles and general tasks of  the party and government, Jiang Zemin said: The basic  principles and general tasks set by the party Central Committee  must be implemented in all sectors of society and all aspects of  work, but first of all, in the vast countryside and state-owned  enterprises. We must pay keen attention to the work in these two  key areas in a bid to promote all-around reforms, development,  and stability all over the country.    Jiang Zemin said: All in all, this year efforts must be  focused on the following seven aspects: 1) Maintaining a  sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the national economy and  continuing to promote all-around social progress. We must rely  on scientific and technological progress and improved quality of  the work force to promote economic growth, paying particular  attention to readjusting the structure and raising efficiency.  We must also develop the rural economy in an all-around way,  effectively build up the stamina of state-owned large and medium  enterprises, strengthen and improve macroeconomic control and  regulation, and go all out to advance educational, scientific,  and technological undertakings. 2) Quickening the pace of  reform in establishing a socialist market economic structure.  We must make ample preparations for launching and implementing  various major measures for establishing a sound macroeconomic  control and regulation system, continue to change the operating  mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, explore effective ways  for establishing a modern enterprise system meeting the  requirements of a socialist market economy, advance price reform  in due course, and develop an integrated, open, competitive, and  orderly market system. 3) Further improving propaganda and  ideological work. We must pay close attention to and make the  study and publicity of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping a fundamental task of ideological  construction, and must earnestly implement the guidelines of the  recent national propaganda and ideological work conference. 4)  Actively promoting socialist democracy and the establishment of  a legal system. We must persist in and perfect the system of  people's congresses, and adhere to the system of multi-party  cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist  Party. We must continue to do a good job in the comprehensive  management of public order to ensure social stability. 5)  Stepping up the united front work during the current new period.  We must, under the banner of socialism with Chinese  characteristics and patriotism, unite forces that can be united.  We must bring into play the role of the CPPCC in exercising  political consultation and democratic supervision. 6) Striving  for an international environment favorable to reforms and  construction in China. 7) Stepping up party building and the  campaign to build a clean government. We must improve the  quality of members of all leading bodies and the work force on  all fronts, and enhance their ideological awareness and improve  their work style.    Jiang Zemin emphasized: A correct understanding and proper  handling of the relationships among reforms, development, and  stability is vital to the fulfillment of various tasks this  year. We have accumulated ample experiences in more than a  decade of reform, which is designed to free and develop  productive forces. The implementation of various reform measures  is aimed at providing better institutional conditions for  economic development. Therefore, we must imbue ourselves with an  historical sense of urgency, while making solid, meticulous  efforts to carry out each and every reform measure to ensure its  success. Development is an essential criterion. We must firmly  grasp the central task of economic construction at all times,  never relaxing efforts nor wavering in the slightest degree. In  terms of development, it is necessary to follow a new way of  thinking. We must strive not only for an increase in the total  volume of supply and demand in the economy but also, more  importantly, attach importance to improving economic returns.  Higher economic returns should be achieved by readjusting  structure, upgrading technology, developing new products, and  improving management, not by taking the old road of extensive  management characterized by blindly seeking of output value and  expansion of the investment scale. Stability is the  prerequisite for reforms and development. To deepen reforms,  open the country wider to the outside world, and promote  all-around economic and social development, we must further  maintain and consolidate the political situation marked by  stability and unity. Meanwhile, only by persisting in reforms,  opening up and developing the economy will it be possible to  maintain stability in the long run. Therefore, we must  understand correctly the dialectic unity between reform,  development, and stability, which can promote one another.    Jiang Zemin said: Under the new situation in our efforts  to push forward all-around reforms and accelerate the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure, it is  extremely important to continuously carry forward the fine  tradition of the party's mass line. No matter whether we make  revolution or carry out reform and construction, we must show  concern for the masses in every way, rely on the masses in all  matters, and do everything for the sake of the masses. Herein  lies the fundamental objective and line of work, as well as the  distinct characteristics and superior political features of our  party. As the times move ever forward and our undertakings  develop further, we should all the more show our confidence in,  concern for, and reliance on the masses [shi dai yue qian jin  shi ye yue fa zhan wo men yue yao xin ren guan xin he yi kao qun  zhong 2514 0108 6390 0467 6651 0057 2814 6390 4099 1455 2053  0226 6390 6008 0207 0117 7070 1800 0735 0181 7237 5028 5883];  respect their wishes and pioneering spirit; and detect and solve  in good time new problems cropping up on our road of advance so  as to properly guide, safeguard, and harness the enthusiasm of  the masses. In this way, we can constantly make new  achievements in our reform and development, continuously  safeguard social and political stability, and continuously push  forward our cause of socialist modernization.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: Over a long period in the past,  comrades and friends of various democratic parties and the  ACFIC, along with figures without party affiliation, have made  use of their advantages to actively bring into play their role  in participating in the administration and discussion of state  affairs, and exercising democratic supervision. They have done  a host of highly effective work in economic, scientific, and  technological consultation, providing intellectual resources to  support border and poor areas, establishing contacts abroad, and  have served as links for importing foreign capital and  technology; thus contributing significantly to propelling our  country's reform and opening up policy and modernization drive.  We believe in the new year, they will continue to stand  alongside us and strive harder to uphold the principles of  "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, of showing utter  devotion to each other, and sharing weal and woe together" while  thinking over, discussing, and attending to major issues to make  even greater contributions to the motherland's economic  construction, reform, and opening up to the outside world.    Touching on the great cause of the motherland's  reunification, Jiang Zemin said: It is a common desire of the  entire people of China, as well as a development trend of the  Chinese nation to accomplish the major undertaking of reunifying  the motherland. We must continue to unswervingly push for  reunification through a peaceful process in accordance with the  principle of "one country, two systems." As far as the Taiwan  issue is concerned, we are resolutely opposed to the concept of  "two China's," "one Taiwan, one China" or "one country, two  governments" in any form, and we will oppose any utterances and  actions that are designed to create "Taiwan independence." With  the date for the reversion of Hong Kong and Macao to the  motherland drawing nearer and nearer, our task in this respect  will definitely become increasingly more arduous. Whatever  situation we may come across hereafter, we will accomplish this  sacred mission entrusted to us by history according to schedule.  We hope that friends outside our party will continue to carry  out their work toward this end through various channels, at  various levels, and in various fields and forms; and achieve new  results in their efforts to realize the strategic concept of  "one country, two systems," thereby accomplishing the great  cause of the motherland's reunification.    Jiang Zemin stressed: Currently, with the relatively  favorable international environment, coupled with essential  domestic conditions, and under the guidance of our party's basic  line, the Chinese people are continuously advancing from victory  to victory along the road of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. We have full confidence in the glorious future  of our socialist motherland. Let us unite more closely, and  strive to fulfill the various tasks for 1994.

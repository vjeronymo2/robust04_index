			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROJANS' LATEST DEFEAT LOOKS FAMILIAR;  </P> <P> USC: STANFORD GETS SHAKEN UP AFTER TRAILING AT HALFTIME AND ROLLS TO 74-61  VICTORY. COLEMAN BREAKS SLUMP WITH 21 POINTS.  </P> <P> Stanford basketball Coach Mike Montgomery was angry after watching his team  play poorly in the first half of Saturday's game against USC.  </P> <P> After Trojan guard Harold Miner sank a three-point shot with one second left in  the first half to give USC a 34-32 lead, Montgomery grabbed Stanford guard  Marcus Lollie, who had left Miner open, and flung Lollie off the court in  anger.  </P> <P> "It was an overreaction on my part," Montgomery said. "I thought we had a  chance to get a little momentum going in and we let it slip away on that last  shot."  </P> <P> After Montgomery blew up, the Cardinal exploded in the second half, outscoring  USC, 42-27, en route to a 74-61 Pacific 10 Conference victory before 5,200 at  Maples Pavilion.  </P> <P> After beating No. 16 UCLA Thursday night, Stanford came out flat against USC.  But the Cardinal outscored the Trojans, 23-9, in the first nine minutes of the  second half to take control.  </P> <P> "This was probably a tougher game than many people thought," Montgomery said.  "We were not particularly aggressive in the first half and we didn't seem to  get our adrenaline going."  </P> <P> But the Cardinal was flowing in the second half.  </P> <P> "Stanford has the physical size and they just wore us down," USC Coach George  Raveling said.  </P> <P> Guard John Patrick scored 12 of his team-high 17 points in the second half.  Patrick hit five of nine three-point shots.  </P> <P> Center Adam Keefe added 15 points and Kenny Ammann and Deshon Wingate had 12  apiece. Forward Andrew Vlahov added 11 points.  </P> <P> The Cardinal (12-3, 4-2 in league play) also outrebounded the Trojans, 38-22.  Keefe had a game-high 12 rebounds and Wingate had a season-high 11.  </P> <P> "Whatever they're paying that weight training coach they ought to be giving him  more, because he's doing a helluva job," Raveling said. "Stanford would look  good at Muscle Beach."  </P> <P> It was the same old story for USC (6-8, 1-6), which has wasted halftime leads  in four of its past five games.  </P> <P> "One of the things that concerns me is that we've fallen into a pattern in our  last four or five games of playing quality basketball for 20 minutes in a game  that's played for 40 minutes," Raveling said. "If we were in a contest for 20  minutes, we'd probably be in the top 20 in the country right now, but  unfortunately we play for 40 minutes.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure why we're not able to sustain a 40-minute effort. We had this in  the Notre Dame game, the Arizona game, the Cal game and this game. So I think  what we as a staff have to do is to look at how we can sustain a 20-minute  effort into a 40-minute effort."  </P> <P> For the first time in 14 games, Raveling changed his starting lineup, inserting  freshman Rodney Chatman at point guard in place of Robert Pack, who wasn't  doing a good job of directing the team.  </P> <P> Chatman celebrated his 20th birthday by scoring eight points and passing off  for six assists in 33 minutes.  </P> <P> USC played as well as it can play in the first half, shooting 60.9% from the  floor, hitting 14 of 23 shots.  </P> <P> But the Trojans were unable to shake Stanford, which trailed by two points  despite shooting just 36.7% in the first half.  </P> <P> Forward Ronnie Coleman, who had scored only 24 points in his past three games,  broke out of his slump by scoring 21 points -- but only five in the second  half. He has 1,001 points during his three-year USC career.  </P> <P> "I was glad to see him get back in his rhythm of things," Raveling said. "He  needed a good physical game like this where he got banged around inside."  </P></p>

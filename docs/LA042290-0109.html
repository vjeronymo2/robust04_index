			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA WEST MARINA PRAISED  </P> <P> In response to your article (April 15) on the slip rental rate increase  proposed in Ventura Harbor, I would like to clarify a statement in which I was  represented as saying maintenance is marginal in Ventura West Marina and the  facilities are not well-maintained.  </P> <P> As an owner of a yacht brokerage in Ventura Harbor, I am acutely aware of the  costs involved in maintaining facilities in a harbor environment.  </P> <P> As a Ventura West Slip renter and a live-aboard, while I am not all that  excited by the prospect of a rate increase I consider Ventura West Marina as  one of the finest live-aboard marinas in the area.  </P> <P> In no way did I imply the facilities at Ventura West Marina are inadequate or  not well-maintained. In fact, I stated that my wish is to see these additional  fees used to increase and improve the facilities for the boaters.  </P> <P> Granted, while no one enjoys paying additional housing costs or slip rental  fees, a 5% increase is probably not out of line considering the rise in  property values in the Ventura Harbor area.  </P> <P> Actually, I am more concerned about "marginal" journalism, or attempts to  tailor controversy for a slant in a news story, than a slight monthly increase  in my cost of living.  </P> <P> DAVID ROWE  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

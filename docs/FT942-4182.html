			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US beverages hit by warning from PepsiCo Wall Street US share prices held fairly steady in quiet trading yesterday, but investors in beverage stocks were rattled by a profits warning issued by PepsiCo, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.69 better at 3,753.14 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 drifted 0.80 higher to 457.86. The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.91 to 728.88, although technology stocks stabilised after Wednesday's sharp fall. NYSE volume remained moderate, totalling 253m shares. Before the opening, most market observers were expecting a tranquil trading session. There was no important economic news scheduled for release and the bond market was taking a breather ahead of today's report on May producer prices. A shred of news was forthcoming from the Labor Department, which said initial claims for state unemployment benefit held steady last week. But the development was brushed aside. However, investors were unable to ignore an announcement by PepsiCo. The big soft drinks group said its second-quarter earnings would show no improvement over last year's result. After a delayed opening, the stock tumbled Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 31 1/2 . Adding to its distress, at least two securities houses, Smith Barney and Bear Stearns, lowered their ratings on the issue. PepsiCo's warning carried implications for the entire beverage industry, since it linked its flat performance to slumping prices in the US soft drinks business. The trend was presumed to have affected Coca-Cola, too. Its share price was marked down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 on heavy volume of some 3.5m shares. Payment of the company's dividend yesterday contributed to the extra activity. Cott, a leading private label soft drinks bottler, dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 18 1/8 , although analysts said its aggressiveness was behind the pricing pressures within the industry. Snapple, which specialises in iced tea drinks, receded Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 25 1/4 . It was the second consecutive day in which the former darling of the stock market suffered heavy losses. Ironically, the reason for the markdown was stiffer competition from Lipton, a line marketed jointly by PepsiCo and Unilever. The damage triggered by PepsiCo's announcement also spilled over into the fast-food business, where soft drink sales are a mainstay. McDonald's retreated Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 60. Its weakness was the biggest restraint on the Dow industrials, most of which were showing modest gains. On a brighter note, many technology stocks steadied after fears of a slowdown in personal computer orders had triggered a sell-off in the previous session. However, the industry was facing another big hurdle, with the Semiconductor Industry Association set to release its May 'book-to-bill' ratio just after the close. The figure is regarded as a reliable indicator of the future performance of computer companies. Before its release, Texas Instruments fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 74 7/8 and Applied Materials lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 38 3/8 . With computer sales expected to flag, office-supply retailers were feeling the pinch. Office Depot weakened Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 and Staples Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 . Canada A further fall for the Toronto market was followed by a late-session rally that left the TSE 300 composite index just 4.5 off on the day at 4,196.8. The index was down 25 points at midday. Declines led rises by 456 to 306. Volume was light at 43.5m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices closed lower, led by utilities, down 1.2 per cent. The mining group had the day's biggest rise, up 1.4 per cent. Cineplex Odeon rose 15 cents to CDollars 4.70. The company said at its annual meeting that it is in a 'prime position' for a possible merger or major acquisition, but added that a deal is not imminent. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo closed 3.8 per cent stronger after moderate trade, prices having rebounded from an early profit-taking wave tied to bearish news on the presidential race. The Bovespa index added 1,106 at 29,324. Turnover came to Cr561.2bn (Dollars 269.5m). Brokers said prices rallied in late trade on lingering optimism ahead of the introduction of the new currency, the real, on July 1. The market declined at the opening following publication of an opinion poll by Ibope private research institute which showed that left-wing presidential candidate Mr Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva was maintaining a strong lead over rivals with 39 per cent of the poll. Former economy minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso had 17 per cent.</p>

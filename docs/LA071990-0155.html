			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW / AMBITIOUS GAMES;  </P> <P> SEATTLE LEADERS HOPE ATHLETIC EVENT WILL VAULT THEIR CITY INTO LIMELIGHT  </P> <P> Does this sound familiar?  </P> <P> A huge sporting event is coming to town, bringing the curious eyes of the world  with it, not to mention the prospects of unbearable commuter gridlock. Years of  planning and debate, and millions of dollars, go on the line for just a few  summer days in which young men and women from around the globe converge -- to  jump, swim, lift, dive, row, pedal and otherwise sweat and strain for  celebrated medals that will proclaim them champions.  </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Just as Los Angeles awaited the 1984 Olympics, Seattle, its breath held tight,  now awaits Friday's beginning of Ted Turner's 1990 Goodwill Games, the most  heavily promoted event in the Pacific Northwest since the 1962 World's Fair of  Space Needle fame.  </P> <P> The Goodwill Games are cable television magnate Turner's efforts to encourage  friendly international competition through athletics. The first games were held  in Moscow four years ago under decidedly more chilly political conditions,  after the U.S. Olympic boycott of 1980 and the U.S.S.R. boycott of the 1984  Olympics.  </P> <P> But, today, goodwill seems a name wholly in step with goodwill times.  </P> <P> Stores here fly the big red hammer-and-sickle alongside Old Glory. Soviet  aircraft are landing at the local airport alongside locally made Boeing  jetliners. Soviet tourists are treated as celebrities.  </P> <P> East-West cultural and artistic exchanges that accompany the games are touted  as being without modern precedent. By one count, 35 separate arts events are  tied to the games, as are conferences on everything from human rights to the  environment.  </P> <P> Simply, Seattle is gaga over the Soviets.  </P> <P> Actually, the games are much more international than just a match of  superpowers. Organizers say that 2,500 athletes from about 50 countries will  compete in 21 sports during a 17-day contest. Unlike the Olympics, which  feature rounds and rounds of eliminations, these games are described as "finals  only."  </P> <P> ANXIETY OVER OUTCOME  </P> <P> With the world knocking on its door, Seattle is a city on the spot this summer.  Residents of Los Angeles would recognize the familiar civic hand-wringing over  what image the games might fix in the eyes of a television audience that is  supposed to reach 72 countries. Will the already crowded transportation system  freeze up under the strain? Who pays for the extra services? What defines  success? Who deserves blame for failure?  </P> <P> Unlike Los Angeles, however, Seattle is still a community in search of its  self-image.  </P> <P> Some promoters figure the picturesque Northwest settings and red-carpet welcome  will increase Seattle's prestige.  </P> <P> Already, the Goodwill Arts Festival has critics swooning over Seattle as a  paragon of culture. Business leaders believe they can gain a jump on the world  in welcoming the eastern Soviet Union into the Pacific Rim.  </P> <P> "Very important trade and other implications," the municipal convention bureau  explains.  </P> <P> But the chest-pounding occurs at a time when the Puget Sound region of  Washington is deep in debate over growth. Enough-is-too-much groups like the  locally famous "Lesser Seattle" fear that blissful accounts of life and  commerce in the verdant greens of the Northwest will stimulate the crowding  that jeopardizes the very things that make Seattle so livable.  </P> <P> FUTURE OLYMPICS?  </P> <P> Competition begins Friday, although welcoming ceremonies will not occur until  Saturday evening.  </P> <P> Seattle is likely to get all the credit -- or blame -- for the games, but  neighboring Tacoma and other cities are hosts to select events.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan will be the ranking politician-guest, President  Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev having demurred. Seattle also  made attempts to attract other celebrities, including offering Nelson Mandela a  reported $100,000 honorarium.  </P> <P> Broadcaster and showman Turner is expected to be in the limelight himself  during the games, along with his sometimes companion, actress Jane Fonda.  </P> <P> There has been substantial worry over the quality of the athletes competing. As  late as Tuesday, organizers said they were not sure whether to expect the  Soviet Union's top athlete, pole-vaulter Sergey Bubka. Familiar American names  who are on the lineup include sprinter and long-jumper Carl Lewis, who kept the  city on edge before saying yes, along with swimmer Matt Biondi, who holds seven  Olympic medals.  </P> <P> In the end, though, the games are just a start. When the up-and-down ticket  sales are tallied, when the number of new world records is posted, when the  merchants count their receipts, when the sporting world passes judgment on the  Northwest, Seattle boosters hope the city will show itself ready for the real  games -- the first Olympics of the 21st Century.  </P></p>

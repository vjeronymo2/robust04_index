			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA RENT-CONTROL ISSUE STILL SMOLDERS  </P> <P> A movement to limit rent increases at mobile home parks in Santa Clarita failed  to win support from the City Council last week but may bring concessions from  park owners eager to avoid regulation, an industry expert said.  </P> <P> "If anything, there would be a tendency to moderate rent increases because of  the threat of rent control," said David Evans, regional director of the Western  Mobilehome Assn., a statewide trade group for park owners. "They might raise  rents 5% instead of 8%."  </P> <P> George Kahabka, general partner in Polynesian Mobile Home Park, agreed: "It's  going to bring about a mood of restraint."  </P> <P> About 60 residents of mobile home parks appeared at a City Council meeting  Tuesday to support a rent-stabilization ordinance. It would tie rent increases  to rises in the consumer price index but limit them to a maximum of 8%.  </P> <P> Council members opted for a cooperative approach instead. They invited both  sides to a December meeting, where they hope to reach an agreement on voluntary  guidelines. But they warned park owners that they would come down hard if rents  started to soar.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, representatives of both camps have retreated to their respective  corners to plan strategy. Park tenants -- many of them elderly and dependent on  Social Security -- complain about rent increases that they say average between  8% and 10% a year, but have gone as high as 15%.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita Mobile Home Owners Area Council, which represents park  residents, is collecting data about rent increases at the 22 parks in the city  and will compare those figures with increases in the consumer price index,  which has hovered around 5% in recent years. Members hope that their findings  will be so persuasive that the City Council will adopt a rent-control ordinance  even though it was reluctant to do so last week.  </P> <P> The 2,200 spaces in Santa Clarita parks are home to more than 7,500 people  paying rents of between $300 and $473 a month, said Don Wilder, president of  the mobile home group.  </P> <P> Among them are Jeannette and Franklin Story, both in their 80s, who live on a  fixed income and are just getting by. Their rent at Mulberry Mobilhome Park has  just gone up 6.5% to $280.87 a month.  </P> <P> "We are living on our Social Security, and we've had four hospital bills since  last December," Jeannette Story said. "The prices of things now, and our  hospital bills, it's outrageous. We don't go to picture shows. We don't do  anything. We don't spend money foolishly.  </P> <P> "If it keeps going much higher," she said of the rent, "well, I don't know what  we'll do."  </P> <P> Thea Wilson lives at West Green Brier park, where rent has increased 8% a year  in the past two years. She pays $473 a month.  </P> <P> "Even though I work, it's a problem," she said. "I don't get a raise of 8% a  year."  </P> <P> Senior citizens at the park have been particularly hard hit, she said. "They  are scared. They are facing, at the age of 60 or 65, the fact that in two  years, they can't afford to live here."  </P> <P> On the other side of the issue are park owners, who say they are entitled to a  fair return on their investments. Without a fair return, neither side benefits,  Kahabka said. "Either you liquidate or things start falling apart."  </P> <P> Kahabka advocates negotiating long-term leases with residents, a system he has  used at a park outside Los Angeles County. He said nine months of bargaining  with park tenants produced a five-year lease that ties rent increases to  inflation but requires residents to absorb the cost of new government taxes for  such things as roads.  </P> <P> Evans said several parks in Santa Clarita use long-term leases that specify the  amount of annual rent hikes. "Some leases, which residents willingly signed,  have increases above the CPI," Evans said. "At Green Brier, the annual  increases are 8%. My response is, 'You knew when you signed the lease what the  increase will be, so why are you complaining?' If the CPI were 10%, the park  owner would be locked into 8% and the residents wouldn't be complaining. When  they signed the lease, both sides took a risk."  </P> <P> Evans, who advises park owners in an eight-county area from Los Angeles to  Fresno, has scheduled a meeting Nov. 16 to assess how much rents have increased  in Santa Clarita and why. That information will be forwarded to the City  Council.  </P> <P> The ordinance proposed for Santa Clarita is patterned after one in Oceanside.  The city of Los Angeles also restricts rent increases at mobile homes, tying  them to inflation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Numerous requests for a mistrial in David Lucas' trial were unsuccessfully made  by his attorneys -- outside the presence of the public and the jury -- during  the jury's deliberations in the penalty phase.  </P> <P> Transcripts of some of the secret hearings conducted with Lucas' attorneys,  prosecutors and San Diego Superior Court Judge Laura Hammes were released to  the public late Thursday.  </P> <P> According to the transcript, defense attorneys Steve Feldman and Alex Landon  asked for a mistrial after the jury foreman sent in a note on July 18 stating  "it is the feeling of the jury that a unanimous decision is not possible."  </P> <P> Since the jury had only deliberated about five hours on whether Lucas should be  executed or receive a life sentence without the possibility of parole, Hammes  ordered the jury to resume its discussions.  </P> <P> The jury returned a death verdict Wednesday.  </P> <P> Lucas, 34, of Spring Valley, was convicted June 21 of three throat-slashing  murders in the Nov. 20, 1984, slaying of Anne Swanke, 22, of San Carlos and the  May 4, 1979, killings of Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and her 3-year-old son, Colin, in  their Normal Heights home.  </P> <P> The judge did not release any transcripts or notes relating to the mysterious  dismissal of one male juror during the deliberations.  </P> <P> Names of the jurors were whited out on the transcripts, except for the jury  foreman. The transcripts were made available as the result of a legal action  brought against the judge by the San Diego Union and Tribune.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEN'S FASHION AND LOOKS  </P> <P> Regarding your article on the Southern California man "Tall, Dark, and  Handsome," I think what you meant to say was:  </P> <P> "The Southern California man is a bold individual in dress and fashion. He does  not kowtow to the meaningless dictates of Madison and Seventh avenues.  </P> <P> He has his own style and is not afraid to go it alone.  </P> <P> "If long hair is out, but he likes long hair, he has long hair. He is not  afraid of a wrinkle or a gray hair, he doesn't run to the beauty shop every  time a foible appears on his immaculately bronzed and well-defined person.  </P> <P> "There may well be days when his less-than-perfectly-honed razor has left a  trace of stubble on his well-defined cheek and he may not even use any toners,  under-eye concealers, mud facials or foundation.  </P> <P> "In short, he is dictated not by Betty Goodwin, Michael Quintanilla, or any  other fashion writers, or his wife, but by the sense of what he feels  comfortable with."  </P> <P> Apart from these few omissions, I enjoyed reading your article.  </P> <P> DAVID H. GOODWIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

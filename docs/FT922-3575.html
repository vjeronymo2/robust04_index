			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Spearheading a leading continental role for Germany / Examining Rolf Breuer's campaign to enhance the country's strengths as a financial hub ROLF BREUER is a main board director of Deutsche Bank: among other things, he is responsible for the bank's securities activities. He is also a leading figure in the campaign to enhance Germany's strengths as a financial centre. From his office high up in one of the bank's two Frankfurt skyscrapers, he says: 'I would like to see Germany as the leading financial centre in continental Europe in close co-operation with London. 'Our ambition is not to be better than London - we must stick with what is realistic, and it would be illusory to think we could overtake London given that city's traditional advantages. To be the leading financial centre on the continent is more realistic.' Mr Breuer's campaign bore fruit in January this year. The government in Bonn announced plans to set up Germany's first nationwide regulatory body for the securities industry. It said it would introduce an insider dealing law by the end of the year. It backed plans for a central stock market for the whole of Germany, and lent its support for further computerisation of share trading. These proposals emerged in the form of policy document written by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister. A day later, Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited the Frankfurt stock exchange - his first visit to Germany's largest bourse - a powerful symbol of government support for what Mr Breuer and other financiers are trying to achieve. There has been further success within recent weeks. Germany's eight stock exchanges abandoned age-old hostilities and agreed to form Deutsche Borse - a stock exchange for Germany. It is hoped that this will reduce inefficiencies and make it more attractive for foreign investors to buy German shares via Germany - rather than via London, as happens for a significant proportion of turnover in the shares of Germany's biggest companies. Work on further computerisation of the stock market, supervised by the McKinsey consultancy company, continues apace. But, according to Mr Breuer, 'there is still a lot to do'. He acknowledges that Frankfurt's reputation was damaged last year by insider dealing allegations levied against the broking community. 'What we need first of all is better supervision,' he argues. 'We had a lot of what you might call 'mishappenings' in the summer of last year, and this stimulated an international discussion about the moral standards of Germany as a financial centre.' Buzzwords of the debate were 'insider dealing' and 'front-running' (a practice whereby brokers allegedly place personal buy orders ahead of executing client's trades, thereby benefiting from sharp price movements). There was doubt, especially in the press, as to whether Germany's securities industry managed conflicts of interest in a fair and proper way. 'The problem has to be solved in a way which adds to the reputation of Germany as a financial centre. An essential part is to establish a centralised supervisory body, a body with real teeth - one which really gets into things, which is respected, even feared by market participants. For this we need the government to act, and in January this year, it did act.' Mr Breuer is confident that the timetable can be kept to, with a new body and insider dealing law by the end of the year. 'Drafts of the relevant rules are already in the ministries, complete and ready to be discussed by parliament. It is up to the minister to introduce the drafts into the parliamentary procedures. The credit institutions are very interested in a speedy procedure - we need to have it.' However, he acknowledges that the plans may be held up as a result of a dispute between Bonn and Germany's state (Lander) governments. The latter are at present responsible for policing the stock markets on their patch, and there is reluctance to cede powers to central governments. Mr Breuer says what may be needed is an institutional structure which establishes a central office in Bonn but which leaves day-to-day policing of the market to the Lander. Whatever the final institutional structure, Mr Breuer thinks the new authority will only succeed if it is a 'quasi-governmental' body staffed not by civil servants but by senior figures from the market who are paid market salaries. This new body and the insider law will be the government's contribution to 'Project market participants can do their bit, too, Mr Breuer believes. At its 1991 results press conference in April, Deutsche Bank announced plans for Anglo-Saxon-style compliance rules for its staff, based on the practice at Morgan Grenfell, its UK merchant banking subsidiary, and at its New York office. Other German financial institutions are in the throes of following suit. Mr Breuer plays down the significance of the location of a European central bank: it would be 'helpful but not essential' to have the new institution in Frankfurt. But he believes that Frankfurt is set fair to become the financial capital of continental Europe by the end of the century, whether it gets the new body or not.</p>

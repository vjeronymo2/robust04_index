			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Steinhardt makes first move in UK Steinhardt Partners, one of the world's top three hedge fund managers, has launched its first raid on a quoted UK company, as a first step towards making a series of substantial investments in debt-stricken European businesses. Over the past two months, Steinhardt, which has equity under management of around Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) but borrows many billions more for investment, has quietly acquired a 30 per cent stake in the convertible preference shares of Ransomes, the lossmaking manufacturer of grass cutting equipment. Even though this gives Steinhardt a fully diluted stake of just under 15 per cent in the company - well above the 3 per cent level that normally obliges public disclosure of a holding - the shares are currently non-voting, so there has probably not been a legal obligation to disclose. However, the convertible preference shares become voting instruments when dividends are six months in arrears. Ransomes made pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.9m in 1993 and it postponed the payment of the preference dividend due last October 31. As a result, holders of the preference shares should receive votes at the end of the month, giving Steinhardt a potentially influential stake in the company. A financier with a close knowledge of Steinhardt's European plans said that although a full bid for Ransomes could not be ruled out, the fund's normal preference was to take a strategic holding and then persuade a company to adopt a reorganisation plan. Steinhardt, which paid around Pounds 10m for the Ransomes stake, is understood to believe the company has a solid operating business but will be unable to thrive until the burden of paying interest on Pounds 75m of bank debt and dividends on Pounds 56.6m of convertible preference shares is reduced by a significant injection of equity. The financier said that Steinhardt was also examining a series of other investments in over-borrowed European companies. Like Soros Fund Management and Tiger, its two main hedge fund rivals, Steinhardt typically invests in very liquid instruments - particularly currency and interest rate derivatives - with the aim of making enormous profits from movements in foreign exchange or bond markets. However, like Soros, it also takes substantial stakes in companies. In the US, it has invested hundreds of million dollars in businesses with excessive debts in order to facilitate financial reconstructions. For example, Steinhardt has been battling with a consortium linked to Continental Airlines over proposals to recapitalise America West Airlines, the US carrier in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Mr Michael Steinhardt, founder of the fund, is consistently ranked as one of Wall Street's biggest earners, alongside Mr George Soros, earning hundreds of million dollar a year.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bondholders opt for YPF shares AROUND 13 per cent of YPF, Argentina's national oil company, has changed hands under a Dollars 1bn option agreement with holders of government bonds. Mr Alejandro Mayoral, economic policy undersecretary, said that about 85,000 people had swapped their holdings of government bonds, known as Bocons, for a total of 46.5m shares in YPF, Argentina's largest company. The government floated 45 per cent of YPF in June, raising Dollars 3.04bn from local and foreign investors. A further 26 per cent was reserved for holders of Bocons at the original flotation price of Dollars 19 a share. In 1991 and 1992, the government issued Dollars 9.4bn worth of 10-year floating rate Bocons to suppliers and pensioners in lieu of payment and pension rights. Pension holders were offered Dollars 8.2bn in bonds convertible into YPF shares. To win support for the flotation of YPF, the government offered to buy back Bocons at 79 per cent of face value. It is believed that many pensioners have sold their Bocons on the secondary market, where they are currently fetching 83 per cent of face value. YPF shares have risen by more than 25 per cent to Dollars 24, giving investors and pensioners a substantial gain. However, the shares cannot be sold for at least a year. The government has issued a further Dollars 1.2bn in Bocons to suppliers. They can also convert the bonds into equity, but will have to wait until pensioners had taken up their rights. Once conversion is completed, the government's holding in YPF will be reduced to 20 per cent. Employees will own 10 per cent and private investors 70 per cent. For the first half of 1993, YPF reported net income of Dollars 240m, up 80 per cent on the first half of 1992.</p>

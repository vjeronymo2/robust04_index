			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Malaysian Air proposes cash call after 42% slide MALAYSIAN Airline System (MAS) yesterday unveiled a 42 per cent slide in group pre-tax profit in the year to end-March, AP-DJ reports. MAS also proposed a rights share issue to raise MDollars 1.75bn (USDollars 694.4m). Pre-tax profits declined to MDollars 120m from MDollars 206m the previous year, on revenues ahead to MDollars 3.57bn from MDollars 2.91bn, a rise of 23 per cent. MAS, whose interim earnings had rebounded from the depressed levels following the Gulf war, slumped into a MDollars 28.7m operating loss in the second half of the most recent financial year. MAS attributed its weak performance to slower-than-anticipated growth in demand; higher provisions for wage increases; and lower income from aircraft sales. The carrier's overall load factor, representing the utilisation of aircraft, fell 3 percentage points from last year to 65.9 per cent, its lowest level since 65.1 per cent in 1983. The load factor's decline is unsettling for analysts because the airline is pushing ahead with an expanded fleet acquisition programme, under which MAS plans to buy 72 aircraft in the next five years. The MDollars 1.75bn rights issue would partly finance the acquisition of 25 new aircraft in this financial year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleh Hruzdilovich: "Butrus-Ghali: `Chernobyl Is </F> a Symbol of International Solidarity'"]    [Text] As expected, the second day of UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali's visit to Belarus was devoted to Chernobyl issues.  At any rate, Chernobyl problems prevailed during his meetings  with Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb, Prime Minister  Vyacheslaw Kebich, and Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Kenik who is  also chairman of the State Committee for Dealing with the  Aftermath of Chernobyl. They were also the focus during his  visit to the radiation medicine clinic in Aksakawshchyna. Mr.  Butrus-Ghali has received sufficient information to fully  realize the scope of the Chernobyl catastrophe aftermath.  During a meeting at the Supreme Soviet, he promised his  personal support for keeping Chernobyl issues alive on the UN  agenda.    The results of the two-day talks held by the UN secretary  general in Minsk were assessed by Foreign Minister Pyotr  Krawchanka as follows: "Mr. Butrus-Ghali fully supported our two  Chernobyl projects. The first one, amounting to $12 million,  concerns the carrying out of permanent radiation monitoring of  the Republic. The second one, whose cost can be evaluated  approximately at $8 million, concerns devising a project to  build a plant manufacturing organic food for children.  Butrus-Ghali indicated that the UN budget has no provision for  financing these projects, and proposed looking for sponsors --  firms and various international funds, to which he promised all  kinds of support."    Regarding other issues discussed during the talks, Pyotr  Krawchanka informed that they were primarily devoted to  relations between Belarus and the United Nations (great progress  has been achieved in that area), as well as to the issue of  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Our side confirmed its  intent to fulfill the agreements on the nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons, which were signed earlier for the period until  1995, as well as the possibility of prolonging them for a new  period, or giving them a set character.    The issue of Belarus' participation in various UN  peacekeeping actions was also discussed. The Belarusian side  highly estimated these international efforts and expressed its  support in principle for activities leading to the suppression  of existing conflicts. Regarding the direct participation of  Belarus in such peacekeeping actions, it was stated that these  issues are under the jurisdiction of the Belarusian Supreme  Soviet. Concrete proposals from the United Nations to assist  Belarus with disarmament were also discussed.    During the meeting of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali with  Prime Minister Kebich, issues of economic cooperation of the  Republic with the international community were discussed in  detail along with the difficulties facing Belarus on the path  toward reforms. Later in the day, Butrus-Ghali laid a wreath at  the Peramoha monument and delivered a speech at the Belarusian  Academy of Sciences. This afternoon, his visit is coming to a  close, but on the eve of his departure a news conference should  be held, after which we will be able to give our readers more  details about the results of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's  visit to Belarus.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eugenio Andrea Bruno: "Where Is Radicalism?"] </F>   [Text] The opposition has as many economic programs as  potential candidates for economy minister that it can offer  society. The economic advisers of Eduardo Angeloz, Raul  Alfonsin, and Fernando de la Rua outline where they agree and  disagree.    For some time now a heated political debate has been going  on  inside the Radical Civic Union (UCR).    There are three clearly defined political factions in the  party: Raul Alfonsin's, Eduardo Angeloz's, and Fernando de la  Rua's.    And just as there are three different political approaches,  there are as many factions in economic policy as well. If we  were to plot economic policy on a spectrum with interventionism  on one end and the free market on the other, then all  indications are that the economic advisers of Angeloz (Ricardo  Lopez Murphy and Francisco Mezzadri) would be closest to the  market, De la Rua's adviser (Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini)  would be in the middle, and Juan Vital Sourrouille of the  Alfonsin faction would be farthest to the left and closest to  interventionism.    Our main question is: Are the economic philosophies within  the UCR compatible?    The advisers themselves answer the question in a way  designed  to temper the argument. Mezzadri contends that "there is a lot  more agreement than disagreement among the professional  economists who belong to the UCR. We may have our differences  about the approach to policies, but on key issues such as the  need for a stable, open Argentina, I do not see substantial  differences. There may be different assessments among  politicians, but not among economists."    In the same vein, Mezzadri says that if Sourrouille were  minister, in his opinion he would adhere to the guidelines of  the Cavallo plan and not return to the previous approach. "I do  not think that he would reverse course," he exclaims.    Rodriguez Giavarini explains that "the economists you have  mentioned (myself, Lopez Murphy, Mezzadri, and Sourrouille) may  be associated with different factions, but we belong to the same  party. We share many views, from a defense of stability, concern  over the effectiveness of government spending, and the dangers  of excessive vulnerability, to the need to boost the rate of  savings and investment."  <H5>  No Consensus </H5>   Although the economists themselves contend that they agree  on  major issues, one has the feeling that the economic program of a  hypothetical Radical government would differ depending on its  economy minister. And the differences would involve substance,  not just approach. Let us see.    It is obvious that Mezzadri and Rodriguez Giavarini do not  think the same as Sourrouille. Whereas the former have praise  for the Cavallo plan, Sourrouille criticizes it unceasingly.    For example, with regard to the labor reform, Mezzadri  contends that if it were up to him, it would be more sweeping  than even the administration's. "There has to be flexibility for  managerial, technological, financial, and labor movements. In  some cases such mobility takes place easily, but in others,  mainly labor, it does not exist at all. It is impossible to  sustain an economic plan such as that with labor relations like  the ones we have today."    Sourrouille, in contrast, feels that although labor  relations  have to be made somewhat more flexible, the administration's  approach is leaving the workers altogether defenseless.    As for the exchange rate, Mezzadri says that it is the  responsibility of Argentine businessmen to seek out new markets  and to adopt an export-oriented stance. "The exchange rate has  hurt some of them, but it has not impeded the growth of  industrial exports...I do not see the exchange rate as a  decisive obstacle. I do not think that those who say they cannot  do anymore are working at peak economic efficiency." Yet,  Angeloz's adviser thinks that more flexibility is indeed needed  in internal factors in order to cut costs and improve  competitiveness.    In contrast, we need only glance at Sourrouille's remarks to  realize that he blames the economic plan, and more specifically  the exchange rate, for the mounting trade deficit.  <H5>  What Lies in Store </H5>   The future of the plan is another issue that divides them.  Mezzadri's thinking in this regard is clear-cut. He calls on the  administration to step up its program and under no circumstances  to stray from the current economic discipline. Rodriguez  Giavarini is even more categorical: "The outlook would darken if  the administration decided to become passive, as if nothing were  happening in the world or, worse yet, to try and keep fueling  domestic demand as a short-term fiscal tool, like more  government spending, to channel the proceeds from the pending  privatizations into consumption, or else to close off the  economy."    "The economic plan is unsustainable," said Sourrouille at a  regional economic meeting of the UCR. The remark conceals an  entire philosophy. In turn, we can hear this philosophy every  day in Alfonsin's statements and, even more so, in the recent  comments by Simon Lazzara ("A little bit of inflation would be  acceptable if it boosted demand").    In short, a major faction of UCR politicians and economists  feels that a marked change is needed in the rules of the game.    What we are looking at, when all is said and done, is a  full-fledged debate within the UCR marked by an unmistakable  clash of ideas. This is not bad, per se, for a political party.  What is harmful is to try and conceal these differences for the  sake of appearing united before society.  <H5>  Mezzadri: "Social Investment Lacking" </H5>   Back when Angeloz still had hopes of becoming president, in  1989, two men had a chance to become his economy minister. One  was Lopez Murphy, and the other was Francisco Mezzadri, who in  reply to a question from LA PRENSA emphasized that "there are  fewer differences among UCR economists than there seem to be."     -  "The best thing about the administration's plan is that it  incorporated the idea of economic discipline."    -  "You asked me  whether I am going to be Angeloz's economy minister in 1995.  Angeloz has a saying to answer that question: there are things  that only he and his pillow know."    -  "My labor reform would be  much more thorough-going than the government's."    -  "The State  should not take action in the economic area, although it should  do so efficiently in health care, education, defense, and  security. In these fields the government should make social  spending more efficient by setting goals and achieving  them."    -  "The administration is wasting its time on second-rate  political matters, such as the reform of the constitution, when  it ought to be devoting that time to completing pending tasks  such as the labor reform and the provincial reforms."    -  "The  provinces ought to implement reform plans like the  administration's plan. Only in this way will there be  homogeneity in Argentina's economy."    -  "A second reform of the  State is currently lacking. The first, which had to do with  bringing the idea of economic efficiency into Argentina, has  already been successfully completed. Now, in order for these  efforts to bear fruit, the government needs to address social  investment more efficiently."   <H5>    Sourrouille: "The Plan Is Unsustainable" </H5>   The former economy minister in the last UCR government  resumed his criticism of Minister Cavallo's economic plan in his  remarks to the UCR regional economic meeting.     -  "There are two reports on Argentina. The first is that  inflation is low, there is stability, interest rates are low,  and foreign funds are coming into the country, albeit for  speculative purposes. But the other has to note that there are  tragic pockets of poverty and that unemployment remained at 10  percent of the population last year."    -  "Most of the country is  suffering crises that seem definitive for the sake of achieving  macroeconomic success."    -  "The administration's plan is good for  only one segment of the population, while the majority of people  are enduring a situation of neglect in which they cannot find  any space."    -  "Social strains that could explode in the medium  term are being fomented."    -  "The two problems facing the Cavallo  plan, which are impossible to resolve under this model, have to  do with the trade deficit and unemployment. And I see no  possibility of solving them under this arrangement."   <H5>    Rodriguez Giavarini: "The Accomplishments Are Unquestionable" </H5>   Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini is an economic consultant and  Fernando de la Rua's main economic adviser. "The administration  must remain on this course and under no circumstances close off  the economy," he said in an interview with LA PRENSA.     -  "The economic plan has made three major gains possible.  Price stability is foremost. The other two are in fiscal policy  and economic activity. The consumer price index over the past  six months is equivalent to an annualized rate of 3.1 percent,  which is similar to the rate in the United States over the past  12 months."    -  "There has been major growth in economic activity,  although we can criticize the exaggerated consumption slant that  the expansion has shown."    -  "As far as fiscal policy is concerned,  the effort to balance the budget and eliminate distorting taxes  is praiseworthy."    -  "The growth in government spending of dubious  effectiveness concerns me."    -  "Some aspects of the technical  design of the plan are debatable. I would have preferred more  incentives for domestic savings rather than spending on public  and private consumption."    -  "I am not pleased about the  administration's tendency to proceed on a case-by-case basis,  with a large degree of discretionary authority and straying from  the sound principles of universality and transparency."    -  "The  administration should step up its fiscal austerity to try to  offset the upward pressure that higher international interest  rates put on domestic interest rates, by bringing down the  country-risk premium."    -  "The strategy of fiscal austerity should  be complemented by progress on pending matters, particularly the  labor and provincial reforms and incentives for domestic  savings."    -  "Inflation must be seen as an extremely regressive  tax. If the government merely signals that it would be willing  to tolerate a little inflation in exchange for growth, I think  that the economic agents would react by penalizing it heavily,  and this would lead to capital flight and a contraction in  credit and production. As you will see, then, I do not agree at  all with Lazzara's statements."</p>

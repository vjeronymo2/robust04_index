			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter addressed the editorial note that Utah proposes for the definition of ``affected area.'' This note indicates that a portion of the definition is suspended insofar as it excludes roads that are included in the definition of ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200. The commenter stated that this clarification is not necessary because the State's proposed definition of ``affected area'' clearly delineates the regulatory authority's jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with this comment. As finding No. III.C.1. indicates, Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' and accompanying editorial note are, with only a few nonsubstantive differences, verbatim copies of the Federal definition of ``affected area'' and accompanying editorial note. As discussed above, the editorial note accompanying the Federal definition is necessary to bring the definition into compliance with the court decision In re Permanent. The same is also the case with the State definition. Without the editorial note or other equivalent revision to Utah's rules, the Utah program would not be consistent with the Federal regulations that were revised in response to the court decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on Utah's proposed amendment from the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the heads of other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated January 21, 1993, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) commented that forest development roads (FDR'S) are not public roads (23 U.S.C. 101(a)) in the same sense as roads that are under the jurisdiction of public agencies, such as States or counties (administrative record No. UT&hyph;821) and are not intended to meet the transportation needs of the public at large. Instead, they are authorized only for the administration and utilization of National Forest System lands. Although FDR's are generally open and available for public use, that use is at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture. Through authorities delegated by the Secretary, USFS may restrict or control use to meet specific management direction. Commercial users, permittees, or contractors also may be required to share in the cost of developing, improving, and maintaining FDR's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USFS also stated that it may regulate use and restrict public travel on FDR's regardless of whether there is substantial or incidental use. The USFS added that sometimes there are FDR's with seasonal adjusted daily traffic of less than 10 vehicles per day ``open to public travel'' when these roads serve large blocks of Forest lands, serve important resources, or are the only access routes within the block of land. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USFS recommended that because it has the legal right to control or regulate FDR's, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;200 (defining ``public road'') should be modified to (1) include FDR's with those roads that have been designated public roads pursuant to the jurisdiction in which it is located and (2) exclude FDR's from the use restriction that there be substantial (more than incidental) public use of a road in order for it to qualify as a public road. USFS stated that with these recommended changes, it could concur with the formal amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By a second letter dated September 9, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;870), USFS restated its concern regarding rules that attempt to dictate standards of development or maintenance relating to roads under the jurisdiction of public road agencies or Federal agencies providing public access to lands of the United States. USFS further stated that <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> SMCRA regulations must be limited to restrictions on coal hauling activities rather than orders to reclaim or otherwise modify the transportation facility. The proposed amendment does not clarify this issue sufficiently to present [sic] unilateral decisions by OSM and DOGM [(the Division)] on roads managed for public access. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM appreciates USFS's concerns as stated in its January 21, 19923, and September 9, 1993, letters. OSM cannot, however, require the State to adopt the recommended changes to the proposed definition of ``public road'' at Utah Admin, R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;200 because the proposed definition is substantively identical to the Federal definition at 30 CFR 761.5 and is, therefore, no less effective than the corresponding Federal definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, as explained below, the existing Federal definition and proposed State definition of ``public road,'' will not interfere with USFS jurisdiction over FDR's and will protect FDR's from the adverse effects of surface mining to the extent allowed under SMCRA and the State Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``public road'' is defined at 30 CFR 761.5 and at proposed Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;200 so that it may be used in determining when a surface coal mining operation may be conducted within 100 feet of a road: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [No surface coal mining operations shall be conducted] within 100 feet, measured horizontally, of the outside right-of-way line of any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> public <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  road *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (30 CFR 761.11(d) and Utah Admin.

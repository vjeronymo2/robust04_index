			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: CSFB The resignation of Mr Archibald Cox as head of its US operations suggests CSFB is some way from achieving management stability. Having appointed Mr David Mulford to the top job in London in March - in place of the established Mr Hans Joerg Rudloff - it might have hoped for a period of calm. Mr Cox hardly has a record of precipitate career moves, so it is hard to believe that bickering over the level of bonuses paid in New York played more than an incidental role. That raises the question of whether his departure is a symptom of a deeper malaise. Like other globally-minded investment banks, CSFB must mould an integrated business from the far flung parts of its empire. Splitting into regional units in 1988 to accommodate the buy-out of First Boston proved an unsatisfactory response. In an era of cross-border capital flows, organising an investment bank geographically makes little sense. By reshaping itself into product groups earlier this year, CSFB has belatedly fallen into line with practice elsewhere. Since that involved curtailing the power of regional chiefs, friction was always likely. If Mr Cox's resignation has indeed arisen out of the decision to impose a more rational management structure, CSFB could emerge stronger from the upheaval. Having clung to the idea of regional units for so long, though, it has lost ground against the best of the competition. What the company really needs now is a focus on profitability rather than personalities.</p>

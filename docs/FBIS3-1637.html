Official sources said that 134 million yuan in the  construction of basic facilities, involving a floor space of  some 200,000 sq m, was completed last year in this development  zone.    With a total area of some 12 sq km, the zone, which was  approved three years ago, is Zhejiang's only state-level  development zone of the kind.    To date, local governments, colleges, scientific institutes  and major companies all over the country as well as some Hong  Kong and Taiwan businesses have set up more than 305 firms in  the zone.    In addition, some 46 foreign-funded firms have been  established there over the past three years, involving a total  foreign investment of more than 80 million U.S. dollars.    According to sources from the management committee of the  zone, great emphasis has been put upon the development of  electronic information, new materials, new energy and  biotechnologies as well as technologies to improve efficiency  and save energy.    At the same time, such advanced new and high technologies as  program-controlled switchboards, membron materials and silicon  single crystals have been introduced and applied to production.    The latest statistics show that some 402 new and high  technologies are currently being applied to production in the  zone and will soon be spread throughout the country.

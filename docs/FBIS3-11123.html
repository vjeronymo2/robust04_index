			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Unnoticed by most of  the large international media, and yet a startling event for  those who became aware of it, the 35 Haitians the U.S. Coast  Guard left to the fate of being devoured by sharks in the open  sea dramatically shows the tragic consequences of a wrong  immigration policy.    The unlucky ones -- those who fled horror and persecution in  their own country aboard a flimsy boat that capsized off the  Bahamian coasts -- became fodder for the sharks that swarm these  waters after they called insistently and unsuccessfully on the  U.S. Navy to help them.    Complying with the provisions in effect in the United  States,  the U.S. Coast Guard opted to conduct another task at that time:  to pick up a group of Cuban rafters who were on their way to  Miami and escort them to U.S. territory.    In this case, as always, the Cuban rafters were received as  heroes. The media were called to interview them, and they were  asked to condemn the Havana government publicly, which seems to  be an essential requirement to being welcomed warmly and  affectionately.    The U.S. immigration provisions, which Havana deems as  political tools used in a campaign against the revolutionary  process taking place on the Caribbean island, encourage this  type of arrival along the U.S. coast. These policies even  include the right to possible employment.    As if this were not enough, the so-called rafters -- some of  whom fall prey to drug traffickers who charge high fees for the  odyssey and some of whom never reach their destination because  they disappear at sea -- can apply for permanent residence in a  year. This option is repeatedly denied to other applicants.    The daily, weekly, monthly, and annual publication of the  number of Cubans who, according to U.S. statistics, avail  themselves of this possibility after leaving Cuba illegally is  part of the anti-Cuban strategy being implemented by Washington.    Of course, this policy is complemented by repeated  rejections  given to many Cubans who go to the U.S. Cuban Interests Office  in the island's capital to request a visa to visit their  relatives or to opt for residence in the United States.    An immigration agreement signed years ago by the governments  of the two countries states that Washington will authorize up to  20,000 visas for Cubans, but the Cuban Government has repeatedly  accused the other party of violating this agreement by granting  a ridiculous number of travel permits.    This contrasts with Havana's evident easing of its  immigration process, which now allows any citizen over age 20 to  travel freely, as long as he has the required visa to the place  he wants to go.    Because accepting Haitian refugees is not a U.S. political  priority, the conditions established for these people are  completely different.    All boats taking these emigrants to U.S. territory are  intercepted and forced to return to their place of origin, even  though this might mean, according to repeated reports by Haitian  organizations, delivering them back into the repression from  which they escaped.    Tragic events such as this are repeated and, more than once,  have caused international scandals, as was the case of the  confinement of thousands of Haitians at the Guantanamo Naval  Base that is occupied by the United States in eastern Cuba.  These Haitians were detained there for months and lived in dire  conditions.    Nevertheless, on this occasion, the tragedy reached  unsuspected proportions, because the refusal to help the 35  Haitians who were trying to find haven in the United States  simply turned them into food for sharks; indeed, those who could  help them were absolutely unconcerned about this.    An eloquent depiction of the U.S. position was the desperate  attempt made by another Haitian to pass himself off as a Cuban  named Felipe Gonzalez, but the authorities discovered his true  identity and arrested him upon his arrival in U.S. territory.    Haitian protests and the tragic results of the  aforementioned  event could definitely become a powerful topic of discussion at  the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.</p>

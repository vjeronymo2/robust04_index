			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 13 April that Japan will not sign  the accord on establishment of the World Trade Organization  (WTO) at the ministerial talks of the multilateral trade  negotiations (the Uruguay Round) which are being held in  Marrakech, Morocco.    The government has decided that Japan will sign the final  agreement document of the Uruguay Round, but will not sign the  accord on the creation of the WTO out of consideration for the  ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] which is still  opposed to the opening up of the Japanese rice market and out of  the need for Japan to avoid signing the accord before the Diet  begins deliberating it for approval. The decision shows how  fragile the coalition government is.    In the case of an ordinary treaty, the government signs the  treaty and each signatory to the treaty ratifies it after  obtaining approval from the parliament. The WTO accord, made up  of 18 agreements, which is high on the agenda of the Marrakech  ministerial talks, is to follow that procedure.    The final agreement document, which Japan will sign, is  merely a piece of paper. It confirms that "the accord on the  creation of the WTO is a sum of the results of negotiations at  the Uruguay Round" and makes it mandatory for each signatory to  submit the accord to its parliament and the accord will take  effect on 1 January 1995. Therefore, Japan's refusal to sign the  accord will have no specific impact on it unless the Diet  refuses to approve it in its autumn session. Japan has attached  importance to multilateral treaties and its refusal to sign the  accord is "regrettable," (says a government source).    Like Japan, the United States will sign the final agreement  document, but will not sign the accord because the U.S.  administration has yet to obtain approval from Congress on  individual agreements including an agreement on lowering  tariffs. The European Union (EU) will sign the accord. However,  the EU member nations are feuding over which side should have  the authority to sign the accord -- the European Commission or  member nations. Their dispute is still pending in the European  Court.    Japan, the United States, and Europe have been at a loss  over  how to deal with the accord and this confusion shows that  agreements hammered out at the Uruguay Round are the outcome of  domestic compromises of each negotiating nation.</p>

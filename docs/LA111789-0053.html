			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> In a handful of watercolors and graphic works, Jeanette Pasin Sloan renders all  sorts of silver vessels -- wine goblets, bowls, platters -- with photo realist  snap. As if it weren't hard enough to coax the fragile, transparent personality  of watercolor to behave like obdurate metal, Sloan also takes on the task of  painting in the cacophony of ambient reflections picked up on vessels' shiny  surfaces.  </P> <P> In "Emergence" there's a tour de force silver pitcher across whose surface we  see the reflection of a table draped in a striped cloth and an oddly elongated  nude woman seated in a sunny room with windows bowing outward as they echo the  curvature of the pitcher. In all the works Sloan cleverly pits the perfectly  described silver containers against the distorted, fun house look of striped  fabric, furniture, and other objects mirrored on the silverware's irregular  planes.  </P> <P> The formal challenge of reflected imagery and the philosophical twist of having  reality copy itself on the face of a shiny object has tickled the fancy of  realists since Van Eyck. In Sloan's case, when the formal pyrotechnics subside  -- and this takes a while because her craft is solid -- there is little else  there to hold our interest.

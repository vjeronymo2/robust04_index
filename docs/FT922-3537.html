			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Stoy and Finnie to merge: Accountancy firm will be 10th largest STOY HAYWARD, the UK's 11th-largest accountancy firm by fee income, is to merge with Finnie &amp; Co, the 20th-largest. The new firm - to be called Stoy Hayward - will have 176 partners and directors, 1,300 professional staff and an annual fee income of more than Pounds 82m, making it the 10th-largest firm under present rankings. Mr Adrian Martin, managing partner at Stoy Hayward, said the merger was agreed for strategic reasons and did not reflect any financial weaknesses in either firm. He said Stoy Hayward had been considering ways to strengthen its network in the south-east since the mid 1980s as part of its expansion of its London office. No professional staff and only a handful of support staff would lose their jobs as a result, he said. Mr Geoff Warren, senior partner of Finnie, will become the seventh member of Stoy's management executive, and four of Finnie's partners will join the seven Stoy partners on its partnership council, which sets general principles for the firm. He said Finnie's partners decided to begin looking for a merger partner late last summer to strengthen the firm's presence outside the south-east and to provide additional expertise in some practice areas. Stoy Hayward was the only firm in which he was seriously interested, he added. Finnie's nine existing offices in the south-east will become Stoy Hayward offices, 'in association with Finnie &amp; Co', while its central London head office will move into Stoy's headquarters. Only its small branch in Beverley, Humberside, will remain an independent firm. No money will change hands as part of the deal, and negotiations over the last few months have centred on how to structure profit-sharing between the two sets of partners. Profit-sharing will continue to reflect the different contributions of the two firms until a new partnership remuneration agreement is redrafted in two years. Accountancy firms will be forbidden to audit the accounts of any companies for which they have valued brands, pension funds, property and other assets, under draft rules released yesterday by their professional bodies. The change was widely welcomed in submissions from accountancy firms and other bodies received in advance of the guidelines, issued by the chartered accountants joint ethics committee, which represents the three institutes of chartered accountants - in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Ireland. They state that a firm should not audit any material specialist valuations performed by the same firm or an associated practice, where the valuation would be incorporated into the accounts as either the firm's or the directors' valuation. Among firms likely to be affected is Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which conducted brand valuation for companies including Mirror Group Newspapers while acting as auditors. Another draft guideline issued yesterday states that firms should refuse to give a second opinion on contentious accounting issues to a company audited by another firm, unless they are in full possession of the information on the subject held by the auditor. The guidelines follow identification by the ethics committee of a number of instances of 'opinion shopping', by which companies have undermined the authority of their auditors by going elsewhere for a more sympathetic ruling.

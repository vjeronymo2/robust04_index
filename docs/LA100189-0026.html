			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> PICKS TO CLICK: With such a baseball authority so close at hand, we couldn't  resist soliciting M.C. Hammer's playoff predictions:  </P> <P> National League: I got to go with the Giants to beat the Cubs. Get the chalk  out at Candlestick for the Series. I see the Giants winning in five. They have  better hitting with that tremendous Kevin Mitchell/Will Clark one-two punch.  I'm telling you -- watch Kevin hit the Wild Thing (Cubs relief ace Mitch  Williams). He lives on fastballs inside. The Giants pitching speaks for itself.  Big Daddy (Giants starter Rick Reuschel) will be taking them to school!  </P> <P>  American League: I'm going with Oakland over Toronto in seven. I wish  Baltimore could've made it -- they were a great Cinderella team. But no one can  match Oakland's pitching. They have a super closer with Dennis Eckersley, four  starters with more than 15 wins and a middle-reliever -- Todd Burns -- who  could be a starter on anyone else's team. Then you have sluggers like Mark  McGwire and Jose Canseco -- and they even have a catcher, Terry Steinbach,  hitting .300. Add Ricky Henderson who we got in a great trade -- (Yankees owner  George) Steinbrenner is already trying to get rid of the guy he got for him --  and Oakland is awesome. The Blue Jays are tough -- but Oakland's too much for  them.  </P> <P>  The World Series: I pick Oakland over San Francisco in seven. The Giants have  their great hitters, but they don't have anyone to match Henderson's speed or  Eckersley in the bullpen. Last year, Oakland cracked under the pressure. But  this year they smell the blood. The Giants will be happy just to make it to the  Series -- they haven't been since the '60s. But the A's will only be happy if  they win it.  </P> <P> </P></p>

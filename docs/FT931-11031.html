			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rescue of Japanese property finance company in jeopardy AN AGREEMENT by leading Japanese banks to bail out Nippon Housing Loan, a troubled property finance company, is in jeopardy following a refusal by agricultural credit institutions to accept a cut in interest rates on loans to the company. Nippon Housing Loan, founded by nine commercial banks in 1971, has an estimated Y1,300bn (Dollars 10.5bn) in non-performing loans arising from the 'bubble' era of the late 1980s, when it became a leading lender to ambitious property developers. The Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance have drafted a rescue package, in conjunction with Tokyo-based commercial banks, calling on each of the banks with exposure to Nippon Housing to accept a reduction in interest payments. But the national executive of the prefectural credit federation of agricultural co-operatives said yesterday that it would not accept the proposal made by the central bank and the ministry, which expect institutions to lower rates to between 1.5 per cent and 3.25 per cent. As commercial banks became wary of lending to Nippon Housing, agricultural institutions, looking for new customers, filled the gap as the property market was turning sour. About one-third of the housing company's debt of Y2,100bn was provided by these institutions, which were apparently unaware of the risk. The involvement of politically-influential farmers' groups with Nippon Housing has made the rescue all the more awkward, as agriculture ministry officials have seriously proposed that the bail-out plan be linked to the opening of the rice market. Under that proposal, the farmers' groups would be repaid in full following an agreement to allow rice imports. It is likely that the farmers' co-ops will eventually accept a small reduction in interest payments, but the delay in reaching agreement on the rescue is frustrating larger institutions, which see the Nippon Housing case as a model for seven other housing loan companies in need of urgent restructuring. Daiwa Securities, a leading Japanese broker, said yesterday that it would support a troubled small broker, Marukin Securities, by accepting 95 per cent of a Y655m third-party share allotment. The agreement appears to set an important precedent for assistance by large Japanese securities houses to ailing small brokers, which have suffered most from the share price collapse.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (8): The showcase of Europe / A look at an extremely competitive telecoms market Britain is Europe's telecommunications showcase. Its government has pushed liberalisation and privatisation farther and faster than anywhere else on the continent. Not just in law or theory. In practice, the UK telecoms market is more competitive than any other in the EU, or arguably in the world. More than 40 operators hold govern- ment telecoms licences, and at least a dozen are currently operating services in all or part of the UK. At the national level, BT faces stiff competition from Mercury, a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless, an experienced international telecoms oper- ator. Mercury offers a nationwide service - including ISDN - to the business and residential markets. Launched a decade ago at the privatisation of British Telecommunications - then the monopoly operator - Mer- cury has won 11 per cent of the national market. Most of its custom comes from the bus- iness sector, especially in the City of London, where it has about two-thirds of outgoing long-distance traffic secured through cheaper tariff pack- ages than those offered by BT. A recent survey by Analysys, a UK consultancy, shows the UK to be cheaper than France, Germany and Italy for tele- coms for all users except residential customers and some one-line businesses, where France comes out better. The City is the focus of the most intense competition in the UK. Apart from BT and Mercury, three other operators are competing for business with dedicated networks - US operators MFS and Colt, and Videotron, a Canadian operator which also has licences to provide combined cable television and telephone services elsewhere in London. A third operator with a dedicated long-distance network - and facilities for direct connections to large City institutions - is also about to join the fray. Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid, is about to launch a network erected on the UK's long-distance electricity pylons. It is likely to engage in a price war with BT and Mercury - putting Mercury on the defensive for the first time. All of which is good news for business. As is the competition in urban areas across Britain between BT and the cable companies - mostly US-owned - building combined television and telephone networks. Over the next five years the cable companies are investing Pounds 6bn in new networks and already boast nearly 400,000 lines - 40,000 of them business lines. The cable companies claim that their ability to harness three revenue streams - telephony, television and the new world of inter-active 'multimedia' services - from one network will enable them to slash the cost of telecommunications. If so, Britain will enjoy the fruits before most of Europe, where cable networks are either undeveloped or utilised exclusively for television. However, for most telecoms users the benefits of competition and privatisation are measured in better service from BT itself. At privatisation BT had an unenviable reputation for inefficiency. Spurred on by competition, the company has made itself responsive and user-friendly to a degree unmatched across much of Europe, where state-owned monopoly operators continue to reign supreme - albeit, in most of the EU, with an obligation to open their markets to competition by 1998. However, beware of the hype. A recent benchmarking survey by the UK's Department of Trade and Industry concluded that Britain's telecoms services were, all-round 'a good second' - towards the top of the international league on most scores, but heading it on practically none. No other European country occupied a more commanding position overall, but the US was ahead on many scores. On pricing, for instance, a very different picture emerges if one looks at leased lines - essential for large businesses constructing their own national or international 'virtual private networks' - rather than public network charges. For leased lines, while the benchmarking survey found the cost of similar high-capacity leased lines markedly lower in Britain than in most of continental Europe, the prices were far lower in the US than in Britain. Reuters, which has the largest private telecoms network in the world, claims that it would save 90 per cent of its outgoings for leased lines in Europe if the equivalent network were in the US. As the DTI notes, 'such high costs not only increase the costs for business, they also suppress business activity by making it uneconomic to offer certain types of service or to carry out some business activities.' There is another moral. Britain may be an island, but its competitive position in telecoms depends critically on high-quality services and low tariffs across its continent. Services are improving and tariffs falling - but overall, Europe lags behind the US on both scores. However, on the same regional dimension Europe is well ahead of Asia-Pacific  -the other great regional magnet for relocating companies - where a few islands of first-world telecoms subsist in a sea of inefficiency and antiquated networks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 26 -- The cabinet Socio-Political  Committee (KSPRM) decided Thursday that settlements of the  trilateral commission for socio-economic issues would receive a  fast legislative track treatment as matters of priority.  Thursday's KSPRM meeting discussed the outcome of negotiations  conducted within the trilateral commission and in six teams  which are working out an agreement on social guarantees.    The committees secretary Grzegorz Rydlewski told journalists  after the meeting that similar treatment would be given to  questions ensuing from government-trade unions negotiations on  social guarantees.    Head of the trilateral commission, Deputy Labour Minister  Andrzej Baczkowski emphasized that the commission is not only a  negotiating but also decision making organ. He also stressed  that the commission examines all pressing demands put forward by  the solidarity trade union which does not mean, however, that  all of them would be satisfied.    Baczkowski confirmed that the government would not carry out  bilateral negotiations with solidarity terming that form of  talks as anachronistic.    Rydlewski added that the trilateral commission, grouping  representatives of the government, trade unions and employers  organizations, was a good instrument for solving unions demands.  The next meeting of the trilateral commission will be held on  June 6.</p>

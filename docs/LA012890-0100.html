			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DUMBTH' ARTICLE HITS CLOSE TO HOME  </P> <P> In "Dumbth," (Times, Jan. 21) Steve Allen updates us on the demise of American  smarts. I'm sure that we can all find examples in our daily lives of this  serious and embarrassing cultural problem.  </P> <P> The other night in a Westwood bar I was chatting with a professional woman in  the financial field. It was just days after the U.S. intervention in Panama,  and I asked her if she was disturbed by the invasion.  </P> <P> She said yes, but then went on to say that she was more bothered by the fact  that Noriega had been sending the letter bombs to the judges in Florida  (confusing the situation with a completely unrelated story in Alabama). She  must have had an extra drink when she read the newspapers.  </P> <P> And a UCLA journalism classmate, who happens to be from Switzerland, told me  this week that she went shopping at Bullocks recently. She paid with her credit  card from a Swiss bank. "Switzerland?" asked the teller, "what state is that  in?"  </P> <P> In a country that can produce the best basketball players in the world, put a  TV in every home and put people into space, can't we do better in educating  ourselves about the world?  </P> <P> If not, what are we doing in Panama, anyway?  </P> <P> Or Florida, for that matter! And that's one I can't answer myself.  </P> <P> ANDREW LIBERMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

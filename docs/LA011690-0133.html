			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASK DR. RUTH: THERAPY ISN'T REQUIRED FOR ENJOYING A TERRIFIC SEX LIFE  </P> <P> Question: I am very much in love with my husband, and every once in a while we  have a wild time making love. I mean one that is thoroughly satisfying to me --  and if it doesn't "make the Earth move" then it certainly does something at  least that big. I feel that all the great things I ever heard about sex have  come true. But it is not regular, and I feel that I may not actually be able to  climax every time.  </P> <P> I think he has to learn how to romanticize or be more sensual, move at a  slower, more tantalizing pace. Where do I get this sex counseling or therapy  you talk about? How much does it cost?  </P> <P> Answer: Where and how much and what goes on in the therapist's office is  information you can get from a local sexuality clinic or by phoning a sex  therapist. You just have to prepare yourself to ask this professional the  questions that people ask her or him all the time. Answering them sensibly is  part of the therapist's job.  </P> <P> The counseling or therapy ranges from free clinic sessions to what you arrange  with the therapist. Some therapists charge a flat rate for the first  exploratory session and then discuss fees for subsequent sessions. That is for  private sessions, not clinic work.  </P> <P> The most important thing to know is that what goes on in the therapist's office  is all talk. Nothing sexual happens there. Every now and then I print this  address for people who want information on sex therapists or names or telephone  numbers in their area: Write to the American Assn. of Sex Educators, Counselors  and Therapists, 11 Dupont Circle NW, Suite 220, Washington D.C. 20036 and ask  for information or for a list of accredited psychosexual therapists near you.  </P> <P> However, I am not sure you need to go to a sex therapist at all. If it would be  convenient for you in all ways, it might be a first call for information, but I  think you need more general information before even thinking of a therapist.  For instance, you should know -- and you will get this from reading a reliable  sex manual -- that in a normal sex life the orgasms, or climaxes, are not  uniformly magnificent.  </P> <P> Some are nice, some are negligible, some are great -- think of other gratifying  experiences in life.  </P> <P> If you want to improve your own sexual functioning, you have to know more about  your own sexual responsiveness and you have to be responsible for it. It's not  fair to expect your husband to know all that about you when you don't know it  yourself.  </P> <P> The idea that the man must be the guide and teacher in great sexual sharing is  much out of date. It had this good point -- it preached that men were  responsible for playing a wooing and helpful part in pleasing their women and  that good sex did not consist of reaching ejaculation as soon as possible.  </P></p>

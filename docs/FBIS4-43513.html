			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Lower House President Rita  Suessmuth and her Russian counterpart Ivan Rybkin have advocated  greater cooperation between the two parliaments. Rybkin  emphasized in Bonn today that the industrial-cultural exchanges  are to be stepped up. The Russian parliamentary president, who  had also met Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Federal  President Richard von Weizsaecker, reviewed his talks  positively. He emphasized: "We Russians and Germans cannot live  without one another."    Kohl paid tribute to Rybkin's conciliatory role in Russian  politics. At the same time, the chancellor underlined Germany's  "vital interest" in the continuation of the democratic and  economic reform process in Russia on the basis of stable  framework conditions, government spokesman Dieter Vogel said.  He also said that the politicians agreed "that bilateral  relations are free of fundamental and insoluble problems." In  the interest of the two countries and of the whole of Europe  this positive starting position should be put to use and  developed further.</p>

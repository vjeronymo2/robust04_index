			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the invitation of Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov, Jacques Poos, deputy prime minister and minister of  foreign affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, arrived in  Bulgaria today. This is how he summarized his intentions for  tomorrow's talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Council  of Ministers, and the National Assembly:    [Begin Poos recording, in French fading into Bulgarian  translation] This is a working visit related to our bilateral  relations. However, I have also come to Bulgaria in my capacity  as acting chairman of the Western European Union. We will also  discuss issues of European security. In response to our  question whether the issue of violating the embargo along the  Danube River will be discussed, Mr. Poos said that this is not  the basic goal of his visit, but the issue will be discussed  anyway. Nevertheless, we do not consider Bulgaria responsible  for the recent incidents, he stressed.    The guest said that at the last meeting of the Western  European Union in Luxembourg on the ministerial level, it was  decided to grant Bulgaria an enhanced status, which will  practically make it an associated member of the Western European  Union.    Mr. Poos will also be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev  tomorrow.</p>

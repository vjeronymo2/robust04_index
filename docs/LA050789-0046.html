			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON GAYS, THE POLICE FORCE, PUBLIC SERVICE  </P> <P> Congratulations on the thoughtful and moving profile by Bob Sipchen on gay  ex-LAPD officer Mitchell Grobeson ("A Gay Officer's Lonely Patrol," April 28).  Mitch's accomplishments and great personal courage are inspiring, and the  inexcusable abuse he suffered from fellow officers because he is gay is deeply  disturbing.  </P> <P> Thousands of patriotic lesbians and gay men serve in our armed forces, and many  other dedicated lesbian and gay public servants are included in the ranks of  our local police forces. Thanks to the bigotry that still rules in this  country, most of these courageous individuals are forced, like Mitch was, to  hide their lesbian and gay identity from those around them.  </P> <P> That is the personal toll bigotry exacts on our lives. It is society as a whole  that suffers, however, when bigots are permitted to force people of  accomplishment like Mitch out of positions of community service. Hopefully,  through the airing of stories like this in the mainstream press, we can begin  to overcome the pernicious effects of homophobia on individuals and society at  large.  </P> <P> RICHARD JENNINGS  </P> <P> Chair, Response Committee  </P> <P> Gay and Lesbian Alliance  </P> <P> Against Defamation, Los Angeles  </P></p>

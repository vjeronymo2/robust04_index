			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Norgeskreditt plans move into banking NORGESKREDITT, the Norwegian private sector mortgage company, yesterday announced plans to become a commercial bank, following recent approval for the move by the finance ministry. The company said it would seek backing for the proposal at its annual general meeting scheduled for April 1. Norgeskreditt said bank status would give it access to the domestic retail market which would constitute an important supplement to financing from the bond market, and thereby contribute to stability in its funding situation. 'Access to the deposit market, the ability to borrow from the central bank and membership of the banks' traditional safety net are also anticipated to have a positive effect for (the group's) bondholders,' Norgeskreditt said. Norgeskreditt's assets dipped to NKr19.7bn (Dollars 2.8bn) at the end of December from NKr21.3bn a year earlier. The company strengthened significantly its capital base through a NKr750m share issue in 1992, when it converted to a limited company. In addition, NKr384m of repayable contributions by foundation members was converted into share capital to boost total capital to NKr1.53bn. Norgeskreditt's preference shares have been trading on the Olso bourse since last July. It said approximately 30 per cent of the preference share capital had changed hands since the listing, and that about 11.6 per cent of its total share capital is held by foreign investors. Separately, the company announced it had returned to the black with net profits of NKr679.7m in 1992 from losses of NKr16.9m in the previous year. The turnround was helped by extraordinary income of NKr575.5m, gained from a change in rules for loan loss provisions allowing these provisions to be booked on profit and loss accounts. Profits before extraordinary items rose to NKr131.3m from NKr100.5m, helped by a rise to NKr267.6m in net interest income from NKr242.3m and a reduction in securities losses to NKr33.8m from NKr57.9m. Credit losses, however, rose to NKr66.4m from NKr51.3m in 1991. The company said that last year it repossessed commercial property with a book value of NKr34.3m, and that these assets provide a net yield of 8.9 annually. Norgeskreditt had a capital adequacy of 14.2 per cent of risk-weighted assets according to Bank for International Settlements rules.</p>

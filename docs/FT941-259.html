			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (16): Forward from rebellion - Punjab's industrial hub As the prosperous northern state of Punjab limps back to normalcy after 10 years of armed insurgency, industrialists are doubly relieved. They can go about their work without fear of the gun, and run three shifts in their factories, which had ceased full production after the trouble started a decade ago. And they can concentrate on greatly expanding their businesses as they experience the benefits of the dismantling of the country's licence raj. Within two weeks of the Union budget statement by Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister and the main architect of India's reforms programme, industry was upbeat in Ludhiana, Punjab's industrial hub. The effects of decontrol are apparent at the Focal Point industrial estate, where more than 10,000 factories within a 12km radius are engaged in the manufacture of steel, machine tools, heavy engineering goods, hosiery, textiles, and sewing machine parts. Mr Raj Kumar Sharma, exports manager in the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation, a state government body to encourage industrial growth, says that the return of normalcy has prompted many more units to apply to set up businesses in Ludhiana. The effects of the government's incentives to exporters have percolated to businesses here, he says. Mr Jagdish Rai Singal, managing director at Eastman Industries, runs one of the most successful businesses at the industrial estate. He is happy that he no longer needs to visit New Delhi, the capital, to spend endless hours knocking at the doors of bureaucrats, while his business is neglected in Ludhiana. Mr Singal's company is among the country's seven leading exporters of engineering goods, shipping Dollars 25m worth of engineering and light engineering goods a year, with a range of products including bicycles and bicycle and moped components, handtools, forgings and fasteners, entirely for exports. Like other units in the engineering industry, Eastman experienced the first benefits of economic reform with the de-control of steel in 1991. 'Steel was regularly available to back-up units, and our supporting manufacturers as well, which is a major benefit of reform,' says Mr Singal. 'The climate is just right for the expansion of industry,' says Mr Jagat Singh, managing director of GS Auto International, manufacturer of automotive chassis suspension components and radiators. Mr Singh's collaborators include Llanelli Radiators of the UK and Nissan of Japan. 'Finance is easy to obtain, and the import of raw materials has never been simpler,' he says. 'Fuels like high speed diesel and liquefied petroleum gas are easily available, and there is no waste of time obtaining the few permissions that are still required from the government.' Mr Brijmohan Lall, chairman of Hero Cycles Limited, and past president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, says: 'We used to waste a great deal of time and energy trying to get things done in New Delhi, deputing very senior people to do it.' 'The licence and inspector raj is practically finished and the reforms have brought a lot of economy in our day-to-day functioning', says the head of the world's largest bicycle factory, on Ludhiana's main road, minutes away from the Focal Point estate. 'Earlier, we used to have to run around for days before the most junior official of the Steel Authority gave us some steel. Now we have senior personnel calling on us, wanting to make the raw material available to us on a regular basis.' Erratic supply and broken deadlines as a result of a delay in clearances are also a thing of the past. Hero is in the process of setting up a steel mill, and all it has to do is acquire the land, import equipment, and commence manufacturing. 'Our equipment suppliers have started trusting us when we say we will remit money to him, and once we settle on a price he knows I will import it and not pull out at the last minute because the government did not grant permission.' A major advantage of reform is that permissions required from the Reserve Bank of India have almost completely been abolished, with the simplification of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) rules. Exporters and other foreign exchange earners have been permitted to retain 25 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings in foreign currency, and 100 per cent export-oriented units and units in export-processing zones can keep 50 per cent. 'Our agents abroad were never sure that their commissions got to them in time, or at all, and the new rules have made both agents and customers quite happy,' says Mr Singal. Pricing quotations have become simpler, because the exporters do not have to take 'incentive money' or bribes to officials into account when quoting their prices. 'Our costing used to be different from week to week, because of erratic supply, but that has stabilised now,' says Mr Lall. 'When in the past we had to chase even the smallest bank loan, the availability of finance has increased dramatically, and there is not a day when some financial institution does not approach us with offers of funds.' 'Exporters have access to finance for exports at a 6.5 per cent interest rate which is a very positive feature for keeping you competitive,' adds Mr Singal. The complexities of export notifications have been disbanded to a great extent, with value-based advance licensing available for most items except a few on the negative list for reasons of security or protection of the environment. 'The few licences that are needed take a shorter time to get than ever before,' says Mr Singal. Inter-nodal transportation is to be introduced soon, which will allow a clearing agent registered with the Ministry of Commerce to issue bills for loading the ship, thus saving time and paperwork with the ministry. The Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme for importing equipment at a concessional rate of duty has also been very effective. Other industrialists in the Focal Point estate agree that there is an attitudinal change in the bureaucracy. 'But some snags persist at the lower levels, because old habits die hard,' claims Mr Harbhajan Singh, who run a small handtools business in the area. 'But the overall attitudinal change for the better is reflected in the fact that more foreigners are keen to do business with India, with a greater awareness than ever before of its changing image.' 'The slow pace of our reforms gets accentuated when they are compared to reforms in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia,' says Mr Singal. 'We may be on the same route but are nowhere near them in terms of speed or efficiency.'</p>

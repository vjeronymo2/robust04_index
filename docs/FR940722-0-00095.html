			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. First, we will structure our attribution rules to allow those extremely large companies that may not bid on blocks C and F to invest in entities that bid on those blocks. More specifically, we will allow the relatively small companies eligible to bid in these blocks to obtain investment representing up to 75 percent of their passive equity from larger companies so long as each investor holds no more than a 25 percent passive equity interest. In addition, eligible businesses owned by minorities and women may choose to have a single investor, no matter how large, hold a passive equity interest up to 49.9 percent. These rules, and others that we establish in this Order, are designed to enhance access to capital by businesses owned by minorities and women. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Second, to encourage large companies to invest in designated entities and to assist designated entities without large investors to overcome the additional hurdle presented by auctions, we will make bidding credits available to designated entities. More specifically, small businesses will receive a 10 percent bidding credit (or a 10 percent discount on their winning bids). Businesses owned by minorities and women will receive a 15 percent bidding credit to compensate for the substantial problems they face in attracting capital. The credits will be cumulative, so that a business owned by minorities or women that also qualifies as a small business will receive a 25 percent bidding credit. Under these rules, it still will be more expensive for designated entities to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services than it was before Congress granted us authority to hold auctions, because they will have to purchase licenses. But by adopting bidding credits, which are explicitly authorized by Section 309(j)(4)(D), the Commission seeks to promote economic opportunity and to counterbalance the tendency of auctions to concentrate license ownership in the hands of several very large companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Third, we will allow most successful bidders within the entrepreneurs' blocks to pay for their licenses in installments for generally the same reasons_encouraging large companies to invest in designated entities, promoting economic opportunity by assisting designated entities in overcoming the additional hurdle presented by auctions, and ensuring that licenses are disseminated widely. In general, successful bidders will be permitted to defer payments of principal on their debt to the government for some period. Small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women will be permitted to defer payments of principal for a longer period than other successful bidders in these blocks. Finally, businesses owned by minorities and women will be charged a lower interest rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Fourth, we will extend our tax certificate policies to promote participation by minorities and women in the provision of broadband PCS. The holder of a tax certificate is permitted to defer payment of the capital gains tax that would otherwise be recognized upon the sale of an investment. Our extension of the tax certificate policy to broadband PCS will promote involvement by minorities and women in spectrum-based services in three ways. First, initial investors in such businesses will be eligible for tax certificates upon the sale of their investments. We expect that the availability of such favorable tax treatment will enable minority- and women-owned businesses to attract investors more easily. Second, holders of broadband PCS licenses will be able to obtain tax certificates upon the sale of the business to a company controlled by minorities and women. Third, a cellular operator that sells its interest in an overlapping cellular system to a minority- or woman-owned business to come into compliance with our PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule will be eligible for a tax certificate. Both the second and third policy will further Congress' objective of ensuring that spectrum licenses are disseminated widely and, in particular, to designated entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Finally, we will reduce the upfront payment for all bidders in the entrepreneurs' block. Bidders in the other blocks will pay $0.02 per MHz per pop while winners in the entrepreneurs' blocks will receive a 25 percent discount and pay only $0.015 per MHz per pop as a pre-auction payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Congress was also concerned that rural areas not go unserved by PCS, and therefore directed us to ensure participation in auctions for spectrum-based services by rural telephone companies who have a history of service to rural areas and an established infrastructure on which to build a PCS business effectively. Thus, we establish partitioning rules in this Order that will allow them to use their existing wireline network to efficiently and expeditiously provide PCS in rural areas. In addition, most rural telephone companies will qualify to bid on the entrepreneurs' blocks, and hence will be eligible for installment payments. Those rural telephone companies that qualify as small or minority- or women-owned businesses will also be able to take advantage of the applicable bidding credits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. The rules that we adopt today are designed to ensure that only  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> designated entities qualify for the special provisions established to ensure their participation in broadband PCS. The rules are designed to enable designated entities to attract passive equity from non-designated entities, provided that designated entities maintain control and a substantial entity stake in the ventures at all times. The Commission will not tolerate ``fronts'' that are controlled by supposedly passive investors, and we will be vigilant in preventing abuse of the designated entity provisions. Our rules are also designed to prevent designated entities from assigning licenses obtained through the use of these special measures or who otherwise lose their designated entity status before the end of a required five-year holding period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

By so doing, the government intends to prepare for the  possibility that the North Korean nuclear issue will be  presented to the UN Security Council when the nuclear  negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic  Energy Agency fail. The government has comprehensively analyzed  North Korea's status of the accumulation of military materiel  and other indications by using the intelligence capabilities of  the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command.    A high-ranking government official said: "Even though major  military facilities of North Korea have been reportedly built  underground, the Combined Forces Command's intelligence  capabilities can fully detect them." He also said: "Still, the  government will further beef up this list and strengthen its  intelligence capabilities against North Korea."</p>

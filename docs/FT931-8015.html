			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Milan shows no mercy on kickbacks: There is an overwhelming cry for political change AS ITALY braces for more arrests and resignations in the corruption scandal rocking the country, the consensus in Milan is that all should be brought into the open. 'It's a scandal when the judges keep silent, not when they start putting politicians away,' says Mr Luigi Cavallini, director of a machine tool importing company. 'The corruption affair may be hurting our image abroad. But it's only in really corrupt countries that the politicians don't go to jail. People should be pleased this is happening.' The corruption probe, which began in Milan and spread nationwide, triggered last week's ministerial resignations and yesterday's cabinet reshuffle. The decision by a parliamentary committee to lift the immunity of Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former health minister, and rumours about the possible involvement of Mr Giovanni Goria, the former finance minister, prompted both to resign on Friday. Many people in Milan share the view that the investigations into political kickbacks should go on, irrespective of the impact on Italy's standing abroad or the value of the lira, which plummeted to L957 against the D-Mark late on Friday. At Mr Cesare Sbravati's barber's shop, talk of an amnesty for corrupt politicians is instantly dismissed by Saturday afternoon customers. Mr Sbravati, born in Mantua but busy cutting hair in the same small shop for more than 30 years, is convinced the judges should carry on. 'It's only thanks to them that things have come to the surface. Otherwise, the politicians wouldn't have done anything,' he says. Mr Alberto Pirovano, waiting for his haircut, agrees. 'We're only halfway there. If the judges stop now, the politicians will bury everything.' There is little sympathy for those who have traipsed into Milan's antiquated San Vittore prison, a first stop for many of the politicians and businessmen arrested so far. 'They should be made to give back what they've stolen, right up to the last penny,' shouts Mr Sbravati's wife from behind the curtain dividing the shop from their sitting room. The customers are more moderate. They probably appreciate the near-impossibility of tracing the billions of lire which have flowed into private pockets and party coffers though kickbacks on inflated public-works contracts. But they at least want new laws banning all those implicated in corruption from holding elected office again and requiring them to repay what money can be traced. The vitriol is reserved for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former leader of the discredited Socialist party, whose power base was Milan. The Socialists 'have no future in Milan', says Mr Ambrogio Invitti, waiting his turn in the barber's chair. But Mr Cavallini, an avowed right-winger who castigates Italy's governments for pumping money into fruitless ventures, usually in the economically-depressed south, gives prime minister Giuliano Amato some credit. 'Every political system in transition has people of the ancien regime alongside the new. At least this government seems to be made up of serious-minded people, unlike the last two years of the former Andreotti government, which paved the way for the damnation of this country.' The overwhelming mood in Milan is that the political system has to change, amid some uncertainty and caution as to how that should be done. With Italy's budget deficit still growing, such steps are likely to involve further unpopular public spending cuts, hitting social security in particular. They are likely to be least popular in southern Italy, where support for established political parties has proved much more resilient than in the north. 'What should I do?' asks Mrs Pierrina Fusco, a pensioner from the southern region of Appulia, who has been working in Milan for the past 30 years. 'Everything's become more expensive. Now I'm going to have to pay for the medicines that used to be free. Tell me what to do. I'll vote for whoever you say.'</p>

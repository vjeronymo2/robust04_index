			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Shameless Talk About 'Patriotism'" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyonyang, May 4 (KCNA) - The traitor Kim Yong-sam  showed up at the Hyonchung shrine [shrine to General Yi Sun-sin]  in Asan, South Chungchong Province, South Korea, some time ago  and talked as if he were practising something, succeeding to the  "patriotism" and "self-sacrificing spirit" of Yi Sun-sin, a  famous general who performed feats in repulsing Japanese  aggression at the end of the 16th century.    NODONG SINMUN today brands his mishmash as an intolerable  insult to and a mockery of the patriotic spirit of the  forerunners.    The news analyst says:    For his treacherous crimes, the traitor Kim Yong-sam has  long  since been disqualified from visiting the Hyonchung shrine or  talking about Yi Sun-sin's patriotism and self-sacrificing  spirit.    The crimes committed by the traitor against the people, the  country and the nation over the last one year or more since his  inauguration are beyond description and are indelible any time.  Although he talked about some forthcoming "changes" what he will  bring about is nothing but national disaster such as deepening  of dependence on the United States and Japan and nuclear scourge.    Patriotism and treachery are incompatible.    Although Kim Yong-sam tries to lull the growing complaints  of  the South Korean people against the "civilian" rule with the  mask of "patriotism" it is a mistake.    The South Korean people will never pardon the Kim Yong-sam  clique which is engaged in treacheries while indiscreetly  insulting the patriotic spirit of the forerunners.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Fed lifts short-term rates to stem inflation pressure: Discount rate up half a point; US bonds and stocks rally;Banks increase loan costs The US Federal Reserve yesterday lifted short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year, adding half a percentage point in an effort to head off inflation rises. After a morning meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy, the Fed announced that it was increasing the discount rate which it charges on money lent to the banking system to 4 per cent from 3.5 per cent. The Fed is also raising the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight balances, to 4.75 per cent from 4.25 per cent. Although an increase in rates had been widely expected, investors and dealers were unsure whether the Fed would raise rates by a quarter of a point or make the sharper adjustment that came yesterday. On Wall Street, the news triggered a surge in bond prices and brought solid gains to stocks. The markets had stumbled briefly in the minutes after the Fed's announcement, but quickly picked up forward momentum during the afternoon. Chase Manhattan raised its prime lending rate for its best business customers to 7.75 per cent from 7.25 per cent in the wake of the Fed move and other banks followed suit. White House officials have repeatedly said that they see no signs of inflation rises that would require a tightening of monetary policy, but add that the Fed is independent. 'Given the strong gains in output and employment so far this year, we need to be watchful for signs of developing price pressures,' Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, and Ms Laura Tyson, White House chief economist, said in a joint statement yesterday. Democratic senators, however, were less sparing in their criticism. 'If you're bored down there at the Fed, if a rosy economic outlook makes you blue, get out of town, take a vacation, do any thing, but just don't raise those interest rates,' Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said before the Fed move. Fed officials note that they kept interest rates very low to try to boost sluggish recovery in 1992 and 1993. 'In fact, real short term rates - that is, adjusted for inflation - were around zero levels throughout last year,' Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, said last week. Most recent economic data have suggested that the economy has slowed considerably, and is growing at a much steadier pace than the 3.7 per cent annualised rate of the second quarter. However, July's employment statistics showed that job creation remained strong, and the producer price index, published last Thursday, showed a 0.5 per cent bounce in wholesale prices last month. Fed officials say that policy actions only show their effects about one-and-a-half to two years later, and that they cannot be deterred by the apparently calm inflation indices. Some Fed economists argue that full employment is now reached when the unemployment rate stands at around 6 per cent - very close to its current level. Any further drop in unemployment, they say, could lead to shortages of labour and be expected to provoke an acceleration in the inflation rate. After the early pause, prices on longer-dated Treasury bonds climbed nearly 1 1/2 points on the rate rise, even though most analysts had anticipated the Fed's course of action. Traders appeared reassured by the apparent resolve of the Fed's chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, to snuff out inflationary pressures. In the equity markets, the rate rise triggered a brief rally, but in minutes a 20-point gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average was converted into a 15-point loss. By the close, however, it was up 24.28 at 3,784.57. In Tokyo today, stocks opened firmer. The Bundesbank, which has a policy meeting tomorrow, is expected to let the dust settle after the Fed move. Economists see scope for a German discount rate cut, but believe the bank's 'steady hand' policy will prevail.

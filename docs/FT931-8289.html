			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (3): The lean, mean survivors - A price war epidemic PERSONAL computer price wars have broken out across Europe. During the second half of 1992, the large established groups, such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and IBM of the US and ICL of the UK, admitted PCs had become commodity products. The branded companies decided to take on the clone manufacturers at their own game. Prices were slashed and low-price models launched. In the UK, average prices for PCs using the 386SX chip fell nearly 30 per cent from Pounds 2,074 to Pounds 1,479 between 1991 and 1992, according to Context, the London-based market research company. The situation is still deteriorating - at least for manufacturers, if not consumers. Mr Bruce Sinclair, vice-president of Northern Europe for Dell Computer, reckons the price of a 386 workstation has fallen by 50 per cent to about Pounds 1,000 over the last 12 months, depending on configuration. Infocorp Europe, the Paris-based market research group, expects prices to fall 15 to 20 per cent during the first half of 1993. Compaq led the way with the launch of its ProLinea PC range and its Contura notebook computers. IBM followed with its ValuePoint range, as did Hewlett-Packard. The initial success of low-priced branded products surprised even the companies involved. Both Compaq and IBM were left with product shortages. At the end of the year, Compaq still had two months of back orders to fill. However, Ms Marye Tonnaire, industry analyst at Dataquest in Paris, says once these early problems began to be overcome in the last quarter of last year, the floodgates opened and prices tumbled even faster. The price has driven volume growth. Dataquest estimates the European market will have increased by 11 per cent last year, a reversal of the previous four years which witnessed slowing growth rates. Meanwhile, so-called no-name manufacturers such as Vobis in Germany and Elonex in the UK have continued to do well. In Europe, they increased their share of the market from 8.1 per cent to 9.1 per cent, according to Infocorp. The switch for most of the groups from high-technology high-price companies to high-technology low-price distribution has created an enormous culture change. The price cuts have squeezed margins for the PC manufacturers. Put simply, they launched cost-cutting initiatives. Dell Computer, for example, launched a cost-containment drive during the second half of last year called 'Cost-busters'. 'Anything that did not add value was cut,' says Mr Bruce Sinclair at Dell Computer. 'Through the programme we reduced operating expenses from 20 per cent of sales to 16 per cent of sales. Meanwhile we were doubling the number of worldwide employees.' Measures taken at Dell included changing the car policy so that not all managers automatically had cars. Pay policies were changed so that the salaries of 40 per cent of the workforce were linked to performance. During the third quarter, salaries were frozen and employees offered 50 share options instead. Distribution costs are also being slashed. Dell Computer has always sought to minimise its distribution costs through direct selling. The company reckons 90 per cent of its European sales are through internal channels. It has also rationalised its logistics by centralising warehousing at Limerick in Ireland, where its new plant is capable of configuring computers for European local markets. This cuts down inventory in local markets. 'What is so encouraging about the last 12 months is that it shows the established PC manufacturers are capable of change. They have become lean and mean,' says Ms Tonnaire at Dataquest. Meanwhile, European retailers are also having to adapt to the price wars. The squeeze on margins sent at least 20 per cent of computer dealers out of business last year. Warehouse-style superstores are being set up in the UK in an effort to emulate US practices. Whether these superstores are successful remains to be seen. Costs such as real estate and labour in Europe are equivalent to 20 per cent of turnover compared with 8 per cent in the US. As one PC manufacturer points out, costs in Sweden are rather different than in Austin, Texas. The full impact of the price wars on the structure of the industry is yet to be determined, according to Dataquest. But some winners have emerged. Compaq's share of the European market increased from 6.4 per cent to 8.5 per cent between 1991 and 1992, according to Infocorp Europe. Hewlett-Packard also improved from 1.7 to 2.4 per cent: it shipped as many PCs in the last four months of 1992 as it did during the previous eight. Meanwhile Dell's market share rose from 1.1 to 1.7 per cent. ICL, thanks to its acquisition of Scandinavia's Nokia Data, rose from 1.8 to 2.8 per cent. Vobis of Germany almost doubled its market share from 2.8 to 4.5 per cent. Olivetti of Italy fell from 6.6 to 6.4 per cent and ZDS of France dropped from 3.2 to 2.7 per cent. Toshiba, the specialist portable computer group, had a tough year, but maintained its market leadership, although Compaq is fast catching it up. Infocorp Europe predicts the PC market will be polarised between the large groups, capable of pushing down production costs through efficient purchasing and economies of scale, while spreading marketing and distribution costs over very large volumes. Small groups will continue to maintain some competitive advantage, given their proximity to clients and their flexibility and high service levels. It expects that many groups in the middle ground will find it difficult to survive. The companies that succeed will be those with a wide product mix that allows them to address different vertical markets, says Ms Tonnaire at Dataquest. Those that survive will also have to get their prices right and sort out their logistics effectively. 'There will undoubtedly be a shake-out during 1993. Some companies will not exist by the end of the year,' she says.  ---------------------------------------------------       PERSONAL COMPUTER EUROPEAN MARKET SHARES*  ---------------------------------------------------                                 1992         1992                                    %            %  --------------------------------------------------- IBM                             15.6         13.5 Apple                            7.9          8.5 Compaq                           6.4          8.5 Olivetti                         6.6          6.4 Vobis                            2.8          4.5 ICL                              1.8          2.8 ZDS                              3.2          2.7 Toshiba                          3.3          2.6 HP                               1.7          2.4 Dell                             1.1          1.7 Siemens                          1.8          1.6 No name                          8.1          9.5  --------------------------------------------------- * All MS DOS/Windows and Apple models  --------------------------------------------------- Source: InfoCorp Europe, January 1993  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / PM plays nationalist card in Euro campaign Vote Conservative if you want to preserve British jobs and British sovereignty. That was the message Mr John Major gave the voters of Bristol last night. The prime minister used his first mass rally of the European election campaign to tell a hand-picked audience of 600 Tory activists in this affluent but recession-touched south-western city that Conservative policies would produce 'a strong Britain in a strong Europe'. This was quite different from the federal European superstate that the 'Liberals' and 'socialists' wanted to see. 'A Labour or Liberal vote would be a vote for a weak Britain in a federal European superstate,' Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, told the faithful while they awaited the arrival of the man of 'principle' and 'integrity' they had come to see. The two men were preaching to the converted, although the standing ovation the prime minister's speech generated was polite rather than ecstatic. The verdict was that Mr Major's pragmatic vision had struck a good balance between underlining the importance of Britain's relationship with Europe and standing up for its interests. 'I thought he outlined a good vision of Europe from the British point of view: we don't want to lose our sovereignty but we cannot afford to be isolationist,' said Ms Ann Armstrong, a local party worker. Mr Geoff Gollop, another Tory activist, said: 'John Major's points on the fact that we can be European and British are just so important; I believe he epitomises that view.' The only discordant note was struck by a small bunch of demonstrators brandishing a sign saying 'Honk if you hate Major' in the street outside. The majority of drivers duly obliged. The west country is a vital electoral battleground. From Doone country to Hardy country, Tory incumbents are under threat from Liberal Democrats on a roll after their local election successes. The Tory party must prevent this rebellion from spreading too far east if it is to stave off its second electoral embarrassment in two months. Much of what Mr Major said - and his catchiest slogans  - were aimed at the Liberal Democrats. 'Think before voting Liberal,' he urged his audience. 'And if you think before voting Liberal, you will find it unthinkable to vote Liberal.' When he appeared on the stage, serenaded by his familiar Purcell theme tune, Mr Major was in relaxed mood, pledging not to resort to party political slogans. But it was not long before he played the nationalist card, arguing it was essential that Britain retained its veto in the European Council of Ministers if it was not to lose all manner of things, including an independent foreign policy and its own rules on immigration. He devoted a long passage to the need to open markets and cut red tape in order to tackle unemployment. To seek to regulate was folly. Europeans were unable to find jobs 'precisely because of bureaucracy'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The manifestos: three pitches on Europe  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CONSERVATIVE  It is for nations to build Europe, not for Europe to supercede nations.  Retain Britain's veto on issues of vital national interest  Keep for Westminster parliament the right to decide on a single currency.  Firmly opposed to the social chapter  A wider Europe, open to new members, free of trade barriers.  Common Agricultural Policy needs to be simplified, made more responsive to the market and less bureaucratic.  Defence effort fully compatible with Nato - not an alternative to it.  Maastricht - any successor treaty will need to build on its decentralised model for Europe.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LABOUR  Commitment to an integrated and co-operative Europe  UK veto to be retained on defence, fiscal, foreign, constitutional matters  Fixed adjustable exchange rates to be set after economic convergence  Social chapter to be accepted, but no compulsory 35-hour week  Enlargement to include all democratic European states 'Wasteful' Common Agricultural Policy to be reformed  Enforcement powers sought for for European Environment Agency  Pan-European legislation against racial discrimination to be promoted  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LIBERAL DEMOCRAT  Aiming for a democratic, decentralised, federal Europe  Reform of EU institutions, including voting system in Council  Moves towards a single currency 'in step' with other member states  'Popular assent' would be sought for future fundamental changes  Independent European central bank to be set up  Energy tax to be imposed to encourage conservation  European Environment Agency to be granted stronger powers  Pan-European rules on immigration and asylum  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

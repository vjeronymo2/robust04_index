			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Airlines loop the loop Investing in airlines has long been a matter of hope deferred. Last week's flurry in airline shares on both sides of the Atlantic suggests investors are looking on the bright side once again. The US carriers responded to good traffic figures and news that President Bill Clinton was establishing a commission to investigate the industry's difficulties. The simplest solution may be to change Chapter 11 administration procedures, allowing the weakest carriers to go truly bust and removing surplus capacity. But that would hardly be politically correct. Some re-regulation and increasing toughness with foreign governments during forthcoming bilateral aviation talks appear the easier options. Such aggression would unsettle state-cossetted European airlines - although both BA and KLM would benefit from any general market liberalisation. The commission may simply conclude that the best strategy is to let market forces run their course. Like many other capital-intensive industries, airlines accentuate their plight by adding too much capacity at the top of the cycle and investing too little in recession. With the growth rate of airline fleets slowing sharply and passenger demand set to rebound over the next few years, there should soon be a big upswing in airlines' profitability. The trouble is it may not arrive until 1995. It is too early for investors to buy for that recovery.</p>

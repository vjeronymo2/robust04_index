			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (14): A bucket, a vehicle and a sketch pad - VME, Brussels based builder of loaders, was formed in 1985 by Swedish Volvo and US Clark Equipment. It has come a long way / Construction Equipment II: VME A stroll round a small museum in Eskilstuna, Sweden, gives a clear impression of the dramatic leaps in product development made by the construction equipment industry over the past 30 years, writes Andrew Baxter. In the town that thinks of itself as Sweden's Sheffield, the museum celebrates the achievements of two early Swedish engineers, Jean Bolinder and Johan Theofron Monktell, and their successors. One of these in the early 1950s had the bright idea of putting a bucket and arm on to the back of a tractor, and turning the controls round so that the back became the front. Thus was born the wheeled loader, which is now Europe's biggest selling type of earthmoving machine. Messrs Bolinder and Monktell, meanwhile, are immortalised as the BM of Volvo BM, one of five product ranges within VME, the Brussels-based construction equipment producer. VME, which was formed in 1985 from the merger of the construction equipment interests of Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US, is one of a handful of global producers in the industry which are in the next size category down from the two giants, Caterpillar and Komatsu. All the companies continue the search for another spark of brilliance which might create something earth-shattering - literally and metaphorically. Grahame Miller, VME's UK promotions manager, says he often sits down with a sketch pad, trying to work out a completely new design that would avoid the need for hanging a 'dead' counterweight on to the back of many machines. In the absence of any totally new concepts in machine design, the industry is committed to a perpetual process of improvement in its current products, replacing one series of loaders, excavators and other lines with another to modernise the design, improve comfort in the cab, update the electronics, and improve the efficiency and environmental friendliness of the machine. Ranges that may have lasted a decade or more in the past now have a life of as little as six years, and are also updated more frequently. This process of incremental change means that a machine of the 1970s looks almost primitive in comparison with what the industry is producing now. There are sound financial reasons for the process. Many customers who are looking to replace a machine after three or four years use expect to be able to buy a more sophisticated product without necessarily having to pay more in real terms, and are unlikely to be impressed by a supplier that is standing still. A new, or even only partially updated product can give a much needed lift to sales - and gives suppliers something to show off at trade shows. This year, it is the same as ever with a batch of new products being unveiled at next month's Intermat show in Paris. VME is launching the new Volvo BM L70B wheeled loader which incorporates a number of new features already included on recently launched loaders, such as load-sensing hydraulics and the so-called TP Linkage lift-arm system first introduced in 1991. In its German-built range of Zettelmeyer small machines, VME has launched the Zettelmeyer ZL802 loader, which replaces an earlier machine in the same size bracket, and unveils two new Akerman excavators, to complete a range of premium-specification Swedish-built machines that has been redesigned over the past year. Mr Chris Rees, managing director of VME's UK subsidiary, has high hopes for the new machines. The relaunched Akerman excavators, which were previously designed very much for the Scandinavian market, should give a much wider presence in the UK market place, he says, and help VME achieve its aim of 10 per cent of the UK tracked excavator market by 1996, compared with 4 per cent last year. The new Volvo BM wheeled loader would help the company consolidate its position while the Zettelmeyer loader would increase VME's market share in the market for machines with a one cubic metre bucket. Overall, and other things being equal, Mr Rees believes the new machines could raise VME's unit sales in the UK from 470 machines last year to 550 in 1994. VME has a strong reputation among users for its products, and has maintained spending on new product development through the recession, even if its published figures suggest otherwise. The group accounts in dollars, but some 70-80 per cent of R&amp;D spending is made in Sweden. So published spending on R&amp;D of Dollars 39m or 3.1 per cent of sales last year would have been about 4 per cent if the dollar-krona exchange rate had stayed constant, compared with 4.4 per cent in 1992. As a group, the company is relying on its modern product range to complement the dramatic downsizing in manufacturing it has undergone in the past three years. Worldwide employment has fallen 40 per cent since the beginning of 1991 to about 6,400 at the end of last year and a 1992 loss of Dollars 93.6m was turned into a Dollars 30m profit last year even though demand in many countries remains weak. The restructuring has lowered the company's breakeven levels but, fortunately for VME, it has long realised that there is little point in suffering the pain of job cuts and plant closures if the product range is not being kept up to scratch.</p>

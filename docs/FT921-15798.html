			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Asset allocators explore the bond markets - US and Japanese interest rate cuts have led to second thoughts, says Richard Waters Fund managers returning to work this week have been presented with a conundrum. Traditionally, the new year prompts a reassessment of investment weightings. It is a time when asset allocators come into their own, determining the relative weightings of equities, bonds, property and other investments in their portfolios. With the US and Japan lowering short-term interest rates at the tail-end of the old year, however, many of the strategy reviews undertaken in the closing weeks of 1991 already look out of date. In particular, the rise in share prices has already removed some of the attraction from equity markets which may have seemed cheap in historic terms. That 'cheapness' is most commonly expressed in terms of the ratio of bond yields to those on equities. For most major economies, that ratio was close to or below its average for the last decade as 1991 drew to a close, appearing to suggest that there was room for share prices to rise, according to research from Smith New Court, the UK securities house. After the severe volatility in the US and the UK in 1987, which had seen yield ratios climb way out of line with historic norms before plunging sharply in the stock market crash, the ratio had continued to move lower in the following years. The UK, in particular, with a ratio below 2.0, looked undervalued compared to recent years. Similar sharp falls had been seen in Japan and Germany since early 1990, as interest rates moved up in anticipation of the inflationary threat in both countries. But recent historic parallels may be of little relevance in the years ahead. Most investors are betting on the fact that inflation has been licked in the major economies for the time being, and is set to fall in the coming 12 months. That view holds particularly for the European Community, where Germany's pre-Christmas rate rise seems to have set the tone for a low-growth, low-inflation period ahead. Against that background, yield ratios could be set to fall to a new range. The chart, showing the bond/equity yield ratio for the UK, illustrates how the ratio moved into a new range in the 1970s as inflation took hold and the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system broke down (being based on year-end figures, it does not show the sharp rise and fall during 1987). If investors believe in low inflation ahead, the ratio could fall back to pre-1970 levels, suggesting a return to a greater degree of fixed income investment, argues Mr Peter Lyon of Smith New Court. That argument, expressed in different forms, has been the dominant theme in many recent investment analyses. The strongest opponent of this theory is Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs, who argues that the yield ratio does not generally move with inflation, in spite of the 1970s experience. This is a minority view, however, and the consensus points to a greater interest in bond markets - although investment managers are not arguing that the rules of the game have changed fundamentally. As Mr Mike Sandland, chief investment manager of Norwich Union, the UK insurer which has caused a stir in recent weeks with its declared switching into bonds, says: 'We would still accept that, over the longer term, equities must outperform fixed-income investments.' Norwich Union's rebalancing of its portfolio to correct an under-investment in fixed income assets has been made on the assumption that the equity returns of the 1980s will not be repeated. 'It is too simplistic to talk about the 1990s against the 1980s,' says Mr Sandland. 'But by the end of the century, the 1980s will be seen as an eccentric decade for equity returns.' He adds: 'Our view is that over the next couple of years or so, returns on bonds and equities are likely to be roughly similar.' Investment houses sold on the attraction of equities agree that bond markets are set for a sustained rally. As Warburg Securities points out, falling inflation, adequate fiscal discipline and the scope for falls in real bond yields, particularly in Europe later in the year, all point to good returns. But Warburg adds: 'To bet against equities is taking a very serious bet against history.' Even in the low-growth, low-inflation late 1950s, equities outperformed bonds comfortably. It would take a severe change of circumstances to shift many fund managers from this view.</p>

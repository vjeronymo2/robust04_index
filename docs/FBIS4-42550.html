			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Cesare Previti by Federico </F> Guiglia; place and date not given: "Women And Volunteers in the  New Army" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] Women and volunteers are coming into the Second  Republic's Armed Forces. The government's bill on the new  defense model is just seven articles long. [Defense] Minister  Cesare Previti read in a single breath the text destined to  reducing the draft substantially over time, giving birth to an  army consisting solely of professionals. He then signed and  commented with satisfaction: "This is a liberal reform. What  we save will be reinvested in the interests of Italy's  international role." But in this interview with IL GIORNALE,  the first granted to a daily newspaper, in which he speaks about  defense problems, Previti does not renounce discussing "pure"  politics. For example, about Forza Italia, his own party. "No,  I do not personally believe that it will become a new DC  [Christian Democratic Party] as under the old system. The  pivotal point of the majority, yes. No danger of recycling.  The important thing is that Silvio [Berlusconi] continue his  path undaunted. He must avoid compromises on two fundamental  items: free trade and the majority principle, which means that  the person in power should not make easy agreements with the  opposition.    [Guiglia] Minister, why do you not completely abolish  useless  military service?    [Previti] The draft remains an essential factor of national  cohesion and of morality, because it brings the people closer to  and ties them indissolubly to the Armed Forces. The solution in  the Italian case, also based on the work of my predecessors, is  that of a mixed model. What we are looking for in the future is  to have 60,000 to 75,000 long-term volunteers and 70,000 to  85,000 draft soldiers. We are also expecting to reduce the  overall number of soldiers from the present 335,000 to 250,000  officers and noncommissioned officers included.    [Guiglia] The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Which comes  off worst?    [Previti] During the past three years the budget cuts have  affected in particular the technological part of the Armed  Forces. I would say that the Navy and the Air Force have been  severely penalized. But, in any case, it would be a mistake to  make a classification of past policy. Right now the important  thing is to recoup part of the old budget cuts and to pay for  the reform, in part also with the money which is saved.    [Guiglia] Are you for or against [former President]  Cossiga's  proposal to unify the Sismi [Intelligence and Military Security  Service] and Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security  Service]?    [Previti] I do not agree. Just last Tuesday [31 May] I  visited SISMI's headquarters at Forte Braschi. I was impressed  by the efficiency and the high technological preparedness of the  people I met. Perhaps the fact that military people predominate  at SISMI gives the feeling of greater organization and a very  professional approach. Their tasks seemed to me to be very well  defined.    [Guiglia] Regularly, someone calls for the demilitarization  of the Carabinieri. Can you tell us in advance what your reply  will be?    [Previti] Please. I am the first to want renewal, but not  mental agitation, which is what the demilitarization of the  Carabinieri would end up being. In the reform which the  government is right now presenting to parliament there are more  than a few genuine novelties. I am thinking of the introduction  of voluntary service for women. But I am also thinking of the  tens of thousands of people who turn around the so-called  defense industry and who can set themselves in motion again to  give birth to the new model of the Armed Forces, based more on  quality than on quantity. We are also studying the possibility  of involving schools in the museums which testify to Italian  military history. And it would not be a bad thing to freshen up  the 2 June [Festival of the Republic] or 4 November [Italian  Armistice Day] celebrations. In short, the objective is to  increasingly integrate civilian society and the military world.    [Guiglia] It is only in politics that "partnership" does not  apply?    [Previti] To the Left as well, the logic is gaining strength  of a healthy distinction between government and opposition.  Cacciari, Salvi, and Napolitano [all Democratic Party of the  Left] are already of this opinion. I would add that anyone who  has had key positions in the First Republic, the partnership  republic, should hand in his resignation. It is not for this  reason that the "old hands" will be marginalized by the new  majority. Beware of purges. But beware of not clarifying things.    [Guiglia] Also for the Senate presidency?    [Previti] Better to be defeated because one has failed to  give birth to a majority than to win because of a hidden  agreement with the opposition.  Journalist.</p>

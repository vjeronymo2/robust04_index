			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. To determine the fraction of hazardous air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutant emissions that are being controlled by the flare;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. To determine the net heating value of the vent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wastewater.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because air emissions from wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment systems cannot be collected and measured, certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters must be identified that indicate the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate from wastewater for monitoring purposes. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods for estimating wastewater emissions for initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the proposed standards for the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source of process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as for identifying enhanced monitoring parameter values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for wastewater, are those specified in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements of 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5) consist of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring specific wastewater treatment parameters and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission calculation methods. Monitoring of the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater parameters is required: inlet flow rate, HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration, pH, and biological oxygen demand. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters were chosen for monitoring because they can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to determine wastewater treatment system performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vi.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Storage Tanks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Storage tank emissions vary greatly over time, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibits testing over reasonable periods of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, no initial compliance test is proposed for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission point, unless emissions are manifolded with process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents, in which case the compliance tests specified for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process vents apply. Instead, the methods specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 63.150(f)(3) are proposed to calculate emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions would be calculated based on the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent usage records for the most recent 1-year period and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided by the amount of product produced during the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. A 1-year period is necessary to reduce the effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of variation in solvent usage on the emission calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because emissions are calculated from factors, and because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage tank emissions are not dependent on parameters that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be controlled, no continuous monitoring requirements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for this emission point, except that facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that control storage tank emissions must certify that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls are in proper working order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equipment Leaks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Like wastewater emissions, equipment leak emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur in open areas and in most cases cannot feasibly be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> captured. Therefore, no performance test is required for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equipment leaks source. Instead, facilities must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that they have an LDAR program in place that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart H. No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring requirements are proposed for equipment leaks, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed standard for equipment leaks is a work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice/equipment standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Averaging Times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial compliance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standards for the process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents, storage tanks, and wastewater source at existing BLR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and WSR production facilities are in the form of mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limits. Initial compliance is determined by adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emissions per unit mass of product calculated for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process vent, storage tank, and wastewater emission point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the facility. For BLR production, a continuous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, a 1-hour averaging time is specified for process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vent compliance tests; the emission rate would be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average of the results of three 1-hour tests. For WSR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production, typically a batch operation, the emission rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to determine compliance would be the average of 3 tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken over for 3 different batch runs. Longer averaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times are required for batch operations to minimize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of emissions that vary significantly with time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Storage tank emissions would be averaged over a period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1 year, based on HAP usage records from the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, to minimize the effect of variation in solvent usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the calculated emission rate. A monthly averaging time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required for wastewater, as specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5). Different averaging times are possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for different emission types because emissions are divided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the production rate for an equal time period. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting production-based emissions are then added together  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to Equation 1 and compared with the mass emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit to determine compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Minister wants boost for rented housing THE GOVERNMENT is to hold talks with institutional investors to see whether a fresh initiative can be taken to build up the private rented housing sector, Sir George Young, the housing minister, said yesterday. 'My vision is of good-quality, professionally managed accommodation for rent, backed by long-term institutional investment,' he said at a meeting of the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Sir George also sharply rebuked critics of the mortgage-rescue scheme agreed between the government and lenders last year. 'The mortgage-rescue package is forecast to rescue 55,000 people, many more than originally forecast last December,' he said. Long-term arrears owed to mortgage lenders had risen because lenders were avoiding repossessions.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Legal action to recover losses OVER THE past two years several thousand Lloyd's Names have taken legal action to recover insurance losses. They are suing their agents or the Lloyd's Corporation, the body which provides regulatory and market back-up services. Actions settled recently Some 500 Names on Warrilow 553 won a Pounds 4m out-of-court settlement including legal costs on February 7 (represented by Elborne Mitchell). A group of 987 Names on Outhwaite syndicate 317/661's 1982 year won a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement on February 12 (Richards Butler). Actions under way A group of 33 Names is suing Lloyd's alleging it negligently failing to close the Oakeley Vaughan agency before the syndicates it managed ran up heavy losses (Michael Freeman). About 175 Names from Aragorn syndicate 384's 1985 year agreed to take legal action last week in a bid to recover insurance losses (Macfarlanes). Writs have been issued and served in three other cases. More than 400 Names on Pulbrook syndicate 90's 1982 year; more than 320 of the 570 Names on Pulbrook 334 in 1985; and more than 400 of the 800 Names on Poland syndicates 105 (1985 year) and 108 (1986 year). All three groups are advised by solicitors DJ Freeman and are alleging breach of contract and misrepresentation by members' agents and negligence by managing agents. At least 91 US Names allege Lloyd's breached US securities laws when they were recruited. They are represented by Proskauer Rose, the New York firm. Cases in Denver and Chicago are being fought by individual Names. In Canada about 70 Names - represented by the Toronto law firm McCarthy Tetrault - are in the midst of a case against Lloyd's. They are appealing against a verdict in Lloyd's favour on a preliminary issue, but have so far successfully prevented banks from drawing down their deposits. More than 600 Names on Feltrim, Devonshire, Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson Young syndicates, represented by Michael Freeman, are issuing motions to seek an injunction preventing Lloyd's from drawing down their deposits. Injunctions are against agents - following the decision by Lloyd's to contest the action. Agents have agreed to freeze deposits until court hearings. These are expected around March 26. Possible actions Gooda Walker Names Association has asked both Withers and Michael Freeman to represent its members. Feltrim Names Association (Richards Butler). Devonshire Names Association (Norton Rose). Rose Thomson Young (Withers).</p>

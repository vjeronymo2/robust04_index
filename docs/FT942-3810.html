			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Further hurdle for C&amp;G offer - Ruling may bar payments to mortgage borrowers say advisers Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society said yesterday that it believed that it had been barred from making payments to its 370,000 mortgage borrowers as part of its proposed Pounds 1.8bn acquisition by Lloyds Bank. The society's legal advisers have said that last week's court ruling prohibited payments to its borrowers as well as its investing shareholders of under two years' standing. The interpretation erects a second hurdle to Lloyds' acquisition because, under the 1986 Building Societies Act, borrowing members must pass a separate vote in favour of the transfer to another company. The society said that the interpretation was one reason why it expected to take several weeks to devise a new scheme to comply with the judgment made by Sir Donald Nicholls, the Vice Chancellor, last week. Although it has estimated that 27 per cent of its 825,000 shareholders, or some 220,000, would be unable to vote under the ruling, it is expected to re-examine its records to check whether this figure is correct. C&amp;G has already closed investing accounts to new members temporarily to prevent inflows of funds. The requirements for the borrowing members' vote are less onerous than for the vote among investing shareholders because the borrowers' resolution needs only to be passed by a majority of those voting. That is in contrast to the shareholders' vote, which must be passed both by a majority of those eligible to vote, and a 75 per cent majority of those actually voting, a figure made hard to achieve by the court ruling. The society has ruled out paying members in preference shares rather than cash. Among options it is considering is persuading shareholders of less than 2 years standing to transfer to non-voting deposit accounts. Although the judge ruled that it was allowed to make payments to depositors who are ineligible to vote it would risk being taken back to court by the Building Societies Commission if it paid shareholders cash to give up voting rights. The longer the society delays devising a new scheme, the more of its investing members will qualify for payments. However, Lloyds could come under pressure from the stock exchange to clarify its intentions publicly.</p>

The recently-completed report on Taiwan's foreign trade  outlook for 1994 said the performance of the Japanese yen will  be the major factor affecting Taiwan's exports to Japan.    The report estimated that the value of Japanese yen against  the greenback this year will drop to 119:1, benefiting Japanese  exporters.    The large-scale appreciation of the Japanese yen last year  boosted Taiwan exports by encouraging Japanese traders in Taiwan  to re-export their Taiwan-made products to Japan. The  appreciation also resulted in more OEM (Original Equipment  Manufacturing) orders here.    The report said its predictions for a depreciation of the  Japanese yen were based on improvements in the US economy and  large- scale public expenditures by the Japanese Government.    In addition, the report noted that there is no more room for  further appreciation of the yen after the mass relocation of  Japanese industries last year.    Any depreciation in the yen will not be good for Taiwan  exports, but expected depreciations will be countered by an  estimated 1.6 percent real-term economic growth rate and  recovery in the Japanese economy by the middle of the year, the  report said.    The report concluded that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan  is expected to increase 11.43 percent to US$15.846 billion in  1994, up from US$14.22 billion in 1993.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa golds ahead Firmer gold shares came back from their highs on disappointment that the bullion price had failed to make further headway, while industrials lost a little ground. The overall index picked up 35 to 5,454, industrials eased 5 to 6,254 and golds were 35 ahead at 2,111. Gencor rose 50 cents or 4.4 per cent to R11.85 ahead of an expected announcement this week on the outcome of negotiations on its planned acquisition of the metal mining business of Royal Dutch/Shell's Billiton.</p>

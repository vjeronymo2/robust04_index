			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (15): Consultants blamed for short-term view - Manager selection 'PIGS MIGHT fly,' said a leading fund manager wistfully, considering the demise of the pensions consulting industry. The role played by pension fund consultants does little to soothe fund managers who complain bitterly of the so-called 'beauty parade', which has become a ritual of the selection process. The fund managers claim that consultants urge clients to switch managers simply to justify their own positions. Worst of all, fund managers say, the role of consultants has caused pension funds to take too short a time-horizon into account when considering the performance of managers. Mr Robert Baker, a senior consultant in the asset planning department at the actuarial and consulting firm of Mercer Fraser, said that he urged pension fund clients to look at performance over at least a three-year period. Recently, he said, Mercer Fraser had conducted some research, and discovered that the top performers for one three-year period were unlikely to achieve that status in the following three-year period. Also, he said, pension funds should spend more time trying to understand the investment objectives of the fund managers they choose. When circumstances were particularly adverse for that strategy, performance would suffer for a time. 'What happens if a good firm goes through a bad patch - what happens if their style goes out of favour?' Mr Baker said. He generally urges clients to stick with the fund manager so that, when the pendulum swings back again, the client will benefit from the upside. This has particularly been the case in the recession when fund managers specialising in small companies or recovery stocks have been hard hit. Also, he argues, pension fund trustees do not spend enough time selecting a fund manager, even when they are advised by a consultant. 'The beauty parade is a very bad way of picking a manager,' he said. Mr Baker urges trustees, instead of inviting managers in to make a presentation, to visit the fund manager's own premises and see how he runs his business. But not all consultants have the same long-term time horizon, fund managers complain. 'These guys have set themselves up as judge, jury and executioner of fund managers. They earn fees for conducting searches, and its in their interest to shuffle the pack periodically,' said one investment director. The tension between the two groups is palpable. The power of pension consultants is such that fund managers are unwilling to speak candidly about them publicly, for fear that their views will damage future business prospects. But even they grudgingly admit that the consultants play a valuable role. 'We brought the consultants upon ourselves by being too complacent,' said one. The fund managers say there is wide variation in the quality of consultants, with most of the large actuarial consulting firms winning generally high marks for thorough research and sensible guidance. However, less well-known consultants, seen as more keen for the business, attract the greatest ire. 'I've been asked to fill out a 100-page questionnaire, only a small portion of which was sent on to the client,' said one fund manager, complaining that consultants, too, often stand between fund managers and their clients. 'Its a kind of a love-hate relationship,' said an official of the Institutional Fund Managers Association. And fund managers' insistence on displaying their own performance records in the most flattering light - to the complete confusion of potential clients - has only hastened the rise of an industry whose job it is to peer through the hyperbole to get at the performance below. In recognition of this, the National Association of Pension Funds last year produced an advertising code of conduct designed to coerce fund managers to standardise the way they advertised their track records. Among other things, it urges the display of a five-year time horizon. But even if comparison of performance becomes a simpler matter for the layman, fund managers and consultants agree that the average pension fund trustee is often badly equipped to make manager selections on his own. 'There is caveat emptor in the selection of fund managers, and that's where we come in,' said Mr Baker. He believes that tensions between investment managers and consultants may have increased in recent years, as consultants have taken on some of the tasks - especially that of asset allocation  - previously within the strict remit of fund managers. Meanwhile, questions have also been raised about the role that pension fund consultants have played in directing larger and larger sums into the hands of just a few major fund managers. A recent study of pension funds by the 100 Group of Finance Directors, representing the UK's largest companies, found that just six fund managers and five internally-managed pension funds accounted for over half the funds surveyed. The survey covered roughly a third of the Pounds 300bn in UK pension funds. 'You have to have a track record to attract new business,' Mr Baker said.</p>

Vasilyev, Institute of Physics imeni P.N. </F> Lebedev at Russian Academy of Sciences, and A.B. Yastrebov,  Ryazan Institute of Radio Engineering; UDC  551.501.7:621.373.826.038.823]    [Abstract] The principle of differential infrared  absorption with scattering is considered for sounding the  atmosphere and its contaminants, especially CFCl[.sub]3[/]  (Freon-11) CF[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]2[/] (Freon-12), and  CCl[.sub]4[/]. Inasmuch as TEA CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers are  inadequate for this purpose owing to the presence of transverse  modes and the decorrelating effect of the atmosphere along with  instability of the radiation intensity and poor reproducibility,  an ammonia-nitrogen 9-13 m laser with resonant pumping by a  pulsed CO[.sub]2[/]-laser is proposed instead. The optics  include three diffraction gratings: G[.sub]1[/] (100  lines/mm, 30 glancing angle) on the exit side of the pump  laser cavity, G[.sub]2[/] (75 lines/mm, 23 glancing  angle) behind the first, G[.sub]3[/] (100 lines/mm, 30  glancing angle) on the exit side of the NH[.sub]3[/]-laser.  Pump radiation from the CO[.sub]2[/] laser impinges on the  first grating, whereupon radiation leaving its zeroth order  impinges almost normally on the second grating and then through  its first order enters the cell with NH[.sub]3[/]. The  optical cavity for this active medium is formed by a spherical  opaque mirror with a 10 m radius off the optical axis in front  and the third grating on the optical axis behind. The opaque  mirror is positioned so that it reflects radiation emitted by  the NH[.sub]3[/] laser onto the second grating, which then  rereflects this radiation back into the cavity along with the  pump radiation. Addition of nitrogen not only boosts the  emission efficiency (to 20 %) and the energy of emitted  pulses  (to 1.5 J) but also appreciably widens the emission spectrum (up  to 13.5 m). Absence of optically weak elements inside the  cavity makes possible periodically-pulsed operation of the  NH[.sub]3[/]-N[.sub]2[/] laser. The laser is tuned by  rotation of that third grating. Emission of 10-1000 ns long  radiation pulses is achieved by passive locking of longitudinal  modes. For measurement duty the system is modified and includes  only two gratings. The first one (64 lines/mm, 31 glancing  angle) tunes the pump radiation from the CO[.sub]2[/]-laser  to one of the two absorption lines of the sR(5,k) transition in  ammonia and thus, with the aid of a compound cavity formed by  that grating and two mirrors, splits that radiation into two  beams of unequal intensities. The cavity of the  NH[.sub]3[/]-N[.sub]2[/] laser is now formed by this  grating, another mirror, and the second grating (100 lines/mm,  37 glancing angle). This grating tunes the radiation from  that laser to the absorption line of whichever contaminating  impurity in air is being targeted, for use as the probing  radiation. The system now also includes a transceiver into which  the first grating sends both tuned pump radiation and tuned  probing radiation, not together but in separate differently  directed beams brought together into the transceiver upon their  reflection by another mirror each.

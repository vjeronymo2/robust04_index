			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Talk: "Intolerable Maneuvers of Puppets' </F> Nuclear Weapons Development"]    [Text] At the moment, the South Korean puppets are pushing  ahead, in earnest, with nuclear weapons development and  ruthlessly conducting more anti-Republic maneuvers than ever  before, while finding fault with our Republic's so-called  nuclear issue.    As has been revealed to the world, the South Korean ruling  bunch has been developing nuclear weapons ever since it  manufactured atomic reactors for military purposes a long time  ago under the guise of commercial use and use in research.  Today, the rascals are going so far as to talk openly about  nuclear sovereignty.    South Koreans involved in nuclear development have also  confessed that the heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and the  multipurpose research reactor in Taedok were introduced for  purposes of nuclear weapons development. And, publications in  South Korea have also revealed that plans to produce nuclear  weapons have been pushed ahead endlessly by South Korea.    As is known, the South Korean ruling bunch made it a policy  to develop nuclear weapons by the early 1970's. They imported a  heavy-water reactor from Canada with a view to securing  fissionables and installed it in Wolsong.    The South Korean puppet clique publicized that the Wolsong  heavy-water reactor was for power generation purposes. But, a  publication in South Korea revealed the truth by saying that the  Wolsong heavy-water reactor that was imported from Canada was  for manufacturing nuclear weapons and for producing plutonium.    The South Korean ruling bunch has also been introducing in a  legal way, enriched uranium from a foreign country after having  designed and manufactured the Taedok multipurpose research  reactor suitable for using enriched uranium. By installing a  new test laboratory for irridation materials, they established a  semi-reprocessing facility where they can produce plutonium  directly from used nuclear fuel.    In South Korea, the development of nuclear weapons has been  carried out in a more earnest way since the Kim Yong-sam puppet  regime was inaugurated. Already a year ago, the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique called on the National Assembly to raise its voice  against the possession of nuclear weapons as it nullified the  principle of the South-North Joint Declaration on  Denuclearization. Some time ago, traitor Kim Yong-sam himself  even concluded an agreemeent aimed at pushing ahead with nuclear  development hand in hand with Japan.    This fully shows how enthusiastic the South Korean puppets  are in their maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons. South  Korea's nuclear weapons development, which has actually reached  a dangerous stage, was possible because of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]'s double standard of not publicizing  and overlooking the results of nuclear inspections there, while  finding fault with our peaceful nuclear facilities.    It is by no chance that THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, a  U.S. publication, revealed that South Korea is implementing its  ambitious nuclear plans with the connivance of the IAEA.    Not satisfied with having made South Korea the Far East's  largest nuclear powder magazine by introducing some 1,000 U.S.  nuclear weapons, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is maneuvering  to frantically accelerate its own nuclear weapons development.  Such an act is a downright breach of faith nullifying the joint  declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and  an implacable, serious crime aimed at annihilating the nation.    As is known to the whole world, in the second round  Korea-U.S. talks, we put forth an epoch-making proposal of  replacing the graphite-moderated atomic reactor with a  light-water reactor. Thus, we showed the transparency of  peaceful nuclear activities and have made all sincere efforts to  find a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    Therefore, if the South Korean ruling bunch has a sincere  intention to make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free, peace  zone, it should make clear, and beg forgiveness, at home and  abroad, even now, that the heavy-water reactor, the multipurpose  research reactor, and the fast-breeder reactor are for  developing nuclear weapons, and should take measures to scrape  them.    If the South Korean puppets continue to accelerate nuclear  weapons development that will cause tremendous catastrophe to  the nation, despite strong protest and denunciation of people at  home and abroad, they will not be able to avoid the rigorous  judgment of the times and history.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should clearly understand  this  and act with discretion.</p>

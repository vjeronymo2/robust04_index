			<p>BFN     [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has  sought the aid of the defense force to defuse the tense  situation at Viljoenskroon in the [Orange] Free State where it  is believed that right-wing extremists will soon man two  watchtowers recently erected in the town.    The IEC's media officer in Bloemfontein, Mr. Rob Hadley,  said  that requests for meetings with the Viljoenskroon town council  yesterday and today had proved fruitless and that the IEC had  consequently asked the defense force to patrol the streets of  the town on Wednesday and Thursday. He said the watchtowers  were the subject of an investigation into alleged acts of  intimidation by the Viljoenskroon town council.</p>

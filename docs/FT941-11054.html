			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / EBRD to boost local presence: Staff build-up in east Europe to bring services closer to potential customers The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development intends to increase its staff in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by about half in an attempt to bring its services closer to potential customers. The move to raise by 20 the EBRD's expatriate and locally hired employees in its 11 offices outside London forms part of a decentralisation strategy being implemented by Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the EBRD president. Mr de Larosiere believes the bank lacks the flexibility and on-the-ground presence to respond quickly to emerging business opportunities, especially with smaller enterprises. As a result, the bank wants to recruit relatively young people with experience of eastern Europe. 'We want people who can make deals,' one bank official said. The official added that the changes, which have been discussed with the bank's directors and senior management in recent weeks, would take time to implement. 'We cannot change direction in a few months.' The decentralisation plan would be backed by a more effective system of communication between the regional offices and the London headquarters. The move is in line with the restructuring of EBRD's operations decided in November to make the bank less bureaucratic. Mr de Larosiere took over at the end of September after Mr Jacques Attali was forced to resign following widespread criticism of the bank's over-spending on its London office and relatively low disbursements of funds for eastern Europe. Since taking over, Mr de Larosiere has launched a programme to reduce costs and refocus the bank's priorities. During the second half of last year, the EBRD stepped up disbursements of loans and equity to the former communist bloc. Some of these increased pay-outs were already planned before Mr Attali left in July. At end-December 1993, disbursements stood at Ecu556m (Pounds 414m), out of approved projects of Ecu3.8bn and signed commitments of Ecu2.8bn. This compares with disbursements of Ecu126m at the end of 1992 and Ecu244m last June. The EBRD's aim is to increase by five the bank's complement of around 20 London-hired employees in its outside offices. A further 15 will be added to the tally of 20 local staff. Seven of the offices are in former communist countries in central and eastern Europe, with the biggest in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest. The rest are in Moscow and other parts of the ex-Soviet union. The new posts will be offset by reductions in jobs at the EBRD's London headquarters, in line with an overall freeze on hiring since Mr de Larosiere's arrival. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

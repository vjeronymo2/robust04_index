			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo </F> in Santa Fe de Bogota on 27 May -- recorded]    [Text] Colombians: On Sunday, the nation will experience  one its most important moments. It is, as we all know, the  election of the person who will govern Colombia during the next  four years. The person to whom I will surrender power on 7  August will receive a mandate from his fellow citizens, a  mandate -- like the one I received when I assumed the office of  president in 1990 -- that obliges and commits him during his  administration to seek the welfare of his fellow citizens and a  better future for Colombia.    That is why today, I want to devote a few minutes to speak  to  you about what I consider our duty to be next Sunday for  Colombia, our children, and our children's children. The first  thing I must say to each of you, to every Colombian who is  listening, is that we must vote. We must vote with conviction,  thinking about the nation's future. We must vote freely,  thinking of our families' future. We must vote with solidarity,  thinking of the needy in Colombia. We must vote with decision,  thinking of the country's peace. But above all else, we must be  clear that that vote, that simple action of getting up early in  the morning and walking to the polling station, studying the  ballot, and choosing each one's preferred candidate, will  influence what happens to each resident of this country  beginning on 7 August.    To not vote, in turn, leaves in the hands of those who vote  our personal future, that of our children, our parents and  brothers, and our dearly beloved fatherland, which has  progressed so much, but which faces so many challenges now and  in the future.    Therefore, I invite you to exercise this right, which is  also  a duty of every good citizen. By voting, we help build the  future of Colombia. This nation has a strong democratic  tradition, which today is applauded and recognized by the entire  international community. There is no doubt Colombians have  advanced a lot regarding citizens' participation and collective  affairs of life. And there is no doubt our electoral  organization is one of the most responsible and efficient in  Latin America. This democratic tradition will be strengthened  if we all vote, and above all, if we all support the National  Civil Registry and respect the rules, some of which I will  stress today categorically.    First, as has been reported, all forms of propaganda have  been banned on the day of the elections. That is, in this  election, as happens today in most civilized nations, no  political propaganda will be allowed, neither moving, nor still,  nor audio propaganda. In other words, wearing propaganda  t-shirts, using loudspeakers, or putting up posters or  billboards about the elections or candidates will not be  permitted.    Second, this process requires that the media act responsibly  and that they respect the legal provisions. The government will  not hesitate -- hear me right -- the government will not  hesitate to punish exemplarily radio stations or television  concessionaires who break the rules. The media cannot broadcast  interviews with political-electoral intentions, propaganda,  opinion shows, news conferences on election day. They can only  provide information on electoral results from electoral  officials at polling stations, the National Civil Registry, and  its branches. When reporting on partial information, the media  must inform the official electoral source. And the media will  not be able, under the risk of facing penalties that may lead to  the cancellation of the license and concession, to divulge  projections or polls on electoral results.    Finally, regarding public order, the media will only be able  to report information confirmed by official sources. What is  more important for news neutrality is that the media will not be  allowed to reproduce results issued by international news  agencies abroad or the projections made by them on the vote  because it would adversely affect the provisions of neutrality.    Third, this process requires the absolute impartiality of  public employees. Yesterday, the prosecutor general warned  government officials about the severe sanctions the Prosecutor  General's Office will impose on those who violate the legal  norms on impartiality or use in some way public property in  favor of any candidate.    Presidential delegates, whose mission is to observe the  normal development of the elections throughout the entire  national territory have been sent to all departments of  Colombia. Believe me, the government will persecute and punish  those who do not observe the legal norms.    Fellow countrymen, allow me one final observation on the  elections. We must vote to give a signal to the enemies of  peace in Colombia, the violent ones, those who have missed the  train of history because they have not had the courage to leave  behind their cowardly rifles, attacks, kidnappings, extortions,  and their obsolete rhetoric. This message must be heard by  them. It must say that the Colombian people demand peace and  demand attitudes of peace. It must say, above all, that the  people of Colombia support the good things, teamwork, and that  they support our future.    A copy of an old newspaper, which was in the hands of our  ancestors in 1884, some 100 years ago, quotes a phrase mentioned  by Simon Bolivar which I believe summarizes what we must all  seek on Sunday when we go out to exercise our right to elect a  president. Bolivar said: I would trade all my dictates and  titles, even that of liberator, for that of a good citizen. If  all 30 million Colombians are good citizens, like Bolivar said,  if we are good citizens, we will undoubtedly elect a president,  who will always seek a more just, equitable, prosperous, and  peaceful fatherland for our good and for the welfare of the new  generations of Colombians. Good night and thank you very much.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORD LOVE A DUCK  </P> <P> Congratulations to letter writer Kathryn Wafer (Aug. 26) for keeping Calendar  on the straight and narrow concerning Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck.  </P> <P> I once busted Newsweek for its unforgivably calling Donald's nephews "Cub  Scouts"; they are, of course, members in good standing of the Noble Order of  Woodchucks.  </P> <P> As someone who spent his first three years of grade school suffering in the  slow-reader's circle, I happily remember the summer day when looking at the  comic picture, I could suddenly read Donald Duck captions.  </P> <P> Right-thinking editors everywhere should be aware of the inviolability and the  loyalty many of us feel toward the Duckburg canon.  </P> <P> DAVID KOLPACOFF  </P> <P> El Cajon  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt and Prime  Minister Paul Keating of Australia visited Vietnam in the first  fortnight of April. Here is our review of these visits:    The two prime ministers came to Vietnam with a view to  broaden cooperation with Vietnam. The Swedish prime minister  inaugurated an Ericsson mobile communication system in Vietnam.  The Ericsson Group of Sweden is a well known manufacturer of  electronic and telecom equipments. The visit to Vietnam by  Australian prime minister came after the two countries reached  an agreement on the construction of My Thuan Bridge crossing the  Tien River in southern Vietnam. This makes Australia rank the  first among investors in construction in Vietnam as well as of  all Indochina.    From either side of the Earth, Sweden and Australia have one  thing in common, that is to contribute to the construction of  Vietnam infrastructure, one of the most essential needs of  Vietnam at the present moment.    The Australian prime minister also announced $140 million of  aid to Hanoi to help the latter continue its renovation process.  Sweden has also so far [word indistinct] granted aid to  Vietnam. With the visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Carl  Bildt, Sweden plans to boost the economic ties with Vietnam. It  is a new decision taken by Sweden.    Both Australian and Swedish leaders acknowledged the  positive  results of the ongoing renovation process in Vietnam. The truth  created by Vietnam itself has urged more countries to invest in  the country.</p>

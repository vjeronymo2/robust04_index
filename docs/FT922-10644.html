			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins declines to Pounds 14m INCREASED property sales failed to prevent pre-tax profits falling by almost a third from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 14m in 1991 at Travis Perkins, the UK's fifth largest builders merchants. The group, which derives 70 per cent of sales from house construction, repair, maintenance and improvements, blamed the decline on the deep recession in residential and commercial property markets. Mr Tony Travis, chairman, warned that this year was likely to be just as difficult. He said: 'We have not seen any improvement in output and we are continuing to make every effort to reduce our cost base.' Sales by volume during the first three months of this year had fallen by nearly 2 per cent over a very depressed first quarter last year. Net margins had fallen by about 1 per cent during the first three months. Group sales for 1991 fell by 11 per cent from Pounds 348m to Pounds 310m. Mr Travis said that the fall in pre-tax profits would have been even greater but for a 70 per cent increase in profits from property sales from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 5.8m. Earnings fell to 10.8p (13.8p) just covering a maintained dividend of 8p after a same again final dividend of 5.5p. The number of workers employed by the company was reduced last year by 13 per cent to 3,429 as the company moved to reduce costs in the face of declining sales. Mr Travis said that bad debts had increased as result of the recession to 1.4 per cent (about Pounds 3.5m) of credit sales. This was about three times higher than the group would expect in a normal market. COMMENT Travis Perkins can find no evidence of a recovery in Britain's depressed construction sector. Sales and margins remain under pressure despite reports that UK house sales may be starting to pick up after the election. According to Mr Travis it can take up to six months for an improvement in the housing market to work through to increased sales at builders merchants. It will be sometime after that before prices recover. It therefore looks like being another tough year for the company along with other British building material producers and suppliers. Travis, in its favour, has a strong balance sheet, with net debt currently under 5 per cent of shareholders' funds. Pre-tax profits this year, assuming lower property sales, could be around Pounds 14m which would put the group on prospective p/e of more than 20. Too expensive to merit a buy but worth holding for its strong defensive qualities.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL PAIRINGS;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK, MATER DEI ARE TOP-SEEDED TEAMS  </P> <P> Saddleback (24-1), the Sea View League champion, and Mater Dei (23-2), the  Angelus League titlist, are the No. 1- and 2-seeded teams in the Southern  Section Boys 5-AA Division basketball playoff pairings released Sunday.  </P> <P> Saddleback has defeated Mater Dei twice this season. Loyola (20-2), the Del Rey  League champion, is seeded third, and Lakewood, the Moore League titlist, is  fourth.  </P> <P> First-round action begins Wednesday with the finals in all nine divisions  scheduled for the week of Feb. 26-March 4.  </P> <P> In the newly-adopted playoff format for the Southern Section, the first three  teams in each league automatically qualified for the playoffs and were placed  in divisions according to their size.  </P> <P> Division 5-AA is for schools with an enrollment of at least 2,400; 5-A  (2,000-2,399); 4-AA (1,750-1,999); 4-A (1,500-1,749); 3-A (1,000-1,499); 2-AA  (750-999); 2-A (400-749); 1-A (150-399), and Small Schools (0-149).  </P> <P> In addition, each league could submit other teams for playoff consideration,  providing the teams had overall winning records. All at-large teams that were  submitted for consideration were accepted, except in the 3-A, where the 32-team  bracket was completely filled with automatic qualifiers.  </P> <P> Schools were also allowed to move up one or more divisions if they gave notice  before Jan. 9. Several schools, including Mater Dei, which went from 5-A to  5-AA, and St. Paul, which went from 3-A to 4-A, took advantage.  </P> <P> Here are remaining seeded teams, by division:  </P> <P> 5-A: 1.

Pilgrim (Heritage  No. 1); 3. Grace Community Christian (Westside No. 1); 4. Cal Lutheran (Academy  No. 1).  </P> <P> The Moore League was the biggest benificiary of the new policy to allow more  than three teams from any one league into the playoffs.  </P> <P> In addition to Lakewood (20-6), Millikan (20-6) and Long Beach Jordan, the  1-2-3 finishers in the league, Long Beach Poly (15-11), Long Beach Wilson  (15-12) and Compton (13-11) advanced as at-large entrants. All of the school  but Compton, which is 4-A, are in the 5-AA division.  </P> <P> Four leagues, the Bay, Marmonte, Sea View and Whitmont, had five teams qualify.  </P> <P> With only Saddleback and Mater Dei receiving byes in the 5-AA divsion, there  are several interesting first-round matchups scheduled.  </P> <P> Long Beach Wilson is at St. Bernard (21-5), the Camino Real League champion,  Long Beach Poly is at Lynwood (15-9), the San Gabriel Valley League runnerup,  Leuzinger (15-11), an at-large entrants from the Bay League, is at Millikan and  Long Beach Jordan is at Antelope Valley (16-8), the Golden League co-champion.  </P> <P> Other first-round games of interest, in the 5-A, Beverly Hills (14-9) at Arroyo  Grande (16-7); in the 4-AA, Servite (12-10) at Torrance (14-10); in the 4-A,  West Torrance (12-12) at Bishop Amat (14-9); in the 3-A, Corona del Mar (15-9)  at El Dorado (20-4), Western (16-6) at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (16-8),  Centennial (13-10) at Pomona (15-9); in the 2-AA, Miraleste (15-5) at Bell-Jeff  (19-4); in the 2-A, Santa Maria St. Joseph (12-11) at Paraclete (20-2); and in  the 1-A, Mary Star (16-7) at Brentwood (14-8).  </P> <P> The only one of the nine playoff divisions that has a completely filled bracket  is the 3-A. In that division there were 33 automatic qualifiers which  necessitated a wild-card game to reduce the field to 32 teams.  </P> <P> Norte Vista (13-10), the third-place team in the Mountain View League, travels  to Yucaipa (9-14), the third-place team from the Sunkist League, tonight, with  the winner playing at South Hills (19-5), Wednesday.  </P> <P> Manual Arts (21-0), the defending state Division I champion and the only  undefeated team in the City, is the top-seeded team in the boys' basketball 4-A  playoffs.  </P> <P> North Valley League champion Cleveland (20-2) is seeded second, followed by  Crenshaw (17-2), the Southern League winner, and Carson (14-7), the Pacific  League champion.  </P> <P> Two coin flips on Tuesday will be necessary to finalize the pairings. Granada  Hills (13-8) and Kennedy (12-8) are tied for third in the North Valley League  and Palisades (9-11) and Fairfax (11-11) are tied for third in the Metro  League. All first-round games are Friday. The City finals for both boys and  girls in the 4-A and 3-A division are scheduled March 3 at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Westchester (15-5), which lost twice to Manual Arts in Metro League play but  has lost to no other City team, was unseeded and will play host to Banning  (10-13).  </P> <P> The Comets could play Crenshaw in the quarterfinals and Cleveland in the  semifinals before a possible rematch against Manual Arts in the City final.  </P> <P> In the 3-A division, Fremont (22-3) of the Central League is seeded No. 1 and  either Los Angeles (14-8) or University (15-6), which tied for the Western  League title, will be seeded No. 2. Wilson (17-5), the North East Valley  champion is seeded third and North Hollywood (15-4), the Mid Valley League  titlist, is seeded fourth.  </P> <P> Three leagues, Eastern, Northwest and Northeast, play their final games  Tuesday.

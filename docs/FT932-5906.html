			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / In search of the private landlord: The call for small investors and institutions to return to home renting ALMOST everyone with an interest in the UK housing market now agrees on one thing: there is a pressing need to revive the private rented sector to increase housing choice and encourage mobility of labour. Politicians from all parties, developers, lenders, economists, housing analysts - even Shelter, the campaign for the homeless founded in 1963 to campaign against slum landlords - are part of this consensus. Last month, they were joined by the prime minister who, for the first time, held out the prospect of measures to encourage private landlords to increase their involvement in the housing market. The Downing Street policy unit is involved in a secret inter-departmental examination of housing policy, reviewing options on renting, and on housing benefit and the right to buy. Certainly, there is scope for increasing the share of the market taken up by private rental. It fell from 90 per cent of housing in 1900 to below 7.5 per cent by 1990 - one of the lowest levels in Europe. There are signs that the apparently inexorable decline in private rentals has been halted. Last year, members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (Arla) reported an average increase in private lettings of 13 per cent, according to a survey from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation. But this appears to reflect nothing more than a temporary reaction to the depressed housing market. The Rowntree survey found that 18 per cent of properties managed by Arla members were owned by people who were unable or unwilling to sell their homes in the current property slump. Another 40 per cent were owned by 'temporarily absent landlords', some of whom might have sold their homes in a more buoyant housing market. 'When the property market picks up, the likelihood is that many of these reluctant landlords will take the opportunity to sell up,' says Mr Richard Best, director of the Rowntree Foundation. This pessimism is widely shared by those in the private rental sector. They see the main impediment to a revival of private rentals in the yield gap: at current rent levels, the return on investment in private rented homes is well below what investors earn elsewhere. The Rowntree survey found that returns on private rentals varied between 6.1 per cent and 7.2 per cent net of management and maintenance costs. Agents believe this return would need to rise above 10 per cent to attract new investment into private renting. Above all else, private landlords want tax incentives. They point to the success of the Business Expansion Scheme, which has attracted more than Pounds 1.2bn of new investment into the private rented sector, by offering small investors tax relief over five years. But the BES is due to be abolished at the end of the year. Advocates of a 'son of BES', such as Mr Best, say new incentives are needed to attract long-term investment from institutions, rather than costly tax relief for small investors. It is an argument that appeals to Sir George Young, the housing minister, who believes Britain's institutions should be persuaded to invest in private rented homes. 'Investments in bricks and mortar, responsibly managed and with rents underpinned by housing benefit, should be an attractive part of any long-term institutional portfolio,' he says. The Environment Department is in discussion with institutional investors over what they see as obstacles to returning to the residential property market. Sir George recently suggested a new form of intermediary, such as the investment trust, through which they could invest in rented property without ownership and management responsibilities. However, the main obstacle to any significant investment incentives for private landlords lies in the Treasury. Already frantically searching for ways to cut public spending, the Treasury is aghast at the suggestion of a 'son of BES', pointing out that fiscal policy is being changed to focus tax incentives on investment in enterprises. It would also not be cheap: the cost to the Exchequer of building just 20,000 homes under the BES was more than Pounds 400m. 'We would be talking about billions of pounds,' one minister says, 'subsidies of several thousands of pounds for each house. There must be a better way to use the money.' An alternative to investment subsidies would be to boost the returns from private renting by sheltering them from tax. Making rental income tax-free would almost certainly bridge the yield gap at current rent levels, according to the Rowntree study. However, it would be expensive if the concession were extended to existing landlords: income from unfurnished property alone topped Pounds 1.7bn in 1989-90. Lifting capital gains tax from private rented property would be cheaper  - perhaps a quarter of the Pounds 1.1bn yield of CGT comes from gains on property. However, even modest sums of this sort are hard to countenance when the government is looking at such unpopular measures as charging pensioners for prescriptions. And many Tory MPs feel that tinkering with the tax system is not the answer. 'I don't believe that tax measures are the right way to deal with this,' says Mr Robert Jones, the Tory chairman of the cross-party environment committee. 'We have to create a society where it is worth building houses for rent.' 'Institutional investors want certainty,' adds another MP. 'They want to know that tax arrangements won't change for, say, 10 years.' Such Tories are too tactful, or embarrassed, to concede that the the way in which high profile pledges on taxes were broken in this year's Budget will not have increased investor confidence in politicians' long-term plans. If tax incentives are out of the question, could the pattern of housing subsidies be altered to help private landlords? For example, phasing out mortgage interest tax relief might make private renting more attractive than owner-occupation for some people. Those within the Conservative party who advocate the abolition of mortgage interest tax relief do so in whispers, since they see no prospect that the government will renege on the election manifesto promise to retain it. However, the reduction in the rate of tax relief from 25 to 20 per cent in this year's Budget has so far passed without outcry. Thought of further cuts may become politic in future, particularly if rising house prices threaten a return to the boom/bust cycle of recent decades. An alternative approach would be to extend to the private rented sector the subsidies which now help housing associations keep rents down. This is an appealing option for Conservative MPs, who fear that the Pounds 2bn a year of government grants available to associations through the Housing Corporation are crowding the private sector out of the market. Sir Paul Beresford, an officer of the Tory backbench housing committee, believes that developers should be allowed to compete for housing grants against associations. Though developers would, on the whole, not be interested in managing estates, that task could be handed over to private sector management companies. This solution would also be attractive to backbenchers, concerned that associations have become too monolithic and unaccountable. However, Sir George Young told the environment committee in April that giving grants to the private sector would raise similar problems of accountability for public money. And, if rents charged by the private sector were higher than those charged by the housing associations, this could boost further the fast-growing bill for housing benefit which the Social Security Department is anxious to curb. Reconciling the differing interests of departments could prove the biggest obstacle to agreement over the form of help for the private rented sector. As one minister candidly admits, there is little coherence in the government's housing policy. If coherence is to be achieved, it will have to be imposed by Mr Major and his high-level review.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               AVERAGE RATES OF RETURN ON RENTAL PROPERTY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Property type       Gross return (Per cent)    Net return (Per cent)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Bed flat                 10.3                        7.2 2 Bed flat                 10.2                        7.0 2 Bed house                 9.3                        6.5 3 Bed house                 8.8                        6.1 All types                   9.6                        6.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    TO INVESTORS IN PROPERTY COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       Per cent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tax exemption on capital gains from shares                39 Tax relief on the purchase of shares                      34 Tax exemption on dividends from shares                    28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 DIRECTLY TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           Per cent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital allowances from investment in rental property        31 Grants for the provision of rental property                  28 Exemption from corporation tax on rental income              28 Exemption from corporation tax on capital gains              13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           Per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     TO PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL LANDLORDS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Exemption from income tax on rental income                   74 Exemption from capital gains tax on property let for a minimum of 10 years                                        14 Grants for the provision of rental property                  13  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Joseph Rowntree Foundation Survey of members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

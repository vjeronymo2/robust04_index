			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Chess monster turns cartwheels: How the world's press has become like a theatrical agent IMAGINE THE excitement if the team of Swedish boffins currently engaged in the most exhaustive and scientific trawl of the depths of Loch Ness, were actually to locate the famous monster. Better still, imagine that, having picked up an awesome and otherwise inexplicably large blip on their sonar equipment, the Swedish scientists were, with some local help, able to induce the great beast to rise to the surface, for all to see. Initially, I am sure, the attention of the world's media would be absolute. Photographs of the monster would even displace the Princess of Wales from the front pages of the tabloid press. John Major and the rest of his Cabinet could sigh with relief as their daily traumas were relegated to down column items. But their respite would be short. For within days the Loch Ness monster would have lost its 1,000-year-old mystique. The Swedish scientist would quickly have categorised the slimy brute and shown how closely it was related to many other and more colourful species which trawl the bottom of our oceans. Russian scientists would immediately claim that a more interesting monster had been discovered by them at the bottom of Lake Baikal. Above all, the Loch Ness monster, simply by being seen and made available to the public, would become mundane. Much the same fate, I am afraid, has befallen Bobby Fischer. The comparison springs to mind because the American genius has been so often described as 'The Loch Ness monster of world chess, often sighted but never seen'. The man was already something of myth during his first incarnation. American Champion at 14, World Championship contender at 16, World Champion at 29, and the only non Russian to hold the title since the 1930s. Then a Garboesque silence, sustained by the belief that he was the undefeated world chess champion. Thus, Fischer's return match against Boris Spassky was accorded the most monumental media attention when the event got underway at the beginning of September. Magazines made their covers available to Fischer, based on interviews which consisted of no more than a few words of Fischer-speak, and thousands of words of padding. Last week the match finally ended after 30 gruelling games, with Fischer the winner by ten to five. It was a very impressive margin of victory for a man who has not played for 20 years, even if the more practised Spassky is not the player he was. Yet Fischer's triumph was almost ignored: the television news bulletins which broadcast extensively on the first game of the match, had no time for the decisive one. Perhaps the modern media, which has become so much more ephemeral even in the years since Fischer last played Spassky, could not cope with the drawn-out drama of a top class chess match. Partly to cope with this trend more grandmaster tournaments are adopting a time limit of half an hour for an entire game, rather than the timeless variety practised by the fuddy duddy veterans Fischer and Spassky. Cynics might argue that Fischer did not demonstrate enough of his famed eccentricity to capture the headlines. This is not the case. I have subjected both Fischer-Spassky matches to eccentricity analysis and there is no doubt that Fischer is more loopy now than he was in 1972. In the earlier match he merely failed to turn up for one of the games, and barred the television cameras from the event. In the second match Fischer insisted on wearing a dark green leather visor; argued that the second half of the event should be played with both players encased in a giant glass bell; demanded that the players' private lavatories be raised by two inches; barred his opponent's seconds from the playing hall; would not allow his opponent to sit down before he did; and demanded to play with a chess set last used in the Dubrovnik Chess Olympiad of 1950. In between Fischer played at least two games of sublime, incomparable brilliance. But still the media were bored. What more could an emergent monster do to capture the public's imagination? By analogy, it was as if the Loch Ness monster, on being dragged from the murky deep, performed cartwheels and sang Auld Lang Syne and was booed off the stage. The modern world's press has, in truth, become like a theatrical agent with too much talent on his books. Sorry, Bobby luv, seen it once, seen it a 1,000 times.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By So Lai-Fun in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China yesterday appeared to back away from its  insistence that all Hong Kong civil servants indicate whether  they will stay or leave the service after 1997.    A top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping,  yesterday said that only those civil servants who were unwilling  to serve beyond the changeover should inform the future  government.    However, Mr Lu did not say how or when such a declaration  must be made.    Mainland co-convenor of the political sub-group of the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), Professor Xiao Weiyun, had  said that all civil servants should make a statement before 1997  declaring whether they wanted to continue in the SAR [Special  Administrative Region] government.    The statement attracted immediate criticism in that it  amounted to a form of political vetting.    But Mr Lu told a delegation of teachers in Beijing that  there  was a "misunderstanding" over the PWC statement.    Mr Lu indicated that the idea stemmed from a recent survey  that traced the brain-drain in the civil service, according to  Yeung Yiu- chung, president of the federation of education  workers, after their meeting with Mr Lu.    A City Polytechnic survey conducted between March and  November last year found that 35 percent of civil servants were  considering resigning because of the change of sovereignty,  while 37 percent were pessimistic about their careers.    It also disclosed that up to 77 percent were holders of a  foreign passport -- a condition that would render them  ineligible for top positions in the 19,000-strong team after  1997.    Mr Yeung quoted Mr Lu as saying that if the survey results  were to happen, the loss would damage the efficiency of the SAR  government.    The director said that informing a future boss of one's  departure was normal practice. Mr Lu said he hoped that only a  few civil servants would be leaving in the years to come.    During the meeting, Mr Lu also touched on whether the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office would continue after the handover.    He said he believed liaison between the mainland's  provincial  and district-level authorities and Hong Kong should be  strengthened after 1997.    But its political department might be dissolved or merged  with other departments, since its main concern -- new airport  affairs -- would be a matter for the SAR government.</p>

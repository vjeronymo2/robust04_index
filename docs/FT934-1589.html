			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market ignores output cut plans Oil markets yesterday shrugged off statements by some producers outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries that they might cut oil production to bolster sagging prices. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for February was Dollars 13.75 in late London trading yesterday, having closed on Wednesday at Dollars 13.79. Agency reports yesterday said Oman had informed customers that their shipments would be cut by 5 per cent from January. A cut of that size would amount to only 40,000 barrels a day, which would have a negligible impact on the worldwide surplus of crude oil, traders said. Egypt later said it was considering a similar cut in its exports of around 300,000 b/d. Opec has blamed a surge in output by independent producers for adding to the crude oil surplus that emerged earlier this year because of chronic over-production by some Opec members. The organisation has appealed to the independent producers to restrain output, but most have rejected the calls. If the Omani cut materialised it would be the first independent exporter of any consequence to go along with Opec. Market reaction to such cuts is likely to be muted, however, as long as big producers such as the UK and Norway continue to increase output. Figures issued by Arthur Andersen yesterday showed that Norway's October production had jumped by 22 per cent over September to 2.4m b/d. UK production in October surged above the 2m b/d figure to 2.072m b/d. North Sea production is expected to climb steadily into next year. Qatargas has agreed the principle terms for a Dollars 2bn loan to finance the construction of a liquefaction plant, an integral part of its Dollars 6bn liquefied natural gas project, Antonia Sharpe writes. The terms of the loan were not disclosed.</p>

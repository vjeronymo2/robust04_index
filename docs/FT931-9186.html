			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / A spiral of violence in Gaza is 'forcing us all to be radicals' / A look at the rubble of houses destroyed in a tough Israeli crackdown MR Mohammed al-Rubi, his wife and six children were woken at 6am last Thursday by Israeli troops, who told them to leave their newly built home in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip while it was searched. Twelve hours later, when the family was allowed back to the house, it was an uninhabitable ruin. While the al-Rubis spent the day locked up in a nearby building - the men bound and blindfolded - a squad of troops, supported by a helicopter, rocketed their home with anti-tank missiles, then entered it firing automatic rifles and finally blew it apart with explosives. Much the same treatment was meted out to 18 other houses in the same block in a methodical operation that Palestinians, United Nations officials and human rights workers in Gaza describe as by far the biggest in a series of similar military attacks in recent months. The operations have become the latest source of fury in Gaza, where the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians appears to be as profound now as at any time during the five years of the intifada, the uprising against Israeli rule. Mounting casualties among Palestinian demonstrators, increased armed attacks on troops and the mass expulsion in December of hundreds of alleged Islamic militants to Lebanon - all taking place against a background of rising economic distress - have stoked the political temperature. The deterioration in Gaza threatens to cut the ground from under Palestinian leaders wanting to resume peace negotiations with Israel just as Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, travels to the Middle East in an attempt to push forward the process. When Mr Faisal Husseini, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, visited the scene of the Khan Younis operation on Saturday he was greeted with insults and slogans supporting Hamas, the militant Islamic movement which opposes both the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the talks. The crowd's anger was understandable. Of the 19 houses attacked, 10 were rendered uninhabitable, leaving 18 families homeless out of 31 who lived in the block. Even those houses not completely destroyed suffered extensive damage. Troops riddled wardrobes, refrigerators, televisions, bathtubs, water tanks and phones with bullets. Many complained their cash savings and jewellery were missing, some burnt in fires which the troops refused to let local fire crews douse. Mr al-Rubi had spent 35,000 Jordanian Dinars (Pounds 35,000) building and furnishing his house in the 15 months since he was expelled from Kuwait, his apartment there having been ransacked during the Iraqi occupation. The army says the Khan Younis operation - and similar previous attacks  - are aimed at rooting out gunmen from Hamas and PLO factions responsible for killing Israeli soldiers in recent months. But Palestinians say the scale of destruction, carried out with no legal order, amounts to collective punishment and intimidation. Increased armed attacks on the army - five soldiers have been killed in Gaza since last October - have undoubtedly increased the nervousness of troops on the streets and their commanders, including Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who fears public reaction in Israel to such killings. It seems one effect of this tension has been a tougher reaction to general unrest. Palestinian casualties have risen sharply in recent months, especially since the expulsions. Figures from the Gaza Centre for Rights and Law show 15 people were killed by army gunfire from mid-July to mid-November, while 27 were killed in December and January. The number wounded rose from 713 in July-November to 911 in December-January, including 355 children under 16. The army has denied allegations that it has relaxed regulations governing when soldiers can open fire on demonstrators. Mr Douglas Ierley of the Gaza Centre argues that whether or not this is true, troops have frequently resorted to live fire when their lives were not in danger. The ferment in Gaza is fed by a depressing economic situation. According to UN figures, per capita gross national product has tumbled since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis from around Dollars 1,200 (Pounds 844) a year to Dollars 790 (Pounds 556). The chief reason is the restriction on permits to work in Israel, long the main source of income for most of Gaza's 750,000 people. Before the intifada, 80,000 Gazans worked in Israel; before the Gulf crisis the number had fallen to 60,000; now it is no more than 35,000. Many people get by through subsistence-level street trading and small workshops. But unemployment is reckoned by UNWRA, the UN Palestinian refugees welfare agency, to be at 35-40 per cent of the workforce. The population is growing at an alarming 4.5 per cent a year, one of the highest rates in the world in a place which is already a sink of squalor and overcrowding. Islamic institutions - and Hamas in particular - have been able to exploit these conditions for political advantage. Not only do they offer a radical solution to Gaza's otherwise hope-starved young people; they use their local networks to distribute welfare payments to poor, bereaved families and the families of prisoners. Similar payments from the PLO have all but stopped since its funding from Gulf countries dried up after the Gulf crisis. It is impossible to know the balance of public support in Gaza between the secular PLO on one side and Hamas and other Islamic groups such as Islamic Jihad. But a Palestinian journalist who has over several years tracked elections in professional and academic institutions reckons that support for the Islamic groups may have grown from around 40 per cent to as much as 50 per cent. PLO-affiliated leaders feel squeezed. Mr Saeb Erekat, a senior delegate to the peace talks, is from the West Bank but reflects the exposure all his colleagues feel. 'I have never felt such weakness,' he says. 'We promised we would achieve something. Now people are banging on the table. It is payback time and I am empty-handed.' In Khan Younis, Mr al-Rubi put it another way as he stood in the rubble of his house. 'I have no hope now. They are forcing us all to be radicals.'</p>

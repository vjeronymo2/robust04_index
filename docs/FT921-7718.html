			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Voices from the grave return to haunt Italy: The fallout from a letter written in Moscow during Mussolini's eastern front disaster THE ITALIAN establish--ment has fallen victim to a journalistic scoop turned sour. The scoop involved revelations about the late leader of the Italian Communist party, Palmiro Togliatti, one of the country's few towering political figures this century. For two weeks the media and politicians of every colour rushed to judge the conduct of Togliatti while he was in Moscow during the Second World War - solely on the basis of a brief letter he purportedly wrote. Now everyone has got egg on their faces, victims of the timeless practice of the truth never being allowed to interfere with a good story. The 1943 letter, it transpires, was taken out of context, was doctored by at least one newspaper and crucial words were 'interpreted' by an academic over-anxious to promote his own researches. The good story lay in the brutally cynical portrait of Togliatti that emerged when he was discussing the fate of large numbers of Italian prisoners taken on the Russian front fighting with the Axis powers. Togliatti appears to be rubbing his hands over the way Mussolini's venture supporting Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union was coming to a disastrous end. Some 60,000 Italians died on the Russian front and in prison camps. In so many words, he said this would be a good lesson for Italians to learn the perils of siding with fascism. He reportedly said of his fellow-countrymen: 'I am not arguing that they should be killed, rather we can obtain certain results in other ways.' At least this was how the weekly magazine, Panorama, broke the story two weeks ago, citing the research of Prof Franco Andreucci in Moscow. Prof Andreucci had just obtained access to the archives of the (Communist International) Comintern under a contract negotiated by the small Florence publishers, Ponte alle Grazie, for whom he was historical adviser. Prof Andreucci confirmed the contents of the letter along with his publishers at a subsequent press conference. For the doubters, Il Tempo, the Rome daily, published a copy of the damning extract in what seemed the unmistakable hand of Togliatti. Coming right at the beginning of the campaign for parliamentary elections on April 5, the tinder for polemics was lit. The letter provoked an immediate outcry. President Francesco Cossiga, ever keen to impose his stamp on a national debate, announced the formation of a special committee of historians to examine the implications of the letter to the standing of a national hero. (The committee in fact never got off the ground because a number of those chosen refused to serve). The Right weighed in, determined to wring the maximum from this magnificent opportunity to discredit the Left ahead of elections. Here was the cold face of Stalinism which had sought to impose communism on post-War Italy, the Christian Democrat politicians cried. Insinuations were also directed towards Ms Nilde Iotte, the head of the Senate who is Togliatti's widow and the candidate of the metamorphosised Communist party, the PDS, for the presidency of the Republic in the election in July. Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the PDS, alarmed at the damage to the image of the Left, declared the contents of the Togliatti letter to be 'chilling' - if true. Only the enterprising Moscow correspondent of La Stampa, the Turin-based daily, decided to check in the archives. And by this weekend he had blown the scoop. Togliatti had indeed written a letter in 1943 using his pseudonym, Ercoli, to a colleague on the executive committee of the Comintern; but it was a very long one. The language of the original was also far more nuanced. In his controversial discussion of the plight of Italian prisoners on the Russian front, Togliatti used the infinitive verb sopprimere (to suppress) not the emotive word assassinare (to kill). It appears Prof Andreucci got over-excited by the idea of using the letter to promote a future book. Put in touch with Panorama, he accepted an immediate release and dictated over the phone a poor photocopy of an extract of the letter, which he liberally interpreted. The newspaper Il Tiempo went one better: it acquired the photocopy and proceeded to write in the contentious parts - changing the word sopprimere for assassinare, and even converting a poorly legible reference to 'old Hegel' into 'the divine Hegel'. The latter phrase incidentally was one of the aspects which alerted those who knew Togliatti to the falsification. The opening up of the Soviet archives has been accompanied by ample tales of false documents being touted by former officials. This is the first case where officials have provided genuine documents and the users have chosen to falsify them. Ironically, for all the scandal, the faked letter, when read in the historical context, did not convey a new insight on Togliatti. Rather it was typical of a committed communist at the time of the Soviet Union's crucial battle against Hitler.</p>

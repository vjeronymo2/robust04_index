			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Letter: Where is the connection? Sir, What reason can you have for describing a man charged with fraud exceeding Dollars 50m as having 'firm political views' and being 'well-known among the Bruges Group of anti-European federalists' on page one ('UK banks face Pounds 490m suit', August 5) and elaborating on an inside page? Can we expect the political leanings of every future alleged fraudster to be analysed in such detail, or is this just a case of tarring all of us anti-Maastricht people with guilt by association?

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Group of Seven (G-7)  ministers are expected to discuss the recent "artificially  manipulated" currency rates, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  said Tuesday [22 February].    "Artificially manipulated movements are undesirable," Fujii  said, adding that this would be discussed at a meeting of G-7  finance ministers and central bankers on Saturday in Germany.    Speaking at a regular press briefing after a morning cabinet  meeting, Fujii was referring to the yen's recent sharp advance  against the dollar on speculations over U.S. comments tolerating  the yen's rise.    But Fujii said, "I'm not thinking at the moment" of  requesting a statement over the yen's recent sharp movements.    He reiterated that the G-7 ministers would discuss their  earlier accord to cooperate in keeping stable currency rates  reflecting economic fundamentals.    Considering the tax issue, Fujii said he would try to  explain  again to the U.S. side that Japan is to implement a  "full-fledged" tax reform by the year-end.    U.S. officials have said the 6 trillion yen tax cuts limited  to a single year would not be enough to prop up Japan's domestic  demand to curb trade imbalance.    Fujii repeated that the tax cuts were conducted as an  "emergency measure" and the ruling coalition leaders have shown  "a direction for full-fledged" reform by agreeing to set a  "balanced tax system in income, assets and consumption" by the  year-end.    Meanwhile, he said that discussions are under way over  boosting a 10-year program of spending 430 trillion yen in  public works as one option for Japan's market-opening measures.    But he stressed that financial sources must be secured, and  also rejected increasing construction bonds which he noted are  "better than deficit-covering bonds but are the same in terms of  national debt."    The Finance Ministry estimated in the fiscal 1994 budget  plan  that Japan's outstanding balance of government bonds would top  200 trillion yen.</p>

Delivering a speech at the famed Beijing University Tuesday  morning, Kim noted that the Korean peninsula has yet to cast off  the yoke of the cold war.    "This state of affairs threatens to throw Asia into chaos at  any moment," Kim said, adding: "This is because North Korea is  still loath to ride the global trend toward reform and openness."    In particular, its nuclear development program imperils  peace  not only in Asia but in the whole world, he said.    Pyongyang is now vacillating between two courses of action:  Sticking to its old policy of isolation and confrontation or  embracing the world trend of openness and cooperation, Kim said.    "I believe that China is a neighbor who can join us in  trying  to persuade North Korea to participate in the current global  movement," Kim said. "I ardently hope that China will play an  active role in this effort."    Indeed, China may be the only country that could possibily  exert influence over the communist regime in North Korea.    "We have never wanted the North to be isolated, and we will  spare no effort to help Pyongyang join the international  community as a responsible member," said the South Korean  president, who is on a five-day official visit to China.    Kim said his country is stepping up development of its west  coast with the aim of boosting interaction with China.    "If and when North Korea also rides the global wave of  openness and reform, a Yellow Sea economic zone will rapidly  emerge," Kim said.    The Yellow Sea would then become an expanse of peace and  prosperity and Northeast Asia an even more dynamic region, Kim  predicted. "The Pacific would even more certainly emerge as the  center of new world civilization," he said.    Korean unification would be in China's interest as well, Kim  said, since it would ease tension in Northeast Asia and  accelerate regional development. Korean reunification would  help stabilize a new Northeast Asian order, he said.    "We must live together and join forces to usher in a new  era," Kim said. "By living together well, South Korea and China  will be the axis for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and  thus the driving force behind the budding Asia-Pacific age."    In this context, South Korean-Chinese ties are one of the  most important bilateral relationships, Kim said.    "There is great potential for our two countries if we  combine  our manpower, natural resources, capital and technology, while  also sharing the benefits of developmental experience and  expertise," he said.    Seoul and Beijing should also step up joint efforts to  develop the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum so as  to enhance regional cooperation, he said.    After the speech, President Kim met with Prime Minister Li  Peng and Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress.  Kim emphasized the need for closer cooperation between Seoul  and Beijing to resolve the North Korean nuclear row.    They also exchanged views on ways to boost bilateral  economic  cooperation.    Kim was to have lunch with Korean reporters covering the  presidential office of Chongwadae [presidential offices] before  holding a press conference for both Korean and foreign  journalists.</p>

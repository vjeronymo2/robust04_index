			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 15 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Venezuelan  Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry  (Fedecamaras) said today it is pleased with the conclusion of  the negotiations that will lead to the signing of a free trade  agreement by the Group of Three (G-3).    Edgar Romero Navas, president of Fedecamaras, the country's  top business organization, told NOTIMEX that the G-3 will  contribute to the creation of a single vigorous integration axis  in Latin America. The G-3, which comprises Mexico, Venezuela,  and Colombia, concluded last Thursday negotiations over a broad  trade agreement, which will potentially benefit a population of  nearly 140 million people. Nava added that the implementation of  the G-3 agreement will allow other countries to make trade  connections with the Andean Pact and tighten relations with  countries such as Chile, which has reached agreements with  Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico.    The trade relations, which will be in full gear after the  agreement is signed by the presidents of the three countries and  ratified by their respective congresses, represent one third of  the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean.    Industrialists from the chemical and textile sectors, who  were opposed to the original draft of the agreement and who in  fact prolonged the technical negotiations, were also pleased  with the terms of the final agreement reached by the ministers  of the three countries. Luis Brizuela from the textile sector  and Pedro Carmona from the chemical industry sector said during  telephone interviews that new opportunities are opening up which  should be explored by all Venezuelan industrialists. Carmona  said the agreements reached were well programmed because even  though rigid norms were accepted for the chemical industry  sector, the agreement to supervise the supply situation by means  of the Regional Supply Committee, was the most viable.    The G-3 will generate a GDP that will be nearly 35 percent  of  the region's total and its exports of goods and services  represent more than 40 percent of the region's total exports.  The G-3 imports represent nearly 45 percent of the total, a  demand that will bring opportunities for each of the three  countries that will sign the agreement on 15 June in Cartagena  de Indias, Colombia.    Carmona said the chemical industry sector came up with a  formula to deal with the fundamental aspects of supply. In the  textile industry sector, the problem will be prolonged for only  two more years. Brizuela indicated that the decision to exclude  textile products from the deregulation program was the least of  the evils that could be chosen in view of the danger of the  negotiations falling apart.</p>

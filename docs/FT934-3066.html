			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Arts: Inside the palazzos of Venice - Susan Moore examines two exhibitions of Venetian furniture and drawings You see them in the conversation pieces painted by Pietro Longhi and his imitators. Arm chairs and stools with carved cabriole legs, rather French in appearance, Murano glass mirrors and little bombe commodes, all gaily painted in a palette of blues, pinks, cream and grey. In reality, 18th century Venetian painted furniture is much harder to come by. Victims of poor quality local materials - soft wood such as pine - and the devastating humidity of the Serenissima, relatively few fine pieces have survived. It has taken the London-based private dealer Patrick Syz some 15 years to gather together the small but choice group currently on show in 'The Spirit of Venice: Three Centuries of Paintings and Furniture'. The exhibition offers a rare opportunity to marvel at the light-hearted vitality and flights of fancy of the Venetian cabinet-makers - and at their abysmal craftsmanship. Open an ill-fitting door and be appalled by the finish - or lack of it - and the crude and disfiguring locks and hinges. Venetian furniture is admirable for its effect rather than its execution. In the hands of the Venetians, the French rococo style was transformed almost beyond recognition. Once over the Alps, the elegantly swelling bombe commode took on a distinctly voluptuous, top-heavy line. The extraordinarily sculptural high-chested tabernacle here, probably made for a private chapel, knows no flat surface save the faux marble plinth on which to stand a Madonna. Armchairs are altogether more accommodating: light in construction, comfortable and lacking in any pretention. Decoration is more idiosyncratic. Only rarely does one find the same treatment twice. Trophies of war in rich lapis blue adorn the more refined of the pairs here. Little bunches of flowers and ribbons of lace are strewn carelessly across an elaborately carved and pierced Bordeaux-red mirror frame. Its arms and candleholders are carved flowers, bells of red, yellow and orange blossoming out from green stems. While the French inset porcelain plaques into their grandest pieces, a corner cabinet here is decorated with faux blue and with Delft with Chinoiserie figures and birds in landscapes of temples, bridges and willows. There are no opulent ormolu mounts but gilded pastiglia, a kind of paste moulded into scrolls and flowers. Once again, the top is faux marble. The quality of the painting at its best has prompted some furniture historians to attribute pieces to the likes of Tiepolo and Guardi, forgetting perhaps that the painters would have belonged to different guilds. Certainly the outstanding cabinet here seems to have been decorated after rather than by the painter Zocchi. This is a parrucchiera or lady's wig chest, its elaborate cartouches painted with charming rustic scenes of shepherdesses, bird-catchers and fetes galantes. One of the scenes copies a print by Zocchi. If it were based on his original conception, the scene would be painted in reverse. But the exhibition also includes a piece of decorative painting, an overdoor perhaps, by Giambattista Tiepolo himself. This is a rare doraille - rather than grisaille - a 'Deborah and Barrach' painted in gold against a dark ground. In a lighter vein is a caricature of a man holding a tricorn hat, one of a number of drawings to supplement the show. In pride of place hangs an allegory of 'The City of Venice Adoring the Christ Child' by that superlative colourist Veronese. Venice is resplendent in rich brocades, a beguiling lion crouching at her side. The spirit of Venice is also manifest at Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox which presents another select small show, this time of 18th century Venetian drawings. The larger part comes from the collection of the Duc de Talleyrand. Even in 20 or so sheets, most aspects of life and art in the Serene Republic appear, from a large and sparkling Guardi of a regatta on the Grand Canal and an unusual Canaletto of a market on the Riva degli Schiavoni, to Giandomenico Tiepolo's bold comedies of manners. For sheer technical brilliance, Giambattista Tiepolo's draughtsmanship is second to none. Two studies for ceiling frescoes are thrilling examples of what one authority has dubbed his flying pen. No Venetian drawings show seems complete without a Punchinello from the Commedia dell'Arte. He is to be found in Novelli's fine pen and ink drawing of a Venetian masked ball, sporting the traditional costume of hook-nosed mask and sugar-loaf hat and wielding a fork and a pot of the favourite food of Punchinellos - gnocchi. Both galleries show us works of art worthy of any museum. The Spirit of Venice (Syz, 94 Eaton Place, SW1) and Eighteenth Century Venetian Drawings (Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox, 38 Bury Street, SW1) continue until December 17</p>

The implementation of resulting recommendations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  comprehensive or random testing, abatement of lead, in-place management measures, and work order modifications) may be funded from other HA sources (i.e., CIAP, CGP, operating subsidy, or operating reserves). HAs are expected to implement these recommendations, especially those related to in-place management measures when abatement of lead hazards will not take place within a reasonable time (one year).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In no instance shall the implementation of in-place management measures satisfy the HA's obligation under the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act to test and/or abate lead-based paint hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Funds under this NOFA may not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be used to purchase insurance including existing-conditions LBP liability insurance. While funds may be used to conduct risk assessments required to be in place prior to the issuance of an insurance policy, under no circumstance may these funds be used to pay for the premiums associated with this insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

As many applications as possible will be funded within the Field allocation or any redistribution of funds. Each Field Office will advise Headquarters, by the date specified in the Processing Schedule in Section III.B of this NOFA, on whether there are sufficient eligible applications within its jurisdiction to require all of the funds assigned.

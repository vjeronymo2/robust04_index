			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Ivanov, Bulgarian President Zhelev's </F> adviser on ethnic questions, by Valeriya Vaseva; place and date  not given: "I Have Never Questioned the Bulgarian Origins of  Muslims in the Western Rhodope Area"]    [Text] Mikhail Ivanov is President Zhelev's adviser  on ethnic questions. He became notorious recently with his  "discovery" of Wallachian and Pomak ethnic minorities in our  country and his claims of 7,000 Macedonians allegedly living in  Bulgaria. Mr. Ivanov is a nuclear physicist by profession.    [Vaseva] Mr. Ivanov, ethnic tensions have been recently  fanned in our country, while our public is sensitively reacting  to alien interferences in our domestic affairs. Do you believe  that the state institutions are defending our national interests  with the ncesssary firm resolve?    [Ivanov] I share de Gaulle's concept that the egocentrism of  the nation should be the prevailing characteristic feature of a  country's behavior. In this respect we should pursue our  egocentric, Bulgarian interests. However, I would like to point  out, in this connection, that I ardently support the concept of  a "nation" in the political sense, namely as it was introduced  by the French philosophers in the 18th century. According to  this concept, a nation is a community of people rallied by the  idea of a common state. Once the state as such has been  established, the idea is to preserve and develop it as an  entity. In this respect, Bulgaria is a single-national state,  where ethnic, religious, and linguistic varieties exist. Hence,  the Bulgarian national idea should be to join all efforts for  the sake of Bulgaria's prosperity, while preserving the  aforementioned variety. You are asking whether we are  sufficiently defending our interests? We should never be  satisfied with our achievements, but I am convinced that  decisive steps forward have been accomplished in connection with  the protection of Bulgarian interests. Reasons for justified  criticism exist, but many things have improved.    [Vaseva] Do cases of human rights' violations against Turks  or Bulgarian Muslims exist, according to you?    [Ivanov] Certain conditions are required for implementing a  right. Let us take the question of the mother tongue, for  example. The Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] insists on  introducing the Turkish language as obligatory and claims that  human rights have been violated in this connection. I do not  agree. I think that one cannot force the children of people who  have declared themselves as Turks to learn the Turkish language.  The international convention against discrimination in the  educational sphere stipulates that such studies should be  voluntary. However, in this respect, we should ask the question  -- have the necessary conditions for an effective language  training been provided for? No, they have not been provided  for. The number of teachers is insufficient and their level of  qualification is not adequate.... Perhaps, the training  programs should be revised and more organically integrated with  the educational process as a whole. This is the stand of the  National Education Ministry, which I subscribe to.    [Vaseva] Are you convinced that the Bulgarian state is  capable of effectively opposing the Turkification process in the  Rhodope area?    [Ivanov] Only two of your young colleagues have noticed that  I am discerning between forced Turkification and Turkish  self-identity, but no one really understood it.    I have never questioned the Bulgarian origins of the Muslims  in the Western Rhodope area and have never denied that their  mother tongue is Bulgarian. I am simply defending the right of  ethnic self-identification. It is true that some of those  compatriots have identified themselves as Turks. However, this  is the result of very complicated causes, which should be  carefully analyzed.    [Vaseva] Nevertheless, you do not deny that the Bulgarian  Muslims are subject to forced Turkification?    [Ivanov] We are touching upon an ambiguity in this case,  namely, we must distinguish between coercion and influence, and  establish whose influence we are talking about? The Muslims of  the Western Rhodope area did not identify themselves as Turks  either on 18 November or on 10 December 1989, and they did not  do so during their protest vigil on the eve of 29 December 1989.  On that occasion they demanded the restoration of their names,  by administrative, rather than by law court procedure.    The law court procedure was adopted as a result of a deal  with the participation of Petur Mladenov, Andrey Lukanov, and  Stanko Todorov, on one side, and Dimitur Arnaudov, Branko  Davidov, and Ahmed Dogan, on the other side.    It happened on the eve of passing the Names Act, on 5 March  1990, and it greatly contributed to the ethnic mobilization of  the Muslims in the Western Rhodope area in the direction of  their ethnic Turkish self-identification.    The anti-Turkish demonstration organized by the All-National  Committee for the Defense of National Interests [OKZNI] in  January 1990 also exerted a highly negative effect. I remember  that numerous women from the Rhodope area called on me to  complain, at that time, and I remember their tears. The  subsequent, violent opposition to the introduction of the  Turkish language as the mother tongue also played a decisive  role.    The DPS organized a school boycott in which the Muslims  from the Western Rhodope area were also involved, while the DPS  leaders assumed the political responsibility for the boycott.  If you add the fact that the economic situation in the area has  become disastrous, under the circumstances, and if you realize  that the souls of those people have been troubled for so many  decades, you should understand that they are looking for some  spiritual values to rely upon. Considering the habit of  frequently referring to "them, the Pomaks" as being different  from "us, the Bulgarians," it is easy to perceive the tragedy of  people in that region.    [Vaseva] Why should we not declare at the highest level that  the "Rhodope area is Bulgarian," which would put an end to all  attempts and speculations?    [Ivanov] Actually, President Zhelev said so in his address  to the nation following the 13 October 1991 elections.    [Vaseva] Nevertheless, Mr. Dogan dared to declare that even  the president cannot prevent him from conquering the Rhodope  area and proclaimed this region as a zone of influence belonging  to the DPS!    [Ivanov] I am actually highly disturbed by the last DPS  conference. The manner in which it was conducted, Ahmed Dogan's  address, and the statute that was adopted could be cited in a  text book as typical examples of authoritarian behavior. I think  that when formal conditions are created for a political party to  entirely identify itself with its leader and when this party  identifies itself as speaking on behalf of a large, compact  group, this is not in the interests of Bulgarian democracy.    [Vaseva] Why did Professor Nikolay Genchev call you "an evil  personality" and a "traitor of national interests"?    [Ivanov] You should better ask Prof. Genchev himself. I  would not like to start a polemic with him on such level. We  have serious differences of principle and I am ready to discuss  them with him in a public debate. I will tell you, to begin  with, that I recently attended a seminar, near Burgas, where  Prof. Genchev was also present and at which he expressed his  views on the solution of ethnic relations in our country.  According to him, the Bulgarian Turks should be encouraged to  immigrate to Turkey, or be dispersed throughout the country,  while Bessarabian Bulgarians should be resettled in the  abandoned areas. I am convinced that, in talking about  Bulgarian national interests, ideas such as those expressed by  Prof. Genchev do not make any sense.    [Vaseva] You are a nuclear physicist by profession. Do you  regard yourself as sufficiently competent to advise the  president on ethnic problems?    [Ivanov] I am a specialist in the field of theoretical and  mathematical physics. My original profession has taught me to  think, above all. The rest is a question of knowledge that can  be acquired by reading. The problems we are talking about  require an interdisciplinary approach.    Let the historians not be jealous. They are not the only  ones  entitled to determine how to solve ethnic problems. I highly  appreciate the contribution of economists, sociologists,  lawyers, political scientists, ethnologists, and so forth. I am  trying to coordinate the efforts of all specialists and to learn  from them. Nevertheless, I have the feeling of being  sufficiently competent for my job.</p>

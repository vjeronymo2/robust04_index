			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: London Clubs at Pounds 16.3m as attendance rises 16% London Clubs International, the London casino operator floated on the USM in May, declared a maiden interim dividend of 4.25p as profits rose 17 per cent. The group, which owns the Ritz and five other London casinos, announced pre-tax profits for the six months to September 25 ahead from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 16.3m. Turnover increased by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 81.7m (Pounds 78m). Pro forma earnings per share were 16.5p, up from 16p. Fully diluted earnings per share were 20.2p (29.1p). The shares, floated at 200p, closed at 283p, up 3p. The increase in pre-tax profits reflects sharply lower interest payments of Pounds 1.8m, down from a previous Pounds 5.18m, following the flotation, which raised Pounds 27.5m net of expenses. Profits before interest were lower at Pounds 18.1m, compared with Pounds 19.1m. Mr Alan Goodenough, chief executive, said the fall in profit before interest had been expected, as the previous figure included an exceptional performance at the Ritz. The figures had been flattered by a high incidence of high rollers, and the group's win percentage was much higher than normal. 'We are very pleased to have got so close to the previous figure from a much better balance of business,' he said. The Ritz and Les Ambassadeurs - the two up-market operations - contributed 69 per cent of the interim profits, compared with 84 per cent. Following changes in gaming legislation, the group is introducing two new games next year - Super Pan 9 and a variation of stud poker. Mr Goodenough believes the addition to the traditional roulette, Punto Banco and Blackjack will help to increase attendances, which were 16 per cent ahead for the half. The group is also extending the casino in Taba, opened in June on the border between Israel and Egypt, and has signed a concession for a casino at Hurghada, on the Red Sea coast, to open early next year.</p>

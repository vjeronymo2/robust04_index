			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Just the ticket for meter maids AN ELECTRONIC meter maid system, developed in South Africa, could soon find its way on to streets around the world, alerting traffic wardens to motorists who overstay their alloted welcome. Developed by Telkor, of Johannesburg, each electronic meter monitors parking in up to four carefully labelled parking bays. When the motorist inserts the money into the appropriate slot, an electronic display shows the time allotted. When that time expires the meter begins to flash, telling passing traffic wardens that they need to write a ticket. Alternatively, a loop in the road, which monitors parking in the four bays, can be used to send the information to a central computer, so that a traffic warden can be despatched to catch the culprit. Telkor: South Africa, 11 444 6000; UK, 0242 251 736.</p>

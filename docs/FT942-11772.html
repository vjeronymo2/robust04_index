			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson still in talks with Pepkor Pepkor, the South African retailer, is still holding talks with Brown &amp; Jackson, the troubled discount retailer which last month announced a rescue deal with the Weisfelds, the millionaire couple who created the What Everyone Wants chain. B&amp;J shareholders are scheduled to vote at an EGM next Monday on the plan for Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld to inject Pounds 6m to meet the lossmaking group's immediate working capital needs, in return for a 19 per cent stake and two seats on the board. A Pepkor director said in Johannesburg: 'We certainly are negotiating but discussions are at a very sensitive stage and we cannot yet confirm that we are making a bid for the company.' Neither Mr Christo Wiese, Pepkor's executive chairman, nor Mr CE Moore, the group's finance director, were in South Africa on Monday - even though that was the day of Pepkor's annual results. Both are currently believed to be in England. B&amp;J, which owns the Poundstretcher chain and had been in talks with its bankers, said last night: 'We will not comment on market rumours. Ever since our problems began, a number of people have been in touch. The only people to put a deal on the table are the Weisfelds - and we are pleased with that and them.' Pepkor is Africa's largest mass-market retailer. The group's core business, PEP, retails goods to a predominantly black customer base. Its international presence has been hitherto restricted to Scotland but it has been on the lookout for further international acquisitions. B&amp;J's shares were unchanged at 5 1/4 p yesterday.</p>

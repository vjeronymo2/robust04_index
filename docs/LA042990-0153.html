			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON'S DEFENSE IN S&amp;L CASE  </P> <P> I serve as attorney to Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) in connection with the  current Ethics Committee proceedings. I have thus far not commented publicly  upon that proceeding, a policy also followed by counsel for the other senators  and by counsel to the committee. The article (Part A, April 13) concerning this  matter is so vicious and so inaccurate, however, that I am compelled to request  that you print this letter.  </P> <P> The article bears the headline "Cranston's S&amp;L Defense Weakened." This  headline suggests that something newsworthy has occurred in the Ethics  Committee matter, and the text purports to inform the public that Cranston's  case has had a "major setback" because "investigators" have rejected a "key  argument." According to the article, questions posed to a witness by committee  investigators indicated that they do not accept as significant the fact that  both former chairmen of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board have testified that  nothing the senator did or said affected their decision not to take over  Lincoln Savings. The article describes this testimony as a "central part" of  Cranston's defense and implies that its rejection by investigators signals a  turn for the worse in his case. The speculation of this witness (who insisted  upon anonymity) as to the state of mind of his examiners is thus elevated into  an authoritative comment on the committee's likely decision. That is absurd.  </P> <P> In the first place, Cranston's defense has been and will continue to be the  truth. He did nothing improper or unethical. Whether regulators felt they were  pressured is relevant, but hardly the "central part" of the defense. Second,  the notion that a witness can conclude from the questions being asked how the  questioner views the merits of a case is silly. Third, it is the members of the  committee, and not the investigators, who will decide the legal and factual  issues before them.  </P> <P> If your witness is someone who has an interest in rehabilitating his own  reputation at the expense of Cranston (such persons do play a role in these  events), it is scandalous. You are treating Cranston unfairly in a most  fundamental way, that is by elevating the speculation of a witness whose  credibility is undetermined into something close to Gospel, and making no  effort to inform your readers of fundamental, undisputed facts.  </P> <P> Sen. Cranston deserves an apology and your readers deserve to know the truth.  </P> <P> WILLIAM W. TAYLOR III  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The derivatives sector ended a hectic week on a more subdued note as dealers paused to take profits and lock in gains made earlier in the week, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, early trading in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was influenced by the initial weakness in gilts and, having opened at 3,069, the contract drifted lower, falling to the day's low of 3,062 at around 9.30am. Bargain-hunters returned the September contract to positive territory and it rose to the day's high of 3,090 over the lunchtime period, before a dull Wall Street led to another bout of consolidation. It closed at 3,070, around 7 points above fair value premium on volume of 7,927 lots. The expiry of the index options was meant to be the main event in the traded options, though with much of the position closing having been done on Wednesday and Thursday, it generated little in the way of turnover. Total volume was 28,570 contracts, of which 6,323 was in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,846 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.</p>

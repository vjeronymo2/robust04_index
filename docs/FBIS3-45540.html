			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Khartoum, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Sudanese Foreign  Minister Husayn Abu-Salih stressed here today Chinese-Sudanese  ties have registered considerable growth in various fields.    He described China as a strong supporter of the Third World  countries in the United Nations.    The minister made these remarks in an interview with XINHUA  before the visit to Sudan by Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen .    The Sudanese minister said that despite the reforms in both  countries and changes on the regional and international arenas,  the ties between the two countries follow a correct course of  development.    This is due to their commitment to the five principles of  peaceful coexistence in their foreign policies, he said.    The minister added that the visit to Sudan of the Chinese  vice- premier constitutes a strong push to the relations between  the two countries and is highly appreciated by Sudan.    Salih pointed out that Sino-Sudanese relations have a long  history. The two countries established diplomatic relations in  1959 and Sudan was one of the first countries backing China's  admission into the United Nations.    In 1993, the two countries signed an economic, technical and  commercial agreement covering a wider range of bilateral  cooperation, he added.    The minister stressed Sudan will never forget the assistance  China has rendered in the past.    The forthcoming visit to Sudan by the Chinese vice-premier  will open new spheres for cooperation between the two friendly  countries, he said.    During his stay in Sudan between January 13 and 15, the  senior Chinese official will meet with a number of Sudan's  prominent figures, including President of the Republic 'Umar  Hasan Ahmad al- Bashir, and discuss with Sudanese officials  bilateral, regional and international issues of common concern.  He will also visit a number of enterprises initiated by China  in Sudan.</p>

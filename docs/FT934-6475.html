			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Portugal prepares telecoms sell-off The Portuguese government appears ready to decide in the next few weeks on merging the country's three telecommunications operators into one, leading to partial privatisation. The sale, provisionally scheduled for some time between December next year and May 1995, would increase to three the number of telecommunications privatisations likely in Europe in the next 18 months. Denmark and the Netherlands plan to float part of their state operators next year. Portugal is likely to seek bids for a 'strategic partner' for the unified company. Its telecommunications are currently managed by Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP), which covers communications in Lisbon and Oporto, Telecom Portugal, which handles calls in the rest of the country and connections with Europe, and Marconi Compania Portuguesa de Radio, which deals with intercontinental telecommunications. The state owns 100 per cent of the first two and 51 per cent of the third. As a prelude to the rationalisation, the government earlier this year formed Comunicacoes Nacionais (CN), a holding company to manage the state's interests in the three companies. CN will first merge TLP and Telecom and then begin negotiations with the private shareholders of Marconi. Initially, privatisation is expected to be limited to a stake of 30 per cent or less. 'We will hope for as much national investment as possible,' said one source, 'but we will not put up any barriers to international participation in the privatisation operation.' In a second stage, it is expected that up to 49 per cent will be privatised. Although Portugal has barely 30 exchange lines per 100 people, financial necessity is not believed to be a driving force. Officials claim that Portugal's telecommunication companies will be 'fully capable' of generating the Es150bn-Es200bn (Dollars 862m-Dollars 1.15bn) a year needed to bring the Portuguese network up to the standard of those in the more advanced European Union states.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Grim year for over-borrowed - Nick Garnett revisits some of the companies he has written about THE SHOP'S interior lies gutted and its front window caked in grime. Milk bottles litter the step and a pile of bills and circulars are heaped through the letter box. A poster of pasta twirls swirling in tomato sauce and the name of the defunct business on the shop front are the only clues that this was a food delivery and take-out service. Fasta Pasta, opened in London in 1990 by a former manager of a pizza chain disappeared without trace last year. Among the many new companies written about for this column, 1992 reaped a grim catalogue of failure. In Arundel, west Sussex, receivers were called in during the summer at New Era Cosmetics, a pot pourri and toiletries maker partly owned by a former Body Shop manager. Long experience in a trade is no guarantee of success for an entrepreneur. The Alternative Shooting Company, which offered clay pigeon shooting for corporate and individual clients, never really got off the ground and was, in effect, wound up along with its loans of more than Pounds 100,000. Resurrected with the same name and same owner, minus the debts shouldered by the owner in another holding company, it is trading again though at a tenth of the level its originators hoped for three years ago. In north-east England, Pam Jose's waste recycling business, started in 1989, has endured a gruesome year. The company maintained a tiny profit and Jose has kept her head above water only by a second job as freelance computer consultant. 'When I see the accountant in April we'll have to make a sensible decision about the future of the business,' she says. All this reveals how tiny companies with high borrowings, low margins or both, suffer during recession. Some go under whatever the business climate. But if an enterprise is grossly under-capitalised, a precarious existence might be the best it can hope for. Nonetheless, 1992 was better than might be expected for Minding Your Own Business companies, especially those whose finances are not riddled with death-watch beetle. Some of the larger companies have performed well by doing the opposite of what stock market-quoted concerns are encouraged to do. They have striven to maintain turnover by increasing their ranges of products even at the cost of profit margins. This applies to SMTS which kept its sales above Pounds 500,000 last year, making high-cost collectable miniature-scale cars in Hastings. This has been the path taken by sisters Lexi Douglas and Henrietta Nettlefold with their Sparklers mail order shirt business in Kent. 'For the last financial year, sales were about the same at Pounds 300,000 but we have introduced more varieties and, partly as a result, saw the return drop from 19 to about 14 per cent,' says Douglas. Many tiny enterprises run from home with minuscule overheads have plodded on nicely, avoiding the horrors suffered by bigger brethren. At Leonard Foulkes' Out Of Print Book Service in Cardiff, run from a low-cost building, sales last year dipped just 5 per cent. 'Some mainstream book businesses suffered a 10-20 per cent drop in sales,' Foulkes says. 'I have reduced costs this year partly because renovation work on the building has finished so profits are up.' Foulkes was able to raise his salary above the Pounds 20,000 he paid himself the previous year. Back to the bad news. Surfachem, the chemicals group which had partnered New Era Cosmetics and was forced into a controlling interest in it early last year, eventually called in receivers Touche Ross to its small prodigy. Touche Ross' accounts for June last year showed New Era encumbered with a Pounds 93,000 deficit owing to unsecured creditors. The company, which had bought dried flowers, fragrances and other material for making into pot pourri, after-shaves and fragrance sprays, made losses in both of its full operating years. It started with capital of just Pounds 15,000 and loans of about Pounds 50,000. Retailers and brand name suppliers to which it provided pot pourri forced it into price cuts and recession hit demand. Fasta Pasta's financial structure always looked a bit uncertain. Three years ago, Ben Fox, a young former manager at Pizza Piazza, persuaded his local branch of National Westminster to make a Pounds 72,000 loan of which all but Pounds 20,000 was covered by the government's loan guarantee scheme. Fox put in almost nothing himself. He bought too much pasta-making equipment from Italy, purchased a new jeep and five new mountain bikes for deliveries. Fancy menus and uniforms for the food delivery service in London alone cost Pounds 4,000. The Pounds 72,000 was gobbled up in 18 months. New investors came in and another outlet opened in Clapham but sales of take-out boxes of pasta with prawn and vodka sauce at Pounds 5 never looked an easy prospect. The company continually suffered from weak cash flow and burdensome debts Up in Newcastle, North-East Recycling is still in business but has proved a very difficult experience for Jose. 'Last year was a stinker,' she says. 'We are still struggling to survive. The waste paper side was steady through the year but plastics were badly hit by the recession. Virgin polymer prices fell dramatically so recycled polythene prices were effectively cut in half.' Yearly turnover rose from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 120,000 but profits remained marginal. A surprising number of businesses in catering acquitted themselves well. Moodies, supplying corporate entertainment packages from converted double-decker buses, suffered a bleak year in 1991. '1992 was fabulous,' says owner Jenine Moodie. 'One of the reasons is that we have gone into weddings. We've found we can make Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 5,000 for a day's work. We estimate turnover for the year at about Pounds 600,000 with a return of about 20 per cent.' John and Hazel Milligan bought a derelict pub building in Oxfordshire in the late 1970s, spending Pounds 150,000 to purchase and transform it into the award-winning Falkland Arms. The couple also owned a pub in St Albans which they sold last year, transferring their attentions to the tenancy of The Old Reindeer, Banbury. 'That pub was closed since August,' says Hazel. 'It was run down. We have so far rebuilt the kitchen and cellars. The cost of obtaining the tenancy and doing the building work was about Pounds 50,000. We can't complain about trading at the Falkland Arms. It's about the same level as last year. We haven't put prices up for accommodation and for weekends you have to book four to five months in advance.' An en suite double room with four-poster costs Pounds 45 per night. Laurence and Sue Cowley, could not sell Glazebrook House country hotel in Devon for Pounds 700,000, so they took it off the market last year. 'We are enjoying it now,' says Laurence. 'Turnover was up 15 1/2 per cent, which is unusual for this part of the world. The majority of our business comes from conferences. Business trade is mainly with solicitors, accountants and some larger commercial companies.' Good news for some is not for others. 'There are three country-house hotels near us which have shut down in the past year. Most country hotels are holiday-orientated and are having a desperate time.' Running harder to stay still has been the dominant theme for this column's businesses in 1992. Most were forced to work harder to maintain sales while profit margins deteriorated. 'Considering the climate, we've had a good year with sales rising from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000,' says Adrian Wright, of Watts and Wright, fitted kitchen and bedroom makers in Walsall. 'Margins have suffered and we realise we must move to better premises where the production lay-out is better. It is so competitive even some of the most famous names are doing special sales.' SMTS makes miniature cars which sell from Pounds 40 to Pounds 250. It kept its turnover to about Pounds 550,000, the same as last year and Pounds 100,000 more than in 1990. 'Our margins are a little down because material costs are up and it would have been suicide for us to raise prices,' says co-founder John Allen. 'Re-orders of models are slow to come through and there are few new collectors coming in. We normally introduce about eight new models a year but we have invested in about 15 over the past 12 months which causes an additional cost. Most of our new models get 400 orders or so straight off but over the past year it has been less than 200.' Allen says the company has profited from manufacturing changes introduced after help from the DTI enterprise initiative. The company has also been putting more people on training courses. No matter how bad a recession, some entrepreneurs in quirky businesses will still locate a market. Angus Greenlees last year transferred his exotic skin business from his home to a shop in London's Knightsbridge. With ray-skin bags at Pounds 210 down to eel-skin wallets at Pounds 33, Greenlees abandoned most of his low-margin wholesale activities, concentrating on direct sales to the public. 'In the year to May 1992 we did between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 160,000 business. I'm very pleased overall. The lesson I learned was don't be afraid of prices, make sure you have the quality and you'll find your market.' A lot of the Minding Your Own Business companies detect a few hopeful straws in the coming year's trading wind. Few, though, are expecting it to be an easy 12 months.</p>

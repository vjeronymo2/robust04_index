			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.K. Dhar] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, 1 April -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State  Strobe Talbott, who is arriving here on 6 April, will be clearly  told that even though India is interested in knowing the Clinton  administration's views on resolving Indo-Pak differences,  linking of F-16 supply to Pakistan with a grand design of  nonproliferation in South Asia is unacceptable to it.    India feels that the issue of Pakistan's nuclear capability  and its capping is a bilateral matter between Islamabad and  Washington. It cannot be expected to make a matching commitment  to a proposition which strikes at the root of nonproliferation  and legitimises Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapons programme.    Mr. Talbott, who is expected to meet Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao and other Union Ministers and have discussions  with Foreign Secretary K. Srinivasan and External Affairs  Ministry officials, is likely to unfold his package to establish  a verifiable, comprehensive nonproliferation regime in the  subcontinent by capping nuclear capabilities of both India and  Pakistan and also suggesting a multilateral dialogue on arms  control.    The incentives he has to offer to India to comply with the  Clinton administration's requirements are not known, but what is  talked about privately refers to raising the threshold on  technologies that have so far been denied to it. The suggestion  for a U.S.-sponsored West Asia Type Indo-Pak dialogue on Kashmir  and other issues has been informally mooted but the Indian  reaction will be known only when Mr. Talbott spells out his  proposals in detail.    At present, India is unwilling to commit itself to any such  negotiations without knowing their scope and usefulness. It  will not accept anything which amounts to compromising its  principles because on issues, such as, nonproliferation and  Kashmir it is not easy to reconcile the views held by India and  Pakistan, which has found a supporter in the Clinton  administration for its nuclear adventurist role in South Asia.    The Assistant Secretary of State Ms. Robin Raphel, who spent  five days here, has already tested the temperature and seen the  disposition of New Delhi, will brief Mr. Talbott on her  discussions with the Indian leaders and also accompany him on  his tour of India and Pakistan. Though Ms. Raphel kept a low  profile during her discussions in New Delhi and avoided raking  up fresh controversies, she did not yield ground on any aspect  of the policies that have been laid down for the Clinton  administration in relation to India and Pakistan. It is,  therefore, unlikely that any further pressures from the U.S.  over the nonproliferation issue will work so long as India's  legitimate security requirements are not met and its concept of  complete and universal disarmament is not accepted.    The Indian Government believe that the Clinton  administration  has already taken the decision to supply 36 F-16 aircraft and an  unspecified number of P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare planes  through one-time exception of the Pressler Amendment which  currently bars U.S. military aid to Pakistan. In order to get  the support of the Congress to the move, the administration is  linking it with a broader South Asia initiative on  nonproliferation including capping of the nuclear capabilities  of both India and Pakistan.    But, in effect, Washington is back-sliding on its accepted  policy of nonproliferation in South Asia. It is pre-empting the  whole purpose of the bilateral dialogue between India and  Pakistan by proposing a barter. F-16s, as India has pointed  out, can be easily modified to deliver nuclear weapons as  Pakistan had done in the case of the aircraft it received prior  to the Pressler ban.    Mr. Talbott will surely be told that India is the biggest  victim of proliferation in the region and the U.S. has condoned  acquisition of nuclear capability by Pakistan and is trying to  formalise it so that Islamabad can indulge in the game of  adventurism and blackmail. Therefore, the concept of forcing  India and Pakistan to comply with U.S. nonproliferation goals  while adding to Islamabad's offensive capability through the  supply of F-16 and other aircraft, is totally unacceptable to  India. The supply of F-16s will decisively shift the military  balance in the region in Pakistan's favour, India does not  accept the argument that because of its superior ground forces  it is not facing a real threat from Pakistan as there are  limitations to deploying forces on a single front. While  Pakistan will have, in addition to the F16s, M-11 and other  missiles supplied to it by China deployed against India, New  Delhi is being strongly advised against deploying the Prithvi  missiles along its borders.    Though Pakistan is theoretically under sanctions over the  issue of missile supplies from China, it is widely known that  Beijing has maintained supplies of components of M-11 missiles  with a range of more than 300 km. Therefore, there are no  takers for the argument that resumption of American arms supply  to Pakistan will not change the strategic balance in the  subcontinent.</p>

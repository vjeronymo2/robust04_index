			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MILLION ASK FOR SOAPER MAGAZINE  </P> <P> ABC says more than 1 million fans have signed on as subscribers to a new  magazine devoted to the network's daytime soap opera scene, about a month  before the first issue is even due.  </P> <P> The planned six-times-a-year magazine, Episodes, is promoted as being free, but  subscribing actually costs viewers $3 for the cost of the phone call to sign  up. (The number is 1-900-860-2600.)  </P> <P> Containing articles about the stars and stories of just ABC's four daily  serials ("Loving," "All My Children," "One Life to Live" and "General  Hospital"), the first issue of Episodes is due to be mailed Feb. 20, according  to editor and publisher Amy Dorn Kopelan. The network expects to reach an  initial circulation of 1.5 million.  </P></p>

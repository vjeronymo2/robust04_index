			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / National Savings sales rise SALES of National Savings products recovered last month after a sharp fall in August. Net receipts amounted to Pounds 202m, and to Pounds 314m with accrued interest of Pounds 112m taken into account. Total contribution to government coffers for the financial year so far is Pounds 2.7bn, including accrued interest of Pounds 1bn. Last month's increase follows a fall in receipts in August to Pounds 126m, after a strong rise in July. Gross sales of all products amounted to Pounds 656m. The highest net additions were by fixed-interest savings certificates, which contributed Pounds 132m, and the first option (Pounds 65m). Index linked certificates brought in Pounds 42m. The launch of the first option bond in July caused protest from building societies and, it is widely believed, led the government to cut its rates on National Savings products. Interest rates on deposits and income bonds and deposits were further reduced to 9 per cent gross on September 18. New fixed-interest terms announced on September 28 included 6.75 per cent on 39th issue savings certificates and 8.67 per cent gross on first-option bonds. The total amount invested in National Savings as of the end of September was Pounds 42.5bn.</p>

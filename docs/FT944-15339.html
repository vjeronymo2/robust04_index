			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Feltrim syndicates run by 'gamblers' Underwriters of three Feltrim syndicates at Lloyd's of London ran their businesses like imprudent gamblers, the High Court was told yesterday. The syndicates' total exposures to risk were not properly calculated and inadequate reinsurance was purchased, said Mr Jeremy Cooke QC, opening the case for more than 1,600 Feltrim Names. The Names are suing the underwriters for negligence and are seeking to recover losses of about Pounds 525m. The losses were sustained between 1987 and 1989 by syndicates 540, 542 and 847, which specialised in catastrophe insurance. The syndicates suffered massive losses after disasters such as the 1987 storms and the Piper Alpha oil platform explosion. Mr Cooke said the gap between the exposures of the syndicates and the levels of reinsurance purchased was too big. Nobody running a business prudently would operate on the basis that if certain events took place the business would be destroyed, he said. This amounted to simply gambling on whether those events would happen. He added: 'Even if gambling, no prudent man would put Pounds 200m on a 100-1 outsider unless he knew he had Pounds 200m available should that 100-1 outsider come home first.' The case is expected to last until Christmas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Foivos Karzis] </F>   [Text] Good evening from the Presidential Palace where  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is now meeting U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State Steven Oxman, who arrived in Athens at noon  today.    Oxman had two consecutive meetings with Deputy Foreign  Minister Yeoryios Papandreou this afternoon. They met at the  U.S. Embassy building first and then at the Foreign Ministry.  During his talks with the Greek political leadership, Oxman  will mainly discuss Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia], but will also cover the entire spectrum of Balkan  problems. He will also discuss Cyprus, because Washington is  particularly interested in promoting the confidence-building  measures.    In statements made a short time ago at the Foreign Ministry,  Papandreou and Oxman noted that the upcoming meeting between  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and international mediator  Cyrus Vance is particularly critical. They both said that this  meeting will determine the course of developments. It was  indicative that when referring to the Greek measures against  Skopje, Oxman exuded an atmosphere that was completely different  from the European Union, which intensely pressures Athens.  Oxman said that Washington is really interested in a swift  lifting of the Greek measures, but that he had received  explanations of the reasons that led to the adoption of these  measures. He said Washington is interested helping to restore  communications between Athens and Skopje and meeting the  prerequisites leading to a preliminary agreement to resume the  talks.    Arriving at Ellinikon Airport at noon today, Oxman made it  clear that Washington has no prepared solutions, but wants to  facilitate talks between the two sides. Oxman said:    [Begin Oxman recording in English] We will certainly be  discussing that issue, and I look forward to it. Our role is to  try to be helpful in this situation. I am not bringing some  made-in-American solution. We want to be helpful; we want to  support the efforts of the United Nations, of Cyrus Vance. We  would like to see the situation resolved as promptly as possible  in the interest of regional stability, so that will be one of  the topics among others that we will be discussing. [end  recording]    Oxman will leave for Ankara tomorrow morning, where he said  he will discuss many issues, including the Balkans,  Greek-Turkish relations, and the operation for assisting  Kurdistan that is organized jointly by the United States,  Britain, and France. It will be a visit of particular interest.</p>

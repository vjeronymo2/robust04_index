			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CLU FOOTBALL COACH CALLS DORM HIS HOME  </P> <P> They say you can't go home again, but Joe Harper would sure like to do so.  Harper, the Cal Lutheran football coach, has moved into a Thompson Hall dorm  room on campus rather than try to sandwich the commute to his Arcadia home  around his 15-hour work days.  </P> <P> Harper has been attempting to sell his Arcadia home and move to Thousand Oaks,  but he finds himself, at 54 years old, sharing a double with "roomie" Steve  Spencer, an assistant basketball coach.  </P> <P> So far, Harper hasn't thrown a water balloon or short-sheeted Spencer, and no  one has had to tell either coach to turn down his stereo.  </P> <P> "Weekends get a little noisy, but that's no big deal," said Harper, who never  lived in a dorm while he attended UCLA. "It's been a real different experience  for me, but I'm enjoying it."  </P> <P> Thompson Hall houses numerous transfers, and coincidentally, Harper ended up  next door to his daughter Kerri, a senior transfer from Northern Arizona.  </P> <P> "She's a big help to me," Harper said. "She does my laundry and stuff like  that."  </P> <P> Now, Harper is constantly available to his players, and he says "I have a  greater appreciation for some of the things they do."  </P> <P> Rapid recoveries: Two weeks ago at the Moorpark Cross-Country Invitational,  Glendale's Hugo Allan Garcia took a wrong turn while leading and went 75 meters  off the course. However, Garcia recovered to win and set a course record.  </P> <P> On Friday at the Mira Costa Invitational, while leading with less than 200  meters remaining, Garcia went 40 meters astray -- and again held on for the  victory.  </P> <P> "It was real confusing at the finish line last week, even the women's leader  went the wrong way," Glendale Coach Ed Lopez said. "We're going to make sure he  knows the way this week. We can't afford for him to get lost again."  </P> <P> Glendale will compete Friday at Arroyo Verde Park in Ventura in the first of  three Western State Conference meets that will be used to determine the WSC  standings.  </P> <P> Making good: Washington State quarterback Brad Gossen, formerly of Westlake  High, rebounded from a poor performance against Wyoming to pass for 323 yards  in a 50-36 loss to Brigham Young. Gossen completed 25 of 42 passes, including  touchdowns of 49 and seven yards. . .  </P> <P> Sean Burwell, formerly of Cleveland High, rushed for 126 yards in 22 carries in  Oregon's 55-23 victory over Idaho. . .  </P> <P> Russell White did some damage in California's 52-24 loss to Miami before he  left the game with 12 minutes remaining in the first half because of a thigh  injury. White returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter.  The former Crespi High standout is expected to start Saturday against  Washington State. . . .  </P> <P> Cal's Cornell Collier, a linebacker from Taft High, recovered two fumbles in  the game and linebacker David Wilson, formerly of Reseda High, recovered a  fumble and made five tackles.  </P> <P> Long-distance serve: CSUN setter Beth Welch is not afraid to try new things. No  wonder she volunteered when assistant coach Angela Brinton-Collins suggested  that one player serve from 20 feet behind the service line to give opponents a  different angle from which to handle a serve.  </P> <P> Little did Welch know what she bargained for. Often, she is backed up against a  wall or a water fountain. And fans have unwittingly cut across the court in  front of her just as she was about to serve.  </P> <P> The early returns have surpassed expectations, however. Welch has served up a  team-high 37 aces, including seven against 15th-ranked USC on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Between the lines: Against Occidental on Saturday night, Whittier had more  offensive snaps, 70-57; more first downs, 15-12; rushing yards, 109-96; and net  yards, 212-211; . . . and 25 fewer points.  </P> <P> Occidental won, 38-13.  </P> <P> Bruin power: Eliazar Herrera and Richard Erbes, probably the top two high  school distance runners from Glendale in the past five years, helped UCLA  finish third in the Fresno Cross-Country Invitational on Saturday at Woodward  Park.  </P> <P> Herrera, who graduated from Hoover High in June, was the Bruins' No. 1 man,  finishing fifth with a time of 25 minutes 20.1 seconds over the five-mile  course. Erbes, a 1987 graduate of Glendale High, was UCLA's No. 4 runner,  placing 29th in 25:57.6.  </P> <P> Heads up: Soccer goals can be as rare as total eclipses, but in a 12-0 victory  over La Verne on Monday, it was all Coach George Kuntz could do to keep his Cal  Lutheran women from scoring more goals.  </P> <P> He limited the number of times his players could touch the ball with their feet  before they passed or kicked it, but Cal Lutheran nonetheless led, 8-0, at  halftime. By the second half, the players could only touch the ball once. If  they touched it and didn't shoot or pass it, they simply had to give up the  ball.  </P> <P> The margin climbed, and when the score reached 12-0, Kuntz told his players  they could only head the ball into the goal. At one point, Rachel Wackerman  dribbled the ball away from the front of the goal and tried to pass it to a  teammate for a header.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive blowout victory for a team in only its second  year.  </P> <P> "Our program is headed in the right direction," Kuntz said.  </P> <P> Staff writers Theresa Munoz, John Ortega, Brendan Healey and Kirby Lee  contributed to this notebook.  </P> <P> WSC VS. THE LONE STAR  </P> <P> The Western Football and Lone Star are considered among the top Division II  football conferences in the nation. Last season, the conferences split six  games in head-to-head competition. But this season, the WFC has taken a big  upper hand, winning all five contests. Cal State Northridge, which travels to  Central (Okla.) State for a game on Saturday, will try to keep that record  perfect.  </P> <P> 1989  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.77IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> WFC  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Lone Star  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Portland St. 12  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Texas A&amp;I 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> So.

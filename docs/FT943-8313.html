			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Nigerian oil strike leaders 'sacked' Nigeria's military government last night paved the way for a showdown with the civilian opposition, sacking the leadership of the trade unions responsible for the country's crippling oil workers' strike. In a national broadcast General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military leader, appeared to rule out early release of Chief Moshood Abiola, whose detention on treason charges triggered the strike, which has cut vital oil exports by nearly half. Gen Abacha said it was up to the courts to decide whether Mr Abiola, presumed winner of last year's annulled presidential election, should be freed. International oil prices rose yesterday as Gen Abacha's anticipated moves heightened concern about increased turmoil. Benchmark Brent crude futures for October delivery climbed back above Dollars 17 a barrel in late London trading, up some 40 cents from Tuesday's close. Gen Abacha also sacked the leaders of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), responsible for a partially successful national strike call. This strike, suspended at the end of last week, was due to resume later this week. He placed the two oil unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, and the NLC, which represents more than 40 other unions, under government-appointed administrators. Gen Abacha branded strikes in support of Mr Abiola as illegal and 'economic sabotage'. He appealed to union members to go back to work and offered them government protection. Gen Abacha gave no hint of compromise with political opponents, describing them as motivated by local, ethnic or personal interests. Recent strikes have caused fuel shortages and closed most banks and factories in the commercial centre of Lagos and the south-west. The head of state tried to outmanoeuvre his opponents by lifting the wholesale ban on political activity which he imposed last November, but said political parties could not be formed until guidelines were set in the constitutional conference in Abuja. This opens the way for the 360 conference delegates to start planning their moves, although parties and elections are not due until early next year. Mr Abiola's supporters and pro-democracy groups have boycotted the conference, which they say is unnecessary as Nigeria already has a constitution but has not been ruled constitutionally. Nupeng, the junior oil workers' union, last week predicted that a union ban would lead to 'violent reactions from all sectors of the oil industry' and 'from our people in the oil communities' in the oil-rich but impoverished Niger delta. The minority tribes from this region are the backbone of the two oil unions, which have been on strike for over six weeks, demanding an end to military rule, the installation of Mr Abiola as president and better management of the state-dominated oil industry. The ban increases the risk of confrontation between senior and expatriate staff, who have maintained production of crude oil at about 75 per cent of normal, and the strikers, who have threatened and in some cases attacked staff and equipment in exposed oilfields.</p>

Leaders of the government and the  seven coalition parties reached the decision to hold the fourth  meeting of an economic forum of the government and the  coalition, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said at  a news conference.    The meeting was originally set for Wednesday morning but was  called off after the representatives of the coalition agreed on  the need for further discussion on proposed income tax cuts and  an alternative tax revenue among themselves.    At Wednesday's meeting of the leaders of the government and  the ruling parties, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata proposed  resuming the talks on tax as early as possible to help  facilitate the formulation of the fiscal 1994 national budget,  Hatoyama said.    All the others present agreed to reopen the meeting of the  economic committee to continue debate on how to finance  anticipated income tax reduction, on which the coalition parties  are split, according to the deputy chief cabinet secretary.    Hata, who doubles as deputy prime minister, heads the  economic forum of the government and the coalition parties.    The panel, formed on the orders of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, met three times in late December.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Black Arrow A marked improvement in activity helped Black Arrow Group, the furniture and leasing company, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 346,000 to Pounds 1.13m in the half year to September 30. Turnover grew 68 per cent, from Pounds 7.64m to Pounds 12.8m. However, Mr Arnold Edward, chairman, cautioned that he did not wish at this stage to predict the full year results because of the 'fragility of the economy'. With earnings per share well ahead at 2.93p (0.78p), the interim dividend is doubled to 1p.</p>

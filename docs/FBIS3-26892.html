			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chris Patten Exposes His Own Ugliness in His </F> Trip to Australia"]    [Text] Chris Patten will put the first part of his  constitutional reform package to the vote at the Legislative  Council [Legco] on 23 February. Yesterday Chris Patten said in  Australia that the first part of the constitutional package has  won the support of most Legco members and is expected to be  passed intact. Meanwhile, the British side announced that, now  that the first part of the package has been passed, Chris Patten  will very soon put forward the second part of his constitutional  reform package "without delay" and push it through in the same  manner. Chris Patten is seizing the opportunity to step up his  efforts to bring his ideas into reality and render Hong Kong a  quasi-independent [ban du li 0584 3747 4539] political entity in  order to extend British influence in the colony.    Before embarking on this political gamble, Chris Patten  racked his brains to garner public opinion in support of his  constitutional reform package. He arranged a visit to  Australia, once again playing the international card. After  this trip, he will immediately rush back to Hong Kong to push  through the first part of the constitutional package. It is  obvious that these activities are two closely linked,  consecutive steps in a schedule which was meticulously drawn up  beforehand.    In Australia, Chris Patten delivered speeches in a righteous  tone, declaring that the purpose of his Australian trip is to  ask the Australian people "to extend assistance to Hong Kong"  and "to defend the value of democracy." He encouraged Australia  to "support democracy in Asia," boasted about his constitutional  reform package, and spoke extravagantly, assuring the Western  countries that his constitutional package was bound to overcome  China's objections. He brazenly publicized the relationship  between his package and the demise of the socialist system and  fiercely attacked the idea of one country, two systems: "No  totalitarian regime can coexist peacefully with a free economy  for any substantial amount of time. The collapse of communism  and its replacement with the free market offers a lesson to the  entire world as well as Asia."    This remark vividly defines the Far East mission that Chris  Patten is undertaking in his capacity as the last governor of  Hong Kong and exposes his real motive in inducing international  forces to intervene in Hong Kong in support of his  constitutional reform package -- he wants to resist China's  resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and opposes the idea of  "one country, two systems." Chris Patten has openly challenged  China's sovereignty, as he maintains that it is impossible for  two systems to coexist peacefully within a country. He has not  only strongly maligned the Asian countries' successful  experiences in maintaining a balance between social stability  and economic prosperity, but he has also slandered socialism as  a totalitarian system and has pronounced a curse on China,  saying that the Chinese Government is bound to collapse. Based  on his mistaken appraisal of the situation, Chris Patten went  all out to confront China in the vain hope that his attempt  would succeed. Thus one can anticipate his repeated failures in  the future.    Going against the trend, he is playing the international  card  everywhere he goes and is trying to pull together an  anti-Chinese camp. He has failed in this attempt, however, as  very few people are echoing his appeal. The Australian  Government has simply ignored his call for support for his  constitutional reform package, giving him a direct rebuff. That  is why Chris Patten is now trying to explain away his vain  attempt, saying that his current visit to Australia is not  trying to seek support for his constitutional reform package but  for the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He is just hoping to  gloss over his awkward position.    Meanwhile, former Australian Prime Minister John Malcolm  Fraser wrote to a newspaper to acutely expose Chris Patten's  bluff and lie, pointing out that Patten knows little about Asia  and Hong Kong and that his constitutional reform is mischief  aimed at creating chaos in Hong Kong. Fraser refuted Chris  Patten's absurd assurance that "even if the Australian  Government supports the constitutional reform package, it will  neither affect Australia's economic and trade relations with nor  its investments in China." Fraser pointed out that, if  Australia wants to strengthen its relations with Asian  countries, it should strongly urge Chris Patten to withdraw his  rash and mistaken policy. Prime Minister Keating declared long  ago that he was not interested in the Patten package. During  his meeting with Chris Patten yesterday, he absolutely refrained  from touching on Chris Patten's constitutional reform package,  nor did he express any intention of supporting it. Keating did  not shake hands with Chris Patten before reporters, because  shaking hands with him as the governor to a colony would not be  in keeping with Australia's political goal of becoming a  republic. The Australian mass media have played down Chris  Patten's visit. Many local Chinese community leaders, as well  as figures from the business circles, have expressed their  views, noting that what Chris Patten has been doing in Hong Kong  is unpopular with the Australian Chinese community. Chris Patten  has found himself in a very isolated position, and his mission  will prove fruitless.    Chris Patten opposes the Asian countries' policy that  places political stability before economic development. His  preaching has been refuted by Australian scholars. Before Chris  Patten came to Hong Kong, the territory had properly handled the  relationship between stability and prosperity as well as its  relations with the Chinese mainland, thus maintaining sustained  high economic growth. The Asian countries have established  their unique political-economic model in light of the local  historical and cultural realities and based on their own  interpretation of human rights, which is different from that of  the Western countries. As a result, they have created economic  miracles and have emerged as a region which has enjoyed the most  rapid economic growth in the world in recent years. In the  meantime, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have  mistakenly copied the western model. Being too anxious for  quick success, they introduced drastic changes which have  resulted in civil wars, economic decline, a worsening public  security situation, and poverty and starvation among the people.  As the Asian people uphold their Asian social development  model, Chris Patten's fantasy of forcing Western value concepts  into Asia is bound to arouse criticism from the Asian world.    While in Australia, Chris Patten has also talked glibly  about  the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The  very soul of the Joint Declaration is China's resumption of  sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, on which date Britain  will return Hong Kong to China, and then all Hong Kong affairs  will become China's internal affairs, and China will apply the  principle of one country, two systems to Hong Kong in accordance  with the Basic Law. If Chris Patten thinks that his  manipulation of Legco will enable him to push through his  constitutional reform package and then have it extended beyond  1997, then he is certainly making a terrible mistake. According  to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, international law, and  the Basic Law, no colonial government has the right to establish  any organizations of political power on behalf of the Special  Administrative Region government which is to rule the territory  after 1997. Therefore, Chris Patten's constitutional reform  will be short-lived, and the three-tier councils he is to  establish will inevitably be dismissed on 1 July 1997.</p>

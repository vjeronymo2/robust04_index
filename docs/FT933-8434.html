			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Management: Home is where the office is - Employers are adopting a far more flexible approach to traditional working practices When Donna Cunningham, media relations manager for Bell Labs, goes to work in the morning, she simply walks from the kitchen of her house, deep in the woods of Vermont, to a small room she uses as her office. Headquarters is a six-hour drive away in New Jersey, but Cunningham says she keeps in touch easily through a host of technologies from electronic mail to video conferen-cing. 'I get a tremendous amount of work done,' says Cunningham. 'The biggest distraction I might have here is if a deer happens to pass by my window.' Cunningham is part of a growing trend in the US which is not only allowing, but actively encouraging, employees to work outside the office. A distance of six hours is still more than most employers are willing to put up with, but the traditional notion of an office as a place workers must report to every day is giving way to a far more flexible approach. Home offices are just part of the new trend. Companies are making heavy use of telecommuting, a policy which allows employees to go to the office one or two days a week and spend the rest of the time with clients or working at home. Several groups have also pioneered the concept of 'hoteling', a systemised policy of office-sharing for workers who spend a small portion of their time at the office. Companies have been experimenting with the concept of working from home and telecommuting for more than a decade. However, over the past few years several groups have formalised the approach, incorporating large numbers of employees into the plan. 'We've been practising telecommuting informally for years, but now, we've adopted it as a formal policy,' says Susan Sears, district manager of AT&amp;T in Phoenix, Arizona. One management consultant firm, Buck Consultants, estimates that between 10 and 20 per cent of the US workforce will spend a significant amount of time working at home by the end of the century. The concept, companies say, is working well. According to an AT&amp;T survey, 83 per cent of the 45 employees involved in a pilot telecommuting programme in Phoenix for the past few years said they had increased their productivity, and 80 per cent of their supervisors agreed. International Business Machines also noted an increase in productivity following the implementation of telecommuting programmes a few years ago. Today, more than one third of the IBM workforce does some portion of their work at home. A number of large US companies, including IBM, AT&amp;T, Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur Andersen and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, say they are adopting the telecommuting concept as a key management strategy. 'We certainly plan to expand the programme,' says Michael Bell, director of corporate real estate at Dun &amp; Bradstreet. 'It's been a tremendous success.' Employers say workers under telecommuting and work-at-home programmes are more efficient because they have fewer distractions and waste far less time commuting. Russell Thomas, a specialist on telecommuting with AT&amp;T says: 'Before we adopted telecommuting we had situations that people would drive one and a half hours to the office, stay for a few hours, drive an hour to visit a client, come back to the office, then leave for the day. Obviously, there was a big loss in productivity going on.' In response, AT&amp;T launched the concept of the 'virtual office', a mobile office, complete with laptop computer and fax, which the employee could use in a hotel, branch office, or at home. A number of factors are adding to the telecommuting impetus. One of the most important is the Clean Air Act, which by 1996 will force many companies in the US to cut the number of miles driven by single-car commuters by 25 per cent. The aim of the new law is to reduce vehicle pollution in the smog-ridden metropolitan areas. Kenneth Maikiewicz, a transportation consultant with Raymond Keyes Consultants, says: 'Companies will use telecommuting as one important way of reducing vehicle trips.' Improvements in technology are also fuelling the trend. 'Technology is the key to making all this work,' says Michael Thompson, operations and facilities director at Ernst &amp; Young. 'We give people faxes, notebook computers, everything they need to work outside the office.' With technologies such as cellular telephones and electronic mail moving into widespread use, companies predict telecommuting will become easier. Improved computer data access will also play an important role. 'We are giving employees the capability of accessing all company files from a home computer,' says Thompson. 'It will make telecommuting even more efficient.' Increasing cost-consciousness has also encouraged companies to consider telecommuting as a formal strategy. 'When the economy was booming,' says Thompson, 'companies didn't care as much about real estate costs. But that's become a real issue now.' Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software cut real estate expenses by 30 per cent through the use of telecommuting, even after buying high-technology home equipment for workers, according to Jennifer Oden, director of real estate and services at the group. Ernst &amp; Young, in its Chicago office, has adopted a strategy of employee expansion with no added space. A year ago, the firm pioneered the concept of 'hoteling', a sophisticated office-sharing plan, to help it meet its cost-cutting goals. Under 'hoteling', employees who spend a lot of time with clients - including auditors and management consultants - are not assigned a permanent desk. They are expected to spend most of their time outside the office, and when they plan a visit, they must call to reserve a place. On the day an employee is expected in the office, all calls are automatically forwarded to that extension, and the information appears on a computerised 'staff locator system' to help colleagues find co-workers. A small staff of 'hoteling managers' makes sure the employee's nameplate is placed on the door and will even put family photos on the desk to make the employee feel at home. Of course, telecommuting does pose some disadvantages to both worker and supervisors. Ernst &amp; Young complains of workers with a strong territorial instinct, who try to take exclusive hold of a temporary office. Employees sometimes worry about their chances of promotion if they are out of the office for long periods of time. 'It would be extremely difficult for me to move up in the company,' says Cunningham of Bell Labs. 'But I accepted that when I agreed to work at home.' Other workers may have unrealistic ideas about the benefits of telecommuting. 'You have to screen workers carefully before you put them into a programme like this,' says Charles Rodgers, president of Rodgers &amp; Associates, a management consultancy special-ising in telecommuting issues. 'Some mistakenly believe that this will be a solution to their child-care problems. Others might miss the stimulation of conversing with co-workers and still others may not have the self-motivation to make this work.' The biggest obstacle to a successful telecommuting programme, though, may be the resistance of management. 'A lot of supervisors are uncomfortable with this arrangement,' says Rodgers. 'Many mangers have the idea that visibility equals productivity. They feel if they can't see the work being done, it isn't getting done.' Despite some resistance on the part of employees and supervisors, companies say the concept works well. 'It improves productivity, helps us address environmental issues and cuts down on real estate costs,' says Ann Riley, project leader for work life programmes at IBM. 'It is an extremely successful programme which we will certainly take as far as we can.'</p>

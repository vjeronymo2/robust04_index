			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Miami news correspondent Marcos Castellon by </F> journalist Roberto Cavada and unidentified announcer at the  Radio Rebelde studio in Havana on the "Doing Radio" program --  live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Announcer]: You have been  listening to that voice, one you are accustomed to hearing on  the "Doing Radio" program. For a month or so now, we have been  chatting with Marcos Castellon in Florida; but now we have him  here, live, in person, a guest at the [emigre] conference and a  guest on our program today. Good morning. [passage omitted]    [Cavada] Marcos, I think we could begin -- and later go into  other things -- with last night's big news, which is that Cuban  President Fidel Castro received all the participants at a  reception. Very briefly, what did you think of the meeting? How  was it?    [Castellon] The first thing I have to tell you is that we  all  attended. I think everyone who was invited to the conference was  there last night at the Convention Center [place as heard]. And  everything unfolded within the atmosphere that prevailed  throughout the conference: a climate of complete normalcy.    We all had the opportunity to say hello to President Fidel  Castro. In many cases he recalled details -- because there were  many people with whom he had had contact in the past, at some  other stage in his life. Then he moved into the hall where we  were all talking. But a climate of complete normalcy. I mean, in  the same tone in which all this has been unfolding. It was very  interesting. [passage omitted]    [Cavada] In this connection, Marcos, what do you think --  apart from the point that you noted -- were other important  things about the conference?    [Castellon] I would like to highlight a conclusion that I  have drawn, and I hope that many of us who participated in the  conference also understood it this way. One thing became clear:  First, the very fact of convening the conference, as was pointed  out several times, is a demonstration of firmness but is, above  all, a demonstration of respect and, I could also say, of  humility. The only thing the Cuban authorities have asked of  this group of us who have come to Havana, the only thing that  has been asked of us is understanding. Nothing more.    [Cavada] People were saying, before the conference took  place, that it was going to be a failure. Or rather, not a  failure but what the Cuban Government wanted it to be, because  it was a meeting among friends -- that there would be no  divergent opinions. After spending three days yourself, sitting  there, listening, and participating, is that the way it was?    [Castellon] Look, aside from the testimony you people, and  all the Cuban and international press, have been able to gather  through all those interviews, about the diversity of opinion  there was among us, I can guarantee that I know personally, and  live with, in Miami, many of the people who were there; I know  how they think. I know what their ideological and political  backgrounds are. Basically, if there is one thing we have in  common, it is that there are no fanatics among us...    [Cavada] Yes.    [Castellon] But within that lack of fanaticism, there is  extraordinary diversity, an extraordinarily broad gamut of  differences in ways of thinking. This has not been a meeting of  friends. It cannot be denied that there are friends among the  participants; but there are also others who are not such great  friends. And others who are frankly not friends at all.    [Announcer] But, as Eusebio Leal was saying, decent people.    [Castellon] Yes, indeed. And everything unfolded in a  climate  of absolute respect for the differences, on both sides. Because  the point is not to accentuate differences but rather to seek  out that which unites us, and build on that. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] All right, so you are leaving tomorrow morning.  And day after tomorrow, you will be informing us.    [Castellon] Indeed I will. We will continue "Doing Radio"  from Miami, and now with even greater reason, for you people  here in Havana.

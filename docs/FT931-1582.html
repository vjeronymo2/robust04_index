			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Fight to save G-Plan range ATTEMPTS were being made last night to save the G-Plan furniture range and 480 jobs after the company asked its bankers to call in administrative receivers. G-Plan, one of the best-known furniture brands, was bought a year ago by The Cabinet Maker which had plans to expand the company. However it fell victim to the recession, and efforts to refinance the group failed. The workforce of 480 is spread between its base in Bath and Lympne, Kent, and King's Lynn, Norfolk. Joint administrative receivers Mr Cedric Clapp and Mr Christopher Hill, from accountants Ernst &amp; Young, are seeking buyers for the operation.</p>

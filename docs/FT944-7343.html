			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Egypt forms gas-to-Israel group - Pipeline across Sinai planned by venture with Amoco and ENI Egypt has taken the first steps towards the eventual export of gas to Israel by forming a Dollars 150m joint venture company with two oil companies, Amoco of the US and ENI of Italy. The venture plans to build a gas pipeline from Port Said, at the entrance of the Suez Canal, to the Israeli border. The state-owned Egypt Gas will own one third of the company, with Amoco and ENI each holding a third. Company and Egyptian officials said the joint venture would build a series of gas pipes in Egypt, with the export pipeline to Israel a priority. At the Israelis' request, Egyptian and Israeli officials held a series of high-level talks about exporting Egyptian gas over the past year. Mr Hamdi al-Banbi, Egypt's oil minister, then agreed in principle to the project, but said exports would depend on a substantial rise in Egypt's provable reserves. The announcement of the joint venture company follows a recent series of gas discoveries in the Nile Delta, the Mediterranean basin north of Sinai and the Western Desert. These have lifted proven gas reserves to 21,000bn cubic feet. Egyptian officials said they believed this would soon rise to 24,000bn cu feet. The leap in reserves, which stood at only 12,000bn cu feet a year ago, will enable Egypt both to continue its long-standing programme to turn all the country's electric stations over to gas power while also allowing exports, officials said. The new company, which must still win formal approval from the country's General Investment Organisation, is expected to start work next year on the proposed 250km pipeline to Israel at an expected eventual cost of Dollars 300m. Egyptian officials said they did not yet know what volumes of gas might be exported. However, Israeli needs have been estimated at 200m cu feet a day in 1998 rising to an eventual 600m cu feet by 2000 - much of it for industrial use. However, Mr Wafik Meshref, a vice chairman of the state-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Company, said the first pipeline would extend to 'Israel, Palestine and even eventually Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey'. Mr al-Banbi is understood to have told his Israeli counterpart in August that Egypt could be ready to start exports by 1998. Mr Meshref said the company was also expected to build a long-awaited pipeline to link recent substantial finds in Egypt's Western Desert to the eventual export pipeline. At first the export pipeline is expected to be fed from the North Port Said concession, operated by the International Egyptian Oil Company, an ENI/Agip subsidiary. The tract embraces a trio of gas fields with proven reserves of more than 6,000bn cu feet. He said the new company could begin building the pipeline next year with completion expected within two years, by which time recent gas finds in the Mediterranean should be coming on stream.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Salomon agrees Dollars 290m settlement in bond scandal SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday agreed to pay Dollars 290m in fines and compensation to settle charges relating to its alleged illegal activities in the US Treasury markets between 1989 and 1991. Criminal charges, however, will not be filed against the firm, although criminal investigations of individuals and other firms involved in the Salomon case continue. In an additional penalty against Salomon, the firm was suspended for 60 days from engaging in transactions with the New York Federal Reserve. The New York Fed said it would resume trading with Salomon on August 3, when its previous ban on the firm bidding in Treasury auctions for customers - imposed immediately after the scandal broke last August - will also be lifted. The suspensions, however, do not affect Salomon's status as a primary dealer in government securities with the Fed, which it retains. After yesterday's settlements were announced, Salomon said that it would take a pre-tax charge of Dollars 185m in the second quarter of this year, which, with the Dollars 200m set aside last year, will go towards covering the cost of the penalties and legal costs related to the roughly 50 private lawsuits that have been filed against the firm in the wake of the bond trading scandal. The Dollars 290m settlement ends a 10-month joint investigation launched by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department in August 1991, when federal authorities discovered that members of Salomon's bond trading desk had faked customer orders and bid beyond government limits in Treasury auctions. The SEC also said yesterday that during the investigation it was discovered that in August 1989 another primary dealing firm secretly bid for Dollars 3.5bn in government securities on Salomon's behalf by concealing the real identity of the bidder in its records of the transaction. Officials at the SEC declined to identify the primary dealer involved. There was no comment on what action might be taken in light of the discovery. Of the money Salomon has agreed to pay for its actions, Dollars 190m represents fines and forfeitures for violating US securities laws, and Dollars 100m will be placed in a fund to compensate victims of the violations. The settlement, however, does not affect the private lawsuits filed against Salomon by clients and individuals who claim they suffered losses because of the firm's activities. The penalties imposed on Salomon yesterday were generally regarded by analysts as sizeable but not threatening to the firm's survival. The news was certainly well-received on Wall Street, with Salomon shares jumping Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 .</p>

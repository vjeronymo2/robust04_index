			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Atlanta prepares itself for a tidal wave - The 1996 hosts are promising to avoid cuteness WHISPER it not in Georgia but the lowest Nielsen TV audience ratings for the Barcelona Olympics in any US city have been in - Atlanta. The capital of the New South and host for the 1996 Olympics appears to have switched off in a big way. 'We have an explanation for that,' confided Billy Payne, without apparent embarrassment. Payne heads Atlanta's organising committee. 'During the opening few days our baseball team, the Braves, were in the middle of the longest winning streak in their history. If I'd been home I'd be watching them too.' Payne is the kind of warm southerner who can use words like shucks without difficulty. In the past month, Atlanta has sent close to 120 personnel to Barcelona to observe how to run the Games. Every Spanish venue manager has had a Georgian behind him with a stopwatch and clipboard. Transport co-ordinators have been telling the Americans what is going on. Since the '96 Games were awarded to Atlanta two years ago, Barcelona has been the first chance to see how things work in real life. And there will not be another opportunity for hands-on experience. The knowledge is both vital but possibly misleading. 'The ultimate lesson is that you don't want to copy anybody. Each Games is unique,' said Payne. 'We're enormously impressed with things here in Barcelona but we know that we'll do it differently in Atlanta. The cultural differences get in the way, and in any case you're not comparing apples with apples.' Atlanta's Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) knows well that the world will expect the mechanics of the 1996 Games - TV facilities, computers, accommodation and so on - to function with invisible American efficiency. 'Heaven help us if we get the hardware wrong,' says Payne. Everyone concerned with Olympic planning agrees that in many ways it is a frustrating business. One senior Atlanta aide likens it to building a Dollars 1.5bn corporation, running on roller bearings - and then dismantling it after 16 days of efficient, powerful life. Since Georgia's capital already has almost all the roads, sports venues and hotels it requires, its position is very different from Barcelona's. 'We are determined to have trained our volunteers and service providers well in advance of when Barcelona has done it,' said Payne. The number of people involved is likely to be close to 50,000. Those who have observed Americans in Europe will know that 'cultural cringe' is not a phenomenon confined to Australasia. A large team of journalists sent to Catalonia by the Atlanta Constitution newspaper have been telling the folks back home that nothing Georgia has to offer can compare with the cultural depth, architecural riches and general elan of Barcelona. 'I thought we'd climbed the inferiority mountain once,' sighed Billy Payne. 'When we bid for the Games so many people asked: 'Against Athens] How can you?' Of course Barcelona is marvellous and the architectural backdrop is marvellous, but they have been at it 600 years longer than us.' Payne is anxious to reassure the world that it will not have a large helping of apple pie and cuteness forced down its throat. 'We are very definitely not aiming for a statement about America,' said Payne. 'Our focus will be the emotions and traditions of the Olympic movement.' Meanwhile, Robert Brennan, communications head for ACOG, will have the task of taking home slides, videotapes and written material from Barcelona to brief and train the growing staff back in the US. He is only partly optimistic about its impact. 'I can describe a tidal wave to you. I can show you photos of it coming up the beach. But until you've been hit by one you have no idea in the world what it's like.'</p>

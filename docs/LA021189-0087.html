			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HUG A RAIDER' BENEFIT MONDAY  </P> <P> It's "Hug a Raider Day" on Monday, and from all reports, the players lever as  much grade-A gusto into the embrace as they do into a football game; maybe  more, considering their 1988 record.  </P> <P> Cost of a hug, plus an autographed photo, is $1, proceeds to the America Heart  Assn., and association spokewoman Nann Miller virtually guarantees value.  "They'll hug you as long as you want," says Miller, veteran of all seven  previous fund-raisers. "You'll get your dollar's worth and then some."  </P> <P> Raiders represented will be Stefon Adams, Vance Mueller, Jerry Robinson, John  Gesek and Reggie McKenzie, while five Raiderettes will be on hand to  accommodate those males not entirely enamored of hugging a football player.  </P> <P> Raiderettes will be in uniform, Raiders in "full hugging gear, which generally  means sweats," Miller says. "Football pads tend to hamper the maneuver. . . ."  </P> <P> Time is 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Place is the Garden Level of the Broadway Plaza,  750 W. 7th St. (at Hope Street).  </P> <P> "Try it, you'll like it," Miller says. "They really put a lot of, uh, Raider  into it!" DICK RORABACK  </P></p>

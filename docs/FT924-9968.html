			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Decision time for water company investors - Prospects for the sector which has been one of the best performers this year WATER shares rose yesterday as investors looked forward to the half-year results season, which kicks off today with figures from Thames Water. This is the sixth results season since the 10 water and sewerage companies were privatised in 1989, and like the others, it raises questions about whether they are balancing the interests of customers and shareholders, and about the benefits of privatisation. Ofwat, the industry regulator, will consider those questions formally in 1994 when it conducts its periodic review of the companies' K numbers, the amount by which they are allowed to raise prices above the rate of inflation. However, in the past year the short-term attractions of the shares have prevailed over the threat of tighter regulation in 1994. Water companies have been one of 1992's best performing sectors, rising by nearly 40 per cent and outperforming the stock market by about 30 per cent. Investors have reached for the security of water companies' high yields and low risk while recovery in the wider economy remains elusive. The decision facing investors at this time is whether that performance can continue. The most encouraging news is likely to be dividends - the main reason for the sector's rise yesterday. Brokers are expecting increases of about 9 per cent in the half-year payment, compared to some 10 per cent on average last year, and about 3 per cent last year for the market overall. Dividend cover for most companies should also be around the past figure of three times. Mr Andrew Stone, analyst at Daiwa Investment Research, said: 'Until we see some hard news such as a cut in interest rates, you cannot get much safer dividends.' There are also unlikely to have been surprises in the results from the companies' core or regulated water and sewerage businesses as revenues will have risen in line with prices, although lower demand from businesses may have held back revenues in the south. Average water charges, which rose 15.5 per cent in the year to March 1992, are set to increase by only 9.7 per cent overall in the current year. Immediate regulatory uncertainty has diminished following Ofwat's ruling last month on next year's price increases. Most companies have struck a two-year deal, in which prices will still rise by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent, nearly double the rate of inflation. However, there are several areas of concern, which could tip the balance for investors deciding whether to hold on to the shares. Companies are heading into their period of highest capital expenditure, and most will move soon from having net cash to net debt. Gearing is expected to peak within the next four years, with interest cover falling to around two times for some. Investors will want reassurance that the capital spending plans are still on target. Water companies, including the 23 smaller water supply companies still in private hands, are in the middle of a 16-year investment programme that could eventually cost more than Pounds 45bn, sharply higher than the government estimates of Pounds 28bn at privatisation. The programme could cost billions more if the National Rivers Authority, the water quality watchdog, favours a harsh interpretation of the EC Municipal Waste Water Directive, which covers treatment of sewage, and if it chooses to bring in strict new UK statutory water quality standards. Ofwat, concerned about the sharp rises in customers bills to pay for the capital spending, has emphasised that standards should not be set unnecessarily high. It has asked companies to consult customers this winter on the desired level of service. But as water companies have little room for discretion on capital spending once the rules are set, several managing directors have interpreted this as a backdoor way for Ofwat to remind the NRA of the expensive consequences of its regulatory enthusiasm. The results will also give a chance to scrutinise companies' diversification, much of which has been disappointing. The companies intend the non-core businesses to shield them against tightening regulation of the core services. They are not allowed to cross-finance the diversifications by revenue from the core activities, but Ofwat's precise views on how this 'ring fence' operates will remain uncertain for several years and a source of risk in the shares. Brokers are divided in their judgment of whether the short-term attractions of the sector outweigh the long term risks. Mr Peter Hyde, analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, says: 'The sector may well do well over the next month, but I expect it to be left behind when the economy eventually recovers'.</p>

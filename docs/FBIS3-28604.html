			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Small and Medium Enterprise Agency [SMEA] under  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will set  up a new loan system -- as one of the new economic stimulus  measures to support small and medium companies planning to start  new business. This system will focus on those small and medium  companies that have technological potential but lack good  business performance at this point. On the condition of  accepting business administration guidance from the Small  Business Finance Corporation [SBFC], each company may obtain  loans up to 600 million yen [Y], of which up to Y40 million will  be provided without collateral, which will be a special measure  of this system. The total amount of loans in the first fiscal  year may reach Y60 billion. The SMEA plans to support these  ambitious companies by expanding loans without collateral.  Normally, private financial organs are negative about providing  such loans.    The new system, which is called the "Loan System To Foster  New Business" (tentative name), aims at providing loans to those  small enterprises that offer unique services or have unique  technology but have difficulties in raising funds from private  financial organs due to lack of good business performance or  sufficient collateral; such loans will be earmarked for starting  new business. Under this system, the interest rate will be set  at the current SBFC standard rate of 3.65 percent plus an  additional 0.3 percent, and the maximum loan term can be set for  15 years.    The committee on fostering new business, to be set up at the  SBFC, will check such factors as the new business' potential and  technology. MITI considers that if the SBFC can continue to  provide management guidance after financing, dependability of  new businesses may increase; and that this system may serve as  "priming water" for expansion of loans by private financial  organs.    Originally, MITI studied the possibility of starting the new  loan system in fiscal 1994. However, since small and medium  companies seem to have lost their interest in starting new  business due to such factors as the drop in the number of  companies that have started new businesses due to the prolonged  recession, MITI will start the system after the third  supplementary budget is approved ahead of schedule.    Private financial organs have restrained from providing  loans  to areas involved with high risk. Thus, MITI has decided that  expansion of support from government-affiliated financial organs  is indispensable to the fostering of new industries.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The recent "Eye on L.A." program on Chile was a disgrace! Not only did it  mispronounce half of the city's names, but it portrayed Chile as the "fashion  capital of the world." Chile has always been known for its culture, not for its  designers!  </P> <P> Alicia Matricardi, Los Angeles  </P></p>

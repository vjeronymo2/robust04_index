			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Arts: A new 'Ring' at the Chatelet - Richard Fairman reviews the first half of the Paris cycle Not the whole Ring, as yet: Wagner-lovers in Paris will have to wait until the autumn to see the first complete cycles of this new production. The timing does, however, mean that Paris has done its best to pip Bayreuth to the post, as the Wagner festival is within a few weeks of unveiling its own new Ring - an event which only comes round once or twice a decade. For international opera-goers there is almost a surfeit of new productions of the Ring this year (the Royal Opera in London is about to launch another in the autumn) but if the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris has its eye on the opposition, it is likely that it is looking closer to home. The Chatelet and the Opera de Paris Bastille, Mitterrand's huge opera palace for the people, are keen rivals and the Bastille has yet to accept the challenge of a Ring. If anybody doubts that competition can be good for the arts, the operatic situation in Paris at the moment offers the proof. Determined not to be outdone by its rival's greater size, income and prestige, the Chatelet aims to make up ground by putting together an adventurous programme. Like the Bastille, it is able to offer international casts and its only ongoing weakness is the lack of a house orchestra of the front rank. For some of its major productions it has the Philharmonia Orchestra in residence from London, but not unfortunately for this one. Doubtless Jeffrey Tate had rehearsed the Orchestre National de France diligently to get such a convincing Wagnerian sound, but the run of cracked brass notes and general ungainliness of the playing do not speak well of the orchestra's current form. Tate himself likes solid Wagner, built on unshakable foundations, but found more elan than usual to build each act to climaxes of unexpected passion. The Parisian audience rewarded him with an enthusiastic ovation. For his part the producer and designer, Pierre Strosser, decided not to come on for a curtain-call, which was probably wise. So far, only Das Rheingold and Die Walkure have been seen, but it seems unlikely that he has any surprises in store for the other two operas. Certainly, his bare stage of a set - everything dark and grey, barely a flicker of colour in sight - looks here to stay, while all the Ring's invitations for scenic spectacle are steadfastly ignored. Just as he refuses to show on stage the waters of the Rhine, a Valhalla castle or a rainbow for the gods, so Strosser is determined to avoid the obvious in his handling of the singers. Whether it is Alberich slipping and sliding on the rocks, Siegmund collapsing with exhaustion or the Valkyries congregating with wild energy, he refuses to have anybody imitate the music; for most of the time the singers just stand lifelessly and sing. There are some virtues in this approach, but only negative ones. It is a relief to see a Ring without caricatures, so that in Das Rheingold both Franz-Josef Kapellmann's Alberich and Peter Keller's Mime came across as men of feelings, not just grotesque misfits (it was distasteful, though, to use real dwarves for the Nibelungs). It also makes life easier not to have to wrestle with a producer's heavy-handed reading of Wagner's political subtext, although Strosser does dress up his gods as a well-to-do Victorian family, who do not want to pay for their new house when the proletariat builders (the giants) turn up with the bill. In general, Das Rheingold lacked impact, despite Peter Straka's intelligently-played Loge getting a grip on the drama whenever he could. Kirsten Dolberg as Erda was left to wander on from the back of the stage virtually unnoticed, dressed like a Sunday-school teacher arriving to read the lesson. Nadine Denize's experienced Fricka and Elisabeth Meyer-Topsoe as Freia made a limited impression among the gods. The Froh was inaudible and the Fasolt feeble. After so much inactivity, it was no surprise the next night at Die Walkure to find nothing happening visually when the door of Hunding's hut flies open to let in the spring. Instead, in blew a whirlwind called Karen Huffstodt, whose Sieglinde sang and acted with such fevered intensity that she nearly blasted everybody else off the stage. I was glad she was there, though her pairing with Jyrki Niskanen's office clerk of a Siegmund did not look like a marriage made in heaven. For its Wotan, the Chatelet has Robert Hale, so far a strong and able choice, with the right amount of power for this theatre. The Brunnhilde, Sabine Hass, lacks heroic strength in the middle of her voice, but it is splendid to hear both a Wotan and a Brunnhilde who sing without any wobble or unpleasant forcing. Among the rest of the Walkure cast there was a menacing, heavily Eastern-accented Hunding from Sergey Kopchak and an international band of Valkyries, including the British duo of Penelope Walker and Yvonne Howard. Siegfried and Gotterdammerung follow in October, with two complete Ring cycles around the beginning of November. A co-production with Radio France, supported by the Association Culturelle du Theatre du Chatelet</p>

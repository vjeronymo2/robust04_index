			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- Comrade Kim Chong-il,  supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, extended thanks  to the Pyongyang seasoning powder factory, the Yongsong meat  processing factory and the Pyongyang flour processing combine  which had distinguished themselves in furthering the beautiful  tradition of Army-civilian unity.    Officials and workers there often went to People's Army  units  and congratulated soldiers on their achievements in combat and  political training, demonstrating their unshakable will to fight  it out in defence of the socialist homeland maintaining close  bonds of kinship between the Army and the civilians if the  enemies invade it.    At thanks-conveying ceremonies speakers said the happiness  of  the Korean people today and their bright future are guaranteed  as they have Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head of their  revolutionary Armed Forces and that they would take care of and  love the soldiers of comrade supreme commander like their own  flesh and blood and aid the People's Army more assiduously.</p>

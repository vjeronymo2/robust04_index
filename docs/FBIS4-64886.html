			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manfred Fuchs: "Permanent Breach of Neutrality"] </F>   [Text] For a long time the activities of the secret and  intelligence services of the neutral states in Europe were  probably the best guarded secrets. This also applies to  Austria, whose diligent agents have provided comprehensive  services to NATO's intelligence services from the time of the  signing of the State Treaty in 1955 until today, most recently  during the current crisis in Yugoslavia.    Neutrality did not play any role.  <H5>  Austria -- Excellent Contacts </H5>   The Austrian Army's intelligence service, the Group for  Intelligence Matters, played a significant role in the  intelligence sphere shortly after its founding in 1955/56 during  the Hungarian crisis in 1956.    Western intelligence officials received detailed information  from their Austrian counterparts on the situation in its eastern  neighbor, consisting of reports by informers and recordings of  the radio traffic monitored by the Austrian Army. The good  relationship between the Group for Intelligence Matters and the  Western intelligence services was partly due to the excellent  contacts between its leading officers and Western  organizations, which date back to the last years of Nazi terror.  The first head of the Group for Intelligence Matters, Kurt  Fechner, could look back on a long career in the intelligence  service of the First Republic and in the counterintelligence  service (the military intelligence service) of Hitler's Reich.    When the collapse was already visible, Fechner succeeded in  establishing contact with the French and U.S. intelligence  services. This not only saved him from any kind of persecution  by the occupation forces but, as a result, he also knew a great  number of agents who many years later intervened with the  Austrian authorities to support his nomination as head of the  Austrian intelligence service.  <H5>  Koenigswarte Listening Post </H5>   The establishment of the Austrian intelligence service was  mainly supported by U.S. intelligence, which also provided the  necessary funds -- in the case of the listening post of the  Group for Intelligence Matters. Apart from setting up an  information network in the East Bloc, where the United States  cooperated with Kurt Fechner, the U.S. agents also offered Army  Colonel Rudolf Camerlander and his comrade Johann Zahradnik help  in the establishment of a radio monitoring service.    The officers of the Austrian Army soon set up a group of  motorized radio troops with instruments and vehicles from U.S.  stocks which they headed out from their headquarters in the  barracks in Vienna's third district. A little later, the Group  for Intelligence Matters established (again with U.S. funds and  U.S. know-how) the first fixed listening station at the  so-called Koenigswarte, a few kilometers from the Hungarian  border and Bratislava.    Apart from the building at Koenigswarte, the Austrian  intelligence service expanded the espionage network under U.S.  control. The signal/reconnaissance battalion (known as the  Technical Control Service at the time) was established in  Neulengbach, where the specialists in radio espionage, decoding  specialists, interpreters, and information and evaluation  experts carried out their work.  <H5>  U.S. Espionage Network </H5>   The reason for the CIA's generosity was naturally not  altruism. The monitoring network only worked for Austria to a  limited extent. During the first phase of the Cold War, U.S.  intelligence established a network of listening stations in all  West European countries that bordered on East Bloc states. Thus,  the Austrian listening posts that were in a position to  intercept radio traffic in Yugoslavia, the Balkans, Hungary, the  CSFR, and large parts of the USSR were designed as a support for  the U.S. espionage network.    The Austrian officers had to submit the recordings and  summaries of monitored radio traffic to the headquarters of the  German Intelligence Service in Pullach. There, the material was  picked up by representatives of the CIA. This breach of  neutrality was silently tolerated by the Austrian intelligence  officers.  <H5>  Electronic Aid From Overseas </H5>   In 1963, some intelligence officers spoke up against the  cooperation between neutral Austria and a NATO intelligence  service. Lieutenant Colonel Johann Zahradnik, who headed  Koenigswarte, even went as far as addressing a letter to Defense  Minister Georg Prader and State Secretary Otto Roesch, pointing  out the unilateral cooperation between the Group for  Intelligence Matters and the CIA. The result, however, was that  he was transferred to another position.    Despite the fact that the Austrian Defense Minister took  over  the financing of the monitoring network, the U.S. authorities  were even concerned about the modernization of cruising and  monitoring network of the Intelligence Service of the Austrian  Army [HNA] until the 1990's.    At the Neulengbach computer center, where it was possible  to observe the troop movements of even the smallest units on the  other side of the border, officers and engineers had reached the  limit of what was possible some time ago. The instruments had  to be renewed to improve the processing of the increasing influx  of data. The INA "passive collection system" was developed.  However, the Austrian electronic engineers were not in a  position to prepare the required programs.    At this point, the U.S. company Bendix offered to cooperate  with the Austrians. It was no coincidence that Bendix also  cooperated with U.S. intelligence. According to the wishes of  the U.S. Administration, the electronic system was to be  provided to the Austrians free of charge. Yet, because of the  chaos within the Austrian Defense Ministry, the smart Americans  made the Austrians pay a sum for their services that allegedly  exceeded 10 million schillings.  <H5>  Services for NATO by the Neutral Countries </H5>   In the crisis year of 1991, the HNA mobilized its radio post  at the Austrian-Yugoslav border. In cooperation with the  Italian military intelligence service which had infiltrated its  agents into Yugoslavia, the HNA supplied an exact picture of the  political and military situation there.    The cruising and monitoring stations of the Austrian Army  monitored the radio traffic of the Yugoslav People's Army and of  all parties to the civil war. The Austrian reports even  contained exact descriptions of the supply lines and the  positions of the Serbian armed forces heavy weapons.    The results of the espionage activities of the Austrian  intelligence service were passed on to NATO intelligence  services, who examined -- and dropped -- the possibilities of a  military operation to end the conflict in the former Yugoslavia  on the basis of the Austrian data.    However, cooperation between the military intelligence  service of a neutral state and the intelligence services of NATO  member states is not merely an Austrian peculiarity. After  numerous hints regarding a special unit within the military  intelligence service in Switzerland, the Federal Council was  forced to set up a parliamentary investigation committee for the  Military Department (the Swiss Defense Ministry) on 12 March  1990.    The parliamentarians discovered a secret resistance army,  the  P-26, which was established as early as in the 1950's and which  had contacts with similar secret troops in other West European  countries. The special unit was considered the Swiss branch of  the NATO organization "Gladio," which was set up in nearly all  West European states with U.S. support in the 1950's. All in  the government, in the Military Department, and in the  Department of Justice and Police who knew about Gladio pretended  to be ignorant and guiltless after the exposure of the scandal.  The head of the P-26, Efrem Cattelan (codename "Rico"), went  underground and took along some of the P-26's most important  secrets. Even the government claims not to possess a "key to  the activation of the deactivation" of the P-26.  <H5>  Swedish Services for the CIA </H5>   Sweden's image as a model neutral country is also beginning  to show cracks because of the activities of its military  intelligence service. From the memoirs of Swedish Air Force  Officer Stig Wennerstrom, who worked for the USSR's military  intelligence service until 1963, it becomes clear that the  Swedish military cooperated with U.S. intelligence, to whom the  reports by the attaches in the Soviet Union were handed over  voluntarily. Ten years after the Wennerstrom affair, the two  journalists Peter Bratt and Jan Guillou, as well as the former  agent Hakan Isacson uncovered "criminal practices" of the  intelligence service of the Swedish Army in the magazine FOLKET  I BILD [PEOPLE IN THE KNOW]. The intelligence service provided  aid to Western intelligence and security services during their  operations in Sweden and its eastern neighboring countries.    Agents of the operational department of the Swedish  intelligence service, the Information Office (to which Olof  Palme, who became prime ministe later, also belonged for a  certain period) planned and carried out landings on the Finnish  coast in cooperation with the CIA. In 1970, they even helped  the Israeli intelligence service break into the embassies of  Egypt, Algeria, and Iraq and protected it against police  investigations. Reports from the East were also passed on to  the Israeli secret service by the Information Office.    The election victory of the conservatives in 1991 in Sweden  did not change anything regarding the military intelligence  service's influential position. Quite the contrary. The change  of governemnt even led to an expansion of the intelligence  service (which is quite large for a neutral state).    Since Sweden has a significant weapons industry, the  military  intelligence service can continue to rely on the government's  approval of its intensive contacts with NATO intelligence  services in the interest of the protection of Swedish interests.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Northern light at the end of tunnel: A ray of hope in the Nordic banking crisis In the depressed world of Nordic banking a little good news goes a long way. So the reduced losses for 1992 reported by Norway's commercial banks were warmly greeted by the country's central bank as an indication that the sector's five-year crisis might be drawing to an end. But with similar optimism lacking in either Finland or Sweden, it is still too early to call the turn in the wider banking crisis which has ravaged the region. The sector's difficulties are a result of financial deregulation throughout the region during of the late 1980s and the deep recession which followed it. Norway's banks were the first to feel the pain, and may be the first to recover, although they are still a long way from a sustained level of profitability. Banks in Sweden and Finland, meanwhile, have just reported their worst-ever results, and with both countries still in deep recession, there is little to suggest that the 1993 figures will be much better. The leading banks in neighbouring Denmark have also reported heavy losses for 1992. The Danish banks, though, are better capitalised than those in other Nordic countries, and are likely to survive the crisis without state assistance. That is not the case in the other three countries, where governments have been forced to intervene to maintain domestic and foreign confidence in their financial systems and to ensure their banks continue to meet international capital adequacy requirements. Huge sums of taxpayers' money have already been invested, with Sweden providing SKr67.5bn (Pounds 5.85bn) in support, Finland FM38bn (Pounds 4.43bn), and Norway NKr27bn (Pounds 2.57bn). Further substantial injections of government funds are likely as the process of restructuring and winding down problem loans continues. This is certain to put further strain on state finances at a time when budget deficits in Sweden, Finland and Norway are swelling in face of rising unemployment and falling tax revenues. At the heart of the crisis is the financial deregulation of 1980s, which included the relaxation of foreign exchange restrictions and a lifting of official guidelines on lending. The subsequent credit expansion was further fuelled by advantageous tax rules for borrowers and a scramble for new business. But banks found themselves with little protection when recession arrived and many loans fell into default. Despite such common factors, differences between the countries are significant. Norway's problems began in 1986 when oil prices sharply declined; Finland's only really became apparent in 1991 following the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union; Sweden, where the crisis only fully materialised in 1992, has been hit most heavily by plunging real estate values. Last year was the worst so far, with total write-offs of problem loans across the Nordic banking sector amounting to more than SKr100bn. Sweden was the most severely hit with credit losses of SKr70bn, followed by Finland with nearly SKr30bn. Norway's credit losses were halved last year, from NKr17bn in 1991 to NKr8.7 last year, largely because its problems began and were addressed earlier. Such figures explain why governments have felt compelled to intervene. Failure to act would have brought the risk of a domestic credit crunch and shaken international confidence in their financial systems. The result of the capital injections is that Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, two of Norway's top three banks, are now 100 per cent state-owned while 70 per cent of the biggest bank, Den Norske Bank, is controlled by the government. Two of the five biggest banks in Sweden are fully in state hands, while the country's most prestigious bank, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, is negotiating a support package. In Finland, the two savings banks groups, Skopbank and Savings Bank of Finland, have been taken over by the state. Relations between the banks and their new public-sector owners are proving tricky, particularly in those countries where governments otherwise committed to privatisation, as in Sweden and Finland, have been forced to extend state ownership. 'We want to reprivatise the banks but to what degree and at what speed, it is far too early to say,' says the Norwegian finance minister Mr Sigbjorn Johnsen. The rescues have been complicated by what are often conflicting objectives: getting the best value for the taxpayer, maintaining a level playing field within the sector and minimising state involvement. A good illustration of the dilemma is provided by the current talks between SE Banken and the Swedish government. The finance ministry expects the bank to do as much as possible to solve its own problems by raising capital from private sources. But the bank believes that before it can attract private capital the public support it can expect to receive must be quantified. There is little doubt that private share capital will be required to get Nordic banks back on their feet. But investors will be wary of ploughing more money into institutions which have already cost them a great deal and where dividend prospects are uncertain. None of the leading banks paid a dividend on their ordinary shares in 1992. The alternative to raising new capital is simply to slash lending activities, but that would mean cutting back on loans at the very time when fresh financing is needed to support economic recovery. The prospect of raising private capital is not entirely gloomy, however. Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, has been the first of the big banks in the region to launch a share issue, and its current FM930m offer has been well received. Recovery could also be assisted by rationalisation and mergers. In Norway, restructuring is already underway, with the merger of Bergen Bank and Den norske Creditbank. It is likely to gain momentum as the most unprofitable portions of the banks' business - such as property portfolios - continue to be hived off and the process of returning banks to the private sector begins. In Finland a merger between KOP and the savings banks groups is currently being considered. Norway has commissioned the UK-based consultancy firm, Davis International Banking Consultants, to look at its banking problems, and expects recommendations that will form the basis of a restructuring programme to be presented to parliament in mid-May. However, sustained recovery in the banking sector largely hinges on broader economic recovery. The worst may be over in some sectors of the economy, but unemployment is rising. Joblessness in Norway, at 8.7 per cent, is at its highest level since the second world war high, while in Finland more than 18 per cent of the workforce is out of work. In Sweden, official unemployment stands at 7 per cent, but the figure would be much greater if those in training schemes were included. With so many people out of work, many are having difficulties repaying loans. The corporate sector, meanwhile, is squeezed by low demand and real interest rates that remain high. In Sweden the central bank's marginal interest rate is being held at 9.75 per cent to squeeze inflation and protect the value of the krona. But the Finnish central bank reduced its base rate to 7.5 per cent in February, while in Norway the central bank this year has gradually eased its official rate to 8.5 per cent. Most analysts believe the leading banks in Sweden and Finland face at least two more years of heavy write-offs of problem loans, although recovery may come more quickly in Norway. '1993 will be a better year for the Norwegian banks, but the problems in Swedish and Finnish banks started later, so the real recovery will not be evident as early,' said Mr Torstein Joerstad, a bond credit analyst at UBS Limited in London. Of the big Swedish banks, Handelsbanken is an exception and it may return to profit as early as this year. Yet even if the Nordic banking sector rebounds during this year and next, the region's financial problems will not be resolved soon. The task of rebuilding financial strength, restructuring and winding-down problem credits is likely to last into the next century.  -------------------------------------------------------                   NORDIC BANKING BLUES  ------------------------------------------------------- Sweden                               (+ Profits -losses)  ------------------------------------------------------- 1992 operating results                    SKr bn  ------------------------------------------------------- SE Banken                                  -5.37 Nordbanken                                -16.00 Handelsbanken                              -0.84  ------------------------------------------------------- Norway                                    NKr bn  ------------------------------------------------------- Den Norske Bank                            -3.06 Christiania Bank                           +1.58 Fokus                                      -2.06  ------------------------------------------------------- Norway                                     FM bn  ------------------------------------------------------- Kansallis-Osake-Pankki                     -2.63 Unitas                                     -2.00 Skopbank                                   -3.46  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

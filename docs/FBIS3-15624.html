			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haerkkerup arrived in  Lithuania on an official visit today.    The Danish delegation will meet President Algirdas  Brazauskas; Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas; members of the  Seimas National Security Committee; National Defense Minister  Linas Linkevicius; officials from the Ministry of National  Defense; and representatives from the Voluntary Defense Service.    The guests will also visit the port of Klaipeda where they  will inspect the flotilla of the Lithuanian marine force. The  main sphere of cooperation between the Lithuanian and Danish  military structures is the training of officers of this country.  Another sphere is partnership for peace. Denmark will help the  Baltic states to set up peacekeeping military units. They are  already introducing their methodology and giving assistance for  the training of servicemen. It is thought that the first  Lithuanian peacekeeping unit will leave for former Yugoslavia,  together with the Danish battalion.    Experts from Denmark are expected to arrive at the end of  March. They will assess the Alytus military base where the joint  peacekeeping unit of the Baltic states is to be trained.    A treaty will be signed by the Danish and Lithuanian defense  ministers during the visit. This will reinforce further the  links between the two state institutions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (XINHUA) -- The People's Liberation  Army [PLA] General Political Department [GPD] recently issued a  circular to the entire army, asking the vast numbers of  commanders and fighters to continue the in-depth activities to  learn from Lei Feng in an effort to vigorously strengthen the  troops' building of spiritual civilization.    The circular pointed out: The Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee set new demands on building a  socialist market economic structure and socialist spiritual  civilization. Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military  Commission, has stressed on many occasions recently that the  army should lead the rest of the nation in building spiritual  civilization. All army units should earnestly implement the  guidelines of the party Central Committee and Central Military  Commission's instructions and raise to a new level the  learn-from-Lei Feng activities and the building of spiritual  civilization.    The circular says: In light of the new circumstances and  problems in the new situation, all military units should  organize officers and men to earnestly study the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to learn  from Lei Feng's glorious deeds and lofty thinking. All military  units should guide their officers and men to take Lei Feng as  their model; hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism;  uphold the communist outlook on life and communist values; carry  forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Deng  Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirits put forward  by Jiang Zemin; regulate their words and deeds with such ethics  and lofty spirits as self-sacrifice, putting others before  oneself, working hard, observing law and discipline, loving the  army, and improving military skills; and consciously resist the  corrosive effects of money worship, ultra-individualism, and  corrupt lifestyle. We must perpetuate traditional Chinese  virtues and, on this basis, establish and develop military  ethics and standards suitable to our army's character and traits  so that the vast numbers of officers and men will have higher  ideological consciousness and moral standards, better behavior,  and higher scientific and technological and cultural standards  and will work hard to become soldiers practicing and spreading  new socialist ethics and styles.    The circular stresses: We must vigorously publicize and  commend advanced models in learning from Lei Feng and building  spiritual civilization. We must continue to bring into play the  exemplar and guidance role of old models. At the same time, we  must try vigorously to find, train, and publicize new models who  have distinctive characteristics of our times and who will exert  major influence on others. We must vigorously launch all kinds  of activities to learn from Lei Feng and build spiritual  civilization, actively participate in local public welfare  services, transform prevailing habits and customs, assist people  in poverty and difficulty, and take part in disaster relief to  contribute to fostering new social ethics. We must earnestly  strengthen leadership over activities of learning from Lei Feng  and building spiritual civilization. We must guide the  initiative of the vast numbers of officers and men displayed in  learning from Lei Feng and building spiritual civilization at  their work posts so that they will work hard to accomplish  military training and related tasks.</p>

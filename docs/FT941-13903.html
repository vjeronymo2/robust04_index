			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: The first big-name designer - An exhibition which harks back to a golden era A collection of work by C F A Voysey, one of the most famous designers to embrace the philosophies of the Arts and Crafts movement, will be on display at the Design Museum in south west London from Monday. Voysey was possibly the first of the big-name designers, the Sir Terence Conran of his day. His furniture, his glass and cutlery - and most of all his designs for wallpapers and textiles for Alexander Morton &amp; Co - came to be as sought-after and easily recognisable to turn-of-the-century shoppers as pieces by Philippe Starck and Vico Magistretti are today. He worked during a golden era of British design when the whole of Europe looked to see what Voysey and his friends - including George Walton, Archibald Knox, Ernest Gimson and C R Ashbee - were up to. But Voysey's interest and importance goes way beyond the fact that he designed pretty things. He approached his work in a profoundly serious way, believing that individual creativity, even idiosyncrasy, mattered greatly - not simply as a matter of personal preference but because for him it was an essential part of a civilised community. *** He saw it as a means of keeping soul-destroying standardisation and bureaucracy at bay. It went with having the courage of one's convictions, with having standards that were incorruptible and absolute. He is generally credited with being the first to consider the importance of the complete design, 'designing from the inside outwards', believing that a house, for instance, should be a composite whole and that the building, the interior and all the minutiae which make it up should work harmoniously together. Thus he liked to design everything himself from the building to the light fittings, cutlery, carpets and furniture. A house for him, far from being a 'machine for living in' was a place for spiritual as well as material shelter: 'A serene port in the storm.' All his instincts led him to like simplicity, light and clarity. His graceful houses, as Claire Catterall, the curator of this exhibition puts it, 'filled with light, brought a breath of fresh air to the dark, formal monumentality characteristic of most buildings of the Victorian period.' His furniture designs were plain, yet graceful, usually made from untreated, unpolished wood and incorporating simple, almost Shaker-like motifs such as pierced hearts. Like the Shakers, he too believed in a connection between beauty and God. 'All true culture,' he said, 'depends upon the love of truth, the love of beauty and the love of God, and can never grow otherwise.' Fine aesthetics were thus much more than just an aesthetic matter - they were of moral import, too. On show at the Design Museum will be some of his architectural drawings, furniture and fittings, fabrics, wallpapers as well as objects as diverses as telephone boxes and gas fires. The exhibition, from the private collection of a family member, is sponsored by BhS and is on at the Design Museum, Shad Thames, London SE1 2YD from January 24 to April 24.</p>

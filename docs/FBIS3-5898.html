			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Korea has dampened "unrealistic" U.S. expectations  for the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) finance  ministers meeting, scheduled for March 18-19 in Hawaii, as a  forum to put pressure on other countries into opening their  financial markets.    In preliminary deputies talks last week, the U.S. Treasury  Department aired a set of proposals that could be developed into  institutional mechanisms for expanding market access for U.S.  financial firms. For example, Washington suggested the creation  of a committee to "study the rule of foreign financial  institutions in APEC countries as well as liberalization of  their capital markets."    Korea, Japan, and even Brunei rejected the idea as it does  not deal with multilateral issues for common prosperity of the  region, according to Assistant Finance Minister Yim Chang-yol.  Instead, the deputies agreed to adopt the Four-Cs (consensus,  cooperation, cordiality and consultation) as a guiding principle  of the APEC finance ministers meeting, Yim said. Furthermore,  the meeting will be "non-binding" and no country will play the  role of "coordinator" in the forum, Yim said.    Despite such a suspicious attitude among APEC countries,  analysts here expect the United States to "make the point in the  Hawaii meeting that financial market integration and  liberalization is in APEC's best interests." Washington is said  to have adopted "three principles" in further opening the Asian  financial markets, they said. First of all, the United States,  out of its ambition to open up foreign financial markets,  threatens not to grant most-favored-nation (MFN) status to  foreign firms in which countries deny full market access and  national treatment to U.S. firms. It is looking for bilateral  agreements which offer reasonable market access and national  treatment. In the case of Korea, the United States might use  the standard of "equality of competitive opportunity," instead  of national treatment, analysts said.    Washington is said to be prepared to guarantee full market  access and national treatment to countries which give U.S. firms  satisfactory access and national treatment, they noted. The  United States is said to be seeking to negotiate constructively  with foreign countries, including Korea. There will be a  standstill or "grandfathering" of existing operations of firms  already in the U.S. market during negotiations. Furthermore,  U.S. Treasury officials are said to be airing the position that  the United States will not unreasonably refuse access to nations  which are not already in the U.S. market, analysts said.    The U.S. objective remains multilateral. However, Washington  argues that it can not accept the situation in which other  nations retain the right to discriminate against U.S. firms  while they are permitted to expand in the U.S. market, analysts  said. Washington officials are said to be asserting that they  will be reasonable and pragmatic. For example, the United  States understands the Korean position which considers that its  financial system is an integral part of its economic policy and  its financial system should remain in domestic hands, they said.  U.S. officials understand this, analysts here said.    However, Treasury officials allegedly cite ASEAN countries,  Japan, Korea and Brazil as their main "problem" countries  regarding full access to the U.S. services agreement. It may  intensify its financial policy talks (FPT) with these countries  over the next two years with the expectation of reaching an  agreement which would enable the Treasury Department not to  apply the MFN exemption, analysts said.    In carrying out such action, the U.S. Treasury Department  has  the legislative authority to reciprocate against foreign  financial firms which apply to expand their operations or seek  new operations in the United States. For example, it has  existing Section 301 authority of the Trade Act to take such  action. But the Treasury Department has been reluctant to use  this authority in the past except in cases of third country  restrictions on market access of U.S. insurance companies.    The Treasury Department also expects Congress to enact the  "Fair Trade in Financial Services" act this year. For the first  time, the U.S. administration has taken a united position in  supporting this legislation. However, there are still problems  in winning passage, particularly in the House of  Representatives, analysts said.</p>

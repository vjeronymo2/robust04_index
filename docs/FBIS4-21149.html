The bureau said that it has seized a total of  1,300 kilograms of heroin last year, which was sufficient to  supply 32,000 drug addicts for one whole year. But the seizure  only reflected about one-tenth of the overall drugs smuggled  into Taiwan, indicating that about 400,000 people here are  addicted to drugs.    The bureau also flatly denied the report by the United  States  State Department that Taiwan is Asia's largest way station for  drug shipment. Citing a record 336-kilogram heroin seizure last  May, the Bureau of Investigation said that Taiwan will not allow  drug barons to turn the island into a transfer port for drug  trafficking.</p>

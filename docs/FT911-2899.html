			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Mengistu in desperate bid to stay in power: Embattled Ethiopian leader offers deal as rebel fighters close in PRESIDENT Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia yesterday reshuffled his cabinet in a desperate last-ditch effort to stay in power as rebels tightened their grip on the capital. With fighters of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) within 65 miles of Addis Ababa after a series of lightning victories against demoralised government troops, Mr Mengistu's slim chances of survival depend on rebel reaction to a parliamentary proposal for a transitional government and a ceasefire. Western diplomats in Addis Ababa say the appointment of the moderate Mr Tesfaye Dinka as prime minister is designed to win confidence among the rebel groups about the government's seriousness in opening negotiations. But most observers believe the proposals are too late to prevent the violent disintegration of the Ethiopian nation after 14 years of strong-arm rule by Mr Mengistu. 'Mengistu is finished. The only question is whether he will go peacefully or be forced out in a bloodbath,' said one western diplomat. Some observers believe the parliament's offer of open-ended, round table talks with all opposition groups, probably outside Ethiopia, stands a slight chance of averting the looming catastrophe, but only if Mr Mengistu resigns. Last Friday Mr Mengistu said he would stand down if it would preserve the unity of the country but for years he has cultivated the image of being the only man who can prevent the break-up of the country - a view which retains currency in some sections of the army and population. Even if peace talks begin, fears are widespread about the real agenda of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, the main group in the EPRDF, which, until recently, was staunchly Stalinist and vague about its political programme except demanding the removal of Mr Mengistu. As rebels closed on the capital earlier this week, the US ordered the evacuation of all non-essential embassy staff. Concern is widespread that fighting could engulf Addis Ababa, unleashing violence after years of pent-up desire for revenge. Those fears have been bolstered with the recent experience of Somalia, where the capital, Mogadishu, degenerated into an orgy of ethnic bloodletting and anarchy as rebels neared the city seeking to extract concessions from the government. 'The Mogadishu factor is very much in people's minds,' said one resident of Addis Ababa. For the moment the rebels appear wary of launching a full assault against the capital until prospects for negotiations are resolved. But with three provinces completely under rebel control, heavy fighting continuing on several fronts around Addis Ababa and the secessionist Eritrean rebels pressing their campaign against government troops in Eritrea province it seems Ethiopia is in danger of fragmenting. 'It would take a miracle to stop Ethiopia breaking up,' said Mr Abdul Mohamed, a leading Ethiopian political analyst. 'If Mengistu resigns immediately and the rebels hold off attacking Addis there is a chance. But it looks grim.'</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: IBM to offer chips to external customers INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest producer of semiconductor devices, has unveiled plans to begin offering its products to external customers. Until now, IBM's large chip plants in Europe, Japan and the US have served only the company's internal needs. The new focus of IBM's semiconductor operations is the latest in a series of sweeping changes within the company over the past year. Last December, Mr John Akers, chairman, announced plans to transform IBM into a 'federation of free-standing businesses'. Unlike IBM's end-user product divisions, such as its personal computer operation, the technology products division - which includes IBM's semiconductor production operations - has been largely hidden from public view until now. However, technology products generate annual revenue of about Dollars 8bn, said Mr Michael Attardo, IBM vice-president and general manager of technology products. IBM's strategy in the semiconductor market will be to compete as a supplier of sub-systems, said Mr Attardo. 'This is because for some time most of the chips that we have been delivering to internal customers are in the form of sub-systems,' he said. 'We will focus on the information technology market because those applications are IBM core competencies. Clearly, computers and peripherals will be our initial market focus.' IBM will be a significant new competitor for established semiconductor manufacturers. However, Mr Attardo said that by entering the semiconductor market place now, at a point where US manufacturers were gaining ground in the world market, would strengthen the US micro-electronics industry.</p>

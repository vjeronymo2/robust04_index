			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUCIFER IN GRUNEWALD'S MASTERPIECE;  </P> <P> THE DEVIL AT ISENHEIM,REFLECTIONS OF POPULAR BELIEF IN GRUNEWALD'S ALTARPIECE,  BY RUTH MELLINKOFF, CALIFORNIA STUDIES IN THE HISTORY OF ART, DISCOVERY SERIES,  1 (UNIVERSITY OFCALIFORNIA PRESS: $29.95; 109 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-520-06211-6)  </P> <P> This beautifully written, sumptuously illustrated, and elegantly printed work  on Matthias Grunewald's famous altarpiece is an auspicious first volume in the  new Discovery Series in art history from California Press. Edited by Walter  Horn and James Marrow, the series is designed to publish short monographs  requiring extensive illustration to develop their arguments.  </P> <P> In this volume, Ruth Mellinkoff, a distinguished art historian and author of  "The Mark of Cain," concentrates on one of the more puzzling figures of the  famous altarpiece at Isenheim, painted by Grunewald about 1512-1516. Best known  for its terrifying depiction of Christ's Crucifixion, the altarpiece was  designed with two hinged sets of wings so that three entirely different views  could be presented according to the arrangement of the wings. A total of 14  panels appear in the three views. The famous Crucifixion appeared in the view  when the wings were closed; the almost equally renowned Temptation of Anthony  appeared when the wings were opened in the shrine position. At the center of  the middle position is a picture of a musical concert given by angels in the  presence of the Madonna and Child. In the sky above the Madonna, God sits  enthroned among his angels, radiating spiritual light. This panel has long  resisted satisfactory interpretation. By addressing one of its most puzzling  figures, Mellinkoff finds a key to understanding the panel as a whole.  </P> <P> In the back row of the concert of angels sits a strange, feathered, greenish  creature, strikingly different from the other angel musicians in the panel and  from other angels in the altarpiece. Mellinkoff is the first to demonstrate  that this figure is the Devil himself. Unlike the other angels, who have  feathered wings, Lucifer is almost completely covered with feathers and hair.  Unlike the other angels, who are reddish, Lucifer is a sickly green suggesting  decay.  </P> <P> One small point here is debatable. Mellinkoff argues that the Devil's hair is  metamorphosing into feathers, but it seems more likely that the process is the  opposite, since iconographic tradition is that in his fall Lucifer was  transformed from beautiful angel into hairy brute. That this Devil still has a  sensitive face is not to be wondered at, for St. Paul said that Satan could  take on the appearance of an angel of light, and the earliest portrait of the  Devil in Christian art shows him in the shape of a beautiful angel.  </P> <P> Most strikingly, the Devil is looking up toward the figure of God in the sky  with an expression of horrified amazement. I have made an unthinkable mistake,  he seems to be saying; God's power is real; I am ruined forever. It is an  arresting, compelling face, this face of suffering Lucifer, a strange echo of  the suffering Christ of the Altarpiece's most famous panel, and, in wider  terms, a premonition of the protagonist of Victor Hugo's great poem "Satan"  three centuries later. The astonishment of the Devil derives not from his  stupidity -- he is after all an angel, the most brilliant of God's creatures --  but rather from his willful refusal to accept the truth. A moment after his  creation, he refused to accept his dependence upon God the Father; and later,  when he met Christ to tempt him in the wilderness, he refused to accept that  this was the Son of God.  </P> <P> The author confirms her argument by following a number of other clues in what  amounts to brilliant detective work. Atop his head, Lucifer wears a strange  crest that on examination proves to be a peacock's plumes. Mellinkoff shows  that Grunewald would have perceived the peacock as a symbol of sinful pride and  that other contemporary artists sometimes set a peacock's crest upon the head  of the serpent of the Garden of Eden. She links Lucifer with the fall of  humankind in the same panel, taking the dark fig tree in the center of the  panel as the fatal tree of Eden.  </P> <P> She identifies a number of strange little figures in the panel as demons, one  of them, near Lucifer himself, having a peculiarly repellent face. She argues  that the chamber pot bearing pseudo-Hebrew characters is linked with sin and  Satan as part of the contemporary custom of demonizing the Jews who denied  Christ.  </P> <P> Mellinkoff's interpretation is art history at its best; she understands that it  is impossible to interpret a painting satisfactorily without understanding the  mentality of the painter. As others have shown for Bosch, Mellinkoff shows for  Grunewald that his work is not as peculiar as it at first appears but rather is  rooted in traditional Christian theology. We now understand the altarpiece  better than ever, and we also have a more poignant sense of the sorrow of  Satan, elected, like Judas, to play a painful part in the drama of salvation.  </P></p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Creditanstalt optimistic in spite of fall CREDITANSTALT-Bankverein, the state-controlled Austrian bank, hopes to post an unchanged partial operating profit this year following a modest setback during the first nine months of 1992, Reuter reports from Vienna. 'We are optimistic that we will be able to achieve a partial operating profit at Creditanstalt this year in line with last year as a result of tight cost management,' the bank said in a letter to share-holders. Improved results from the bank's trading on its own account should ensure that Creditanstalt's total operating profit rises against last year, the bank said. Nine-month partial operating profits slipped by 8 per cent to Sch1.33bn (Dollars 118.64m). Operating profits improved by 3 per cent to Sch2.2bn. Increased credit risks, especially among Austrian borrowers, mean that net profits will fall short of last year, the letter continued. Creditanstalt said operating conditions had been very difficult, but that it had taken measures to improve earnings by increasing account fees and by pushing since August to widen interest rate margins.</p>

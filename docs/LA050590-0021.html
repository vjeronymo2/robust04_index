			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW SKETCH OF SLAYING SUSPECT RELEASED  </P> <P> San Diego police released a revised sketch Friday of a man seen fleeing the  scene of a fatal stabbing in Clairemont in April, but they said they have not  confirmed suspicions that the man is a serial killer.  </P> <P> Since January, three young women have been stabbed to death in the area of  3100-3400 Clairemont Drive. But, only after the most recent killing, on April  3, did a witness glimpse the suspect. Three weeks ago, the witness helped  police come up with a computer-generated image of the young black man, but that  image was imperfect, said homicide Lt. Gary Learn.  </P> <P> "The witness was never comfortable with the first composite," he said, adding  that a graphic artist gave the revised sketch "the human touch" by altering the  hairline, the ears and the facial features.  </P> <P> Learn said: "With respect to the serial killer, I'd be the first one to  acknowledge that, in the three cases, Jan. 12, Feb. 16 and April 3, there are a  tremendous number of similarities. But I can tell you in all honesty that at  this point . . . , we do not have physical evidence that can conclusively link  these three cases together."  </P> <P> Learn said 10 police officers, or one-third of the homicide unit, are working  full-time on the case, canvassing the neighborhood and following tips. He  estimated that officers have interviewed several hundred people, but he said  they will need further cooperation to solve the case.  </P> <P> "Somewhere in the community there's a distinct likelihood that someone knows  this individual," he said. "It's going to take a lot of courage to come forward  and provide us with this type of information . . . (but) however trivial it may  seem to them, we need that kind of input."  </P> <P> A $15,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest by the  Police Department, Crime Stoppers and the management company of the Buena Vista  Garden apartments, where two of the slayings occurred.  </P> <P> Sgt. Dorothy Powell, a police spokeswoman, urged Clairemont area residents to  take precautions.  </P> <P> "The No. 1 thing they can do is lock their doors. We're finding an awful lot of  doors unlocked -- a lot of people saying, 'Come in. It's open,' " she said.  "We're asking them to be aware of their surroundings, know if someone is  following them. If someone is following you, especially if you're a young woman  going back to an empty apartment, don't go back to that empty house. Go  somewhere where there are people."  </P> <P> Anyone having any information about the killings or about anyone resembling the  suspect is asked to contact the San Diego police homicide unit at 531-2500, or  Crime Stoppers at 235-TIPS.  </P></p>

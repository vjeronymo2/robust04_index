			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Forty percent had discrepancies relating to storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities that were not clean, sanitary, or in good repair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  For established participants in the NMFS program (as opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to entrants), the percentages with discrepancies in the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas for 1989 were: 49 percent; 47 percent; 25 percent; 49  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent; and 33 percent (Ref. 35, p. 42).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA has tentatively concluded on the basis of all of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings that HACCP-type controls for sanitation as proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below are needed. The sanitation measures required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.10 are fundamental to good sanitation practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and can have a bearing on human safety. The agency recognizes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, that depending on the conditions in a facility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional measures may be necessary (see, e.g., part 110). FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will expect processors to include those measures in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation practices but tentatively concludes that it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to include them in the fundamental core of required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA acknowledges the conclusion of the MSSP project that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for seafood at least, it is possible to include sanitation within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an HACCP system without unduly overburdening that system with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large numbers of critical control points. The FDA/NOAA HACCP-based seafood pilot program included critical control points for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation. For these regulations, however, FDA has tentatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided to propose specific HACCP-type requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation, rather than require that processors identify critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control points for sanitation in their HACCP plans. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in &sect;123.10 potentially relate to an entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility, not just to a limited number of critical control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points. FDA tentatively concludes that this step is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully implement section 402(a)(4) of the act and yet at the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time not overload the HACCP system. FDA invites comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In particular, FDA invites comment on whether sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements should be enumerated as in proposed &sect;123.10. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logical alternative would be to leave sanitation as one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that is to be identified and addressed in HACCP plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the control of microbiological and physical hazards (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(ix), and (b)(4)), but not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have specific provisions in the regulations as to how sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to be achieved. Good sanitation blocks avenues for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction of pathogens, harmful chemicals, and physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objects and is an essential preventive control for safety. Even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if a product is to be cooked by the consumer, the load of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microbiological pathogens on that product when received by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer is still relevant to safety. FDA's prescriptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to sanitation in proposed &sect;123.10 is intended to assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors to provide the greatest protection for consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonetheless, FDA invites comment on whether an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach as described above would ensure this protection at less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10(a) to require that processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct sanitation inspections to ensure that the sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions in &sect;123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) are met. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that the nature of the operations conducted by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor affects the hazards that may be presented by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product. Processing other than storing usually involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manipulation of exposed, i.e., unpackaged, fish and fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. Both the manipulation and the exposure subject the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product to all the hazards that can occur from unsanitary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices. Storage, on the other hand, can subject the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to some, but nowhere near all, of the hazards associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insanitation. Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors of fish and fishery products inspect for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions in &sect;123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) that are appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to their circumstances. FDA expects that, at a minimum, in, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, storage facilities, such inspections will include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring against the presence of vermin, because this is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequent problem in warehouses that can affect products even when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are being stored in a packaged state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In &sect;123.10(a)(1), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors ensure that water that contacts the product or food-contact surfaces, or that is used in the manufacture of ice, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived from a safe and sanitary source or is treated to render  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it of safe and sanitary quality. Water is used in virtually all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish and fishery product processing facilities for washing raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials, product contact surfaces, and employees' hands. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to transport fish through the plant in water flumes. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, water is often an ingredient, as in soups and glazes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contaminated water can serve as a vehicle for contamination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product, both directly and indirectly (Refs. 63, 64; 65, p.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49; 66, 67, and 68, pp. 1 and 2). It can also serve as a vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for contamination as the ice in which the product is stored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The safety and sanitary quality of water from United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and some foreign public water systems is generally ensured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through public water treatment, chlorination, or monitoring and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control by local health authorities. Where this assurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists, FDA does not anticipate that processors will need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement any additional controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

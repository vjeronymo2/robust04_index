			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jose Gonzalez Batista] </F>   [Text] Jose Javier Mulino, director of the National Office  for Attention to Refugees [Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de  los Refugiados -- ONPAR], said yesterday the Panamanian  Government has installed a national commission formed by state  and civic organizations to evaluate the situation and entry of  refugees from Haiti and other nations into Panama.    This comission is formed by representatives of the  Government, Labor, and Foreign Ministries, Immigration, State  Security, ONPAR, UNHCR, and the Red Cross, among other  organizations. The commission is analyzing the request made by  the United States to permit the arrival of Haitian refugees in  Panama.    Although Panama has not adopted an official position  regarding the request, unofficial international reports indicate  that the United States plans to transfer to Panama a total of  5,000 Haitian refugees who are currently in Florida.    Nevertheless, Jose Javier Mulino denied that the national  commission, ONPAR, and the UNHCR are studying the entry of such  a large number of refugees, "because this country is not  prepared to meet such expenses or deal with their presence here."</p>

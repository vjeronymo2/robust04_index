			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cooling unit to the rescue German scientists have devised a solar-powered cooling unit for transporting vaccines to remote regions of the third world. Scientists working at the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in Freiburg, a research institute, have developed a miniature solar-powered fridge, which fits in a rucksack and can maintain a temperature below 10`C for up to 12 hours. With a capacity of four litres, it can hold enough drugs to treat an entire village. Fraunhofer-Institut fur Solare Energiesysteme: Germany, tel 761 4588 227; fax 761 4588 217.</p>

Jovanovic gave  the interview when he made a brief stop in Budapest during his  travels.    In answer to a question, he said the peace and security of  the Balkan peninsula should be created, but not to the detriment  of the Serbs.    When asked whether the democratization process of Serbia,  which the international community expects from the settlement of  the South Slav crisis, has begun or not, Jovanovic said:    "The process of democratization is well advanced in  Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia, that is Serbia, is the only country in  Eastern Europe which has held three parliamentary elections. If  the declaration of the people's wish is the chief standard of a  society's democratic character, then in our case there are no  grounds for such verdicts, whereby the democratization of  Yugoslavia is insufficient."    As regards his evaluation of Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade, Jovanovic said: "It is a  particularly welcome fact that Jeszenszky's Belgrade visit was  held in the spirit of mutual confidence. We believe that this  implies the beginning of a process, which will result in the  intensification of mutual confidence, political relations and  the various cooperation forms."</p>

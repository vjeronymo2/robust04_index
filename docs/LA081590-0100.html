			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINE AIDS TREATMENT;  </P> <P> ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT THERAPY SHOWING PROMISE IN TESTS  </P> <P> A form of ultraviolet light therapy that has been successful in treating  patients with a rare skin cancer is showing early promise as an experimental  AIDS therapy.  </P> <P> Four of five patients with AIDS-related complex treated in a preliminary trial  had decreased symptoms and improved immune system function, according to an  article in today's Annals of Internal Medicine.  </P> <P> In laboratory experiments, the treatments have been shown to kill the AIDS  virus directly and to stimulate the immune system.  </P> <P> "We have some encouraging results. . . . The data definitely needs to be  corroborated," said Dr. Emil Bisaccia, a dermatologist at Morristown Memorial  Hospital in northern New Jersey and the principal author of the study.  </P> <P> Bisaccia said that 15 additional patients are now receiving the expensive  monthly treatments. There have been no serious short-term side effects.  </P> <P> "The first patient treated, a homosexual man who before treatment was able to  walk up a flight of stairs only with difficulty, is now capable of jogging 3.5  miles a day and lifting weights," the report said. Two other participants "are  now attending college and working full time."  </P> <P> The findings are difficult to interpret because so few patients were treated  and because there was no control group of untreated patients, a standard  research procedure in tests of the effectiveness of new therapies. The  researchers may also have been biased in their interpretation of the patients'  responses to therapy, according to an editorial by Dr. Elias Abrutyn, an  associate editor of the medical journal.  </P> <P> Abrutyn wrote that the article was published, despite such "substantial  questions," to stimulate additional independent investigations and because  "AIDS is a calamitous illness for which we need additional therapies."  </P> <P> The treatments, known as "extracorporeal photopheresis," are approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a skin cancer of T-4 lymphocytes,  the same white blood cells that are attacked by the AIDS virus. The tumor is  called "cutaneous T-cell lymphoma."  </P> <P> During the treatments, which are administered on two consecutive days once a  month, the patient ingests 8-methoxypsoralen, a light-activated anti-cancer  drug. Then, small amounts of the patient's blood are removed from the body, and  the white blood cells and plasma, the liquid portion of the blood, are  separated. The red blood cells are returned to the body.  </P> <P> After more than a pint of white blood cells and plasma is collected, the  mixture is passed as a thin film through a sterile irradiation chamber, where  it is exposed to high-dose ultraviolet light. The process takes three hours.  Then the mixture is transfused back into the patient.  </P> <P> It is not certain how the treatments work against cancer or might work against  the AIDS virus. When activated by light, the drug can bind to the DNA in  chromosomes, damaging the cells and interfering with their ability to  reproduce.  </P> <P> A leading theory is that abnormal T-cells are selectively targeted by  photopheresis and then recognized and destroyed by the immune system when they  are returned to the body.  </P> <P> The treatments may be killing AIDS virus particles as well as "jump-starting  the immune system," said Dr. Albert S. Klainer, another author of the study.  Four of the first five AIDS-related complex patients to receive the therapy  have continued with monthly therapies for as long as 19 months, Bisaccia said.  One patient, who was judged to have improved, dropped out of the study after  five months.  </P></p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Shared rule urged for Ulster THE INSTITUTE for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has recommended that the UK and the Republic of Ireland should share sovereignty over Northern Ireland as a means of resolving the conflict there. The left-of-centre think tank recommended in a report published yesterday the drafting of a new constitution for the province and that the Royal Ulster Constabulary should be replaced by a security force better representing both communities. The report recommended that both governments should recognise each other's claim of sovereignty and make the province part of the national territory of the UK and the republic.</p>

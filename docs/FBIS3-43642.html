			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Afrikaner National Front leader, General </F> Constand Viljoen, by reporter Estelle Pienaar on the "PM News  Wrap" program; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] General Constand Viljoen says the ANC [African  National Congress] and the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF --  Afrikaner National Front] have reached the end of the road of  negotiations. Talks between the ANC and the AVF have broken  down over the establishment of an Afrikaner volkstaat [Afrikaner  homeland]. Leader of the AVF, General Constand Viljoen:    [Begin recording] [Viljoen] It is a disappointment. There is  some inconsistency in the whole development. We had, on  Saturday morning, rather very positive discussions with the  negotiating team and then all of a sudden, Saturday afternoon  Mr. Mandela took a very strong viewpoint and he repeated it  Sunday evening and to us it is now very clear that Mr. Mandela  has decided completely otherwise [as heard]. As I say this is  rather, you know ... [changes thought] It is not in line with  the discussions and the spirit of the discussions which we had  up to now, so it is a great disappointment, yet the two leaders  met yesterday afternoon and they have sorted it out and it  appeared as if Mr. Mandela has decided that there will be  absolutely no position on a volkstaat -- then I agree with Dr.  Hartzenberg. Then there is no sense in carrying on with the  negotiations at the moment.    [Pienaar] Have you had any feedback from the negotiators on  the ANC's side and from your negotiating team so far?    [Viljoen] Of course, we met here with our own negotiating  team. We have discussed the situation, not with the complete  team but we have consulted with the individual members up to  now. I haven't called them together. The ANC today will  probably meet their negotiating team and we will probably hear  from them in due course -- what their viewpoint is, but from the  negotiating teams there is not much we can do because it was  decided at leadership level there will be no negotiations and I  can see no alternative, because what is the sense of carrying on  with negotiations. Are we just wasting our time? This is the  pity, you know, even Mr. Mandela's present action is  inconsistent with his previous ones, because previously he has  said to us -- don't shout at us, give us a map. Now this is the  time when we were really moving towards what he demanded and  then all of a sudden he called it off just like that. So to us  this is not quite understandable.    [Pienaar] How do you see the road ahead? Is there still a  light at the end of the tunnel? Do you still see the  possibility of an agreement being reached before the deadline?    [Viljoen] This is a very serious situation that we have  arrived at, at the moment, because humanly speaking we have come  to the end of the road of negotiations. Now, what have we  achieved? I think from the Volksfront's point of view what we  can say is we have achieved at least the higher moral ground --  to say that ... [changes thought] or the moral high ground to  say we have done everything that we possibly could. We have  really gone all the way. We have done this with enthusiasm and  we haven't spared a moment. We even worked between Christmas and  New Year to facilitate this so that is what we have achieved.  Now the road ahead of us: I would say we have to decide now  what else to do because there is no doubt about the fact that  the Afrikaner wants a volkstaat and that we are going to have a  volkstaat. I have been very firm on this right from the  beginning and we were prepared to negotiate the details of the  volkstaat, but we were never prepared to negotiate anything but  a volkstaat and this is for a security arrangement -- for a  peace arrangement for the future of South Africa. I think it is  in the interest of the whole country, and what is even more  important is the fact that this is a possible peace settlement  or a complete change of attitude between two major forces of  South Africa -- the Afrikaners and the Africans, as represented  by the ANC. It is rather a disappointment because we both ...  [changes thought] both negotiating teams always acknowledged  this fact of how important this is. [end recording]</p>

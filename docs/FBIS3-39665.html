			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Italian Socialist Party Secretary </F> Bettino Craxi by Giovanni Negri in Rome; date not given:  "Craxi: `The More Occhetto Talks, the More He Lies'"]    [Text] Hotel Raphael. Craxi comes down to a meeting room.    The teleprinters are spewing out heated declarations from  [Democratic Party of the Left headquarters in Via delle]  Botteghe Oscure: a conspiracy, a disgrace, a traitor. He  lights a Salem, a menthol cigarette.    [Negri] D'Alema is in trouble. They say that you are the one  who put him on the spot.    [Craxi] Whatever next! I have been saying for ages that I  would take care of the liars. It is true, I am working on them.  But I can tell you that in the next few days I shall also be  turning my attention to the extraterrestrials.    [Negri] Extraterrestrials?    [Craxi] Yes, those who now pretend that they have been  living  on the moon for 20 years, that they do not know how things  worked. There are lots of extraterrestrials, I even had some in  my government. They are worse than the liars, who at least  assume responsibility for the lies that they tell.    [Negri] Amato, La Malfa, who do you mean?    [Craxi] Pardon me, is there anything else you want to know?    [Negri] Yes. Whereas you are paying visits on the public  prosecutors' offices, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] deputy  Correnti is now saying that "justice is too serious a matter to  be left to the examining magistrates." A reversal of roles?    [Craxi] It is politics that cannot be left to the  magistrates.    As to the rest, to date four prosecutors' offices have  summoned me to elucidate on my speech to the lower house:  Venice, Turin, Rome, and Milan. I gave the magistrates a few  examples to back up my denunciation.    I cited one case in a hundred. Of course, it is not a good  thing for the election campaign to be run by the prosecutors'  offices, but this is what has been happening for two years.    [Negri] Let us come back to the point: The PDS general staff  is describing the D'Alema affair as a slanderous attack on your  part.    [Craxi] The leaders of the PDS, who have opted from the  outset for lies rather than for ascertaining the truth, are  using these epithets and talking in these terms in an attempt to  shore up their own position. This is why I have decided to make  one of the chapters of my report public by giving it at least to  those who undertake to pass it on.    It is the third of the 18 chapters that I have handed over:  It demonstrates how a perfectly true account of an episode was  described by L'UNITA as a "farce."    [Negri] Do you know anything about this Morandina, who has  claimed responsibility for the accounts in Switzerland and was  the PDS's key man in the Veneto region until just now, its  delegate in the negotiations as to who is to stand for the  progressive alliance?    [Craxi] No, nothing. But he is a technical man, is he not?  He must be a highly skilled technician if he has done  consultancy work for Fiat.    [Negri] However, Formica has asked why he gave the money  back  if he earned it by providing professional services.    [Craxi] Ah, that is something you must ask him; as a  technician, he will know why he gave it back.    [Negri] How do you see politics nowadays, after what has  happened to you?    [Craxi] My expectations are being confirmed. What I thought  would happen is happening. We shall assess matters up in a few  months, but meanwhile there is a tragic economic balance sheet.  The talk is of everything but employment, bankruptcies,  shutdowns. This is what happens when violence is used. Things  can only get worse, because you reap what you sow. I hear no  talk of the real problems in this media-dominated world; it  looks almost as if there is a real reality and a media reality.    [Negri] What do you think of Berlusconi in politics?    [Craxi] It is a phenomenon that requires analysis, one that  is also present is societies that are even more media-oriented  than our own, such as the United States or even Latin America.  When I think that from 1976 to 1983 I worked to gain two  percentage points [for his party], I cannot but ask myself how  great the change has been.    [Negri] Did you give him any advice?    [Craxi] He has done it all on his own. He realized that  there was a lack of leadership, a worrying situation, and he has  brought the full weight of media to bear. Be that as it may, he  has his own credentials, with their pros and cons. He has  demonstrated that he is a good businessman, although the  transition from business to politics is undoubtedly a leap into  the unknown.    [Negri] How do you see Occhetto getting on in the midst of  media domination?    [Craxi] He has a large part of state television at his  disposal, but the television screen is also a mirror of truth.  The more people watch him on television, the more they will be  able to notice that he is a great liar and that he is not a  leader capable of running the country.    [Negri] Any nostalgia for the old parties?    [Craxi] Much of the blame for the collapse of the system can  be laid at its own door, it had aged badly, but we cannot  pretend not to see what is replacing it.    Notwithstanding its degeneration, the party regime was a  channel, but now we are facing the unknown. Suffice it to say  that there are only three days to go before the deadline for  submitting the lists of candidates, but no one knows yet who  they will be. Who knows through what centralized filters the  winning names have to pass. It will soon become clear that we  are moving out of the party regime into an oligarchy.</p>

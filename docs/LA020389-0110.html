			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM BENEPE HAS SOLUTION FOR TRAP ON NO. 6: HE MAKES A HOLE IN ONE  </P> <P> Jim Benepe doesn't do things half way. He won the first tour tournament he ever  entered, the Western Open in 1988.  </P> <P> He also figured out a way to beat the troublesome sixth hole at Riviera, the  one with the sand trap in the middle. Playing Riviera for the first time  Thursday, Benepe got a hole in one on the sixth hole, his first ever in  competition.  </P> <P> Benepe, who used a 6-iron on the par-3, 163-yard hole, said: "I caught the ball  high on my blade and I didn't think it was going to get over a bunker. I said  after I hit it, 'Fly miles.' "  </P> <P> Benepe, who had started from the 10th hole, was 4 under par after his ace.  However, he took a double bogey at the ninth hole when he 3-putted from 15  feet.  </P> <P> So Benepe, 25, from Sheridan, Wyo., had to settle for a 2-under-par 69.  </P> <P> "The hole in one is like being the high scorer for your team in basketball, but  the team loses," Benepe said.

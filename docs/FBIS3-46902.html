			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Urasoe and the Naha Defense Facilities  Administration Bureau [NDFAB] have reached a secret verbal  agreement on the relocation of Naha Military Port to Urasoe.  This was disclosed on 27 December by a RYUKYU SHIMPO probe.    Former Urasoe Mayor Noboru Higa verbally promised Duchu  Kobo,  the former chief of NDFAB, to that effect; NDFAB appears to have  kept this memo. The Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, and  the Defense Facilities Administration Agency are said to be  pressing Urasoe to accept relocation of Naha Military Port to  the city. However, the actual relocation of the military port to  the city would make it possible to link the military port  directly with Makiminato Supply Depot (Camp Kinser), thereby  further consolidating the military port rather than returning  it. The secret verbal agreement will certainly draw a backlash  from democratic organizations.    Answering an inquiry from RYUKYU SHIMPO about the secret  verbal agreement, Urasoe Mayor Seiko Gibo admitted the existence  of the secret verbal agreement. Commenting on the relocation of  the military port to the city, he stated: "I have inherited the  former mayor's municipal administration, but the relocation of  the military port to our city is another question." In this  way, he objects to the relocation. Some businessmen and  politicians in the city have also whispered about the secret  verbal agreement.    Naha is accusing Urasoe of committing itself to such a  secret  verbal agreement, saying: "Urasoe wharf is located in the Naha  Port harbor area; the relocation of the military port to the  wharf will only serve to consolidate the military port on  Okinawa."    Meanwhile, NDFAB denies the existence of the secret verbal  agreement, saying: "Seven or eight years ago Urasoe made an  informal proposal in connection with the relocation of Naha  Military Port, but the city has since taken no follow-up  actions."    Urasoe is promoting the development project of western  coastal regions, the most important development project for the  city. The development project is designed to reclaim about 120  ha [hectare] of coastal area north of the Okinawa Wholesale and  Commercial Complex in Seishu, Urasoe. However, the coastal area  faces coastal areas off Camp Kinser, areas which are designated  by U.S. forces on Okinawa as restricted waters. These  restricted waters stand in the way of reclamation.    All information RYUKYU SHIMPO has gathered indicates the  "secret verbal agreement appeared aimed at swapping the U.S.  forces' decision to lift restrictions on the waters for the  relocation of Naha Military Port to Urasoe wharf."    NDFAB is said to have asked the Okinawa Prefectural  Government to secure the 50-ha site, almost the same acreage as  that of Naha Military Port, in return for the relocation of the  military port.    The acreage exceeds the 40 ha Urasoe plans to reclaim under  the first phase of the development project. Urasoe claims:  "Even if we have constructed the wharf, civilians are largely  restricted in using it."</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Swedes expect recession to end next year THE Swedish recession, one of west Europe's worst, should end gradually next year under the influence of the government's anti-inflation strategy and an international upturn. This was forecast in yesterday's supplementary budget. The government's medium-term outlook suggests Sweden will move into line with average western European economic performance by the mid-1990s. Mr Allan Larsson, finance minister, told employers yesterday the economy had already begun to recover In his budget statement, he said inflation, now running at 9.6 per cent annually, would ease considerably this year; he projected 3 per cent for 1992. There would be a negative growth rate this year of -0.2 per cent but the following year should see the economy grow by 1 per cent, with annual growth of more than 2 per cent thereafter until 1995. The government takes an optimistic view of what will happen to pay increases, expecting a marked fall to 5 per cent this year, after an average 10.3 per cent in 1990, and just over 3 per cent in 1992 as a result of a two-year national agreement now accepted by all public sector workers and 55 per cent of private sector manual workers. Mr Larsson said the government would have to act if those opposing restraint secured higher pay than the rest because it would lead to the collapse of the whole pay stabilisation deal and wreck the government's strategy. He said there would be a SKr18.5bn (Pounds 1.75bn) budget deficit this year, although the percentage of public spending as a proportion of gross domestic product was down to 62 per cent compared with 67 per cent 10 years ago. The government is aiming to cut its own budget by SKr2bn or 10 per cent over the next three years; public sector consumption is set to rise at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent. Registered unemployment will increase, but the government expects the rate to stay under 3 per cent. Independent forecasters believe it will climb to 4-5 per cent by the end of next year.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SURRENDER OF NORIEGA;  </P> <P> SECLUDED EXISTENCE AT EMBASSY WAS ANYTHING BUT GOOD LIFE FOR GENERAL;  </P> <P> REFUGE: NORIEGA APPARENTLY REMAINED AS STUBBORN AND SECRETIVE AS HE WAS IN  POWER, CLERICS AND VISITORS SAY.  </P> <P> For 10 days after being overthrown in a U.S. military invasion and taking  refuge in the Vatican embassy, Manuel A. Noriega lived a secluded, Spartan  life, sealed off from the outside world by the reluctant host of his diplomatic  sanctuary.  </P> <P> Three times a day, the deposed dictator of Panama opened the door to his  sweltering second-floor room in the Vatican nunciature, accepted a meal on a  tray and shut himself in again, according to visitors to the embassy compound.  </P> <P> "He looks tired, pale and depressed," a Roman Catholic Church official said  before Noriega surrendered himself to U.S. authorities late Wednesday. "He  hardly speaks."  </P> <P> For those 10 days, however, as the Vatican, the Bush Administration and the  U.S.-installed Panamanian government negotiated his fate, the 54-year-old  Noriega apparently remained as stubborn and secretive in captivity as he was  during the seven years he ruled Panama as military commander.  </P> <P> After narrowly escaping capture by American troops who invaded Panama on Dec.  20 and put a $1-million bounty on his head, an exhausted Noriega slipped into  the nunciature on Christmas Eve and surrendered an Uzi submachine gun.  </P> <P> "He looked like a hunted fox," one diplomat said.  </P> <P> Noriega slept through three days of ear-splitting rock music blared toward the  embassy from loudspeakers by American troops surrounding the place --  harassment that kept awake his host, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, and was  shut off only after Laboa's repeated complaints.  </P> <P> Until Wednesday night, Noriega resisted Laboa's own campaign to pressure him to  leave voluntarily by shutting off the air conditioning in his quarters, thus  allowing the room temperature to rise into the 80s.  </P> <P> Obviously missing from the life of Panama's former self-proclaimed "maximum  leader" in this period were the pornographic photos and large quantities of  cocaine that American officials say they found in his many homes. The nuns at  the nunciature even took care to remove the wine from the guest wing where  Noriega was left free to roam.  </P> <P> Throughout his stay, Noriega had no access to radio or newspapers. Everything  he learned from the outside was filtered through brief daily conversations with  Laboa, a 66-year-old Spanish Basque who, as Vatican nuncio since 1982, is the  dean of Panama's foreign diplomatic corps.  </P> <P> "Laboa has been trying to get him to see that he cannot stay there for the rest  of his life," said a European diplomat before the surrender.  </P> <P> But each time Laboa asked him to go, said a church official, Noriega gave the  same answer: "I am not ready."  </P> <P> From his window in the three-story embassy, in the seaside Punta Paitilla  neighborhood, Noriega looked out on rolls of concertina wire, U.S. tanks,  armored vehicles and elite Delta Force troops surrounding the place, waiting  for him to step outside. He could hear U.S. army helicopters hovering overhead  or landing in a nearby field.  </P> <P> The Vatican, following diplomatic precedent, agreed to give Noriega temporary  refuge while it determined whether he was being pursued for criminal or  political activity. He was indicted in the United States on drug charges, and  Panama said last week that it planned to charge him with murder in connection  with a failed coup against him last October.  </P> <P> Even before Noriega decided to leave the nunciature voluntarily, church  officials said the Vatican had classified him as an accused criminal and was  therefore willing to end his sanctuary.  </P> <P> However, diplomatic precedent inhibited the Vatican from handing Noriega  directly over to the Americans as a foreign occupying power. And the Panamanian  government said it did not want such a problem prisoner in its own disorganized  legal system. The new Panamanian government also pointed out that the  Panamanian constitution bars the extradition of one of its own citizens to  another country for trial.  </P> <P> As pro-Noriega resistance to the American invasion died out, Panamanians who  struggled for years against the dictator turned their ire against the Vatican  for harboring Noriega.  </P> <P> About 5,000 citizens signed a letter urging Pope John Paul II to end his  "ambivalent attitude" and turn Noriega over to "authorities with immediate  capacity to bring him to justice" for "horrendous crimes."  </P> <P> Within earshot of Noriega, about 10,000 Panamanians gathered Wednesday  afternoon, in the first major demonstration since his downfall, to demand his  arrest.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, as diplomatic cars and light armored vehicles moved back and  forth between the nunciature and the high school across the street where the  American, Vatican and Panamanian negotiators were meeting, Noriega became "very  nervous," according to a church official who saw him.  </P> <P> Friends of Laboa, a jovial, extroverted man, say he has been wounded by  criticism against the Vatican. They say he believes he spared Panama much  bloodshed by giving sanctuary to Noriega, under the same principle of  diplomatic immunity that protected foes of the dictatorship who were running  for their lives. Laboa's defenders have noted that Noriega had never violated  the Vatican sanctuary to arrest anyone.  </P> <P> According to several accounts, Laboa got a Christmas Eve phone call from  Noriega in a house somewhere nearby. Having dealt with Noriega over the asylum  of at least a dozen political figures who fled into the nunciature to escape  his repression, the nuncio instantly recognized Noriega's voice.  </P> <P> Noriega asked Laboa for refuge, saying that otherwise he would go into the  jungle and lead a prolonged guerrilla war, a friend of the nuncio said. After  quick reflection, the nuncio agreed. Shortly thereafter, Noriega drove his own  car to the nunciature's ornate iron gate, rang the bell and was escorted  through the mansion's yellow wall.  </P> <P> At the time, several hundred members of Noriega's Defense Forces and Dignity  Battalions were fighting a sporadic war of resistance on Noriega's behalf.  </P> <P> "The moment I accepted him, I knew that his people would decide that he was a  bloody coward and stop fighting," a diplomatic colleague quoted Laboa as  saying.  </P> <P> In any case, the nuncio tried to get Noriega to tape a message instructing his  followers to surrender. The former dictator refused, then fell into an 18-hour  slumber. By the time he woke up, resistance to the new regime had dwindled.  </P></p>

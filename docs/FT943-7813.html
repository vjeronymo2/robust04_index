			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: When cover can be at a premium - Those seen as higher risk can lose out While household insurance premiums may be falling generally after the huge rises of the past few years, the picture is not equally rosy for everyone. Insurers are battling for a share of the profitable, low-risk end of the market, but this can leave anyone seen as higher risk out in the cold. Those who do not fit into the insurers' favoured market segments, or who have made claims recently, may find personal evidence for falling premiums hard to come by. The bad news, if you are one of the thousands of home-owners to have made subsidence claims in recent years, is that you probably are stuck with the same insurer for the foreseeable future. Only in exceptional circumstances would most insurers take on properties with a previous subsidence problem. If, say, your house is less than 10 years old, has been under-pinned fully and is in an area not generally prone to subsidence, some insurers would consider it. But if it is pre-war and built on clay soil, the chances of being accepted by a new insurer appear to be practically zero. The only way out is to move. Fortunately, if you do want to sell up, most insurers will continue to insure a property already on their books which has a history of subsidence claims, even if it changes hands. One or two recent claims for theft or accidental damage may also make it extremely hard to change insurers at present The message from Norwich Union, for instance, is that if you have had a theft claim for more than Pounds 1,000 in the past year, you should forget about switching insurers for the time being. Likewise, if you have had three buildings or contents claims of any size within the past three years, the Norwich is unlikely to take you on, although it will look at the background: claims for one-off storm damage will be treated more sympathetically than a series of accidental damage or loss claims. Evidence of improved security can sometimes help if your record is tainted with recent burglary claims. In some places, better security is compulsory - many insurers now refuse to cover inner city properties unless they meet minimum security standards, usually involving five-lever mortice deadlocks on the front door and locks on ground floor windows or french doors. Red-lining, cherry-picking, or a frequent unwillingness to quote for certain types of business are tendencies to which insurance companies are loath to admit. But the anecdotal evidence is that direct insurers are more likely to decline to quote than traditional insurers. Callers are occasionally told, quite bluntly, that their postcode is uninsurable. Yet, since postcode-based rating is based largely on insurers' own claims records, the same postcode might trigger a different response elsewhere. Direct insurers tend to have much tighter underwriting criteria, partly because the staff providing quotes over the phone are not themselves underwriters and must stick to fairly rigid guidelines. Where other insurers might look closely at the circumstances, and raise premiums to take account of increased risk, the direct companies sometimes seem to prefer to turn business away. So, if yours is a 'problem case' and you have been finding the direct insurers less than welcoming, it could pay you to turn back to the brokers, who can scour the more obscure corners of the market for amenable insurers. As most brokers deal only with a limited number of insurers, talking to more than one could improve your chances of finding a good deal. Mortgage lenders may also be prepared to help if you are having trouble with buildings insurance, where they have a vested interest. The last-ditch option, if you are having difficulty finding insurance at a reasonable price, is to accept a lower level of cover. This could involve indemnity-only cover, which means that pay-outs for stolen or damaged possessions are reduced for wear and tear rather than the new-for-old replacement which is standard with most policies. In extreme cases, insurance might be available - or affordable - only if you cut out cover for theft altogether and limit the insurance to fire, flood and other catastrophes.</p>

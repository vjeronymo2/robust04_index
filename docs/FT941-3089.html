			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Croat brewer attracts several European bids Several leading European brewers have placed bids for a 24 per cent stake in Zagreb Brewery (ZB), Croatia's largest brewer with the capacity to produce up to 1m hectolitres of beer. The bidders include Interbrew, the Belgian company that makes Stella Artois, Brau AG of Austria, Castel of France, a German group, and a millionaire former Croat emigre. The whole of the company is being privatised with over 50 per cent of the shares reserved for employees, and the reminder going to pensions and other funds. A foreign partner was sought to help modernise production. ZB has a book value of around DM41m (Dollars 23.2m) but the market value as reflected in the bids is considerably higher, says Mr Peter Golscheider, managing director of Epic, the Vienna-based investment fund which organised the foreign tender. While ZB has mainly a regional market, demand is expected to pick up strongly when tourists return to Croatia once the war in Bosnia is over. The winning bid will be announced in a week's time. The brewery has a strong history of profitability, a low debt, and a good management team, Mr Golscheider says.</p>

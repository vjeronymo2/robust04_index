			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Downturn continues as Brammer slips to Pounds 9.2m BRAMMER, the ball bearing distributor and electronic services group, yesterday reported its third consecutive year of declining profits with a pre-tax return of Pounds 9.2m for 1991. The result, which disappointed analysts who had expected Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 11.4m in 1990. Turnover fell from Pounds 122.5m to Pounds 111.5m. Mr Hugh Lang, chairman, defended the results, saying they were creditable compared to many of Brammer's competitors. The group ended the year with a strong balance sheet, carrying net cash of Pounds 3.8m. BSL - the leading UK distributor of ball bearings and power transmission products - suffered a 9 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds 91m and a 22 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 8.1m. Gross margins had been maintained, however, Mr Lang said. The group planned to expand this business into continental Europe. Mr Robert Ffoulkes-Jones, chief executive, said talks were in progress with several companies. The equipment rental business, which focuses on environmental monitoring and computer devices, saw sales decline by 10 per cent to Pounds 20.4m, with profits down by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.5m. A break-even result in France, and the exceptional charge of Pounds 382,000 for relocating the French business, offset the profitable return in the UK. The Italian rental subsidiary was closed, incurring a Pounds 718,000 extraordinary charge. Earnings fell to 14.7p (17.5p). The final dividend is held at 8.5p, making 13p.</p>

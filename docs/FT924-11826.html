			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / BA may cancel Disney park link BRITISH AIRWAYS may cancel its official airline status with Eurodisney, the Paris theme park, because of disappointing demand from UK air travellers, Daniel Green writes. The present contract expires at the end of March next year and BA is prepared to take a tough position in talks over any renewal. The theme park opened last May and BA increased the capacity of its services from five UK cities in anticipation of heavy demand. But the 1.25m visitors so far from the UK have tended to travel by ship and coach; P&amp;O, the ferry operator, and Wallace Arnold, the UK's largest coach operator, are official partners of Eurodisney.</p>

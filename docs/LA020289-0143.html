			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Jack Clark has signed a 2-year contract with the San Diego Padres worth $4  million, fulfilling an arrangement made when San Diego acquired the  power-hitting first baseman in an October trade. The agreement replaces the  final year of Clark's 2-year, $3-million contract, which he signed with the New  York Yankees a year ago.  </P> <P> "We had agreed to honor a 2-year commitment that was made to Jack Clark prior  to the trade," said Dick Freeman, acting club president. "It took some time to  finalize the agreement due to a busy winter for both us and his agent, Tom  Reich."  </P> <P> Clark will get $2 million a season from the Padres. Under the old deal, he  would have received a base salary of $1.5 million in 1989 with the opportunity  to earn $500,000 in bonuses.  </P></p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Plot saved from a pillow case IT WAS Chesterton who called Othello the 'Dangerous Pillow Case', criticising a plot which turned on a handkerchief. The danger with staging Othello lies in its tendency to slope away into farce. This is just avoided in a plucky production from The Court Theatre Company in London's King's Cross. The Company was formed in 1980 and moved to its present venue in 1990. It is the professional wing of the Court Theatre Training Company; the cast includes recently graduated trainees making their professional debuts. The productions offer an opportunity to see new acting talent: work in progress and actors in progress. This Othello is a case in point. Seeing actors at this moment of their careers can be highly instructive. Shakespearean verse is never easy and, throughout the evening, the cast grapples honestly to stay on terms with the sense and music in the language. Brabantio's 'Who would be a father?' is a throwaway instead of the key to his character. And Othello's 'Yet she must die lest she betray more men' misses the point - 'Yet she must die lest she betray more men' catches the feeling better. The play avoids props, usually a way of concentrating the action in a minimal setting. But inexperienced actors without props can lose their way. Here, Othello and Iago act the central scene 'Ha, I like not that', which turns the play, over a set of battle plans; they looked more at home with something to do. Props can be a guide to character. Trevor Nunn's superlative 1989 Othello (Willard White and Ian McKellan) at Stratford showed how intimate and nervy the play could be; the action was an imprint of Iago's mind. McKellan's brilliance was to find in Iago's 'I am that I am' a man obsessed with order. An over-meticulous, precise Iago was forever adjusting, rearranging or deploying things. This production (directed by June Abbott) takes Nunn's closet-studio route into the play: all gloomy interiors and whispered confidences. Abbot makes this more claustrophobic by hanging a low blue canopy and focusing the lights through it. Two performances emerge with great credit: David Bliss as Iago and Alison Williams as Emilia find subtleties and strengths in the verse, creating energy from what they do on stage. Gary Lawrence as Othello is convincing but needs to find calmer depths. Nicholas de Carlo, on his professional debut, turns in a good Cassio. The delight of the evening is to find new actors tackling a classic. The performance is honest (as befits the play), serious, thoughtful and thought-provoking. The Courtyard, King's Cross, until August 16 (071-833-0870).</p>

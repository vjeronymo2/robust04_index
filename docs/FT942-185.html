			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Life insurer moves early on disclosure: Equitable steals march on rivals Equitable Life, one of the UK's largest life insurers, is to offer customers fuller information about financial products, six months before disclosure becomes compulsory. The company believes it can gain a competitive advantage by being the first to reveal details including charges and costs, although other life insurers are sceptical. Equitable says the new system, which it claims will show its costs are low as a proportion of its premium income, will come into effect from tomorrow. Equitable's move contrasts with general industry reluctance or opposition towards regulatory efforts to ensure that sales agents volunteer better information to customers. Last July the Treasury ordered the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, to produce regulations requiring all those selling life insurance to give more information about their charges and products. The SIB produced the final version of the detailed rules for the new regime  -which will apply both to independent financial advisers and to sales agents directly linked to a single life office - late in April. The new regime will be introduced from January 1 and must be in place by August 1 next year. From tomorrow Equitable sales agents will provide clients with: A paper setting out the key features of the policy being sold. Examples of how much it will yield, based on the life insurer's own charges rather than an industry average. A letter explaining why the advice to take out the policy has been given. The surrender values at various points during the contract and a figure for the cost of providing advice. In the case of a 20-year pension plan sold to someone aged 45, for example, with an annual premium of Pounds 1,000, and assuming a 9 per cent rate of return, it shows that if the policy were given up at the end of five years, the customer would receive Pounds 6,139, having paid Pounds 384 in deductions. On the same basis, the customer would have had Pounds 1,189 deducted in charges at the end of 10 years, and would receive Pounds 15,371 if the policy were surrendered then. It also says that the cost of providing advice for this sort of policy averaged Pounds 231 in 1993, and that this cost would rise proportionately as the level of customer contribution increased. Equitable specialises in pensions for the top end of the personal financial market. Its relatively small direct sales force of 370 is salaried rather than paid by commission, though staff can qualify for bonuses. Mr Roy Ranson, managing director, said the cost of the move, including strategic planning, systems design and development and planning, amounted to less than Pounds 500,000. The task has been more straightforward for Equitable than it will be for many life offices. It sells only through the direct sales force and has deliberately kept to a relatively simple range of products.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMPTION OF GROUND BEEF HAS INCREASED THANKS TO SOARING FAST-FOOD SALES. BUT  THIS NOSTALGIC INGREDIENT FROM THE 1950S ALSO REMAINS A SOURCE OF QUICK,  NUTRITIOUS AT-HOME MEALS.;  </P> <P> WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HAMBURGER?  </P> <P> Hold it. I thought we were going to talk about food in the New Age. Things like  hydroponic vegetables, vacuum technology, bio-sensoring, explosion puffing,  reconstructed egg cubes. Whatever. Then I get an assignment to write something  about hamburger. Hamburger? Yes. Whatever happened to good old American  hamburger? That was the question. Well, the prognosis is not good. On the other  hand, it's not bad, considering how many things one can do with hamburger, how  far it stretches the food budget, and its nutritional and nostalgic value. What  family of the '50s did not have a meat loaf cooking in the oven at least once a  week? According to the American Beef Institute, total ground beef consumption  has increased from 21.9 pounds per capita in 1970 to 29 pounds in 1987, but it  is believed that at-home consumption of hamburger has decreased. "We get our  clue from spending patterns," said Jens Knutson, economist at the American Meat  Institute in Washington. "Away-from-home spending has increased sixfold, from  about $25 billion in 1970 to $156 billion in 1988. On the other hand, at-home  spending has not increased proportionately -- $74 in 1970 to $255 in 1988.  That's only a threefold increase," he said. "To us that means that  away-from-home dining out has increased dramatically while home dining has  decreased." Since 1978, there has been a 12% decrease in home consumption of  hamburger, according to the Lempert Report, a newsletter specializing in  marketing analysis, issues and trends. If you think that's bad, hot-dog  consumption has gone down 17% in the last 10 years. The decrease in total beef  consumption from 80 pounds per capita in 1970 to 73.4 pounds per person in 1987  reflects, say health experts, consumer concerns about fat intake. Knutson can  only speculate as to reasons for the downward trend in home cooking and its  effect on hamburger.  </P> <P> "A good guess is that with two-income families on the rise, there is little  time for home cooking and sharpening of home-cooking skills. It's easier for  people to eat out these days," he said. Does that mean the days when children  ran into the kitchen following the aroma of cookies baking in the oven and pot  roast browning on the stove are gone forever? Just about. But there are still  cooks who find the kitchen a therapeutic place to create nutritious, low-cost  meals. And hamburger, whosecost per pound has risen from 66 cents in 1970 to  $1.31 in 1987, still represents an excellent food bargain. A little -- one  pound -- goes a long way when combined with vegetables or grains.  </P> <P> We dug into the '50s (via our recipe files) to resurrect tried-and-true recipes  using hamburger, the standard fare of many families in those days. What we  found -- and had almost forgotten -- was a treasure trove of inexpensive,  nutritional recipes. Things like hamburger pie, Chinese casserole and Sloppy  Joe.  </P> <P> Hamburger requires no cutting or trimming; it is ready to use and quick to  cook. There are neither long hours spent over a hot stove, nor elaborate  concoctions that defeat the purpose of ease and convenience.  </P> <P> If fat is a concern, check the label on packages of hamburger. Generally  speaking, hamburger made with cube steak, top round or beef tips is lower in  fat and calories than hamburger made with bottom round, top loin or sirloin.  </P> <P> Ground meat from chuck, brisket or rib steak contains more fat and calories,  about 209 to 244 calories per three ounces compared to 157 to 204 for the  lower-fat meats mentioned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fat Percentage Varies  </P> <P> The percentage of fat the meat contains varies, but 3 ounces of lean hamburger  contain a total of 19 milligrams of fat. (By comparison, chicken with skin  contains 15 milligrams fat; eggs 12 milligrams, and salmon 6.6 milligrams.)  </P> <P> The cholesterol levels of beef are lower than those for same-size servings of  pork, roast or fried chicken, veal and dark meat of turkey (about 73  milligrams, or 24% of the daily level of 300 milligrams recommended by the  American Heart Assn.).  </P> <P> Our old recipes show that ground beef commonly was sauteed with some fat.  Addition of fat is no longer recommended when searing or sauteing ground beef  in a nonstick pan. In addition, draining off excess fat can further reduce  total fat intake.  </P> <P> In the old days, hamburger casseroles were a convenience entree that mothers  could prepare early in the day and heat up when the troops arrived home for  dinner. Today, some of those casserole concoctions can be prepared quickly in a  skillet, because hamburger takes minutes to cook and is easily combined with  noodles, rice and other grains, or vegetables for a quick, nutritious meal.  </P> <P> Casseroles, such as the tamale casserole given here, were a standby of hosts  who needed to avoid last-minute work. Other casseroles, such as the Oriental  concoction, were buffet table favorites.  </P> <P> Chile and tacos are dinner-time favorites even today and can be made at home in  a flash, with additions such as chopped onions, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce  and tomatoes to boost their nutritional and taste value.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recipe on Package Mix.  </P> <P> The recipe for cheeseburger pie probably originated on the package of pie crust  mix. Leftover crust found its way to the dinner table with hamburger as a  filling and cheese slices as a topping. A side of spinach or other vegetables  rounded out the entree.  </P> <P> Meatballs simmering in a thick tomato sauce ready to spoon over spaghetti -- it  is as beloved a dish today as it was in the '50s, when the only pasta most of  us recognized came with meatballs or meat sauce.  </P> <P> Stuffed peppers, too, are an ongoing classic that defy age. The nice thing  about the dish is that stuffed peppers can be prepared well in advance and  served at room temperature or hot. Some people, in fact, eat them cold,  straight from the fridge. It's also a good meal to prepare in quantity and  store in the freezer.  </P> <P> The Times' Marian Manners Meat Loaf was a favorite of several former Times food  editors. One such original recipe calls for beef, pork and veal; however, we  found that using only ground beef was completely satisfying and tasty. The loaf  usually was served with tomato sauce or gravy. We added a tomato sauce to  Marian Manners Meat Loaf.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sloppy Joe Craze  </P> <P> Sloppy Joes were big time in the '50s. All you had to do was season a pound or  two of ground beef with catsup, Worcestershire sauce and chile powder. Sloppy  Joe was also part of the makings for tacos, enchiladas and spaghetti meat sauce  -- quick, easy, versatile.  </P> <P> Another favorite of the time was the Diamond Jim Special, named after Diamond  Jim Brady, a turn-of-the-century financier who enjoyed consuming food and  amassing fortunes. The special is a simple yet nutritious concoction of ground  beef, spinach and eggs. High in protein, the Diamond Jim Special makes a  splendid dish to serve children who won't eat spinach. In this dish, they will  hardly know the green, leafy vegetable is present.  </P> <P> Salisbury steak could do no wrong when it was king of hamburger -- before the  advent of fast-food hamburgers. It's really a steak formed from ground beef and  served with Belmont Sauce, a simplified gravy made with catsup, Worcestershire  sauce and mustard. Sherry added to the sauce enhances the flavor but is not  essential.  </P> <P> Noodle-beef casseroles in numerous variations were part of the '50's repertoire  for many families. They still make a good pantry shelf dish to serve a family  in a budget or time pinch.  </P> <P> Shepherd's Pie is an inheritance from Britain that has graced American tables  throughout the decades, especially when leftover mashed potatoes were on hand.  All you do is top sauteed meat seasoned with tomato and gravy with the potatoes  and voila, a dish fit for family, friends or potluck suppers.  </P> <P> Here is a group of popular dishes from the past using hamburger.  </P> <P> (Food Styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane)  </P> <P> CHINESE BEEF CASSEROLE  </P> <P> 1 pound ground beef  </P> <P> 1 cup minced onion  </P> <P> 1/2 cup snow peas or 1 (10-ounce) package mixed vegetables  </P> <P> 1/2 cup water  </P> <P> 1 (10 3/4-ounce) can cream of mushroom soup  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon soy sauce  </P> <P> 2 cups chopped celery  </P> <P> 1 (4-ounce) can pimiento, drained and cut julienne  </P> <P> 1 (3-ounce) can Chinese noodles  </P> <P> Brown beef in skillet.

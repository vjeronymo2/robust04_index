			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Italian government approves administrative measures for Bosnian refugees The Italian government yesterday approved a series of administrative measures to cut red tape in the handling of refugees from the fighting in Bosnia. At the same time, the government stressed the problem should be dealt with by the entire EC. Yesterday's measures will enable the local authorities to react quicker to any influx of refugees. Italy continues to be haunted by the spectre of the chaos last summer in southern Italy, when the authorities tried to cope with the invasion by boat of thousands of Albanians seeking aslyum.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Alliance enters overdraft rate war Alliance &amp; Leicester building society, the UK's fourth largest, yesterday became the latest high street financial organisation to cut its overdraft rate in a ploy to attract new customers. Alliance &amp; Leicester's new rate for an authorised overdraft in its Alliance account is 9.5 per cent equivalent annual rate. The rate reduction, made only two weeks after the account was launched, is seen as a sign of how quickly the battle to win personal customers is intensifying. The current round of rate-cutting was started by Abbey National bank, the former building society, at the end of last month when it reduced the annual percentage rate on authorised overdrafts to 9.9 per cent. Although this sparked fears of a price war, the largest high street banks, which have most of the estimated 33m personal current accounts, have dismissed the move and have expressed doubt that the reductions will be maintained. However, Nationwide, the second-largest society, and Woolwich, the third largest, have announced substantial reductions in their authorised overdraft rates. Alliance &amp; Leicester said that it would probably reduce the overdraft rate on its Giro account. The society sees the Giro account as comparable with bank current accounts, while the Alliance account competes with other building society current accounts. Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said that cutting overdraft rates represented another, and relatively cheap way for societies to attract retail deposits. Although societies recorded net inflows of retail funds in April and May, the net outflow in the first quarter totalled Pounds 1.3bn.</p>

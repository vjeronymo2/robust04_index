			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Blick leaps by 36% to Pounds 8.58m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Blick, the communications systems and time products company, advanced 36 per cent from Pounds 6.32m to Pounds 8.58m in the year to September 30. Turnover expanded 30 per cent, from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 30.9m. Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director, said that although some of the increase had been acquisition-led, there had also been strong organic growth within the group. Further, the group had generated some Pounds 12m of cash in the year, ploughing about Pounds 7m back into the rental base and fixed assets of the business. At the year-end net cash balances stood at Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 2.4m). Having raised more money - Pounds 3.7m - in the March placing than turned out to be essential for the Pounds 3.8m acquisition of the rental contracts portfolio of GPT, Mr Alan Elliot, chairman, said he envisaged no more borrowing for the moment. Since the year-end, it has picked up Electrelay, which markets car parking and time control products from Amano, already Blick's main supplier of time control products. In communications, Mr Scott-Gall said it was exciting that Blick was now selling to the public rather than just other businesses. It has been renegotiating new cable and satellite television contracts for the expiring ones bought in the Telefusion acquisition in May 1991. Over the year the contracted future rental income rose 25 per cent to Pounds 85.3m (Pounds 68.4m). In the time division, equipment sales slipped to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 4.4m), but the customer base grew to Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 8.6m). Pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.4m). On the communications side, sales were up at Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 6.3m) but the customer base more than doubled to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 4.5m). Most of this was organic, Mr Scott-Gall said. Profits jumped to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 1.9m). A final dividend of 6.2p is proposed for a total of 9.2p, up 15 per cent.</p>

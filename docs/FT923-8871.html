			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase, Q&amp;A): No opt-out for self-employed I AM self-employed. Can I opt out of the state pension scheme, and if so, can I get back the money and interest I have paid in? The answer to both questions is no. Contracting-out rebates are only available for employees taxed under Schedule E as the self-employed do not qualify for SERPS. Contracting-out cannot be backdated. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

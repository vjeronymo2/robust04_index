			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Peter Isler, who led one of four designated American defense syndicates for the  1992 America's Cup, dropped out because of funding difficulties.  </P> <P> "The cost of mounting a top-level campaign exceeds $20 million," Isler said.  "Time is so short that rather than compromising our campaign's chances of  victory, we have decided to withdraw."  </P> <P> Isler had signed only one major sponsor: Hewlett-Packard. The America's Cup  Organizing Committee had set a deadline of Oct. 1 for defense syndicates to  show they had secured $6 million in sponsorship.  </P> <P> The other defense syndicates remaining are headed by Dennis Conner and Larry  Klein of San Diego and John Bertrand of Newport Beach.  </P></p>
